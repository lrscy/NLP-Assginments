On Monday evening, Parliamentâs Sessional Services decided to send some millions of euros to the supranational EU parties, which are all in favour of the EU Constitution.
More than 150 Members of the European Parliament will not have a share of these resources. That is contrary to the principle of equality and thus illegal.
I would call upon you to raise the matter in the Council so that the regulation relating to parties is either abolished or supplemented by arrangements for those who do not wish to belong to a supranational party but wish to engage in corresponding European information-providing activities, for example concerning the Constitution.
How will you guarantee that EU resources used by the campaigners for a âyesâ vote can be used equally well by the campaigners for a ânoâ vote?
May I finally call upon you to intimate that you will respect the outcome of the referendums, whether they be âyesâ or ânoâ.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, there can be no doubt that the most ambitious task facing the incoming Luxembourg Presidency will be the conclusion of negotiations on the Financial Perspective for 2007-2013.
This will unquestionably be an extremely challenging task, but I am in no doubt that everything in our power should be done to reach a compromise on the budget by June of this year at the latest.
Otherwise we will risk major delays, for example in the drawing up of regional aid programmes, and this could mean EU funds not reaching the Member States in January 2007.
It is of course not just the date by which we reach a compromise that is of crucial importance, but also the nature of the compromise.
MrÂ Barroso rightly said that we cannot have more Europe for less money.
The European Union will cease to exist without solidarity, and this is why we cannot consent to either the policy of solidarity or the need to support the new Member States being removed from the EUâs budget priorities.
We must be aware that unless gaps in economic development within the enlarged EU are addressed, it will be impossible to achieve the goals of the Lisbon strategy.
We must therefore ensure that funds are earmarked in the future EU budget for cohesion policy, as this is in the interests of the whole Community.
MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council, there can be no doubt that PresidentÂ Bushâs visit to Brussels will be the most significant event to occur during the six-month Luxembourg Presidency.
It will be the first time that a President of the United States has ever visited the European institutions.
I hope that this symbolic visit will go some way to improving transatlantic relations, which have been somewhat strained recently.
Unless we cooperate closely with the United States, we will struggle to respond to a great many global challenges.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I welcomed your comments on relations with Ukraine.
The European Union must draw its own conclusions from events last year in one of its neighbouring countries.
The Ukrainian people have proven that they share our European values, and that they desire integration with the EU.
We should therefore offer them a partnership that could ultimately lead to membership.
Â Â  Mr President, as you know, the European institutions recently â and, I think, disastrously â cut the Gordian knot with regard to the possible accession of a non-European country, Turkey, to the European Union.
An issue of that kind threatens to change the very nature of the Union as we know it and even puts the future of European cooperation as we know it fundamentally at risk.
It is, above all, an issue in respect of which a large majority of our electorate, our citizens, are very alienated from the position adopted by the official European institutions.
I regret, then, the Luxembourg Presidencyâs failure to take the opportunity, first of all, of asking respect for the democratic will of the majority of our citizens and, secondly, as a small Member State, asking respect for that other small Member State, Cyprus, which is being ignored and misjudged by the Turkish leaders in the most arrogant and unacceptable manner.
In my view, this is a missed opportunity, and one that can only widen the enormous chasm between our citizens on the one hand and European politics on the other.
Â Â  Mr Juncker has described a very ambitious agenda for these next six months; this agenda offers a great opportunity, but is also a great responsibility for Luxembourg and particularly for its Prime Minister, who has both experience and ability and whom we wish every success in this difficult task.
I would like to make a few comments on the greatest challenge for this Presidency, which, in my opinion, will be the reform of the financial perspectives, which you, Mr Juncker, mentioned in passing.
It will probably be the most essential element, on the basis of which these six months will be assessed.
It is clear that success or failure depends not only upon the actions of the Presidency, but it is the case that during this time the Luxembourg Government will have to employ all its determination, and I am pleased that you have stated this morning that you will ensure that the general interest is put first, because, as you have said yourself, to reach July without an agreement would spell financial chaos for the European Union.
In order to be successful, the Presidency will have to seek compromises; I believe that these compromises will have to be based on two fundamentals: on the one hand, the validity of the principle of cohesion, as stated by the Council at the end of the Swedish Presidency, and, on the other, balance in the distribution of burdens.
I hope that over the next six months this House can learn the cost of enlargement to the original fifteen Member States, because on the objective basis of figures it is possible to make proposals that the European citizens in each Member State can understand and accept.
On the subject of the citizens, and going beyond what is laid down in the Treaties, I would like to ask the Presidency what role it intends the European Parliament, which is going to give its opinion in May, to play in this negotiation?
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, you recently stated, MrÂ Juncker, and indeed you repeated just now, that competitiveness will be neither the Holy Grail nor the be all and end all as far as you are concerned, in particular with regard to the mid-term review of the Lisbon strategy.
You noted that social goals and sustainable development goals should not be placed in opposition to goals relating to competitiveness.
My group welcomes this statement, as we believe the opposite to be true, namely that promotion of the European model is a major driving force behind competitiveness on our continent.
In fact, we believe that what is needed is a Europe of excellence which attaches priority to investment in research, innovation, employee training, the quality of infrastructures, trans-European networks, public services, the quality of work and social relations.
We agree with you on this issue, and we sometimes detected a slight difference of approach to that adopted by the President of the Commission. We hope that he will be equally clear in his statements, especially with regard to social issues.
Yet the good intentions you have professed to hold will be put to a number of tests.
I should like to mention three such tests, the first of which is the European budget.
We share your view that this debate must not be allowed to get bogged down and that it must progress rapidly.
You intend to act as a motivating and intermediary force, as well as one that accelerates the process, but we do not want the process of reaching a compromise on the Financial Perspectives to be accelerated if this would mean sacrificing a budget that meets the European Unionâs needs.
We agree with MrÂ Barroso on this issue; we need a budget that enables us to guarantee cohesion, solidarity, investment in the future and in research and investment in the trans-European networks.
The process should not be accelerated at the expense of the final outcome.
The second test will be the directive on services of general interest, which has already been mentioned today by a number of speakers, in particular MrÂ Turmes.
I believe that you yourself are aware of a risk that is a cause of great concern to us, namely the extended scope of this directive, which poses a threat to a large number of services of general interest.
We are also concerned by the country of origin principle, which poses a threat to the right to work in multiple countries; I am thinking in particular of the application of collective bargaining agreements.
The third test relates more generally to the European social agenda.
We would particularly like to see a clear commitment on your part in relation to other Council members regarding a review of the Directive on Working Time and a removal of the opt-out clause, and, finally, regarding a proposed review of the Directive on European Works Councils.
Â Â  Mr President, on 1 January, Luxembourg began its eleventh EU presidency.
The experience it has gained in this field, and the excellent preparations that have been made and which I have seen for myself, will be a great help in dealing with the various challenges that await you, starting with the terrible disaster in Asia. The latter showed that there is an urgent need for humanitarian aid to be coordinated on the ground, and should encourage us to set up the European Voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps, as provided for by the Constitution, as soon as possible.
There are other issues that you will have to deal with, of which I shall only mention three.
Firstly, the Lisbon process has reached its halfway point. This process needs to be made clearer and it needs targeted priorities; in short, it will need to be made easier to understand.
I am therefore fully in favour of the three aims you identified.
The second issue will be the Financial Perspective.
It is doubtless to be welcomed that it will be the Luxembourg Presidency that puts the finishing touches to it, but many people are still undecided between 1% and 1.24%, to say nothing of 1.14% â and I could go on â and much money is also hanging in the balance.
Finally, the Stability Pact will need to be amended, and the necessary balance found between strictness and flexibility to ensure that stability is not compromised.
MrÂ President, I very much hope that your success will be equal to the efforts that have been made by so many people.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to wish Prime Minister Juncker a positive and productive presidency and am very pleased to see a small, successful, independent country leading the European Union.
Luxembourg is one of the six Member States that is smaller than my own country, Wales, and an example of what an independent Wales could achieve.
The priorities paper tries to maintain the essential balance between economic, social and environmental policies.
I would like to mention the continuing campaign against discrimination, in the hope that real progress will be made on the European Gender Institute and on the recast equality directive.
There is no better example of the failure of policies on equality than the pay gap between men and women.
Thirty years after legislation was passed on this issue, a report published this week by the GMB trade union in the UK shows that, in Anglesey in my constituency, full-time pay for women is as low as 59% of that for men.
This is a scandal which must be addressed and I hope equality issues will be given priority.
Â Â  Mr President, first of all, I should like to express my condolences to Mr Juncker on account of the death of Grand Duchess Josephine-Charlotte.
I wish you and the Luxembourg people strength to bear this loss, and may God be close to you.
The Luxembourg Presidency is facing the weighty task of reforming the Stability Pact and implementing the conclusions of Wim Kokâs report.
The Commissionâs proposal to give due consideration to the economic climate in the Stability Pact offers, in my view, a basis for carrying out adequate reforms.
The implementation of the Pact benefits from clear decision-making.
Clear sanctions are still needed.
It was in the autumn of 2004 that Mr Kok presented his report on the Lisbon strategy; his conclusion is as clear as it is predictable: the Member States must really get down to carrying out structural reforms.
I would therefore like to ask Mr Juncker in what way we can expect your presidency to follow that up.
Since Luxembourg has always been a great champion of necessary reforms, I have high hopes.
Finally, with regard to the Membersâ statute, can Parliament expect from the presidency that a decision will finally be made on this subject in the next six months?
Â Â  Thank you, Mr President.
I wish the Luxembourg presidency every success.
It will be in the interests of us all.
You are the second country to hold the presidency of the enlarged twenty-five.
You are a founding state of the European Union and you are also an example of how a small country can set the tempo and dictate the conditions to the big countries.
The President of the European Commission, Mr Barroso, drew attention in his speech today to the increased financial pressure on the new Member States, referring to the backward regions.
I should like to point out that these ten Member States also have great wealth.
Many of these regions have been deprived of tens and hundreds of young ambitious people, scientists, doctors, who have left in the last fifteen years for the old Europe and they are contributing to their successful economies.
I should like to point out to the Luxembourg presidency that we do not wish to be just the recipients of charity.
I see this as an opportunity for you actively to involve the new ten.
Following ratification of the Constitutional Treaty, Europe will build new institutions.
I invite you to take steps to ensure that the east of the European Union is given the right to host an important European institution.
I am convinced that this idea could be a success.
Evidence of this faith is the fact that the Bush â Putin meeting is to take place in my little country, Slovakia.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, the reform of the Stability Pact and the reform of the financial perspective are two sides of the same coin.
These reforms need to find a common philosophy and a common solution: more growth, more competitiveness and more resources for the Member States.
That all means more affluence and more cohesion.
Let me be frank with you, Mr Juncker.
What you have said on the Stability and Growth Pact is thoroughly acceptable, but it is all provided for in the current system of regulation: the automatic stabilising mechanisms, their relationship with growth or recession, the relationship between greater deficit flexibility and the effectiveness of debt dynamics â all that is already provided for.
What the European Union needs now is not that, but perhaps we should be more ambitious.
I say more ambitious, but that does not mean less rigorous, just more mindful of the strategic needs of our Union.
If we really have to re-establish an effective, Europe-wide strategy for investments, infrastructure, research and security â in short, to meet the targets set at the Lisbon Summit â then we have to reach agreement on the kinds of action needed: no hypocrisy, no dirty tricks and no opportunism.
The Pact needs a European golden rule, as one might say, with the appropriate guarantees and controls attached.
The financial perspective needs a stronger, not a weaker Union budget, one that focuses more on the investments required by the Lisbon objectives and less on handouts.
Mr Juncker, Mr Barroso, will we be capable of that?
It depends on us.
The responsibility rests with us all, but please let us not have any hypocrisy.
Â Â  Mr Juncker, I would like to focus my brief comments on the financial perspectives, which, of the challenges that have been mentioned today, are perhaps the most difficult facing this Presidency.
In explaining your priorities, you say that you accept the reasons why it is necessary to reach a political agreement on the financial perspectives in June, so that the legislative procedures can be concluded under the British Presidency, reconciling national differences.
We wish you luck, because, on the one hand, there is the enlargement we have just carried out, with ten new Member States whose economic situation mean that we are going to have to make an enormous financial effort with a view to social and economic cohesion, in order to protect the European social model, as you have stressed in your speech.
On the other hand, there are the short-sighted accountants, whose sole aim is not to exceed a certain level of spending.
We hope that, with your experience and with the cooperation of the European Parliament, your Presidency will persuade the Council to take a broader view, and make it see that it is irresponsible to try to create more Europe with less resources â to use once again that well-worn phrase.
But it is also necessary to make the Council see that budgetary policy, Mr Juncker, is facing much more important challenges than keeping spending below a particular percentage of gross domestic product.
Let us continue to build a Europe amongst all of us and with sufficient resources, as laid down in the Treaties, so that we do not disappoint the citizens.
Â Â  Mr President, the new presidency can be assured that hundreds and thousands of British citizens will fight the proposed European Constitution tooth and nail, and millions of us will vote against it when the time comes!
We have no quarrel with the people of Europe: our quarrel is only with the system of unitary government called the European Union.
The EU is the of the accountable parliamentary democracy that the British invented over 700 years ago.
This attempted reversal of the relationship between the State and the individual has been foisted on us over the last 30 years by deceit, denial and misrepresentation.
But now we understand fully what the EU is really all about.
We may not leave during your presidency, but be in no doubt â leave we shall!
Â Â  Mr President, the tenor of my speech will be rather different from that of the previous speakerâs.
Let me start by thanking the Luxembourg Presidency, not only for the excellent agenda it has presented, but also for the style, content and level of commitment evident in it.
In the coming months, the Luxembourg Presidency will certainly have its work cut out, and we have high hopes.
There are great challenges that require an answer and that Europe has to meet.
I should like to bring up one of those challenges, namely more and better jobs, but also sustainability and social cohesion.
I will therefore repeat to Mr Goebbels and MrÂ Cohn-Bendit that the Socialists and the Greens do not have sole exhibition rights in this respect.
Social cohesion is very much one of the Christian Democratsâ principles, and I will always continue to dedicate myself, as I know will our group, to ensure that social cohesion is maintained.
That is why I am pleased that not only the President of the Council, but also the President of the Commission and the chairman of my group mentioned it.
I should like to say a few words about Lisbon, and I want to make a number of points.
First of all, while the objective of what we did in Lisbon was sound, and the result we would like to achieve is excellent, we forgot that, when all those Heads of Government went home, nobody assumed any responsibility or liability for this process.
What matters more than anything else at the moment is, in addition to all the new measures that have to be taken, for people to be made accountable.
It will then be possible to verify national plans at European level.
I should like to finish off with a cry from the heart.
I have noticed that we have made a few agreements about the free market that were subsequently flouted by the Member States and also by the European Commission, as regards qualifications, mobility, and so on.
Â Â  Mr President, the Lisbon Strategy is so full of grand ideas that we often hear very little â and indeed we have heard very little today â about the simple things, such as improving the quality of our own legislation.
The fact is that the European Union could add between two and six per cent to its productivity if its regulatory framework was matched by the best in the world.
We should therefore be making it a priority of the Luxembourg presidency to encourage the Commission to put real resources into consultations at an early stage in its proposals and to test whether its competitiveness is appropriate.
We also need to spend time looking at existing legislation and seeing whether it has achieved the effect that we asked for.
Often we pass legislation, but do not look at what it has actually achieved.
Is existing legislation being properly enforced and implemented?
It seems to me that, in the European Union of 25, implementation enforcement should get far higher priority than it has up until now.
I am glad that the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection has taken up my suggestion that we should have an own-initiative report looking precisely at these issues.
We have also heard considerable talk today about social Europe, but we have to ensure that social Europe applies to everybody and not simply to those who are in work.
Far too many of our citizens are economically inactive, and therefore we should be putting investment into active labour market policies that enable people to get back to work and then policies that support people in order for them to be able to continue in work.
If we fail to do that, then we will fail in our Lisbon Strategy.
Finally, I urge the Luxembourg presidency to take fresh initiatives in relation to Northern Cyprus so that we can ensure we have effective economic regeneration in that part of the country.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to begin by wishing Mr Juncker and his country a successful presidency.
Mr President-in-Office, you assume the leadership of the Union at a crucial period.
The ratification process for the Constitution is underway, the Lisbon process is not yet making enough progress and the future of transatlantic relations is a source of concern.
In March, the European Council will conduct the mid-term review of the Lisbon process.
It will do it against the backdrop of the Kok report, which was blunt in its assessment of the lack of progress.
I urge the presidency not to be distracted by the siren calls of those who urge that the preservation of the 'European model' is the most important political priority.
It is clearly not.
It is precisely because so many governments have failed to grasp the nettle of radical reform that the Lisbon process is in such dire straits.
The UnitedÂ States continues to out-perform us and the competitive challenges from Asia, particularly China and India, are increasing, with no apparent urgent response from national capitals in our Union.
The presidency must be unequivocal in its support for economic reform, for greater labour market flexibility, for more competitive taxation policies, and for reducing barriers to employment growth, particularly the excessive regulation that pervades all our economies.
With high unemployment a factor across Europe, people are waiting for practical ways of getting them back to work.
Reform will be difficult and fraught with risk, but as the United Kingdom, under Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s and Spain under Mr Aznar in the 1990s proved, a resolute approach to economic reform delivers results.
Low taxation, flexible labour markets, less red tape and a determination to tip the balance firmly in favour of the wealth-creators offers the only way out of a relative economic decline.
These things are naturally anathema to socialists but are good for all our citizens.
We look to the spring Council in March to reverse the failures of recent times and put Europe firmly on a free market and enterprise-driven path.
Â Â  Mr President, the whole issue of children has been invisible in EU policies and programmes.
However, children's rights are now mentioned in the Constitution and the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
It is important that progress is made towards a horizontal European policy on children.
Children cannot defend themselves. Thus it is our obligation to do this.
Every day we hear about children who are starving, dying or abused in all possible ways.
However, there is no mention in your programme of a full-scale strategy on children's rights in accordance with the UN Convention on Children's Rights, which was ratified by most European countries.
Children are vulnerable to trafficking.
The recently published report on trafficking in human beings by the Experts Group has a strong human rights dimension.
I urge the Luxembourg presidency to take this forward, including a specific legal instrument to promote and protect the rights of children who have been trafficked.
The Luxembourg presidency has stated that a directive on the return of asylum seekers is a priority.
It is important that there is a specific section to protect the rights of children and that unaccompanied children are not returned to their countries of origin without an assessment of what is in their best interests.
The mainstreaming of children's rights in European Union development policy has not been achieved.
I urge the Luxembourg presidency to address this failure without delay by calling for a communication on children's rights and new development cooperation and by supporting references to children's rights as a priority.
I further urge it to revise the development policy statement.
The implementation of new guidelines to safeguard children in conflict areas remains a concern.
In order to ensure progress, it is essential that the Luxembourg presidency takes this process forward by completing and putting into practice a plan of action.
In conclusion, it is vital that children's rights are made a priority of the Luxembourg presidency and that children's rights are included in the presidency conclusions.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, I have noticed two shortcomings in the Luxembourg Presidencyâs programme, and I should like to ask two questions with regard to these shortcomings.
The document outlining the Luxembourg Presidencyâs priorities mentions 27Â countries and regions outside the EU by name, yet Eastern Europe and Ukraine are not mentioned once.
To put it another way, the programme lacks an eastern dimension.
It would be somewhat alarming if this reflected the Luxembourg Presidencyâs views and intentions with regard to the new European democracy that has emerged before our very eyes and on our very doorstep.
The comments made before this House on Ukraine have been very cautious.
They do not imply that measures will be taken that are equal to the responsibility which Europe bears towards Ukraine, and which poses a moral and political imperative.
If we were to content ourselves with the old Action Plan, which was based on the neighbourhood policy, we would be doing far too little, and we would be making a mistake.
This plan was drawn up for a Ukraine from a different age, before the âOrange Revolutionâ took place, offering hope and a model for peaceful political transformation.
The events in Ukraine merit a reaction from Europe, not merely words and outdated instruments.
Time passes more rapidly, and indeed differently, in Central and Eastern Europe.
We must act now to ensure that democracy is not merely victorious, but that it is long-lasting and a source of hope to others.
What should therefore be done?
The old Action Plan should be revised and extended beyond the neighbourhood policy, and a fresh offer should be made.
The EUâs relations with Ukraine should be advanced to a new level, and the country should be offered an Association Agreement and the prospect of membership.
We should not thwart Ukraineâs European hopes or trade in our fundamental values, such as freedom, democracy and solidarity, for oil and gas.
By supporting Ukrainian democracy we will also support the democratic ambitions of the citizens of Belarus, Russia and the other countries of the post-Soviet space.
It is an opportunity for political change that will benefit the European Union in every respect.
The era of Yalta, of the Brezhnev Doctrine and of the Berlin Wall has ended.
We need a courageous policy based on our values, not on our financial interests, and promoting democracy, human rights and the right of nations to self-determination.
The forging of more open relations with a democratic Ukraine is both a great challenge and a great responsibility for the Luxembourg Presidency.
I wish it every success.
Â Â  . Mr President, I can take one of two approaches; I can either answer the 30 Members who have spoken, and risk being very long-winded, or I can merely answer a few of them, and risk appearing extremely impolite to the others.
I shall therefore try to be brief in order to be polite.
MrÂ Goebbels, who has been following my progress closely for many years, believes me to be entirely incapable of such a thing, and on this point we agree.
Mr President, several speakers have referred to the Lisbon agenda, in particular the group chairmen and other Members such as MrÂ Swoboda and MrsÂ Oomen.
It would appear that we are more or less in agreement on the need to maintain the fundamental synergy on which the Lisbon strategy is based, and which was given a useful boost by the conclusions of the Gothenburg European Council.
It has become a habit of MrÂ Cohn-Benditâs to refer indiscriminately to authors from both sides of the Rhine, and today he quoted Victor Hugo.
With regard to the Lisbon agenda, I should like to quote Pascal, who said that he liked things that go hand in hand.
This holds true for a number of areas of life, and it also holds true for the Lisbon strategy.
It is impossible to distinguish between the various elements that go towards making the Lisbon strategy so effective â and I am talking here of its theoretical effectiveness, not the enthusiasm with which it is implemented.
A number of you have referred to the much-needed structural reforms that must be carried out in the framework of the Lisbon strategy.
I have been a member of the Ecofin Council since 1989, I believe.
Since then, I have been told week after week and month after month that structural reforms must be carried out, yet it is rare for me to come across anyone who is able to say exactly what these structural reforms should look like.
As a general rule, it is my impression that those who say that structural reforms must be carried out actually mean that the social state must be dismantled.
This is why it is frequently said with regard to structural reforms that labour markets must be reformed and that they need to be more flexible.
I believe this to be true, but I also believe that European employers could be more flexible.
I believe that it would be in the interests of decision-makers, who frequently also take decisions for others, to prove themselves more flexible in adapting the tools we have to modern needs.
I myself do not believe that Europeans should be led to think that it will be enough to reform labour markets, to abolish existing social legislation and to eliminate the buffer zones provided by workersâ rights in order to become more competitive.
This would be a very short-term approach, with obvious consequences; we would not gain competitiveness, but we would lose the support of a large number of Europeans, in particular workers.
I should therefore like to warn you against such simplistic proposals, which will get us nowhere.
Several of you stated that your groups would support the Stability Pact, and this made the debate extremely interesting.
I shall explain what I mean by this.
MrÂ Goebbels, no less, offered the support of his parliamentary group, the Socialists.
If I understood him correctly, MrÂ Cohn-Bendit appears to be moving towards a clear meeting of interests and ideas on this issue.
MrÂ Poettering promised the support of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party.
Five minutes of the Luxembourg Presidency were therefore all that were needed to see the Socialists, the Liberals, the Christian Democrats and all the others agree on the general shape to be taken by the reform of the Stability and Growth Pact.
This is something I welcome greatly, and in this respect the Luxembourg Presidency will be straightforward; this was not something I was aware of before todayâs sitting.
I shall turn briefly to the Directive on the liberalisation of services, with regard to which I thought I had made my views clear.
We will not reject this Directive, as it could in fact generate jobs if we draft it in a way that is appropriate to the situation.
I would like us, however, to join forces to remove everything from this Directive which poses a risk of social dumping, and which has crept into the text if one reads between the lines.
I am well aware that our discussion of this directive is bedevilled by confusion, because the potential risks posed by a number of its provisions are not obvious.
I should therefore like to call on the Commission, the Council and Parliament to examine this draft directive line by line, searching for any risk of social dumping.
After all, given that everyone, including Mr Bolkestein, tells me that the aim is not to violate the rules which protect our labour markets, we should be able to eliminate the risk of social dumping â a risk I believe to be very much present as far as this directive is concerned â by means of a common reading, if this is indeed our overall intention.
That said, even if we had the opportunity to do so, the directive would not be adopted as it stands during the Luxembourg Presidency, as it requires amendment in several places.
The Statute for Members will be adopted before the end of the Luxembourg Presidency.
MrÂ Mote, you said that you would like to leave the European Union because it represents everything to which you are opposed and which you reject.
I must say that I cannot agree with you on this point.
The European Union represents everything I support, because I support understanding between peoples and European solidarity â a solidarity that must not be jeopardised by a flawed reform of the Financial Perspective that aims to destroy solidarity instruments.
The European Union represents everything I support because I support peace.
We have undergone untold suffering in Europe as a result of divisions between peoples.
Even if you wish to leave the European Union, you cannot fail to support it.
Â Â  . Mr President, I do not intend to return to issues we have already discussed during our debate.
The Luxembourg Presidency has made its priorities quite clear.
The Commission supports these priorities, and intends to work together with the presidency, all the Member States and the Council in a fair and constructive manner in order to achieve significant results during a six-month period that we regard as crucial.
I would, however, like to turn to an issue which was not mentioned during our introductory speeches, but which has been raised by at least one Member, namely the issue of better lawmaking.
We too support the fact that the Luxembourg Presidency intends to give priority to measures to improve the quality of legislation, and indeed this priority is specified in the presidencyâs programme.
The Cox report stresses that the quality of legislation is one of the key factors in improving the economic environment, but I should like to say that quite apart from the economic environment, better lawmaking is also a key factor in improving the European publicâs understanding of and confidence in European integration.
Better lawmaking relates not only to competitiveness, but also to citizenship.
The public view of the European Unionâs work is often marked by criticism of its bureaucratic and interventionist nature, and the fact that it is divorced from reality.
Legislation should be simplified in a systematic and operational fashion, and the must be made easier to understand.
Impact assessments are a key factor in ensuring that better preparations are made for crucial political decisions.
Simpler and better prepared legislation is a prerequisite for greater understanding, and hence greater acceptance, of such legislation by our fellow citizens.
I must also stress that implementation has become a critical aspect.
If the EU and its Member States prove incapable of ensuring that directives are transposed rapidly and the respected, the credibility of EU action will be at stake.
For its part, the Commission will focus renewed attention on violations of Community law and onÂ the way in which infringements are dealt with.
In conclusion, and turning to the review of the Lisbon strategy, I should like to say that divisions should not be seen where they do not exist.
I believe that we all agree that economic competitiveness, the environment and social legislation are crucially important in this Europe of ours.
The same cannot be said of competitiveness on a global scale, as this is an area where improvements could be made in relation to our partners.
I do not honestly believe that we have a great deal to learn or to do to catch up with our partners as far as environment and social legislation is concerned, but much remains for us to do in the field of competitiveness, for example with regard to research and development.
If one compares Europe â even the Europe of 15 before enlargement â to the United States and Japan with regard to investment in research into new technologies, for example, it can be seen that the investments made by the Europe of 15 only total one third of US investments, and are 30% less than Japanese investments.
Yet investment in research and innovation for growth in Europe deserves to be a priority, and we are currently working with the Luxembourg Presidency and all the Member States to ensure that this is the case, namely that more targeted attention is paid to the most pressing issues.
I am in no doubt that during this presidency we will all be able to adopt a revised Lisbon strategy, which will have greater force and be able to revive our European social model in a modernised form in order to guarantee the prosperity of our fellow citizens.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  â This Presidencyâs programme only manages not to be a complete disappointment because we did not expect much from its content anyway.
We deplore the fact that it has overlooked some key issues.
The programme says nothing about unemployment, even though it has worsened.
It makes no commitment to take stock of the euro in the 12 Member States of the euro zone, despite increasing problems in most of those countries, not least in view of the currencyâs overvaluation.
It makes no commitment to demanding a review of the liberalisation of the textiles and clothing trade, or at least to using safeguard clauses for the most sensitive products.
It makes no reference to the 60th anniversary of the defeat of fascism.
As regards the Lisbon Strategy, it does not reach the right conclusions on the impact of the current situation; far from it.
It pursues the same path of liberalisations and privatisations, of making jobs less secure and of attacks on public services.
Similarly, it does not propose to repeal the Stability and Growth Pact and replace it with a Social Progress and Jobs Pact, in line with the objectives of full employment, sustainable economic development and economic and social cohesion.
Â Â  The next item is the Council and Commission Statements on the consequences of the tsunami disaster of 26 December 2004.
Â Â  . Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the unprecedented disaster that occurred on 26Â December affected 12Â countries and has claimed over 160Â 000Â victims to date, without taking into account the thousands of missing persons, the large number of casualties and the many displaced or homeless persons, of whom there are estimated to be fiveÂ million.
Children who have been orphaned or separated from family members are particularly vulnerable in these circumstances.
Sanitary conditions are a cause of great concern, and the extent of the material damage defies any attempt at calculation.
Given the scale of the disaster, and in close cooperation with the Dutch Presidency, the Luxembourg Presidency reacted immediately after 26 December by visiting the area concerned on 1 January, along with the Commission.
On the same day, the Luxembourg Minister for Health also contacted and met with officials from the WHO and the International Red Cross.
On the basis of these first contacts with the United Nations and the countries affected, and following the extended emergency summit held in Jakarta, the presidency called a General Affairs and External Relations Council on 7 January, which brought together a great many ministers for foreign affairs, cooperation and health.
The Council meeting of 7 January reiterated the European Unionâs solidarity with the countries affected and with their citizens, whom it thanked â and this is a very important point â for the support they gave to European citizens present in those countries at the time of the disaster.
The Council also paid tribute to the general spirit of solidarity that had been demonstrated by civil society and by the public.
The Council meeting provided us with an opportunity to review both the many initiatives taken by the Commission and the Member States and the much-needed coordination of EU aid.
We turned our joint attention to the best way of responding to the emergency in terms of financial, material and health aid, and the financial and operational resources which would be necessary and adequate for the subsequent stages of rehabilitation and reconstruction.
Officials from UN agencies, namely the OCHA, the WHO and UNICEF, were invited to take part in this meeting.
They provided the Council with additional information regarding the situation on the ground and the measures which had been taken, as well as an assessment of future needs.
In this connection, it was stressed that the UN would play a central role in the coordination of aid.
The main and most immediate outcomes of this Council meeting were as follows; with regard to financial issues, the Council announced that combined state aid from the European Union and the Member States for the victims of the tsunami currently stood at around EURÂ 1.5Â billion, including both emergency aid and reconstruction aid.
The Council noted, however, that this figure should not lead us to forget the general issue of development, humanitarian aid and the Millennium Development Goals, especially in Africa, nor to reduce the resources set aside for that purpose.
With regard to health issues, the Member States were invited to combine their efforts under the auspices of the WHO, in order to prevent the risk of epidemics and to put in place health infrastructures by supplying appropriate materials and medical teams.
The European Union and its Member States will act in support of the WHO.
With regard to more long-term measures, the Council expressed its hope that the European Unionâs capacity to deal with major disasters would be enhanced, and stated its intention to put in place the following instruments.
The first of these instruments is a prevention strategy and an early-warning and rapid reaction system for disasters, particularly with a view to the World Conference on Disaster Reduction, which will be held in Kobe, in Japan, from 18 to 22Â January.
Secondly, improvements will be made to the civil protection mechanism and humanitarian aid, and analytical capacity enhanced.
The Council hopes to build up rapid response capabilities for the European Union by putting in place appropriate structures for planning, coordination and resource mobilisation.
The third such instrument is the stepping up of consular cooperation.
Fourthly, there are other measures which the Council will need to examine, such as the development of an EU rapid response capability, or in other words an early-warning system.
The setting up of a European Voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps will also need to be assessed, and coordination within the European Union in the fields of rescue, evacuation and the transport of supplies and medical aid stepped up.
Further measures include trade support and bilateral partnerships, such as the twinning of towns and hospitals, and, finally, the rescheduling of debt servicing for affected countries wishing to embark on such rescheduling.
This should be an item on the agenda of the Ecofin Council to be held next week.
The General Affairs Council of 31 January will return to all the measures and strategies envisaged by the EU and the Member States for the medium and long term, with a view to drawing up an operational action plan for the EU.
On the evening of 7 January, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, the European Commissioner competent for such matters, myself and the ministers responsible for health and cooperation reported back to a large delegation from this House.
This week, the presidency and the Commission will continue to hold an intensive dialogue with the relevant European Parliament bodies in order to implement the EUâs financial commitments, and I hope that during the General Affairs Council of 31 January we will be able to give concrete expression to some of the strategies sketched out during the General Affairs Council of 7Â January.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the scale of the disaster in Asia leads us to reflect on the fragility of human life in the face of the force of nature and on how other matters pale in comparison with a human tragedy on this scale.
It also makes us consider the nature of national- and European-level political action aimed at dealing with the impact of natural disasters such as this one.
I feel that this is an appropriate time for us to think about our instruments and our policies and about the ways in which we coordinate our efforts and in which we share responsibilities among national authorities and European institutions.
My trip to Jakarta last week gave me some sense of the actual scale of the tragedy caused by this earthquake and the tsunami that followed.
The trip also confirmed to me that the international community, including the EU and the Commission, was capable of responding swiftly by raising substantial amounts of money and providing other forms of support.
Commissioner Michel was shocked by what he saw when he was in the area.
The giant wave completely swept away any human presence along 500 kilometres of coastline, destroying everything in its path and reaching places more than five kilometres inland.
The biggest tragedy is that most of the population lived on the very coastal strip that was completely devastated.
Similarly alarming stories have reached us from Sri Lanka, Thailand, India and the Maldives and the havoc caused in other, less accessible, countries, is only now coming to light.
The tragedy also reached as far as the coast of Africa.
This enormous natural disaster has left 150Â 000 dead in its wake, and more than 5Â million people homeless and traumatised, who now have to face the challenge of picking up what remains of their devastated families, rebuilding their homes, restoring economic activities and, in short, trying to start their lives again.
The scale of the disaster and the shocking images plastered on our televisions and newspapers sparked massive sympathy among our European citizens, who widely demanded a very quick and large-scale response.
We should be proud of the European response.
Europeans have provided a massive demonstration of solidarity, at the level of institutions and at the level of individual citizens.
Overall European support for the victims and countries affected is by far the most important worldwide: Europe was the first donor to announce direct assistance; European representatives were among the first on the ground.
I want to praise all of those directly and indirectly involved in this enormous effort.
As regards the management of the crisis, I want to highlight the excellent cooperation between the Commission and the Council presidency, in particular the cooperation of Prime Minister Juncker, and the European Parliament.
We have shown how crucial it is to ensure sound and effective interinstitutional cooperation.
In other emergency situations the Commission has had more time to discuss and prepare its response beforehand with Parliament and the Council, our budgetary authorities. In this case, we did not have that time.
Within nine days of the waves striking the coastlines of Asia and Africa, the heads of government from the affected countries and the major donors were gathering in Jakarta to agree on how we would repair the damage and what funds we would make available.
To prepare the ground within the limited time that we had, I discussed with President Borrell Fontelles and Prime Minister Juncker, before leaving for Jakarta, the Commission's proposal to pledge up to EUR 450 million.
They were both very positive and supportive of the approach I proposed.
Indeed, at the conference in Jakarta I mentioned a special message that President Borrell Fontelles sent me and asked me to transmit to the heads of state and government gathered there.
Without having had an opportunity for detailed discussion in Parliament's plenary and the Council, I indicated to the pledging conference in Jakarta that the Commission's EUR 450 million pledge was conditional on its approval by the budgetary authorities and that includes you, the European Parliament.
The Commission's priority today is to listen to your views, answer your questions and agree on how we can best tackle the two main tasks we now face, namely how to turn our conditional pledge rapidly into concrete money on the budget, and then to turn those funds into effective reconstruction programmes on the ground that will help people rebuild their shattered lives.
While it is still early days, I should like to explain in more detail what I have in mind as to how best to use the Commission's pledge, if you and the Council agree to the funding that we have proposed.
On the humanitarian side, the Commission has responded rapidly and very efficiently.
Through our humanitarian assistance office, ECHO, we were one of the first organisations to respond to the disaster by making â EUR 23 million available â EUR 3 million of which were available on the day of the disaster itself â in humanitarian aid to the Red Cross and other partners for meeting essential needs.
We reinforced ECHO staff on the ground, and our experts have been working closely with the United Nations and other donors to assess needs and ensure the coordination of the humanitarian aid effort on the ground.
Commissioner Michel travelled to the most affected areas from 1 to 7 January to gather a first-hand impression and gauge needs for relief and rehabilitation.
We have also been quick in mobilising civil protection.
The European Civil Protection Mechanism, under the responsibility of Commissioner Dimas, has been active since the very first reports of the tsunami.
Throughout the disaster, the European Commission's Monitoring and Information Centre has operated around the clock to mobilise and coordinate civil protection assistance from European Union Member States and neighbouring countries.
The mechanism has proved to be a simple and efficient system that allows the targeting of assistance to the specific needs of each affected country.
Within 24 hours of the disaster, the Centre sent assessment and coordination experts to Thailand and Sri Lanka.
As Mr Kofi Annan has underlined, USD 1 billion will be needed immediately.
In answer to this, I proposed, as part of the pledge, that another EUR 100 million be allocated from the emergency reserve to provide humanitarian assistance.
I understand your committees have been discussing this proposal favourably and Commissioner Michel indicated our commitment at the United Nation's pledging conference held in Geneva yesterday. This also shows our full support for Parliament's approach of underlining the coordination role of the United Nations.
On the reconstruction side, I proposed that EUR 350Â million be made available. I envisage that part of this will come from fresh funds and part from a reprogramming of funds already planned for the affected countries.
Although the reconstruction task will take several years, the financing of this reconstruction effort should be provided this year and next year.
I understand that the word 'reprogramming' has caused some concern in Parliament.
So why is the Commission proposing this?
The main reason is speed.
The funds for projects planned for 2005 are already on the table and can be used for the urgent and immediate reconstruction work.
Waiting for fresh funds to come on stream will take up to six months.
We need to move with reconstruction funds now.
All donors are responding in the same way, including the World Bank, to mobilise funds for the tsunami relief project as fast as possible.
Moreover, I do not believe this approach will have any negative side effects.
We may ask whether this will lead to a cancellation of projects already planned.
The answer is no.
If, like us, the governments decide that the tsunami-related project takes immediate priority, the originally-planned projects can be taken up in 2006 or 2007 under the new financial perspective; in some cases, the problem is that we cannot go on with the previous project for those regions because the tsunami has affected those regions, so we have to give priority to the tsunami-related projects.
Will this lead to Asia robbing other regions of their funds?
The answer is no.
Any projects that may be reprioritised and delayed in this way will be within the Asia envelope which, if necessary, will have to be readapted.
I count on your support in this regard.
Having seen the European Parliament's draft resolution, I can assure you that the 'poor across the world will not pay the price of this disaster'.
Regarding cooperation development aid, the priority of the European Union clearly is, and will continue to be, Africa, on account of its structural needs, of which you are all aware.
But this does not mean that we cannot proceed now by giving direct priority to the relief for this disaster.
Let me give you some specific examples of how this reprogramming approach can be of immediate value.
In Indonesia, the Commission has a EUR 35 million programme which aims to improve access and quality of healthcare at community level.
If the government of Indonesia agrees, this can be extended quickly to help rebuild and strengthen healthcare facilities damaged by the tsunami.
In Sri Lanka we are planning to cooperate with the World Bank on a housing programme to assist the resettlement of internally-displaced persons.
Similarly, this programme could be broadened quickly to assist with the rehousing of families displaced by the tsunami.
Whatever the level of new funding, I stress that the Commission needs to look at how planned projects can be reprogrammed in this way to ensure that we can respond to reconstruction within the critical first months.
But the Commission's pledge was provisional and could be revisited once final costings have been made.
We already know that needs are huge and there could be room for an even higher contribution of fresh funds if both Parliament and the Council agree to it.
I fully support the line agreed in Jakarta that the countries must conduct assessments of need and create their own national tsunami reconstruction plans.
That would identify the priority projects and the means to implement them.
It is a matter of basic principle: allowing the countries to assume their own responsibility and ensuring that they coordinate all the generous commitments made.
We should not flood the countries with hundreds of different facilities and instruments drawn up beforehand with donors or international financial institutions.
Let us look at another principle that all donors and countries agreed in Jakarta: to deliver our support rapidly.
I emphasised in Jakarta that the Commission would seek to explore all means at its disposal to turn its plans into effective programmes as quickly as possible.
The General Affairs Council further lent its support to this commitment.
This means accelerating our procedures as much as possible within the confines of the Financial Regulation so that unnecessarily heavy bureaucracy does not slow us down.
I saw how rapidly and efficiently the countries have already moved in helping their citizens.
It is impressive!
As such, we should provide the bulk of our aid as budget support, giving the countries the tools to rebuild their destroyed infrastructure and to restore the livelihoods of their shattered communities.
This approach is the only way in which the affected countries can coordinate the aid efficiently.
It would be an impossible task for them if the hundreds of donors gave their aid separately and all demanded that their own procedures be followed.
However, budget support must be properly supervised if we are to have the comfort of sound financial management of our funds.
To this end, I support the initiative of the World Bank and the other international financial institutions to develop trust funds with the countries concerned, effectively creating a common pot into which donors can put funds along with a common set of rules for implementing, monitoring and auditing, which will guide the management of the funds.
The Commission will also need to address punctual and particular projects that will be better delivered by direct implementation rather than by passing through the national budgets.
For example, some specific work may be started in the humanitarian phase that could usefully be continued under the initial reconstruction phase.
Alternatively, there may be specific conditions that prevent easy access for the national budget to certain geographical regions or, indeed, to the poorest communities who must benefit from this reconstruction.
Such cases would also warrant the continued channelling of part of our funds through NGOs.
The European Commission has been active from day one on all fronts, from humanitarian aid to civil protection and, increasingly so, to rehabilitation and reconstruction.
We will pursue our efforts relentlessly.
However, we will also reflect on improvements, new ideas and solutions.
We will reply to the Council's requests for proposals and put forward innovative tools.
In doing so, our main concern will be to find solutions that provide effectiveness and good use of available capacities in the Member States and European institutions, optimising means and technologies at European level.
Creating new structures for the sake of it is not an option; making better use of the vast existing European capacity in a coordinated and articulated manner is the way forward.
We will also be particularly attentive to the European dimension of our initiatives and will be keen to make it more visible to the general public and to the beneficiaries.
Solidarity is a trademark of the European Union.
Let it be experienced also in times of crisis.
I recognise the importance Parliament places on additional measures beyond aid that the European Union can provide further to help the countries affected by the tsunami.
You can rest assured that all Commission departments are mobilised in their particular areas to investigate what can be done in this regard.
This includes support for the G8 debt moratorium initiatives, the investigation of possible trade initiatives to ease trade access to the Union for the countries concerned and working with the governments to seek to facilitate the implementation of the European Investment Bank's Indian Ocean Tsunami Facility.
The Member States and Commission agreed in the General Affairs Council to offer direct support to the countries in their efforts to develop early-warning systems so they will be better able to respond to future disasters.
I noted with interest the ideas being floated on the possibility of supplying fishing vessels from the Commission, that is to say, European Union fleets to the fishing communities in the affected countries.
The idea is very appealing.
We have all seen pictures of boats wrecked by the tsunami, and our own fishing industry is about to destroy boats from its own fleet in line with fishery limits.
My services are currently exploring whether vessels are available, what state of repair they are in, if they meet the need of the fishing communities in the tsunami-affected areas, and how they could be made available to these fishermen.
I hope that this initiative will work and we will report back to you with the results of our work.
The Commission is also considering proposals for a new European Union approach to reinforce capacity for disaster prevention and, as discussed in the extraordinary Council meeting last Friday, we intend to look at early-warning mechanisms and preparation for disaster management, the ways to further improve the Commission's humanitarian aid provision, and civil protection, with a view to developing our rapid response to crises in third countries in full respect of the specificity and principles of humanitarian aid.
In this context, the Commission is preparing a proposal for the development of a rapid response capacity of the European Union, which will permit it to enhance its assistance in future humanitarian disasters and other crises.
We expect to present that proposal at the Council meeting on 31 January 2005.
In every successful emergency programme organised by the Commission, Parliament has played a pivotal role.
In this regard, I think of Afghanistan or the Balkans.
This role is not simply to agree on funding, but to follow the programme and to lend political weight where needed to ensure that the programme's political goals remain on track.
Your attention could also focus on the administrative resources â in headquarters and in delegations â necessary for effective delivery.
I am confident that you will play an important role in facilitating the Commission's programme of reconstruction after the tsunami.
To this end, I will undertake that the Commission will report to you regularly on progress, both in plenary and in committees.
The College had an extensive discussion yesterday on the Asian crisis and on how we should organise our follow-up to the work done so far.
By the end of this month, I expect to present Commission proposals for an improved European crisis response capability.
Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner will go to the region in the coming weeks to further assess needs and to put more flesh on this proposal.
I will propose that she report to Parliament on her return.
We have set high targets for the European Union's response to the South Asian crisis, both in Jakarta and in United Nations meetings in Geneva.
The outpouring of support from our private citizens for this crisis further shows their support for the full commitment of all European Union institutions to deliver on the promises we have made.
We must provide answers and I count on your support in helping the Commission to deliver.
I give you my promise to work closely with you in the massive task ahead of us.
Â Â  I would like to thank both the Council and the Commission for the extensive information they have given us on this tragic event; in particular, I would like to expressly acknowledge the way in which the President of the Commission has coordinated his work perfectly with the Presidency of Parliament in the meetings that have taken place and I would also like to thank him, in particular, for including two Members of this Parliament in the delegation at the Geneva Conference, which will undoubtedly help us to carry out the work of each institution in a more coordinated and speedy manner.


Â Â  . Mr President, I have just returned from Sri Lanka, where I witnessed many of the dreadful sights that we have all seen on television.
As a Sri Lankan-born Member of this Parliament, I wish to express my gratitude to all those who have responded so generously to appeals, and especially for the help given by the peoples of Europe; my own country, Britain, in particular; and my constituents in the south-east of England.
The EU and its Member States have together pledged almost EUR 1.5 billion so far.
The amount continues to rise.
The Commission and Parliament have sanctioned EURÂ 23 million and promised funds of EUR 350Â million, although EUR 150 million of that is not new money, but will be taken from existing long-term developments.
This must be reviewed.
I also welcome the proposal for a lending facility of EUR 1 billion from the European Investment Bank.
We must deliver the aid which we have promised.
In the past the international community has not done so.
A rapid reaction civilian corps for aid delivery, as proposed by Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, is most welcome.
Our aid must be visible.
I was embarrassed in Sri Lanka because EU aid was immediately delivered, but was done so invisibly, despite Commissioner Michel being extremely visible and hands-on.
The United Nations and NGOs only act as coordinators and do not pretend to be the donors.
Our taxpayers demand visibility.
Ownership matters.
We must also ensure that aid is not stolen â yes, stolen!
Where the appropriate systems do not exist in the recipient countries, aid will be stolen unless we ensure that delivery mechanisms are totally transparent and accountable.
There is currently an urgent need for small, suitable boats to be donated.
I am glad that President Barroso mentioned that.
Early warning procedures are also needed before the next disaster happens.
An authenticated telephone call to CNN and the other broadcast networks could have saved thousands of lives in Sri Lanka, Somalia and Thailand.
After all, the Americans evacuated Diego Garcia.
However, that telephone call did not come.
This does not only apply to Asia.
How would people in Europe be warned if, let us say, volcanic activity in the Canary Islands caused a tsunami?
Will the Commission prepare an urgent report?
In Sri Lanka I hope that reconstruction will also mean reconciliation and that aid will be consistent with the December 2002 Oslo talks and the Tokyo Donor Conference expectations.
We should expect no less for Indonesia, with its Aceh separatists.
We must remember that it is trade and investment, not aid, which will sustain the people in the long term.
The devastation is limited to the coastal areas and the countries of south Asia are still open for business.
Let us all work together, not only to repair the destruction, but also to give the victims a hand up and not merely a hand-out.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we do not believe that there is anything substantial to be added to what has been said by the President-in-Office of the Council, MrÂ Asselborn, and by the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso.
Both the Commission and the Council have described the essential steps that have to be taken.
We in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament can say that we endorse all these initiatives, and that this House must grant all the financial and organisational support that is needed.
I think everyone â including Mr Deva, who has just spoken â has made it clear that, as far as Parliament is concerned, both the economic resources and the organisational measures are guaranteed.
I can therefore limit myself to making a few basic observations on this disaster, which has made it apparent that we live in a global village and that the solidarity that is self-evidently necessary in the world in which we live must be supranational in character.
That is why it is important that we revisit, and establish in our own minds, the decisive importance of the role played by the EU itself alongside the Member States, for it is in the European Union that Europeansâ willingness to join in supranational action manifests itself, and that this international action organised under the European Unionâs aegis results in action being taken across continents is a necessary consequence of the fact that a disaster of this kind knows no geographical limit to its impact, afflicting not only the people who live where it strikes, but also people from every country, including from the European Union.
New forms of organisation are thus called for, and they are coming into being.
One of them has been proposed by the Commission: the combination of a rapid-response unit, rapid-response forces, and technical expertise, organised under the leadership of the European Union.
That is an intelligent proposal and one that is deserving of support.
It has been proposed that financial instruments be organised alongside those of the nation states, and that is something we cannot do without, but it is equally clear that people like Europeans, from a highly mobile society, cannot do without consular help in such a situation.
So it is that the development of a joint consular system, potentially paving the way for a shared diplomatic service, is something good to come out of this debate.
By way of a concluding comment, let me say that, in amidst the flood of information I have received over the past few days, there is one outstanding piece of news.
A few months ago, in this House, we commemorated the victims of the terrorist attack in Beslan.
I learned this morning that the people of Beslan have collected a million roubles â amounting to EURÂ 30Â 000 â as an expression of solidarity with the tsunamiâs victims.
In a situation like theirs, there can be no greater example of humane conduct, of solidarity, indeed of human greatness.
I think we should take this opportunity to express our utmost respect for the people of Beslan, who have themselves been victims.
Â Â  . Mr President, this is a global tragedy requiring a global response.
It provides an opportunity to reassert the role and the benefit of multilateral action through the United Nations, but also a challenge to the United Nations to prove itself up to the task.
Thus far, its response has been promising.
The response of the European Union, too, has put us on to a good start, and I salute the prompt action of Commissioner Michel and the support that his colleagues gave.
European Union aid, both public and private, has been impressive in its generosity.
ECHO funds were released rapidly in the aftermath of the disaster.
Total pledges now amount to EURÂ 540 million, plus a EURÂ 1 billion lending facility.
Though, to be honest, one-third of that grant aid is reprogrammed from existing development aid for the region.
Let us make sure that these pledges are honoured â only two per cent of the USDÂ 1 billion pledged to the reconstruction of the Iranian city of Bam after the earthquake there has been spent.
Let us not be complacent, for the present ECHO can act as a financier.
In the longer term we must have the potential to send troops, ships, floating hospitals and helicopters to assist in disaster relief.
More than 150Â 000 people have lost their lives, whole communities have been wiped out.
Five million more people are injured or have lost their homes, livelihoods or families.
Many are children at risk of falling prey to child traffickers and others.
Goodwill abroad notwithstanding, children from those devastated communities should not be removed from the societies and traditions that they know.
Unicef and others must act swiftly to provide the shelter, protection and registration that those children need if they are to rebuild their lives and perhaps, eventually, be traced by relatives.
This tragedy has called forth a major response in donations from individuals a world away, to families of victims they have never met, yet wish to help, reminding us how small our global community is.
Let us build on this opportunity to set aside our differences.
The stricken countries will pay more this year in trade tariffs than we will grant them in aid.
That should give us cause for reflection on our trading policies.
We need close monitoring of the aid to make sure it is not used to fuel regional conflicts and is not diverted by corrupt local officials.
Let us have a scoreboard for EU reconstruction efforts, just as the United Nations must have a tracking system for aid channelled through its agencies.
And let the Commission extend its lead in coordinating the Union's response.
If each Member State contributed an expert in humanitarian aid to ECHO, a central resource would exist with expertise in the response capacity of different national facilities.
Finally, one clear lesson from this is our frailty in the face of the forces of nature.
We cannot tame them, but we can collectively mitigate their devastation.
We have the technology to detect earthquakes in the world's danger spots.
Providing it to regions at risk can be achieved at modest expense and perhaps save hundreds of thousands of lives.
Â Â  . Ladies and gentlemen, holding debates in the aftermath of a disaster is always difficult, because on the one hand emotions are running high, and yet on the other political lessons must be learned from what has happened.
Could you please either quieten down or go and have a coffee, and come back when we have finished discussing the important issues?
Would that be possible?
There is a bar outside, where you can go and get as drunk as you like.
Thank you.
I apologise, MrÂ President.
I should like to say that my group supports the proposal presented by the Commission and the Council to enhance the European Unionâs civilian intervention capacities.
This disaster has shown us that, although much-needed, national interventions alone were unable to respond to a disaster of such magnitude. It also showed that civilian intervention capacities should cover not only humanitarian civilian intervention but also political civilian intervention, or in other words intervention in support of conflict prevention.
We cannot intervene in Indonesia without intervening in the conflict which is taking place there, and we cannot help Sri Lanka without intervening in the military conflict which is going on there.
Intervention in support of conflict prevention and humanitarian intervention are intimately linked, and we support the Commissionâs views on this matter.
I should like to suggest to other Members that the money they receive for this sitting should be donated to help the victims of the disaster.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, I have the impression that the media spotlight on the tragedy in the Far East has not yet been turned off and already the emphatic declarations of solidarity are giving way to more cynical economic and geopolitical interests.
Mr Barroso has tried to carry out a sleight of hand, but he is not a good conjurer.
The word âreprogrammingâ means using funds that had already been allocated to aid, and so I call for all the EUR 350 million for the first stage of reconstruction to be a new appropriation and for the total of EUR 1.5 billion that is to be paid out by the European Union and the 25 Member States to be donated without any kind of interest.
I have heard calls in this Chamber to take account of the foreign debt of the countries affected by the tsunami.
I believe we should state clearly that the only practicable possibility is to cancel their foreign debt.
We are talking about countries like Indonesia, which has more than USD 130 billion in debts and repaid USD 13 billion in 2002.
Given figures like those, our donations cannot provide any practical aid unless we cancel the debt.
I have not yet heard anybody mention an attempt to change the immigration rules, at least temporarily: I refer to the possibility for immigrants from the affected nations who are already living in Europe to be able to return home, see the situation for themselves, look for their loved ones and then be able to come back to the Union, without running the risk of losing their residence permit or job.
I also refer to the possibility of offering residence permits, at least temporary ones, to all those who have been hurt during this tragedy.
Â Â  . â Mr President, we have to deal with three issues in the wake of this disaster:
First, how this solidarity can be better expressed; in other words, how much money from European citizens will reach citizens in this devastated area, without being siphoned off by middlemen, para-governmental organisations and contractors.
Secondly, we need to respond to certain complaints from newspapers in the Middle East to the effect that it was allegedly preceded by a nuclear test.
We must not allow something like this to be raised, even as a ridiculous eventuality.
We must first check if any such nuclear test was carried out.
Thirdly, we must examine in depth what is happening in our area.
Here, the Commission is cutting money from earthquake research and giving it to space research.
However, if a similar earthquake occurred here, in the Mediterranean, the tsunami would reach the Alps and would flatten Greece, Italy, Malta, Cyprus, France, Spain and other countries.
We therefore need to look at what we can do in this direction.
Let the misfortune of south-east Asia be a lesson.
As Hippocrates said 2Â 500 years ago, prevention is better than cure, and that makes sense.
However, I do not know if there is any sense in the people at the Commission who are cutting money for earthquake research and giving it to space research.
Let us do something in our own area, before it all ends in tears here too.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, the key lesson to be learnt from the Indian Ocean disaster is the crucial and urgent need to equip the European Union with civil protection.
The events of recent days should make us give the matter serious consideration: Europe with its 25 Member States, its almost half a billion people and its single currency just looked on, stunned, dismayed and impotent, while the peoples that had been affected called out for immediate, practical and effective aid.
Where was the European civil protection mentioned in the action plan drawn up in 1999?
What did the European Monitoring Centre achieve?
Where was the civil protection task force set up by the Council of the European Union in October 2001 precisely to guarantee rapid intervention even outside Europe?
Why did the Commission decide to leave the 300 experts in the European task force at home during the tsunami disaster after training and preparing them for years?
Perhaps now is not the time for polemics, but it should at least be put on record â as we have been demanding for the last three years â that what Europe needs is not coordination and pooling of resources, but a civil protection agency, an autonomous body that is versatile and thus able to anticipate needs and take action when and where it is required.
That is what Parliament should be proposing, starting with tomorrowâs resolution, if we do not want to carry on pretending that nothing has happened or thinking that solidarity is just an empty promise.
Â Â  The debate is interrupted for voting time and will resume at 3 p.m.
Â Â  The next item is the vote.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, on behalf of the 25 Heads of State or Government who signed the Constitutional Treaty on 29Â October 2004, I should like to express my delight at the fact that the European Parliament has approved this Treaty by a very large majority.
This is an important moment in the history of this House, and an important moment on Europeâs path towards the ratification of this new Constitution. I would like to call on the national parliaments and the public to make known their views on this ratification in referendums wherever possible.
I say this in my name and in the name of the overwhelming majority of Europeans.
Â Â  Mr President, while the vote on Article 6 was being taken, I was addressed by a member of the Convention and mistakenly cast a ânoâ vote.
I would like to make it clear that I am in favour of Article 6, am voting in favour of it, and am happy to see the Constitutional Treaty adopted.
Â Â  â Ladies and gentlemen, we shall now proceed to the explanations of vote.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, thank you for allowing me to speak to explain my vote after the sitting was suspended by the President.
I confirm that I voted for the report by Mr Manuel Medina Ortega on civil liability in motor vehicle accidents, which unfortunately occur all over Europe.
I should like to request that, in his next reports on this topic, Mr Medina Ortega, a lawyer, should think of protecting the elderly.
When the elderly are injured in road accidents, they do not receive compensation because they cannot earn an income on account of their age.
I believe the fact that they are elderly does not mean they do not have a right to compensation for any injuries they sustain.
Â Â  . The purpose of the proposal before us is to update the minimum amounts of compulsory cover, within the framework of Community harmonisation on this matter, in the directive in question on motor vehicle security.
The main problem with this proposal is that of striking a balance between, on the one hand, the need to improve victim protection cover â cover for personal and material damage â in the event of a car accident involving a car of relatively low value and the fact, on the other hand, that improvement in cover of this nature will result in a rise in insurance premiums, when the âpricesâ charged by insurers are not monitored.
A further aspect of this issue is the general problem of harmonisation when economic situations vary from country to country.
This must be taken into account, especially in southern countries, such as Portugal, which have always had reservations on this issue.
Portugal has had a transitional period in which to adapt national legislation.
The common position provides for a further transitional period of five years, which I believe strikes a better balance.
Nevertheless, the proposals to raise minimum amounts to EURÂ 1Â million per victim and EURÂ 5Â million per event, regardless of the number of victims, is excessive, particularly the latter.
Â Â  . I hope this proposal will be successful in its aims of modernising and improving the existing EU rules in the field of motor insurance.
There are clear advantages for drivers in having a coherent framework for the recognition of their insurance policies and claims across frontiers.
This report should also add clarity to what legal assistance drivers are entitled to following an accident.
I hope the dispute over 'vehicle and trailer' issues does not stop this being adopted without need for conciliation.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of the Recommendation for Second Reading by Mr Medina Ortega (A6-0073/2004) on civil liability in respect of the use of motor vehicles.
The development of the internal market, and the increase in Community traffic have meant that for ten years we have needed to update the rules in force.
It was therefore necessary to update and strengthen protection through compulsory cover for victims of accidents caused by one motor vehicle, and to ensure greater convergence in the way in which Member States interpret and implement the directive.
With this fifth Directive it will be easier to obtain effective and valid civil liability insurance outside the country of residence, and to sell or buy a vehicle in another Member State.
Furthermore, this text increases legal protection for the victims of accidents.
I also feel that it is extremely important to highlight Parliamentâs proposal as regards a transitional period of up to five years to enable Member States to adapt to the minimum cover amounts.
Â Â  . Insurance against civil liability in respect of the use of motor vehicles is extremely important to European citizens either as the insured or as the victims of an accident.
The draft legislative resolution updates and enhances protection for victims of road accidents through compulsory insurance; it plugs gaps and clarifies provisions in directives so as to ensure greater convergence in the way in which the Member States interpret and implement them; and it provides for solutions to problems that often arise, in order to ensure a more efficient internal market in the area of car insurance.
In so doing, it contributes towards modernising and updating European insurance law and, at the same time, looks after the consumersâ interests and ensures that those consumers will enjoy a higher level of cover.
The legislative resolution is thus in line with measures to strengthen protection for the victims of road accidents and seeks to ensure that the injured party is duly reimbursed.
I hope, however, that some flexibility will ultimately prevent a sudden sharp rise in insurance premiums.
I also feel it is extremely important that legislative efforts be made to prevent the use of delaying tactics to renege on the liability guaranteed in the transfer of risk contract.
My vote is in line with the consensus that was reached yesterday in the trialogue.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, while I was voting for the Constitution for Europe â and I was pleased to vote in favour of it â I dozed off; I do not know why: perhaps it was the calm way in which MrÂ Borrell Fontelles conducts voting.
As I was dozing off I saw you, Mr Onesta, telling me that I must vote for the Constitution, and when I asked, âWhy must I vote for it?â you replied, âYou represent the pensioners, after all!â
We have to realise that this Constitution, which incorporates the Charter of Fundamental Rights, gives the elderly the right to be seen as deserving the same rights as the young, the same rights as workers.
While declaring that I voted for the Constitution, I would also express the hope there will not be any discrimination of any kind against the elderly in Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, the fact that we unequivocally reject this European Constitution does not mean that we are opposed to further European cooperation â the contrary is the case.
We do, however, resist the European big brother state, which is the precise opposite of what is laid down in this Constitution, namely respect for the subsidiarity principle.
Since we Flemings live within the Belgian federal state, we are experiencing first-hand how difficult, not to say impossible, it is to have good governance within a federal state.
When we now notice that with this Constitution, the European Union will increasingly resemble a kind of enlarged Belgium with extensive intervention in competences that, in our view, are strictly national, including culture, language legislation, and social security â to name but a few â then that is more than a bridge too far for us.
We are in favour of Europe but not of European uniformity.
Needless to say, we have voted against this European Constitution for those reasons, as well as many others.
Â Â  Mr President, when I voted in favour of the Corbett report, it was not because I thought the Constitution was the end of the story.
At the same time, however, I did not think it was the result of chance. What firstly crossed my mind were the lengthy struggles that preceded the 1949 European Convention on Human Rights and the 1961 European Social Charter, with the latter being backed by all the trade unions.
These have now borne fruit in the shape of Part Two of the Constitutional Treaty, which contains the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
Above all, however, my thoughts turned to the real father of the Constitution, AltieroÂ Spinelli, whose name is not mentioned nearly enough. Spinelli, a member of the Communist Youth who was put under house arrest for ten years by Mussolini, anticipated todayâs text right from the European Parliamentâs first term as a directly-elected body.
Another name to cross my mind was that of MrÂ Duhamel, who during the last parliamentary term prompted us to hold a public Convention in order to draft this Constitutional Treaty. I therefore came to the conclusion that, as a left-winger, I could lend my support to this draft Constitutional Treaty today without any qualms, as it will open a promising page in the history of the EU.
Â Â  Mr President, I voted to adopt the Constitution, but at the same time I wish to express my unhappiness that our Christian heritage is hardly mentioned.
In the debate on the subject there has been a general misunderstanding of the nature of the mention it gets.
This is not a matter of a declaration of faith, but an acknowledgement of the basis of our ethical infrastructure.
God does not need the protection afforded by the articles in the Constitution â it is not a question of that â but human beings do.
Defence of the weak cannot be justified in an Aristotelian way, with merely rational arguments.
For that reason, I think we ought to have acknowledged the role of Christianity behind the concept of European humanity.
The type of humanism we know today owes much to the Christian image of humanity that emphasises the value of the individual.
We need a firm basis for our great dreams of a fair Europe.
Hopefully we will be able to continue to help it develop.
Â Â  Mr President, it is, of course, impossible, within the space of one minute, to list all the reasons why I have voted against the report on the European Constitution.
I will therefore confine myself to the essence, namely that it is nation states that have constitutions, and not a body such as the European Union, unless, of course, the intention is to turn the European Union into a federalist superstate, in which case they should not count on the support of the .
Not everything in the Constitutional Treaty is bad â on the contrary â but there is no doubt that a number of simplifications and clarifications could have been carried out by means of a new European treaty of the traditional kind.
This Constitution, above all, leads to new transfers of competences to the EU and more European interference.
Moreover, in view of the probable accession of Turkey, a country which will considerably shake up the functioning of all institutions, the text is already superseded before it is ratified in the Member States.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to say that I think there is something very unusual about the way in which statements of vote are being dealt with in this instance.
The report on which we have just voted states that: âthe greatest advances brought by the Constitution are to be found in the specific area of common security policyâ.
That is the principal reason why I reject this Constitutional Treaty for the EU.
Its Article I-41, paragraph 3 states that âthe Member States are obliged to progressively improve their military capacitiesâ, which means that the EUâs Member States are obliged to rearm.
When we turn to foreign and military policy, we find that the Constitutional Treaty evidently aims to equip the European Union to wage global war.
Article I-41, paragraph 1, states that the Treaty is intended to secure operational capacity drawing on military assets, so that the Treaty makes rearmament an obligation.
An armaments agency is to be set up to monitor all this and to implement appropriate measures to strengthen the industrial and technological basis of the defence sector.
I think there is a whole array of other points demonstrating why the Constitutional Treaty, which militarises the European Union, must be rejected.
That is what I wanted this statement of vote to make clear.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Constitutional Treaty represents significant progress in the process of bringing Europe together, and that is why I voted in favour of it.
At the same time, there are aspects of it that give me cause for concern, one of them being the open coordination method as cooperation â with non-binding legal status â between Member States in the fields of social and employment policy, research policy, health policy and industrial policy.
The Commission is now, in these areas, empowered to take the initiative in enacting guidelines and action plans.
What this means in practice is that policy initiatives â new ones â are taken first, and then the related powers and responsibilities may be created.
The open coordination method represents the incipient transfer to the European level of what were formerly national areas of activity and blurs the demarcation of powers and responsibilities between Europe and the Member States.
Competition between the Member States is necessary, but this process is likely, to say the least, to shut it down.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to make a statement on the way I voted.
I voted in favour of the Convention because, despite my misgivings about it, it represents an improvement on the present situation and the law as it stands.
I am saddened, though, that this Constitution contains no reference to God.
It is a disappointment to me, and to millions of European citizens, that the 25 Heads of Government and this Parliament did not have the will or the strength to get a reference to the Deity inserted.
A European Constitution would have benefited from it being stated in the preamble that we are responsible for actions both to God and to man.
Another reason, though, why I voted in favour of the Constitution, was that its Article 57 makes it possible for Turkey and other countries to be offered a long-term and privileged partnership in the context of special relationships.
It is my hope that it will prove possible to incorporate the reference to the Deity in the Constitution at a later date.
Â Â  . With the European Constitution, Europe wants to make Europe more democratic and more transparent.
This is exemplified by Parliamentâs reinforced role in the decision-making process, the confirmation and strengthening of the subsidiarity principle, the creation of one uniform legal framework and the simplification of the legislative instruments.
The extension of Europeâs competences to include defence and asylum policy, and the definition of the European values are important new departures in the Constitution.
The Constitution is a step forward. A timid one, yes, but it is still a step forward.
That is why the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) supports this step because it stands for a more democratic and transparent Europe, a Europe with a strong public culture built from the bottom up and supported by its citizens.
At the same time, the N-VA regards the Constitution as a missed opportunity.
Although three-quarters of European regulations are implemented at local and regional level, the involvement of those regional authorities that implement them is minimal.
The regions that make up Europe are not allocated a single (formal) role in the European decision-making process.
Apart from a noncommittal paragraph concerning the recognition of the national identity of the Member States, in this Constitution, the Union completely overlooks the institutional reality in various Member States.
The continuing denial of this regional dimension is at odds with the idea of subsidiarity.
Â Â  . I welcome the progress made in the Constitutional Treaty with regard to development and international solidarity, the principle of which is enshrined as one of the EUâs fundamental values.
For the first time, this Treaty includes a separate chapter on cooperation with third countries and on humanitarian aid.
It emphasises objectives pertaining to this policy, namely the eradication of poverty, the promotion of health and the fight against infectious diseases.
It gives priority to childrenâs rights, and makes a great deal of progress with regard to womenâs rights and their key role in development.
The European Union has therefore reached a significant milestone, by acknowledging in its Constitutional Treaty that solidarity cannot be limited to its own territory and its own citizens, but should extend beyond its borders.
I have a number of concerns, of course, particularly with regard to the lack of any reference to âglobal public goodsâ, an issue upon which I put forward proposals.
Together with my Socialist colleagues, however, I intend to continue the fight to put into action and practice that which we were unable to put in the text of the Treaty.
Â Â  . This positive and balanced report gives the Treaty a favourable verdict.
It is very disappointing, however, that it does not take account of the opinion of Parliamentâs Committee on Fisheries, the only European body with specific powers in the area of fisheries which discussed the amendments introduced to the conservation of marine biological resources.
As the Committee on Fisheries concluded, âwithin the context of the other exclusive competences of the EU which are detailed in the draft Constitution, the inclusion of the conservation of marine biological resources is anomalous and unjustifiedâ.
Unlike the other areas in which the Treaty has undergone substantial amendments, marine biological resources are not solely the institutional concern of politicians.
They are the concern of the maritime communities, fishermen, scientists and environmentalists, whose opinions should never have been ignored.
Indeed, an opinion poll in Portugal found that only 4% of the public supported this solution, as opposed to 86% in favour of shared or national power.
The conservation of marine biological resources cannot be anybodyâs specific competence.
It is the duty of every citizen, and in particular of the citizens who depend on those resources for their livelihoods, people who cannot be ignored by the European institutions and by the representatives of the Member States.
I trust that this âunjustified anomalyâ will soon be rectified.
Â Â  The Moderate delegation has today voted in favour of the report on the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, A6-0070/2004.
We believe that the Constitutional Treaty should respect the institutional balance.
We therefore reject the proposals to introduce an elected President of the Council and to have the President of the Commission elected by the European Parliament.
We are also opposed to the procedure laid down in Article IV-444 and generally known as the passerelle, because we consider it fundamental that changes to the Treaty be ratified by each Member State before they enter into force.
The Constitutional Treaty makes the basic rules governing cooperation in the European Union easier to understand.
We are in favour of the greater weight given to subsidiarity, and we support the wordings that re-confirm and further develop the national parliamentsâ role in European cooperation.
EU law, as it has been in force and been applied, is affirmed when it comes to the relationship between EU law and national law; that is to say, Community law takes precedence over national law, account always being taken however of the Member Statesâ constitutional traditions.
The limits of the EUâs competence are also clarified, and the legislative procedure simplified.
We therefore support the proposed Constitutional Treaty.
Â Â  .
I fully support this report and eventually support adoption of the draft Constitution.
The Constitution was drafted in a uniquely democratic process and putting in place a Constitution for Europe by way of a binding treaty between sovereign states is the most important European decision citizens will make.
Four European treaties in less than 15 years have resulted in many undoubted European successes: the single market, the euro, the accession of eastern European countries, rising environmental standards, greater equality between women and men, and anti-poverty and full employment strategies, to name but a few.
But it had become increasingly obvious, particularly since the Nice European Summit in 2000, that the old intergovernmental method of revising European Treaties did not enable adequate European responses to the common challenges facing us to emerge, nor did it enable citizens to feel that the process belonged to them.
Europeâs institutional framework still needed to be overhauled, decision-making had to be made more democratic and brought closer to the citizens and Europe had to meet its responsibilities to the rest of the world, especially the developing world if the project is to help in bringing the globalisation process under democratic control.
Â Â  . I applaud the quality of the report on the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe.
Whilst the Constitution falls short of what Parliament wanted and has enshrined controversial issues, such as the question â extremely important to Madeira and the Azores â of the Unionâs exclusive competences in the area of the conservation of marine biological resources, against which a number of opposing views were raised at the Convention, and in the opinion on the Constitution issued by the Committee on Fisheries, I do acknowledge that it represents a welcome compromise and an improvement on the Treaties in force, as mentioned by the joint rapporteurs, and is a significant step towards achieving the European project, from the point of view of both the Member States and the citizens of Europe.
I also wish to highlight the Constitutionâs approach to the status of the outermost regions.
Not only does the Constitution maintain and strengthen the possibility of modulating the implementation of all European policies to the outermost regions, but it is also confirmed that this article constitutes a valid legal basis that is sufficient to underpin the development of a genuine policy for the outermost regions.
I shall be voting in favour of adopting the Constitution.
I call for it to be ratified and I am committed to the campaign for it to be implemented.
Â Â  . I abstained from voting on this report for several reasons.
To begin with, I cannot vote in favour of this resolution because my criticisms of the Constitution outnumber by far the very few aspects of it which could be regarded as slight progress.
In addition to my grave doubts regarding the construction of a social and political Europe, my most serious criticism relates to the fact that the task of a constitution is to allocate powers and to outline citizensâ rights and duties.
The policies and ideological choices set out in the Constitutional Treaty have no place in a constitution, and they preclude any possibility of different policies being implemented.
Furthermore, only one goal was pursued in the drafting of this report, namely that nothing but the positive and âprogressiveâ aspects of the Constitution be mentioned.
This exclusion of all criticism, no matter how minor, stands in stark contrast to the reservations voiced by this House when the previous resolution on the Intergovernmental Conference was adopted.
I am not convinced that either this resolution or this Treaty will make it possible to involve our fellow citizens more in European integration, or to respond to their calls for justice, equality and democracy.
Â Â  . Todayâs vote in Parliament on the draft of the new Constitution is part of the sad process of obfuscation and propaganda surrounding the so-called European Constitution; this is, in a word, manipulation.
Parliament has no legitimacy whatsoever to âadoptâ Treaties, as Point 6 of this resolution would have us believe.
Disingenuously and in collusion, most of Parliamentâs right wing, the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, and social democrats, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, are thus seeking to spread the false idea that the draft Treaty has been âadoptedâ by Parliament â as some media organisations will erroneously report before, let us not forget, any national referendum on this draft has been held.
The intention is clear: to use todayâs vote as yet another means of exerting pressure and spreading propaganda in favour of the loathsome so-called European Constitution in the process of its ratification â or rejection! â by the Member States.
In other words, it is an attempt to interfere in an area in which the Member States have sole competence.
It is disgraceful that this vote was accompanied by music being played, by balloons being let off and by banners and flags being unfurled âwith the above-mentioned key words and âyesâ in various languagesâ, thereby silencing any criticism of this draft.
Â Â  . The Corbett report, upon which the European Parliament gave its verdict today, acknowledges the indisputable progress made by the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe.
The Treaty provides us with a number of tools that are essential if we wish to make Europe more efficient, easier to understand and more democratic. It does so by clarifying the roles of the institutions, reducing the scope for blocking decisions and increasing the powers of the European Parliament and of its representatives, who have been elected by popular vote.
At the same time, it fosters Community solidarity and helps ensure genuine cohesion within the EU.
Firstly, it helps ensure social cohesion thanks to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which lays down rules relating to civic, political and social rights.
The Treaty also declares Europeâs objectives to be a social market economy, sustainable development and the fight against discrimination.
Secondly, it helps ensure territorial cohesion by means of a set of provisions that will help the EUâs regions to manage their own development.
The Treaty reiterates the specific nature of the UPRs, and more particularly that of the French overseas territories.
By consolidating the mechanisms under which derogations may be granted from Community rules, it provides real protection for the overseas territories, thus counteracting a destructive mindset that regards Europe as a uniform and homogenous territory.
Â Â  . What we are voting upon today is not a report but an act of faith, and an act of bad faith at that.
Contrary to what the rapporteurs have said, this text creates a centralised, omnipotent and totalitarian super-state that lacks an identity and a soul.
It will be a centralised state because every decision will be taken in Brussels, whatever field it may apply to, and all these decisions, whether legislative or not, and whether they concern national or local issues, will have to comply with European legislation and the sole interest of the EU.
The principle of subsidiarity will be held up to ridicule, as it has been for the past 12Â years.
It will be an omnipotent state because the European Union will have jurisdiction over every area, without exception, and all policies are or will be communitised.
It will be a totalitarian state because the real power will reside with a handful of officials, namely the Commission technocrats, who hold a monopoly over legislative initiative, and the Luxembourg judges, who are the overzealous inspectors of pro-European orthodoxy.
What they have in common is that they are not subject to any kind of democratic control after their appointment.
Finally, it will be a state lacking a soul and an identity, as it will turn its back on its Helleno-Christian roots and agree to Turkeyâs integration, despite the publicâs opposition, and will believe only in globalisation, competition and the market.
I shall therefore vote against, both today and in the referendum to be held in my country.
Â Â  We have voted against this report.
Our definitions of âsubsidiarityâ and âsuperstateâ clearly differ from those of the rapporteurs.
We define subsidiarity in terms of political decisions having to be taken as close to the people as possible and in terms of its being the national parliaments and not the EU institutions that determine which issues are to be decided upon at which level.
Our definition of a superstate is an EU state in which the Council as a rule takes decisions on a qualified majority basis, in which not all the Member States are represented in the Commission and in which the European Parliament has the right of codecision on all issues.
The EU is thus no longer a federation of states, which is what we believe it should be, but a federal state.
A common foreign and asylum policy, a rapid reaction force designed to intervene elsewhere in the world and an EU budget increased through the EUâs being given the right of taxation are among the factors that extend the exercise of political power by this âsuperstateâ.
This draft Constitution should be replaced by a new draft intergovernmental Treaty that gives central place to the national parliamentsâ political responsibility.
Religious issues must not be among those dealt with in texts of EU treaties.
We protest about the fact that, in connection with the reading of this report, the majority in the European Parliament is to invest EURÂ 340Â 000 of taxpayersâ money in a spectacle to launch the âyesâ campaign for the adoption of the âEU Constitutionâ by the Member States.
Â Â  I have chosen to differ from my political group and shall vote against the report on the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe.
I believe that the draft Constitution entails the EUâs going from being a form of intergovernmental cooperation based on treaties to being a state based on a Constitution.
I believe that it strengthens the precedence of EU law over national law, removes more power from the Member States and gives the larger countries more power than the small countries.
These are things to which I object.
I voted in favour of Swedenâs becoming a member of the EU in the 1994 referendum, and I am sincerely in favour of the idea of international cooperation in solving common problems.
There are important tasks we must perform together, especially where the environment, human trafficking and social dumping are concerned.
I am, however, opposed to the present trend towards increased supranationalism in the EU.
I wish to see European cooperation at intergovernmental level.
Â Â  .
I voted against this report in the final vote. I did so principally because I believe that the inclusion of marine biological resource conservation as one of only five exclusive competences of the EU is not only unnecessary, but in fact anomalous and unjustified.
The fact that this Parliament's Fisheries Committee almost unanimously supported that view in its opinion reflects a strongly held point of view in Scotland's fisheries dependent communities.
This is yet another example of failure on the part of a Westminster Government to act in the best interests of fishing communities, and will undoubtedly motivate many voters in Scotland to vote for rejection of the Constitutional Treaty in a referendum.
Â Â  .â If it were left to the Greens, the draft Constitution would be a good deal more ambitious than the one we have been presented with.
It would enable us to give practical form to the political, social and ecological Europe that we advocate.
Such a draft would be without ambiguities or uncertainties as to its objectives; it would not have this third part which, doing nothing more than recapitulating previous treaties, is in contradiction to a global and ambitious project for Europe.
Despite its imperfections, I shall be voting in favour of the draft Constitution, and I urge others to do likewise, for it would be a great aberration and major political error to go over to the ânoâ camp simply because the final document is not equal to the demands made of it.
More than ever, we need Europe, imperfect though it may be.
A Constitution will enable us to launch this peaceful Europe as the custodian of such shared values as human rights and democracy.
This great act will enable the European public to feel themselves united in a truly common design.
The âyesâ I shall say by voting in favour of the Corbett report is the âyesâ of a militant.
To fail in this historic moment would be to negate our own labour as builders of Europe and would for a considerable time put the brakes on the ambitious development of the European project that we wish to see âŠ
Â Â  The EU could operate perfectly well with one Commissioner per country.
Now that the European Council has, however, decided to reduce the number of Commissioners from 2014, it is important that we stick to the principle of fair rotation between the Member States.
Â Â  . Mr President, this Constitution, which claims to be European, is in fact an anti-European document, destroying as it does the foundations of Europe: its nations, which will lose their sovereignty for good, and the values of its civilisation, both Graeco-Latin and Christian.
There is nothing trivial about the omission of any reference to these: it was necessary in order to make the accession of Muslim Turkey acceptable.
It is evident that there is a causal connection between the European Constitution and the entry of this Asian country, contrary to what President Chirac tells us.
Once the Constitution is adopted, it will not only facilitate Turkeyâs accession, but will also give it â the most populous state in the European Union â the most MEPs and the most votes in the Council, giving it pre-eminence and superiority over France and Germany.
When President Chirac tells us that the French people will be able give their judgment on Turkish accession in 2014, he is lying; it will be too late.
The referendum on the Constitution will be held in a few monthsâ time, just before negotiations on accession begin.
If they vote ânoâ, the French people will also be saying ânoâ to Turkish entry.
Â Â  . This text, submitted to us as a Constitution for Europe, is the result of a misbegotten compromise in which all Europeâs social democrat governments have surrendered their peoplesâ sovereignty to a supranational body.
This Constitution organises a state with the appearance of unity, hiding the federalist mechanisms within it.
It is a hybrid organisation which, by making its mind known on every subject, and interfering in every area, enforces political choices that have tragic consequences for the future of the European peoples.
It also represents the culmination of a slow and progressive process of political and legal stratification and the institutionalisation of a new totalitarian organisation.
The Europe that is coming into being distances itself further from its citizens by impoverishing their societies.
These peoples are treated with contempt, and each consultation, be it parliamentary or in the form of a referendum, will ratify and confirm policies that are in fact already being implemented.
By using the choice between Europe and chaos, itself a low form of extortion, and designed to force the hand of sovereign peoples, this Constitutionâs supporters flout the basic rules of democracy.
We will not fall into the trap that this Europe represents, and we intend to denounce it at the forthcoming referendum in France.
We can have another Europe â the Europe of free peoples and sovereign nations.
Â Â  .Â Â Â The report under discussion recommends that the EU Member States ratify the European Constitution.
I had no hesitation in voting against this report, for a number of reasons.
It is out of place for the European Parliament to recommend that the Member States ratify or reject the Treaty, as final decisions on this matter and completion of the ratification process fall under the exclusive jurisdiction of the sovereign national authorities designated for this purpose.
How one views this so-called European Constitution is an entirely separate issue.
In my opinion, ratification of this Constitution would not further either Polandâs or Europeâs interests.
I have repeatedly noted how inappropriate it is for there to be no reference to God or the Christian tradition in the preamble to the Treaty.
The lack of any such reference means that the truth about our continentâs history is blatantly ignored.
A further point of contention is the revision of the Treaty of Nice, which has not even been given the chance to prove itself in practice.
The provisions of this Treaty on weighted voting within the European Council, which would have been to Polandâs benefit, have been watered down by the Constitutional Treaty, without their influence on the functioning of the Communities having been assessed in any way.
Furthermore, I have concerns regarding a number of other provisions in the so-called European Constitution, for example increasing the unjust privileges granted to the eastern of the Federal Republic of Germany under previous treaties.
Â Â  . While the European Parliament has not yet pronounced upon the draft Constitution, a festive party is already being thrown at the cost of EUR 375Â 000 to celebrate its approval, thereby illustrating yet again that the two prejudices about Europe â those being that it is undemocratic and wastes money â are wholly justified.
My group is opposed to this Constitution for a number of reasons.
We denounce the neo-Liberal and socio-economic component in it which, under the guise of âfree tradeâ undermines public services and denies national and local authorities the right to determine for themselves how they want to organise their public services.
We are strongly opposed to the militarisation of Europe that is apparent in the Constitution, including in the paragraph obliging Member States to increase their defence budgets.
We reject this Constitution, because it reinforces the Unionâs undemocratic structure and does not do a great deal to improve it.
Some of my fellow Members may be prepared to sell their souls to neo-Liberalism for a handful of extra parliamentary means of power, I do not intend to do so.
Where democracy is concerned, only the best is good enough, and I therefore refuse to support this Constitution, which is for the benefit of the European elite, the multinationals, warmongers and bureaucrats.
Â Â  .â The Constitutional Treaty or so-called Euro-constitution codifies the previous treaties, strengthening the privileges and profits of big business and further developing the culture of the arming and militarisation of Europe.
These are measures to arm the plutocracy, which will exacerbate social and class antagonisms and bring new trials and tribulations to the people.
That is why the peoples of Europe should throw out the 'Euro-constitution' and step up their fight against the reactionary policy of the ÎU.
The guilt of the EU is also clear from the unilateral misleading propaganda and misinformation on which it is spending huge amounts in a bid to gain the vote and assent of the workers, while at the same time using its guidelines to impose cuts in wages, pensions and unemployment benefits.
The presence in Parliament's motion of the highly reactionary Article 43 adopting the US doctrine of preventive war as civil protection from terrorist attack constitutes provocation.
It is the pretext for big business to terrorise the peoples and plunder the wealth they produce.
We MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece shall vote against the so-called Euro-constitution and against any variation on it.
There can be no progressive 'Euro-constitution' in the EU of big business and war and anyone cultivating such delusions is not helping to develop the fight against its exploitative policies and agencies.
Â Â  . Although there is, both in the Member States and in this House, general approval for this text, there is also a critical public that regards it with concern.
In criticising it, we are not arguing from the restricted vantage point of the nation state.
What we criticise is that the treaty aims to further militarise the European Union to the point of enabling it to wage war on a global scale.
It is intended to secure âoperational capacity drawing on military assetsâ.
The Constitution requires rearmament, in that âthe Member States are obliged to progressively improve their military capacitiesâ, a process to be supervised by an âagency in the field of defence capabilities development, research, acquisition and armamentsâ, which will also implement âappropriate measures to strengthen the industrial and technological basis of the defence sectorâ.
We are also critical of the way in which the principles of neo-liberalism are to be enshrined in the Constitution.
The general âObjectives of the Unionâ do admittedly gloss over matters by talking in terms of âa highly competitive social market economy, aiming at full employment and social progress, and a high level of protection and improvement of the quality of the environment, but the part that actually deals with policy then speaks in plain language of a commitment to the âprinciple of an open market economy with free competitionâ.
Far from reflecting this view, the draft report takes a completely uncritical view of the draft Constitution.
The Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left cannot, therefore, endorse it.
Â Â  . I should like to congratulate Mr Corbett and Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo on their excellent report on the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe.
I should like to take this opportunity to highlight the important consolidation of the status of the outermost regions, which falls within the scope of the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe.
Consequently, the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe guarantees the exceptional nature of the status of the outermost regions, in other words, their horizontal/transversal dimension and the derogatory nature and the adequacy of the legal basis in the adoption of all measures specifically geared towards the outermost regions.
I was also very pleased to see that the Intergovernmental Conference included reference to European law and framework law between legislative instruments enabling the adoption of measures to support the outermost regions.
Â Â  .
I welcome this report by my good friends Richard Corbett and ÃÃ±igo MÃ©ndez de Vigo and their call for the Constitution to be adopted and ratified by all Member States.
The Constitution will improve the transparency, effectiveness and efficiency of the Union.
In my own field of trade it will improve significantly the role of the European Parliament and therefore bring greater clarity and democratic scrutiny to a vital area where the EU has exclusive competence.
This should enable NGOs, trade unions, commercial organisations and others to follow in more detail and to influence the negotiations leading to international agreements.
Â Â  . Today, the advocates of the Constitution are celebrating.
The European Parliament cannot amend the documentâs wording, any more than can national parliaments or the voters who will take part in the national referendums.
We can only approve or reject it, and celebrate or mourn that choice accordingly.
That makes it impossible to scrap the requirement for re-armament and for solidarity with NATO.
It is equally impossible to make the free unhindered competition that the text glorifies subordinate to the environment, the provision of public services or the protection of labour.
It is no longer possible to actually reward the collection of a million signatures of citizens, prescribed in ArticleÂ 46, with a referendum.
New social basic rights are lacking.
The EUâs traditional authoritarian administrative model, boasting a strong role for the Council and the presidency, without any adequate means of correcting it by way of parliamentary democracy, is not up for discussion either.
I do not want this Constitution.
I do not want to be part of todayâs festivities.
In the Netherlands in the next couple of months, I shall be involved in the campaign of my party, the Socialist Party, to persuade a majority of voters to reject this flawed text.
Â Â  . The Constitutional Treaty is a compromise text that should be assessed for what it actually contains and not for what some â on both the federalist and the euro-sceptic sides â would like it to contain.
In view of the fact that in a globalised world Portugal has everything to gain from belonging to a regional bloc with the characteristics of the EU, there are aspects of this text, as in any compromise text, with which I agree and others with which I am not satisfied.
On the positive side, I should like to highlight the simplification that the unification of the Treaties has achieved, the clearer distinction between national and European powers, the strengthening of the role of national parliaments and the guarantee that the Union only has at its disposal the powers attributed to it by the Member States.
Furthermore, the fact that this Treaty represents a moment of stabilisation in the process of revising the Treaties brings security and stability.
I do not agree, however, with the absence in the preamble of any reference to Europeâs Judeo-Christian heritage, the end of the rotating presidency among the Member States, the eventual reduction in the number of Commissioners and the creation of the potentially contentious post of European Minster of Foreign Affairs.
On balance, I have decided to vote in favour.
Â Â  . I have often criticised the break with the EUâs best practice, the source of its success: the âsmall steps policyâ of Schuman and the founding Member States, which is increasingly being trampled underfoot by a ferocious desire to stride forward, regardless of the feelings of the people.
I should prefer to go down the European road of genuine unity in diversity, characterised by respect for the national democracies from which that road emerges, than to contribute towards the sham of a proto-continental State which few want to see, which the people did not ask for and which nobody has any real affection for.
I have no qualms about applauding the broad outlook of a European constitutional text.
Yet once the people have been consulted, let us draw it up using fully democratic, participatory and representative processes, interacting with the public, in an assembly specifically elected for this purpose, as suggested at the Intergovernmental Conference.
I am always dismayed by the climate of concealment and manipulation, the lack of loyalty to the public, the fact that often one thing is said and then something different is done and the blatant way in which the rule of law has been brushed aside â a sure sign that âanything goesâ, so long as it goes in a particular direction.
A glaring indication of this is the pompous declaration that Parliament âadopts the Constitutional Treatyâ.
This does not fall within our competences and to say it does puts us in a legally dubious position.
I had hoped for better.
I voted against the resolution.
Â Â  . I do indeed endorse unreservedly the draft European Constitution, and it was with enthusiasm that I voted in favour of my colleaguesâ excellent report.
This draft is no doubt a compromise but it also represents a considerable advance.
The Union of 25 will be stabilised by having a President appointed for two and a half years instead of a presidency that rotates every six months.
A Minister of Foreign Affairs will be Europeâs voice in the world.
The Charter of Fundamental Rights has at last been incorporated into the institutional framework.
The citizens enjoy the right of petition (capable of being translated into European law with the support of over 1 million signatures), and, in the social sphere, for the first time, the Union sets itself targets for shared progress in a social market economy.
In short, the European Union is becoming more democratic, more transparent, clearer and more effective.
It may be, though, that the hardest task awaits us yet: to complete ratification in all our Member States, and hence to explain it in such a way as to persuade Europeâs citizens.
I am also delighted that, in this nervous time for Europe, a recent survey reveals that the Belgian public are ready to go into battle for a âyesâ to the Constitutional Treaty; 80% of them are in favour of it!
Â Â  . It is a rare occurrence in anyoneâs lifetime to gain the impression of living through an historic moment, and this Constitutional Treaty, I believe, sees us participating in writing a page setting out the Europe that we want.
This text sees us continuing the work of the founding fathers who wanted this Europe of 25 States â soon to be more â and dreamed of it.
This Constitutional Treaty makes of Europeâs humanist, spiritual and social heritage a foundation for the governance of our daily lives.
The Charter of Fundamental Rights acquires legal force and becomes binding on citizens.
Rules are made simpler, and increasingly resemble those with which we are familiar in our 25 democracies.
The Union will have a greater political role in the world, will at last be able to carry weight, and, I hope, will exert greater influence in the comity of nations in spreading abroad the ideal of peace which presided over its birth.
I voted in favour of the Corbett report, and will, in my own country, participate in the campaign in favour of the ratification of the text in a referendum.
The train of history is pulling out of the station; let us take it together.
Â Â  . The adoption of the Constitutional Treaty by this House is an historic moment given the role played by Parliament throughout the process.
As a Member of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I voted in favour, because I firmly believe that this represents a step forward towards consolidating the European social policy.
The citizensâ social rights emerge clearly strengthened due to the fact that the EUâs Charter of Fundamental Rights has been incorporated into the Constitution â recognition of the publicâs place at the heart of the European project.
Economic and social cohesion has been reaffirmed as a key objective of the EU.
New norms have been introduced as regards a high level of employment, the fight against social exclusion and discrimination, the promotion of social justice, social protection, equality between men and women and a high level of education and health, the promotion of sustainable development and respect for services of general interest.
The EUâs role on the international stage has also been strengthened, in the fight to eradicate poverty and in the promotion of sustainable development and fair trade.
Furthermore, new provisions will facilitate the participation of the citizens, social partners and representatives of civil society in EU discussions.
Following over half a century of European integration and numerous Treaties, the European Constitution is the one that brings by far the most visible and most practical benefits to the citizens of Europe.
Â Â  . The Corbett/MÃ©ndez de Vigo report does not give fair consideration to the pros and cons of the present Treaty, and can thus be classified as 'pure propaganda'.
It fails to mention that too many areas of policy are still left to intergovernmental cooperation and that important areas are still subject to veto.
The role of the constitutional regions in the European decision-making process remains precarious.
Part III of the Treaty makes it clear that the Union lacks social order and confirms choices in favour of the neo-Liberal model.
The European Union is still too little in the way of a security union and is at risk of emphasising the deployment of military means in favour of conflict prevention.
Since these observations are not included in the report, I have voted against it.
That does not prevent me from campaigning in the next few months with in favour of ratification of the Treaty in the federal, Flemish and Brussels parliaments.
After all, the Constitution is an enormous step forward and in the event of non-ratification, we will fall back on the provisions of the Treaty of Nice, which are less efficient, transparent and democratic than the present Treaty establishing a European Constitution.
Â Â  . Mr President, it was with much conviction that I voted in favour of the resolution, and hence of the Constitutional Treaty.
I join with a large majority of the European Parliament in supporting the argument that we need to prompt the citizens of Europe, along with national and regional parliaments, into assuming a positive attitude.
I, too, take a critical view of the untruths that are being spread about this Constitutional Treaty.
The text, which is now to be ratified democratically, contains only steps in the right direction: it offers more scope in order to commit to those areas of policy in an open, transparent, democratic and effective manner where the Union can, and should, add value for the benefit of the public.
It deserves all our support.
Â Â  . We opposed the report by Richard Corbett and ÃÃ±igo MÃ©ndez de Vigo because we do not support the adoption of the European Constitution.
The Constitution would essentially transfer decision-making power from the Member States to the European Union.
The focus of the exercise of power within the framework of the Union would move from intergovernmental cooperation to a supranational level.
A new treaty should be negotiated for the European Union, which should serve as a basis for its development as a federation of independent states.
Â Â  .The new Europe means survival because it rejects all forms of totalitarianism.
We paid with our blood for our commitment to the European ideal of achieving freedom of thought, religion and conscience.
European integration, the way the 25 EU Member States function together and making the Community procedures work better must be improved and must progress, with care, little by little.
Asking simple questions about this âConstitutionâ should not lead to accusation of being anti democratic; Understandable and credible answers are still needed.
Under this Constitution, the uncontrolled European Court of Justice will apply judgements directly and unequivocally to all Community institutions and bodies and the Member States.
No constitutional lawyer has been able to show me where it is guaranteed that the Court will not infringe the various national competencies and policies.
Even if Parliamentâs elected majority or the composition in the Council of Ministers changes, how can the EU major political orientation be changed when set out in a constitutional document requesting a double unanimity?
Finally, in refusing Christian heritage, the cultural short-sightedness of this Constitution is a worrying form of revisionism.
Granted, the Treaty of Nice did not contain any reference to Europeâs Christian heritage; but it did not claim to be a Constitution either.
Â Â  Mr President, I have a serious complaint: about 15 minutes ago a peaceful protest was about to take place against the Constitution â a banner was to be unfurled.
Two researchers belonging to the Independence and Democracy Group were physically assaulted â one was kicked and punched.
The security staff who I believe were involved include Mr Zylka and Mr Dekhudt.
I ask you to conduct a serious and immediate investigation into what happened.
We have had a one-sided debate here about the Constitution.
An enormous amount of money has been spent; banners are being unfurled for the 'yes' side, but the 'no' side is not allowed a say; and when a peaceful process takes place, people are physically assaulted.
This is totally contrary to the purportedly democratic principles of this institution.
I ask you to undertake an immediate investigation.
You will receive a complaint in writing.
Â Â  All that will be forwarded to the relevant office of the House.
That completes the explanations of votes.
Â Â  Mr President, if the sitting is supposed to resume at 3 p.m. then would it not be a good idea to start at 3 p.m. and not have lunch until all hours of the afternoon?
However, there are more serious points which we should perhaps draw to your attention.
You will be aware that your employees assaulted two of our employees â that is, employees of the United Kingdom Independence Party â this morning, causing bodily injury.
I would like to ask whether this happened as a result of your instructions and whether or not you are prepared to take responsibility for this?
I appreciate that you are not the President of Parliament, who has always proved partial.
At Westminster, the Speaker's job is to protect the rights of backbenchers.
All that the President of this Parliament â who is totally inexperienced â seems to do is to want to preserve the status quo.
This morning he has really blotted his copy book because, last month, he permitted all the signs saying 'Yes to Turkey' to remain up in this Chamber for a considerable period of time.
He set a precedent then, so why were we not permitted this very day to hold up signs saying 'Say no'?
Â Â  You made your point.
Your question will be answered in due time.
It is not a point of order.
You have made your point and you will get your answer.
Thank you.
I understand that there are no objections as far as the Minutes are concerned.
I am sorry, Mr Knapman, I will not give you the floor.
It is not a point of order.
You will get your explanation in due time.
We can assume that the Minutes are approved.
Â Â  Mr President, the gentleman, his colleagues and his staff should be cleaning up the 'No to Europe' literature and mess that is strewn around the grounds of this Parliament.
It is spread all over the place!
Perhaps he could clean up the litter.
Â Â  The matter is closed.
Let us proceed with the sitting.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to know who is responsible for security staff outside the Chamber.
I cannot find anything about this in the Rules.
Who authorised the security staff to interfere with free and peaceful expressions of political opinion outside this House, and on what authority was this done, having regard to the Rules of Procedure or any other relevant authority?
Secondly, why was violence used against women, and thirdly, what steps will the President take to bring to account those responsible?
This follows on from my previous complaint to the President, Mr Borrell Fontelles, asking for this matter to be investigated.
Â Â  As I told the previous speakers, you will get your answer in due course.
Â Â  Mr President, please would you look at Rule 166 and tell me whether you have applied this Rule in response to the points of order, following your decision to tell your staff to assault ours, causing them bodily injury.
The Rule stipulates that 'A Member may be allowed to speak to draw the attention of the President to any failure to respect Parliament's Rules of Procedure'.
We have done that.
'A request to raise a point of order shall take precedence over all other requests to speak'.
We have done that â at least, for once, you got something right!
Paragraph 4 states that 'The President shall take an immediate decision on points of order'.
We ask â although I know you are not important in the pecking order â to take a decision on these very important points of order; probably the most important points of order you will ever get in your life!
Â Â  I am sorry, but you have already had the floor.
You have now spoken for the second time.
You may find it unsatisfactory, but that was my answer.
Â Â  Mr President, Rule 166 states very clearly that you are required to give us a response to complaints such as those already made by my colleagues, Mr Batten and Mr Knapman, concerning violence used against our members of staff by your members of staff.
What steps are you taking or proposing to take to hold to account those who have used violence apparently in your name?
We want to know what steps you are going to take or have already taken â it says so in Rule 166 â and we need that answer now, not tomorrow.
Â Â  As I said, you will be given an answer in due course, not at this moment.
I consider the whole issue closed.
There will be no more points of order.
Â Â  We shall now resume the debate on the Council and Commission statements on EU aid for tsunami victims in Asia.
Â Â  Â Â Â ... practices in this House if representatives from all groups â even the smallest group, that of Non-attached Members â are not given the floor before a vote.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the citizens of the EU Member States do not expect us to talk in soundbites, but to be honest.
The simple truth about the political context of this disaster should finally be told.
Local political interests are being played out in the shadow of the terrible tsunami tragedy.
The UNâs crumbling authority is to be revived thanks to its aid measures in Asia.
The USA and certain European countries wish to improve their image in this part of Asia and extend their influence over the continent by means of humanitarian measures.
The victims of the disaster are being helped to some extent along the way, but it is abundantly clear that huge advantages are being gained from the whole affair.
I would like to believe that the European Unionâs charitable measures will serve aid-related purposes alone, and that we will not, as the EU, prey on human misfortune and promote our own narrow interests in the aftermath of such a major tragedy.
The aid we provide should be rapid and based on solidarity, and it should not be held up by a bureaucratic obstacle course.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want to start by saying that I agree with all the expressions of sympathy in response to the calamity in South-East Asia.
Having said that, I will now concentrate on making a few rather sobering comments.
The donations made by people in the European Union and throughout the world are a truly overpowering demonstration of goodwill.
The evidence of how the whole of the globalised world has been touched by this terrible event also makes a deep impression.
In Germany, though, we have a proverb to the effect that âgood intentions do not always do any goodâ.
We need to learn how to help.
The banner headline on todayâs issue of one of the major German newspapers is âMany disorganised aid workers make Indonesiaâs work difficultâ.
It also has to be said that the way in which the European Union has gone about things there is hardly likely to call forth rapturous enthusiasm about the success of the work it does.
Let me also quote this: âIf it were not for the American and Australian armies, who are all over the place, flying their cargo planes back and forth on a regular basis, then things would be far worse still.â
There is a problem here.
It is quite obvious that what we need is not just goodwill and the willingness to come up with plenty of money; we also need an organisation that can get this money, in a proper way, to the people who need it.
Let me therefore endorse what has already been said this morning: above all else, the European Union needs a crisis management unit, in other words, something with transport capacity, leadership and communications resources, and units to provide sanitation and supplies; that is what is needed if we want to help in a really practical way and very quickly.
Until such time as the European Union has an army of its own that can deal with that sort of thing, we do in fact also need â however much goodwill is there â practical ways of delivering help, and a crisis management unit would be the very thing.
That is what the EU must concentrate on.
Â Â  Mr President, may I start by apologising for the behaviour of some of my compatriots.
I am very embarrassed that they are behaving in this way and interrupting when we are having a very serious debate about such tragic matters.
If we may continue â 26 December 2004 was not the same last year, nor will it ever be again.
Disbelief turned into incomprehension, to grief, to sympathy; a plethora of emotions as we watched the tsunami tragedy unfold.
The waves and quakes were a pervasive example of how our fates are shared with one another in a global theatre of environmental and natural risk.
As President of the South Asia Delegation, I would like to give my sincere condolences to all those affected by this tragedy.
I have been very moved by the heartfelt global response to this unprecedented disaster.
In the face of the tsunami, European citizens have been amongst the most generous.
Last week, I travelled to Chennai in South India to see at first hand the relief work by the European Commission and met with officials from UNDP, Unicef and NGOs.
The EU's immediate response within 24 hours was highly commendable, as was the selfless Indian decision to ask that this aid should go to the worst affected areas, such as Sri Lanka and Indonesia.
Therefore, I hope that the rumours of current funding to India being diverted to other areas are not true.
Having seen the needs in India for myself, I hope they will not be ignored in the short term.
I would demand that the Commission does not redeploy or reprogramme funds from any existing aid projects within this region.
It would be criminal to take from the world's poorest to fund this tragedy.
I welcome the Commission's promise of an extra EURÂ 350 million, but I was not convinced by President Barroso's explanation this morning, because for years humanitarian aid budgets for Asia have been in decline, from 70% in 1990 to 38% in 2000.
Therefore, it is not acceptable that we divert money away from poverty eradication programmes; we should be adding more money.
We need to approach this tragedy differently from any other and explore the use of new specialist teams in those countries.
It is not just money that is needed: we also need to give technical expertise.
I would ask the Commission to look at enduring changes.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, in view of the instruments currently at its disposal, I think the Commission reacted appropriately.
There is, however, one aspect of the South-East Asian situation about which I feel there is considerable reticence on the part of all politicians, at least in their public speeches.
I refer to the political troubles in many of these countries: from Sri Lanka to southern Thailand or Indonesia, particularly in the area of Banda Aceh.
It is a question of intervening in areas where armed independence movements have been present and active for a long time.
These are areas of very violent guerrilla warfare, where there is also infiltration by Islamic groups linked to Al Qaida or the Al-Gamaâa al-Islamiyya organisation.
Such elements make the whole reconstruction effort highly problematic, yet I have heard very little said about them, especially in public speeches.
I am convinced that real, effective reconstruction is impossible without resolving the political problems: genuine political reconstruction needs to be set in motion throughout the region, to renew the currently stalled peace processes and also to strengthen the institutions and the rule of law, without which the forces of instability are likely to come to a head.
This is a great opportunity.
If it is well used, the whole reconstruction programme can provide the leverage needed to restart the peace processes, but if not â if intervention is badly managed â it may make the already obvious tensions explode.
In this context, I believe the European Union should address the problem of its political presence during the reconstruction process, because at the moment it is not visible and it will be even less visible later.
For instance, I find it disconcerting that the first meeting between the government in Jakarta and guerrillas of the Free Aceh Movement (GAM) took place in the presence of the United States, the United Kingdom, Sweden, Japan, Singapore and Libya, while the European Union was clearly absent from the negotiating table.
These are matters which, if ignored, will prevent you from properly managing the reconstruction process, which will be long and difficult but also potentially very worthwhile.
Â Â  MrÂ President, when the tsunami came, rich and poor alike were affected.
Everyone ran for their lives, and it was the children who were hit hardest.
The nightmare of not being able to protect their children befell thousands of people.
We now all have a responsibility to give them our support and listen to their needs.
I call upon you to send our heartfelt thanks to the people of Thailand and other affected countries who fulfilled our ideals of compassion, humanity and solidarity.
Unselfishly and without discrimination, they helped all the victims, irrespective of their culture or religion or the colour of their skin.
In particular, many of my own fellow countrymen received considerable support, a fact which shows that these concepts are universal rather than specifically Christian or European.
We can begin to fulfil the same ideals by giving substantial aid to the countries affected, introducing fair trade, combating poverty and hunger and allowing our emergency services to help each other more effectively.
Â Â  â Mr President, the impressive mobilisation of global and European public opinion is inciting both governments and the European Union to act more effectively by strengthening international cooperation under the aegis of the UN.
I should like to comment on four points: the first and most important at the present moment is to ensure that promises are kept and will not remain dead letter as on other occasions; in other words, that aid will reach the citizens who need it quickly and efficiently, without being squandered or stolen by corrupt intermediate links.
The role of the UN is crucial here.
Secondly, the European Parliament needs to ask creditor countries to write off the debts of the countries hit and not simply defer payment of a number of instalments.
The announcement by the seven richest nations that they were simply deferring payment for the benefit of the countries hit would appear to be hypocritical in the light of the United States' insistence that the debt of Iraq, a country over which it exercises military control, be written off.
Thirdly, I propose that the European Parliament support the proposal formulated at the United Nations back in September 2004, and already supported by about 100 countries, on a global tax on capital transactions, arms sales and the consumption of non-renewable energy, in order to finance emergencies from natural disasters.
Fourthly, we need to strengthen the European civil protection programme more generously with resources and mechanisms.
The relevant report, which I presented a month ago and which was approved by the European Parliament by an overwhelming majority, needs to be strengthened more generously over coming years.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, how many days went by before European Union intervention arrived in the countries hit by the tidal wave, even though it was known right from the very first hours after the disaster that the tsunami had affected thousands of tourists of European origin?
It may have been true that all the EU officials were on holiday, but not a sign of an official from the European Union was seen for days and days in those countries, for instance in Thailand.
Their absence allowed people to be buried in mass graves, making it difficult, if not impossible, to identify the bodies of the missing Europeans.
You are not giving any information on this, but I should like to know how many people were sent where and after how long a delay, because, I repeat, in many of those countries there is no record of their presence.
