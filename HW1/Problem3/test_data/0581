Northern Ireland was lucky enough to enjoy the decisive support of US Senator Mitchell, which led to the Good Friday agreements and a genuine peace process, despite the ups and downs that it is suffering along the way.
How long will we Basques have to wait for Europe to realise that peace is in its hands, that it must stimulate, promote and oversee a sincere and democratic dialogue between the opposing sides?
That would be the best recipe the European Parliament could recommend against terrorism and in order to achieve peace.
I particularly value Recital O of the report, which makes it very clear that democratic dialogue based on mutual respect and non-violence is the best means of resolving conflicts, thereby rectifying previous resolutions by this very European Parliament.
What I regret is that the attempt to reflect this same idea in the final recommendations has failed.
I must, therefore, consider this document to be incomplete and insufficient.
However, despite this insufficiency and having reflected on it, I am going to vote in favour of the Watson report in order to give an opportunity to Recital O, that is to say, to democratic dialogue as a means for resolving our conflict.
Mr President, it has been a very happy coincidence for the sake of democracy to have had the previous debate on the Echelon network.
The hypocritical position of the Member States on the violation of citizens' rights that has been underlined by various speakers can help us in our analysis of the report on terrorism.
The report, very regrettably, ignores state terrorism.
But what is even more regrettable is the fact that there are no specific recommendations to foster measures that could implement political dialogue for resolution of conflicts.
Despite that, this House will most probably accept this report.
Then it will be for you, Commissioner Vitorino, to propose a text that you have already negotiated, mainly with the Spanish and French authorities.
On Monday I mentioned the victims of the Spanish dirty war.
Let me now recall the memory of the journalist, Fernando Pereira.
As you know, he was killed by the action of the French secret service against Greenpeace.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if we succeed in adopting these recommendations to the Council by a large majority here in the European Parliament, we shall not only have sent out a signal; we shall also have taken absolutely decisive action against the cynical, murderous and anti-democratic terrorism that has been rearing its ugly head most conspicuously in Spain but in other European countries too.
The aims of this package which Mr Watson has proposed, range from harmonisation of laws and regulations to improvement of judicial assistance, from the creation of a European search and arrest warrant to provision for the compensation of victims, and the Member States of the European Union should not only use it to combat the familiar forms of terrorism but should also apply it against the new forms of terror to which we were introduced at the last summit meeting and which I fear will resurface at similar events in the future.
The debate on these new forms of terrorism has left a lot to be desired.
There has been no discussion about the safety of the innocent people who have been exposed to acts of violence, nor has there been any discussion about protecting property from destruction by violent activists and those who are incited to violence, about the police officers who have been seriously wounded or about either the compensation of victims or international police cooperation.
Too little has also been said about the background, about the sources from which these terrorists draw their support and their funding and about the political orchestrators of terrorist activities.
It has been a diluted discussion.
This terrorism that is threatening to sprout up again here, however, is increasingly international and global in character; its perpetrators are not truly engaged in the globalisation debate that needs to be pursued but are merely using the debate as a vehicle for acts of terror against governments, against state institutions - in short, against our democratic system.
I therefore expect us to confront terrorism in both its old and new forms with the utmost vigour for the sake of the people, the security and the stability of our countries, to press our case uncompromisingly within the European Union, being ever mindful of those who have already fallen victim to this terrorism.
I ask you all to give your overwhelming support to this excellently prepared package of measures, not only for the sake of Spain but also in the interests of Europe, its stability and the security of its people.
Mr President, I am sure we all agree that terrorism is one of the most critical challenges our society has to face.
It is a global phenomenon, with cells operating throughout the world.
It can therefore only be effectively combated internationally.
Fighting terrorism also means defending human rights and democracy.
The cowardly terrorist attacks and murders we have seen recently, which have been at their most virulent in Spain, testify to the need to intensify European anti-terrorist cooperation.
International terrorism, which draws support from many a dictator or Islamic fundamentalist regime, cannot be effectively combated in the European Union unless the competent national authorities cooperate with each other.
Our House also bears responsibility in this respect; to exercise this responsibility, we must nail our colours to the mast by adopting this report on the role of the Union in combating terrorism and making it clear that we are unanimously committed to the fight against terrorist activity.
I wish to thank the rapporteur for his outstanding work towards this goal.
Our proposals are intended to create the conditions for effective European cooperation among the Member States in order to put an end to the murders committed by terrorist organisations such as ETA in Spain.
Mr President, terrorism is the destruction of democracy.
There can be no successful dialogue with criminal terrorism for it is a lie incarnate.
Releasing terrorist prisoners and seeking to buy them off with places in rigged government is exalting terrorism and not eliminating it.
Northern Ireland is an example, with all terrorist prisoners from both sides released while not one murder weapon has been decommissioned by either side.
The tormented victims of brutal terrorism are largely forgotten.
I welcome this report' s action call on this issue to look after the interests of these tormented victims and its emphasis on the immediate need to ensure that there is no sanctuary for terrorism in this European Union.
Action on that is imperative.
Mr President, this report is of the utmost importance to the citizens of Europe.
This report should receive the widest possible dissemination throughout the Community.
It is a complex and difficult report that should impact clearly on each and every citizen, so that they can understand precisely what Parliament is trying to accomplish on their behalf.
It does credit to the Chairman of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, Mr Watson.
We will be voting in favour but, nonetheless, we will do so with reservations on many of the paragraphs and recommendations.
No doubt we will revisit the subject after consultation with our national parliaments and citizens' groups.
We must define exactly and precisely what we mean by terrorism.
We must not confuse terrorism with peaceful protests, with legal and lawful protests by the citizen.
There are a number of paragraphs that we have reservations about but, despite these reservations which we will probably revisit in subsequent discussions and debates on the issue, we will be voting in favour of this.
I congratulate Mr Watson and all concerned in putting together this report.
Mr President, Mr Watson' s report confirms that the European Union is powerless and has painted itself into a corner in its fight against the ever-increasing phenomenon of terrorism.
It is powerless both because terrorism has changed shape and is now backed up by modern technology and funds and because there is little judicial and police collaboration on the part of the Member States and no common legislative framework.
In Greece, a new anti-terrorism law was passed in May 2001 in a bid to systemise and up the ante in the fight against terrorism without violating fundamental rights and the principles of the rule of law.
However, combating terrorism, be it in Greece or Spain, is a matter for the European Union as a whole.
The Charter of Fundamental Rights should be used as a reference point for any new initiative.
In other words, under no circumstances should increased criminal activities by terrorist groups be used as an alibi, be it at national or European level, for taking measures which are incompatible with the rule of law and democratic principles.
However, in the case of terrorist offences, the Council should immediately abolish formal extradition procedures and adopt the principle of mutual recognition of decisions on criminal matters, including pre-judgment decisions, as proposed in the report.
In addition to these measures, it also makes a great deal of sense to prevent terrorism through education, social and other policies to encourage citizens, especially young people, to value dialogue and reject all forms of violence.
Mr President, may I first of all take the opportunity to congratulate Mr Watson on the preparation of this report.
It is a very balanced and very good report.
Terrorism has been a major problem in the Western world and in Europe it has been prevalent certainly since the Second World War.
It has been proved that a dedicated few can hold a majority to ransom.
We have to face up to the fact that there has not been full cooperation between Member States.
We in Northern Ireland have experienced that very painfully over the past 30 years.
If terrorists have a safe haven they will continue to flourish because they have somewhere to retreat to.
We must end safe havens.
I have some reservations, in that if you abolish extradition what you put in its place may not be effective.
If we do abolish extradition, whatever replaces it must work and must be seen to work, especially between Member States.
The Member States must be free to protect their citizens.
I believe it is the duty of every Member State government to protect the innocent, not the perpetrators of violence.
There must be maximum cooperation to achieve this.
We also see terrorist cooperation throughout the world.
The recent arrest of three IRA activists in Columbia brings home very clearly how widespread terrorism is throughout the world and how terrorists cooperate in the development of new and better weapons.
We also have to recognise that many terrorist organisations are involved in racketeering, drug smuggling and many other forms of normal criminal activity.
They use certain words and pseudonyms.
They threaten the communities in which they live.
We have to recognise the victims.
There must be mutual recognition.
No one has the right to murder in the attempt to achieve a political objective.
We must also remember it is easy to terrorise: I have experience of this.
But believe you me, it is much more difficult to build peace after the terrorism.
Mr President, terrorist acts are intended to weaken democracy and the fundamental values on which Europe is being built.
It is therefore necessary - and this is what we have understood - the strengthen the fight against terrorism and create mechanisms and initiatives which strengthen cooperation between the Member States, bearing in mind, furthermore, the intensification of terrorist actions within the European Union.
Also, the Member States must promote a commitment to rejecting any form of violence among their young people.
Of the four main recommendations in this report (the definition of the crime of terrorism and applicable penalties, removal of the formal extradition procedure, the application of the principle of mutual recognition of criminal judgments and the European search and arrest warrant), I wanted to specifically highlight the last one relating to compensation for the victims of terrorism which, perhaps, has been the one least mentioned by other Members.
In this respect, I wish to highlight the fact that this House already adopted, on 24 November 2000, a report for which I had the honour of being rapporteur, which determined, for the first time, the definition of victims and their role in the judicial process.
Lastly, I would like to stress that, if we are capable of implementing the recommendations of this report, we will have taken a very significant step in developing the European area of freedom, security and justice.
Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking Mr Watson for his work, laying out the role the European Union must play in the fight against terrorism.
I would also like to thank the President of Parliament, Nicole Fontaine, for her personal attitude on opening this sitting in greeting the family of a victim of terrorism, the Councillor from the Union of the Navarrese People, JosÃ© Javier MÃºgica, whose widow and three children were present in the Chamber and who have asked me to pass on their thanks to the whole House and to its President.
This Parliament has managed to become a torchbearer in the European fight against terrorism.
It was the first Chamber to produce a recommendation in writing that it was necessary to politically isolate political parties which do not condemn terrorism.
And it has been this Parliament which has managed to gather more than 400 signatures of Members of this House in a public commitment to combat the terrorism of ETA.
We are now discussing the Watson report, and in this regard I would like to stress the need for the Union to have a European search and arrest warrant which replaces the formal extradition procedure for terrorist crimes as soon as possible.
Because terrorism, and specifically the terrorism of ETA, affects all the citizens of Europe, not only the victims, but even Members of this House.
I regret that Mrs DÃŒhrkop is not present due to illness.
She could have told us of how ETA deprived her of her husband, Senator Casas.
My own wife and family have also been subject to three attacks, which cost the life of a policeman.
And other Members could also speak of their suffering.
Spain and other places in Europe suffer terrorism.
We are not going to indulge in theorising, because we are aware that, as the Watson report proposes, we have to oblige the Member States to finally reach an agreement, because terrorism represents the greatest violation of human rights suffered by the European people.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to stress the very practical, realistic and topical nature of this report.
Indeed, as well as violent terrorism, it talks about a less explosive, very widespread terrorism operating under cover of political groupings whose objective is clearly to fight against democratic systems.
Recitals E, F and G make this clear, stressing that terrorism is on the increase in almost all the European countries and that the nature of terrorism is changing radically, but that there are also, according to recital G, in particular, international networks enjoying strong - as the recital says - logistical and financial support.
Well then, that is precisely what happened in Genoa during the G8 period.
International terrorist organisations used the Black Blocks to exploit genuinely peaceful organisations, working under cover of groups purporting to be non-violent and their complicitous leaders, who were supported in turn by the parties of the Italian and European left, which even lent them the platform of the European Parliament yesterday to hurl frenzied abuse at the Italian government and against the values of democracy and respect for people' s ideals, values which Parliament supports and develops.
This too, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, is terrorism: it may be less potent but it is still effective.
Recital M and recommendation No 3 state this explicitly, and Amendment No 2, tabled by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, is also negative evidence of this for, if it were to be adopted, this amendment would have Parliament believe that where the democratic and Constitutional structure of a country is working properly there is no terrorism.
Well then, following this reasoning, we could cheerfully label Spain, Ireland and maybe even Italy as undemocratic countries with dysfunctional Constitutions, whereas their governments are the victims of terrorism, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, and cannot be held accountable for it.
This too is a form of terrorism.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to begin by congratulating Mr Watson on the excellent report he has presented us.
He is right to emphasise the need for effective, clear and rapid measures to prevent and combat all acts of terrorism whatever form they may take and whatever they may be trying to achieve.
We reject and condemn all terrorist acts, which are unacceptable because of the blind violence that characterises them and which mainly affect innocent citizens.
We know that terrorism is one of the most terrible challenges facing our societies.
Over the last ten years, the European Union has seen an increase in the number of violent and terrorist acts.
This increase demonstrates that traditional methods of judicial and police cooperation are inadequate, particularly if we take account of the fact that new forms of terrorism are continually arising, such as computer or environmental terrorism.
We also know that these acts increasingly stem from the activity of international organised networks, which manage to exploit the various legal loopholes and the diversity of national legislation.
It is deplorable that most Member States do not have specific legislation in this field. Only six Member States, including Portugal, have specific legislation and out of these six, only four, again including Portugal, have adopted a definition of the concept of terrorism in their legislation.
By adopting the principle of solidarity in the fight against terrorism, the Treaty of Amsterdam has opened up new possibilities for coordinated action by the European Union.
With the commitments given in Tampere, terrorism has become an integral part of the global approach to fighting crime.
The report we are now debating warrants our support, particularly because it advocates the approximation and harmonisation of the legislation of the fifteen Member States.
Mr President, being the penultimate speaker - Commissioner Vitorino has the honour of closing the debate - exempts me from expressing many considerations which have been expressed by previous speakers, and they have done so very well.
I am only going to make two points.
One of them is addressed to those Members who have said that what we are voting on today, this arrest warrant, replaces extradition; that is not the case at all; it accompanies extradition for certain crimes which are particularly odious, such as a terrorist crime, precisely so that the European Union may become more efficient.
And I am going to make my second point, Mr President.
I believe that if we look back to 1992 when this Parliament voted in favour of the Maastricht Treaty, we will see that there were considerable gaps in the issues of justice and internal affairs within the third pillar.
It was a great innovation that the European Union was going to deal with issues which had always been at the heart of the Member States.
Very little time has passed since then, practically seven years, since Maastricht entered into force, and nevertheless, what progress has been made!
Progress has not just been made in terms of European solidarity on a specific problem, the terrorism of ETA, which is extraordinarily important and which is of fundamental importance politically; but progress has also been made in the construction of Europe.
This is the way to move forward together in Europe and to deal with the real concerns of the citizens, as has been said here.
Therefore, as well as expressing gratitude for European solidarity, I would like to say that this Watson report - and I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, who has made great efforts - also represents a very important milestone on this journey which we, including all of us here in this European Parliament, are making together in the construction of Europe.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, underpinning the European Union and its Member States is the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, the guarantee of human dignity and the protection of individuals and institutions enshrined in the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights.
All of these rights can be breached by acts of terrorism.
In a completely democratic setting, such as we have in the Union and in its Member States, terrorist acts can never be justified, irrespective of where they are carried out or their aim.
Acts of terrorism must never be considered to be political crimes or as crimes connected with, or inspired by, political motives.
Terrorism must never be considered to be a way of solving a problem facing an individual or a group, regardless of its nature.
Over the last few years, Europe has seen an increase in terrorist activity within its borders, characterised by a profound change in the nature of the acts carried out.
The actual or potential impact of armed attacks has become increasingly destructive and lethal as a consequence of technological changes taking place in the arms and explosives sector.
New forms of terrorism are emerging as a result of the on-going and rapid development of information technologies, electronic databases and computer equipment.
Terrorists are able to exploit differences between the legal systems of various Member States and the difficulties in extraditing such people, especially when such an act is not covered by law in a given State.
This aspect illustrates, as has been said several times during the debate, the inadequacy of traditional forms of judicial and police cooperation in combating terrorism.
There is, therefore, a greater need today than ever before to adopt measures to fight terrorism by drafting legislative proposals designed to punish such acts.
The institutions of the European Union, in particular the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council, have continually condemned terrorism at a political level.
Unfortunately, we have been called upon unusually frequently to state this position as a result of the terrorist actions of ETA in Spain.
Our solidarity with the Spanish people and especially with the victims of terrorism in Spain is unequivocal and unceasing.
We must build on this solidarity with more effective actions.
This is why Article 29 of the Treaty of Amsterdam refers specifically to common action in three areas: closer cooperation between police forces, customs agencies and other competent authorities, including Europol, closer cooperation between Member States' judicial authorities and approximation, where necessary, of criminal law provisions.
Under Article 2 of the Europol Convention, terrorism falls within the competence of Europol.
Pursuant to Article 31(b) of the Treaty establishing the European Union and the Tampere conclusions, which states that formal extradition procedures between Member States will be abolished for individuals trying to escape justice, to be replaced by a simple transfer, the Commission has already announced its intention to present an initiative designed to abolish formal extradition procedures between Member States for certain types of crime and to create a 'European search and arrest warrant' . The purpose is to combat not only terrorism but also other heinous transnational crimes.
Similarly, the Commission intends to propose an approximation of criminal legislation on acts of terrorism, pursuant to Article 31(e) of the Treaty establishing European Union, not only covering traditional forms of terrorism, but also its newer incarnations.
Lastly, the act of directing, promoting, supporting or belonging to a terrorist organisation must also be subject to a common standard.
The Commission shares Parliament' s concerns with regard to protecting the victims of terrorism and intends to present, in the course of the current presidency, a Green Paper on compensating victims of crime in general and of terrorist crime in particular within the European Union.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in conclusion, the Commission agrees with the principles set out in the excellent report by Mr Watson, whom I wish to warmly congratulate, and with the guidelines contained in the draft recommendation that Parliament is considering today.
Following the work that we have been carrying out over the last few months, in close consultation with all Member States - and I must emphasise, with all Member States and not just with some - the Commission intends to propose to Parliament and to Council, in September, legislative initiatives on harmonising the definition of terrorism, on adopting the European search and arrest warrant and on replacing extradition procedures with rapid handover mechanisms for certain types of crime, including terrorism, thereby, I am sure, fully complying with the requests made in your draft recommendation.
Thank you, Commissioner Vitorino.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Madam President, as well as thanking the Commissioner for what he has just said, I would like to ask the presidency, in order to reinforce the gesture we have made by means of this debate, to allow us to vote on the Watson report first, not last, as is currently planned.
Mr BarÃ³n Crespo, given the applause, I think that the House fully agrees with this proposal and, since there are no objections, we shall begin voting with the vote on the Watson report.
Welcome
Madam President, I must insist on an issue which I have raised several times during these points of order.
Since the last part session in this Parliament, thirty people from Africa have died on Spanish beaches trying to find work in Europe.
During this same period, another 2 800 have been detained and I believe it is now time, Madam President, for this Parliament to deal with this very fundamental problem which should make us all ashamed and which requires this Parliament' s action.
VOTE
Madam President, Recital M evidently refers to the definition which the Council of Europe gives for the term 'terrorist act' .
In fact, reference to this definition is also made further down in that report.
I should like to ask whether the Dutch text of Recital M could be brought completely into line with this definition.
The Dutch text should read: "...en die leiden tot streven naar..." , and not only: "...die leiden..." , because there is no link between the violence and the pursuit at the moment, and it is clear that the Council of Europe did intend this link in the definition.
Of course, Mrs Maes, I can assure you that we take great care that all the language versions are in line, as it is very important to respect what is meant.

Before the vote on Amendment No 2 by the Group of the Greens
Madam President, I had to wait to see whether the amendment proposed by the Liberal Group was carried.
We are now looking at Amendment No 2, which relates to the BSE risk in the candidate countries.
This risk is only referred to in the report on Poland.
This is why I have tabled an amendment referring to the fact that this risk is also present in other countries, because the wording would otherwise have amounted to discrimination against Poland.
But I made a mistake: the amendment says 'in all other countries' , but it should read 'in other countries' .
There are different risk categories.
Subject to that alteration, I recommend that the House adopt this amendment so as not to discriminate against Poland.

Before the vote
Madam President, I should like to ask the House to approve an oral amendment to the Slovakia report, which reads as follows - in German:
'bedauert, dass es nicht gelungen ist, einen Kompromiss im Hinblick auf die Neugliederung der Verwaltungsbezirke zu erreichen, der auch die Zustimmung der Vertreter der ungarischen Minderheit finden konnte' [regrets that it was not possible to reach a compromise over the rearrangement of administrative districts which was also acceptable to the representatives of the Hungarian minority].
(NL) Madam President, I am making this suggestion in order for it to gain broad approval.
I have also discussed this matter with the rapporteur.
Mr Oostlander, is this amendment at the beginning of the report and could we vote on it now?
Does it duplicate any other amendment?
That depends on the Group of the Greens.
If they want to vote on their amendment first, then this amendment, which is a weaker version, could be voted on subsequently.
In that case, I shall consult Mr Wiersma.
. Madam President, given the formulation of the amendment and given our concerns about the on-going discussion in Slovakia on regional decentralisation, we can support this amendment, also in the context of the knowledge that negotiations and talks are going on about the competences of these provinces.
We all hope that the coalition government in Slovakia will find a solution to the overall package of regional decentralisation.
In that framework, as rapporteur, I support this amendment.
I hope my group will follow my lead.
Madam President, if I understood Mr Oostlander correctly, this relates to our Amendment No 3.
We are prepared to withdraw it, and the text would then be worded in accordance with Mr Oostlander' s oral formulation.
Fine. I think this proposal is perfectly acceptable.

Before the vote
Madam President, I want to clarify my remarks of yesterday on my report to avoid any misunderstanding on inter-country adoption by Spanish families of Romanian children in the last ten years.
I can say categorically that the vast majority of these cases have been processed fully and properly by the Spanish authorities and by the families in question.
Indeed I know that they have resulted in many happy outcomes, some of which are known to my Spanish colleagues here in Parliament.
I can add that the authorities in the European Union Member States have, of course, been acting with full propriety on this sensitive matter and that none have acted more rigorously than the Spanish authorities.
I am grateful to Spanish colleagues here for drawing this need for clarification to my attention and in particular to Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado and Mr Salafranca SÃ¡nchez-Neyra.
I look forward to continued fruitful cooperation with all of my Spanish colleagues in this Parliament in the future.

Before the vote on Amendment No 16 by the ELDR Group
Madam President, unlike Mr Wiersma, I will simply speak in Dutch.
A minor error has crept into the nominal list, namely Amendment No 16 of the Liberals is identical to Amendment No 9 of the Group of the Greens.
This is as we agreed. It therefore seems more practical to me if we combine the votes on these to avoid confusion.
There are no objections from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, so I shall put to the vote Amendment No 16, from the European Liberal, Democratic and Reformist Group and Amendment No 9, from the Group of the Greens. The rapporteur is also in favour of this.
Before the vote on Amendment No 5 by the Group of the Greens
Madam President, we would like to present an oral amendment to Amendment No 5. Instead of "triggered by unrest and acts of violence starting in the early sixties" , we wish to replace the words "triggered by" with the words "which followed" .
The intent of this oral amendment is just to clarify any misunderstanding that would justify the invasion by Turkey of Cyprus.
Are there any objections to taking into consideration the oral amendment?
Madam President, my group voted for the Watson report, which is an excellent and very comprehensive one.
But it proposes very radical changes which can potentially pose problems for some of the Member States, particularly those in the front line of terrorism.
Without a clear and mutually accepted definition of terrorism, states must be able to take whatever measures they deem appropriate to deal with these serious threats.
However, this does not preclude the Member States from identifying those areas where there are difficulties in cooperation between Member States and finding ways to improve such cooperation.
Effective measures need to be introduced to prevent the formation and activities of violent groups in Europe and collaboration between such groups.
I commend Mr Watson on his report.
Madam President, I voted against this report because it makes no mention of state terrorism.
I consider that the European Parliament has closed its eyes to the fact that state terrorism is operating with impunity and that the European Union is rejecting the basic principles that we are supposed to fight for.
. (EL) The positions taken in the Watson report on an initiative at EU level to combat terrorism seriously threaten to undermine grass-roots movements and democratic freedoms.
The aim of this initiative, so the rapporteur says, is to ensure that all the Member States adopt minimum legal rules relating to the constituent elements of criminal acts and to penalties in the field of terrorism.
The rapporteur considers beyond all doubt that the ÃU has achieved such a level of democratic operation that taking recourse to any method other than democratic dialogue or settling conflicts through the channels provided should be made a criminal offence.
He calls on the Member States to take effective measures to prevent "violent" groups from forming or a "support framework for terrorists" from being created and maintained.
It is clear, I think, from the above that the sole purpose of this whole diatribe is to terrorise and subjugate anyone and everyone who opposes the violent attack unleashed by the global capitalist system, especially now that the Socialist system has been overturned.
Using the pretext of justified opposition to the often suspicious motives behind personal terrorism, its purpose is to crush the new and successful mass uprising in Europe against the anti-grass roots policies and new imperialist order, as expressed at both national and European level (e.g. Nice, Gothenburg and, most importantly, Genoa), if possible as it arises.
The voices of European government officials equating demonstrators with criminals and terrorists are still ringing in our ears.
The aim now is to further strengthen and harmonise the criminal arsenal available to the Member States for dealing with terrorism.
It will not be long before demonstrations and any form of civil disobedience are banned and made criminal offences.
The unanimous decision taken recently by the EU Council of Justice and Internal Affairs, which met immediately after the demonstrations in Gothenburg and just before the demonstrations in Genoa, points in this direction.
Surely the abolition of the right to congregate and the violent suppression of the mass demonstrations in Gothenburg and Genoa are acts of terrorism?
Surely the two people killed by the Swedish and Italian state terrorists are the victims of terrorist action and deserve compensation?
The Belgian Presidency has already started intensive preparations to take even more violent action against "street terrorists" in the run up to the demonstrations being planned to coincide with the Laeken Summit.
Greece is one of the countries which recently pushed through special legislation supposedly designed to fight terrorism and organised crime.
This law, which was voted through by a couple of dozen MPs present in the house, constitutes a direct threat to the democratic freedoms which the Greek people have fought and died for; it abolishes fundamental rights and places civil and trade union action directly in the line of fire of government high-handedness.
A broad spectrum of high-profile democrats, trades union and other social organisations has rallied against it.
It is for these reasons that the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the report.
Madam President, I would especially like to thank you for your kindness in inviting the Members present to listen to my 17 - which are actually 16 - explanations of vote, apart from anything else because an anti-Fatuzzo amendment has been tabled in the document amending the Rules of Procedure, which seeks to limit the number of oral explanations of vote delivered during voting time to a maximum of three.
I am therefore very pleased to accept your invitation to the Members to listen to Mr Fatuzzo' s explanations of vote, the first of which today concerns the Watson report on the role of the European Union in combating terrorism.
The Pensioners' Party, in the person of myself, voted for the motion. It recommends that, in order to genuinely combat terrorism, absolute silence of the press and television in matters of terrorism should be established.
The terrorists want their crimes to be publicised and the media must refuse to satisfy them.
Directives must be adopted which lay down absolute silence of the press and television where terrorist acts are concerned.
The Ruffolo motion for a resolution on cultural cooperation in the European Union contains numerous positive proposals and proposed amendments to the original Commission proposal, such as:
earmarking 1% of the gross budget for artistic and cultural works
an annual Commission report on the European Union' s cultural policy
the three-year cultural cooperation plan
setting up a European observatory for cultural cooperation
converging VAT.
I should like to take this opportunity to point out that one of the main outstanding obstacles to cultural cooperation between the Fifteen is the fact that the Parthenon marbles have been appropriated by the British Museum.
The European Parliament supported the return of the marbles to Greece when it officially adopted the Lomas written statement a few years ago.
I think that we should take more action in this direction.
. Extradition procedures between Member States cannot, in practice, be extinguished without common minimal standards for procedural law in order to guarantee fundamental rights.
The rejection of the Verts/ALE amendment requiring that Member States reach such an agreement means that the report, which is serious and important, is fundamentally flawed.
This is of such fundamental importance to European citizens that regrettably this has prevented me from voting in favour of this report.
I would like to express my support for this own-initiative report, which urges Member States of the European Union to be better coordinated in the fight against terrorist acts.
In recent years, there has been an increase in the number of terrorist activities within the European Union' s borders and every Member State has been affected by these activities.
Traditional forms of judicial and police cooperation are often found to be inadequate in combating this new form of terrorism, which stems from the activities of networks operating at international level, which are based in several countries and exploit legal loopholes arising from the geographical limits of investigations, sometimes enjoying extensive logistical and financial support.
We must, of course, condemn these acts, which traumatise whole families and create a climate of terror in the areas that are particularly affected.
More importantly, however, we must make firm proposals that seek to put an end to these despicable acts.
This is the aim of the report, which contains some interesting proposals, such as:
the creation of a 'European search and arrest warrant' with a view to combating terrorism in the context of action against crime, whether organised or not, trafficking in human beings and crimes against children, illegal trafficking in drugs and arms, and corruption and fraud,
establishing minimum rules at European level relating to the definition of criminal acts and to penalties in the field of terrorism,
abolishing formal extradition procedures and adopting the principle of mutual recognition of decisions on criminal matters relating to terrorist offences,
adopting the appropriate legal instruments for the approximation of national legislation concerning the compensation of victims of terrorist crimes.
Like the rapporteur, I also believe it is essential to work on preventing terrorist acts.
To achieve this, Member States must continue to conduct education and social policies that aim to combat all forms of social, economic and cultural exclusion.
Poverty and a lack of education help to create a favourable hunting ground, which can be exploited by fundamentalists.
We can no longer turn a blind eye to these acts, which threaten the democratic future of our societies.
. The British Conservatives voted in favour of the Watson report in order to send a message that we will give no quarter in the fight against terrorism, and particularly to show solidarity with our colleagues involved in the on-going fight against terrorists, notably ETA.
However, while the Conservatives have a long and proud record of fighting terrorism, our concerns about undue interference and politicisation in due legal process are equally long-standing.
We are anxious that extending Community competence into this area will impair the ability of Member States to take those measures which they consider necessary to tackle this problem.
We feel that it is premature to grant Europol far-reaching powers, and maintain our conviction that different national legal traditions mean that the way forward must be by cooperation, not harmonisation.
We will never, under any circumstances, give succour to those who seek to use force to undermine legitimate democratic institutions.
, in writing. I regret that I found myself unable to support the request for Parliamentary unanimity on this report.
As a Green, my preferred route is always non-violence and I believe there is absolutely no justification for violence as a means to change in a democratic state.
Where the ballot box is an option, violence is not.
I welcome the distinctions made in paragraph T in relation to third countries. My "no" vote should not be interpreted as support for terrorism but is based on one key factor.
This is the issue of mutual recognition of decisions on criminal matters.
Unless there are agreed common minimum standards for procedural law, this should not go ahead.
We cannot use the fight against terrorism to undermine the legal procedures and democratic safeguards which differ between Member States.
Parliament chose not to adopt Amendment 1 which would have demanded these minimum standards.
I must also admit to an underlying unease about supporting a report which omits certain issues such as state terrorism, the proscription of certain organisations active in non-EU countries and the basis for such decisions and, indeed, the lack of a definition of "environmental terrorism" .
However, the lack of a commitment to minimum legal safeguards is the deciding factor in my voting "no" .
. I decided to vote in favour of this reform although I have many reservations about the effect of some of the recommendations.
I do so in the hope that we will see meaningful cooperation between Member States in the eradication of violence and terrorism.
Ulster Unionists have stood against violence for decades and will continue to do so in the future.
We see the globalisation of terrorists with the arrest in Columbia of three activists in the IRA.
This brings home how widespread terrorism and the effects of terrorism have become.
Ruffolo Report (A5-0281/2001)
Madam President, two weeks ago I was in Verona.
I went to the Verona Arena to see a wonderful opera by Giuseppe Verdi, La Traviata.
It was, I am sad to say, the first time I had ever seen an opera live, and it was so beautiful that I feel it is right to make it possible for the whole of Europe to enjoy these cultural products.
Therefore, I welcome reports such as Mr Ruffolo' s report on cultural cooperation.
Clearly, it is not just Italy which has cultural activities to share but the other 14 States of the European Union and the 12 candidate countries as well.
In its explanatory statement, the report calls on the Commission and Member States to show a greater commitment to culture.
There is a reason for this, since the report also states that, in 2000, a mere 0.1% of the Community budget was earmarked for the cultural and audiovisual sectors.
What does the report mean, then, by the terms relating to 'European culture' , which are constantly used by the authors?
Apart from the fact that this expression itself is ambiguous, how does European culture differ from universal culture, which is rich with contributions from every continent?
In one of its recitals, the report includes sectors such as copyright, resale rights, liberalisation of the telecommunications market, international competition law (including funding of cinematographic works, resale price maintenance for books, theatre subsidies and media concentration) in the context of culture.
We claim that we are talking about culture when we are actually referring to markets, if not business!
On the other hand, the report does not raise any of the most basic questions.
Is everyone living within the European Union guaranteed access to culture?
Do they all have even a reasonable level of literacy?
Were they all able to receive an education that suited their abilities?
These questions do not interest the European authorities, which are too preoccupied with regulating competition in the cultural business world.
We therefore voted against this report.
I welcome the fact that the European Parliament, the body that represents the aspirations of European citizens, has taken its right of initiative to urge the European Commission to propose firm measures in the area of culture.
Since 1974, the European Parliament has stressed the importance of developing a cultural policy at Community level, and for a good reason.
Culture is a fundamental aspect of the European Union' s identity. Culture is a basis which affords people the opportunity to meet, to relate to one another and experience a shared sense of belonging.
Of course, this does not involve putting forward a European cultural policy that seeks to impose uniformity.
On the contrary, this involves emphasising cultural and linguistic diversity and the sharing of a common heritage.
At a time when our citizens are questioning Europe, we must work in order to enhance the feeling of European citizenship.
This is a prerequisite for building a European constitution.
This is the background to Mr Ruffolo' s report, which suggests several routes to follow.
The Commission is also requested:
to present to the Council and European Parliament a draft recommendation, in which the Commission will undertake to submit an annual report on cultural policies of the Union and of the Member States, and in which the Commission will call on the Member States to contribute actively to drawing up and carrying out a three-year cultural cooperation plan;
to create a European agency to monitor cultural cooperation;
to convene, as part of the review of the Culture 2000 framework programme, a second Cultural Forum which, on the basis of this resolution, will redefine the values, objectives and forms of cultural cooperation in Europe;
to carry out a study into the opportunities for bringing principles more closely into line at Community level governing the tax treatment of works of art and artistic work;
to restate, in view of the forthcoming WTO summit, the position of the European Union.
I shall conclude by reiterating that, as rapporteur for the Sixth Research and Development Framework Programme, I proposed amendments that seek to enhance cultural research.
. (DE) Closer European cultural cooperation is a welcome and desirable aim.
I voted for the Ruffolo report because I firmly believe that closer cultural cooperation will be mutually enriching.
Familiarisation with other cultures helps nations and peoples to understand each other and fosters peace.
The culture and language of the migrant communities in Europe must not go unmentioned in this context, and I call on the European Union to ensure that some of its financial aid is used to support the cultural activity of these ethnic groups.
Cultural cooperation in Europe is a fundamental aspect of closer European integration.
By learning about each other' s cultures, the people of our countries can undoubtedly develop a sense of European identity.
I consider this particularly important, because Europe is still remote from its people, for whom it is something situated in distant Brussels.
Besides its unity, Europe is also characterised by its cultural diversity.
That is of inestimable value and helps peoples to live together in peace.
I am determined to work for a Europe whose inhabitants do not merely coexist but, above all, engage in fruitful interaction.
Schmitt Report (A5-0279/2001)
Madam President, as you know, the number of elderly people and pensioners has been increasing constantly for some time now, which makes me very happy as representative of the Pensioners' Party.
This ever increasing number of pensioners and elderly people travels throughout the world, especially within the European Union, and is choosing to do so increasingly frequently by air.
These pensioners have complained to me a number of times about the treatment they receive on board aircraft, the times of flights and delays, and I can therefore only commend and vote for a report which seeks to improve the quality of air transport.
It is now urgent to have consistent and common safety requirements in air transport.
Air traffic has increased considerably and we must treat safety issues with particular attention.
We agree that this is a necessity.
However, we are not in favour of creating a European Aviation Safety Agency (AESA) on the basis proposed.
The issues at stake are obviously related to the increase in international air travel.
The AESA has been created to coincide with the liberalisation of our air space and is an instrument which can be used in the war with the United States over requirements.
Rather than this being an attempt to achieve consistent safety requirements, this is an attempt to increase competition.
The AESA is needed in order to bring about the proposed deregulation in air transport and, in the future, navigation staff and services will also be affected by the decisions taken by this agency.
At the moment, navigation staff are actually informed and consulted, but they are never acknowledged as experts.
This gives cause for concern at a time when massive structural changes and lay-offs are being made at AOM, Sabena and Swissair as well as at other airlines.
This agency must focus on one task alone, namely safety; employees must be involved in this work and the experience and knowledge of each Member State must be made consistent across the board.
- (DE) Mr Schmitt' s report is supported by the majority of my group.
The advantages of creating a European Aviation Safety Agency in place of 15 national agencies are undisputed:
It can create uniform authorisation procedures,
it can standardise the rules on air safety and environmental protection, and
it can create standard provisions relating to the safety of products, persons and installations.
At the same time, the new Agency would be a recognised partner for aviation authorities in other parts of the world.
The functions of the Agency are clearly defined: consultancy, providing technical support to the Commission, issuing the requisite official documentation, conducting checks and inspections, monitoring the implementation of statutory provisions, devising and funding research projects and cooperating with the agencies of non-EU countries.
The Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has adopted other important amendments which would make the Agency more independent of the Commission as well as defining the obligation of the Agency to keep the European Parliament informed.
My group also attaches importance to the provisions that are designed to increase transparency.
These would subject the Agency to the following controls:
General Community budgetary procedures would apply to the Agency,
Community anti-fraud legislation would apply to the Agency, and
the Agency would be subject to regular external assessments.
For these reasons the vast majority of our group voted in favour of the report.
.
(NL) There is a grave risk that the aviation industry is facing chaos.
As various companies charging different rates and offering different levels of service vie for the same busy connections, the chance of carelessness and risk-taking is greater than in public transport on the ground, which has been reasonably well regulated, so far.
Moreover, airspace is becoming increasingly crowded, leading to many near misses.
The fact that aviation is not only dangerous but also unhealthy is evident from the incidence of thrombosis which occurs in passengers who are cooped up in very confined spaces for long periods of time.
That is why I would welcome a body that can unambiguously implement the best possible safety rules in Europe.
If we consider twelve years of a 'Joint Aviation Authority' to be too non-committal and wish to set up a new body which, in agreement with EU legislation, must achieve the highest security level possible, the question is raised whether this new European agency for safety in aviation should be independent of the European Commission.
It is certainly unjustifiable to deregulate aviation traffic in the short term for the benefit of what we call a 'single sky' , where air safety functions are given to competing companies, existing control services are dismantled and airline companies are in a position to reduce their staffing levels further.
. I would like warmly to welcome Mr Schmitt' s report which calls for the establishment of a European Safety Agency with a view to improving air safety.
If this proposal comes to fruition, a uniform, high level of safety in civil aviation with common safety requirements will be created.
There are many benefits, both financial and practical, to be gained by creating a single pan-European Aviation Safety Agency: if various national regulatory and certification procedures can be replaced by a single European, uniform system, various asymmetries will be abolished.
This will ultimately lead to lower costs, a standardisation of procedures and more importantly, less red tape and bureaucracy.
Indeed, it is easier to monitor one safety system as opposed to fifteen.
It is highly important that passengers feel safe when travelling on the airlines and establishing common European rules on civil aviation will go some way to achieving this.
Swoboda Report (A5-0266/2001)
Madam President, Mr Swoboda has tabled a document on heavy goods vehicles transiting through Austrian territory, particularly the valleys and the beautiful areas there are in Austria with which we are or would like to be familiar.
I very much hope that the European Union will strive to ensure that noise and other pollution from heavy goods vehicles and other vehicles are dealt with more resolutely, so that the air remains clean and pure, particularly in the residential and tourist areas frequented by pensioners and elderly people.
Madam President, allow me to explain my vote on the Swoboda report.
Although the problem of transalpine traffic to which Mr Swoboda refers in his report primarily affects Austria, it also relates to the entire Brenner corridor.
That is where we have the problem, which derives from the fact that the proposal and the ideas presented by the Commission lose a very great deal of credibility as far as the area between Verona and Munich is concerned by seeking to amend a Protocol to the Act of Accession unilaterally.
We are in favour of tighter ecological restrictions.
We are in favour of measures if they respect the interests and equal rights of the people and companies that operate in the area in question.
But it is absolutely imperative that contractual law be upheld, both now and in the future.
. (IT) By agreement with Europe, Austria and Switzerland have laid down limits for heavy goods vehicles, and new railways, currently being built or designed, are planned.
This is part of the trans-European transport network, which proposes the Turin-Lyon rail link as an alternative to road travel.
The Commission recommended the route for the Aosta-Martigny tunnel, which was restored by the authorities in the Val d' Aosta, in accordance with the Protocol on the Implementation of the Alpine Convention in the field of Transport signed by the States and soon to be signed by the Commission.
The Mont Blanc and FrÃ©jus tunnels will now serve as a test to see whether the intention is genuine: the former was closed to traffic following the tragedy whereas the latter has seen a great increase in the transiting of heavy goods vehicles.
The communities of the valleys leading to the tunnels voiced their anxiety and concern: in the Chamonix valley there was a request for a ban on heavy goods vehicles and in the Val d' Aosta a request was made for a quota system.
There are no limits on heavy goods traffic in the western Alps.
Italy and France are going to establish such limits - I recall a draft law I submitted to the Chamber of Deputies - together with the local communities, and communicate them to Europe so that Europe can modify the trans-European transport network and specify the changes in the Commission' s White Paper, which will also cover vehicle transit through the Alps.
Measures must be laid down to govern road tunnels between Italy and France, in order to achieve a uniform system throughout the Alps now that the Mont Blanc tunnel is being reopened.
- (DE) We, the undersigned Members of the European Parliament from the Austrian People' s Party (ÃVP) and the European People' s Party (PPE), voted unanimously today against the Commission' s proposal for the amendment of Protocol No 9 to the Act of Accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden regarding the system of ecopoints for heavy goods vehicles transiting through Austria, an amendment which would advance the expiry date of the so-called 108% clause whereby a ceiling is imposed on the number of journeys and which would not replace the clause with another form of restriction.
This plan devised by the Commission is contrary to the letter and spirit of the provisions that were negotiated at the time of Austria' s accession to the EU.
We, for our part, continue to put our faith in the 108% clause; by virtue of our vote on paragraph 2(a) to (c) of the legislative resolution, we have helped to ensure that a consensus of all the European institutions - the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament - will be found at all future stages in the quest for appropriate and sustainable solutions to transport problems in the areas designated as sensitive, areas which include Austria and the Alpine region.
The conclusion that Hannes Swoboda reaches in his report on the Commission proposal regarding the system of ecopoints for heavy goods vehicles transiting through Austria, namely that we should reject the document presented by the Commission, has my own and my fellow group members' full support.
We go along with the rapporteur' s argument that the ceiling on the volume of traffic on transit routes through Austria must be maintained because the original aims of Protocol No 9 on road and rail transport and combined transport in Austria have not yet been achieved.
These aims involved the reduction of nitrogen emissions and noise levels and the improvement of road safety.
Instead of progress towards these goals, we have seen a steady rise in the number of journeys, which rose by 16% between 1993 and 2000 on the main haulage route through the Inn Valley and the Brenner alone and by 52% in Austria as a whole - in other words, a total of 580 188 additional journeys!
The EU ceiling of 40 milligrams of nitrogen dioxide per cubic metre is constantly being exceeded by more than the tolerance margin in readings taken at the Vomp measuring station on the A12 autobahn.
The same applies to the other Alpine passes that are crossed by transit routes.
Despite a few reductions in pollutant emissions that have resulted from technical improvements to heavy goods vehicles, the overall level of carbon dioxide emissions has risen.
If the original aim of continuous and sustainable reduction of pollutant emissions is to be achieved, the number of transit journeys by heavy goods vehicles must be reduced.
For these reasons, we advocate rejection of the Commission' s proposal.
To add another proposal to our debate, let me say that efforts should be made to follow the Swiss example and create rail links for the transport of heavy goods vehicles through Austria.
Motion for a resolution on the enlargement process (B5-0538/2001)
Madam President, in relation to the enlargement reports - not just Mr Brok' s report, but also those on the individual applicant states - it is interesting to see that Mr Brok has recognised the rejection of the Nice Treaty in Ireland.
He has confirmed what we have said all along, that basically the Nice Treaty is not necessary for enlargement.
Enlargement can go ahead without the Nice Treaty.
It is deplorable that our own government is trying to force people to change their minds.
In relation to the accession reports on the individual states, I have grave concern about the emphasis on the common foreign and security aspect, the fact that countries are being coerced into joining Nato.
The report on Malta, for example, deplores the fact that Malta is divided on the issue of membership.
I believe it is up to the Maltese themselves to decide on whether or not they want to join.
If there is a clear division, then there should be a free choice.
In Malta, Ireland is being used as an example of how you can be a Member of the European Union and a wonderful economic success and still remain neutral.
All of this is false.
We have to stop dangling artificial carrots in front of the applicant states and be honest.
Ireland is no longer neutral.
It is cooperating in common foreign and security and defence policy.
Ireland' s economic success is not solely down to the EU, as many economic experts will tell you.
Madam President, in terms of the European Union' s enlargement process in general, I have to say that I voted for the motion.
The Pensioners' Party supports the enlargement of the European Union for two reasons: first and foremost, the States of Central and Eastern Europe lived for over 50 years under a totally oppressive dictatorship and their request to be part of Europe with us deserves recognition.
The other reason, Madam President, is that there are already a great many pensioners and elderly people in the current European Union.
With the accession of the candidate countries they will become even more numerous, and I can only rejoice that there will be lots of pensioners in Europe who might vote for the Pensioners' Party in the future.
There are three reasons why we welcome the debate that has just been held in Parliament on the forthcoming enlargement of the European Union.
First of all, it appears that, as of 2004, around 10 of the 12 candidate countries (with the likely exceptions of Romania and Bulgaria) may all join at the same time.
The Members belonging to the Mouvement pour la France think that this is excellent news, which will allow us to make up for some lost time, after such a long wait.
The second reason is that we have remarked upon a change in tone when referring to the candidate countries, which are now treated like States that are worthy of respect.
The resolution even stresses that the European Union must ensure that the dignity of the people of the candidate countries is never compromised by making inappropriate demands upon them.
We had often condemned the haughty and even contemptuous attitude of the federalists, who demanded that the countries in the East relinquish their sovereignty.
Let us hope that this new development will provide more than just a change in vocabulary.
Lastly, the third reason we welcome the debate is that paragraph 10 of the resolution appears to accept a more flexible Europe that is made up of various circles.
In our view, this is a more realistic position, on the condition, however, that the circle in which France is placed is not dominated by ultra-federalism. This would allow flexibility for all countries, in return for increased rigidity for a sub-set, which would be illogical.
The resolution still contains, however, some unsatisfactory, even unacceptable paragraphs.
For example, it is a contradiction to demand better monitoring of external borders of candidate countries as well as a relaxation of their asylum policy. It is hardly responsible to call for a structural policy to be applied to the whole of the European Union following enlargement, whereas we should instead focus the policy for a limited period on the new member countries.
It is unacceptable to assert that the lesson to be learned from the Irish referendum is that we need to find a method of revising the treaties, which are likely to provoke such opposition (Recital E). It appears that the change in tone does not go as far as respect for national democracies that vote 'no' !
- (DA) So that there shall be no doubt that we are well disposed towards admitting the new candidate countries, we have voted in favour of the report.
There are nonetheless quite a few aspects of the report and of the enlargement negotiations as a whole that are particularly open to criticism.
Recital E, in particular, to the effect that '... the citizens of Europe do not understand the historic endeavour of the Union to bring peace, security and prosperity to the entire continent' is strikingly arrogant.
In the roll-call vote, we voted against change, but we are not in principle opposed to changing the procedure for amending the treaties of the European Union.
However, we have misgivings about whether the proposed change would make any practical difference at all to the result it is hoped to achieve by means of a possible convention model.
On the positive side, however, is the fact that paragraph 2 talks about 'devising alternative options as a precaution' .
.
(FR) Behind a presentation that is supposed to be optimistic, the description the reports give of the Eastern European states forming the majority of European Union candidate countries is gloomy.
'Worrying levels of corruption' , 'overpopulation of prisons' , 'enormous traffic in women and children for the purposes of prostitution and sexual exploitation' , 'high level of unemployment' , 'poverty' , 'seriously damaged environment' , 'unpromising economic outlook' , 'acceleration in the spread of the HIV virus' , 'oppression of minorities' , 'discrimination against the Roma' , these are some of the expressions used in relation to one Eastern European country or another, or, in some extreme cases, to all.
Despite this, the report expresses satisfaction with the fact that privatisations are going ahead, even in the health sector, denying healthcare to a significant proportion of the population, and with the fact that foreign investments and exports are on the increase in these countries.
The return of these states to brutal capitalism and the increasing stranglehold of powerful investors from the west are already causing a considerable rise in social inequalities.
However, despite a few sanctimonious warnings given by the reports to the governments of these countries, what they are mainly asking for is for the remaining obstacles to the penetration of foreign capital to be lifted and for 'the flexibility and mobility of work' to be increased, that is to say, for their working classes to be submitted to a higher level of exploitation.
Being supporters of a completely unified Europe from one end of the continent to the other, we have not voted against enlargement.
Our abstention expresses our opposition to the master and slave relationship that the European Union is seeking to impose on these countries in collaboration with their privileged classes, in addition to the anti-worker policy imposed under the pretext of enlargement.
- (DA) We have not voted in favour of Mr Brok' s decision.
It is an expression of a development of European cooperation that we cannot support.
We do not therefore consider the development of a common defence to be of benefit either to present or future Member States, and we are opposed to involving NATO in a decision concerning enlargement of the EU.
We believe that the decision skates all too easily over the problems created by Schengen for quite a few candidate countries, for example when it comes to regional cohesion in the form of trade, and other contact, with neighbouring States outside the EU. The issue of Kaliningrad' s future, to which the rapporteur does not give serious treatment, also comes under this heading.
Moreover, the decision has all too little to say about the problems raised by the transitional arrangements demanded by the EU, for example concerning the freedom of movement of the labour force.
Such arrangements would, for one thing, prolong the problem of illegal labour from candidate countries in current Member States and, for another, give people in the candidate countries the sense of being second-class citizens of the EU.
Furthermore, we think that the decision is far too weak when it comes to the agricultural and structural funds.
We welcome the fact that the rapporteur emphasises the necessity of putting both the environment and the social consequences of the arrangements into the equation; but, if enlargement is to be an equitable process, a minor adjustment in these two crucial areas is far from being sufficient.
Finally, the author' s arrogance towards countries' populations is completely incomprehensible, and we wish to retain the right of each individual country' s population to decide for itself.
. (PT) The contradictions contained in this motion for a resolution, to which 31 proposals for amendments have been tabled, show that there are considerable differences of opinion on the prospect of enlargement and the objectives that people wish to achieve.
The European Union' s leaders have given commitments to the candidate countries that they are now not only behind in fulfilling, but are also making unacceptable demands which could clearly threaten objectives that they are trumpeting and which should actually be the broad guidelines for accession negotiations, such as the peace, development and prosperity of all peoples, taking into consideration the principle of economic and social cohesion.
On the one hand, however, the resolution voted for by a majority of the European Parliament states that "the dignity of the peoples of the candidate countries must never be wounded by insensitive demands from the EU" and the need to correct certain discriminatory aspects that were approved in Nice is acknowledged.
On the other hand, it unacceptably ties the enlargement of the European Union to that of NATO. The resolution expresses satisfaction with the conclusion of the agreements on liberalising agricultural trade and urges further privatisation, bearing in mind current and future obligations within the WTO, whereas, in social terms, it opens the way for transitional periods in the free movement of people, thereby covering the German and Austrian positions, which we reject, of preventing workers from candidate countries obtaining legal status for seven years,.
The motion for a resolution also fails to adequately address the issue of the future budget of the European Union, despite knowing that major disparities exist in the levels of development, not only between the countries of the European Union but also between the average of the fifteen current Member States and that of the twelve countries applying to join the Union, which we cannot accept.
The move towards economic and social cohesion requires a thorough revision of the financial perspectives and a substantial bolstering of Community funds in order at least to maintain current levels of support for cohesion countries, including Portugal, and to give significant support to the development of the candidate countries.
.
(FR) In this current process of enlargement, the Council uses the same framework for all 12 candidate countries without taking into account the specific nature of those from Eastern Europe, insofar as we are forcing them to change their entire systems, which makes this round of enlargement a qualitatively different issue to any previous enlargement.
The European Union is therefore asking each candidate country to prove their ability to face up to competition by destroying their environment, their system for social protection and their means for a true policy of modernisation and full employment, thereby encouraging the development of poverty and unemployment.
Far from continuing to give gold stars to those who have privatised the most and to those who have reduced their budgetary expenditure the most, there should be an audit of the true socio-economic effects of these measures, a moratorium on privatisations, public aid for development, and the definition of a Europe-wide social plan for the European Union that is open to the East and to the South, protecting employment, the environment, health and standards of living.
Instead of this, the EU is preparing to welcome these new countries into the Community as members of a second division, commanded to apply the acquis communautaire and excluded from the effects of the CAP or even the structural funds.
The citizens of these countries should be consulted beforehand, preferably by means of a referendum, and Europe give the commitment to accept their response whatever it may be.
This is why we have not voted for the process of enlargement to be pursued under these conditions.
.
(FR) The enlargement process is without doubt a great adventure.
Yet up to this point it has been reduced to the rank of a commercial-style takeover bid or a company merger, instead of being a major event in history, reuniting all the Christian peoples of Europe at a time when the secular enemy once again is threatening the south.
Within this framework of a camp of freedom and light, pitched against a camp of integrationist obscurantism, Ukraine and Russia, the advanced guard of the West, would have comfortably found their place.
The result of this derisory technical fudging of a political issue at the summit is the expression 'acquis communautaire' .
In around thirty chapters, from agriculture to taxation, via the environment, SMEs, education and transport, the laws of the candidate countries, their administrations, their sociologies and even their morals are being closely examined with a police-style scrutiny that must remind these former countries suffused with a proletarian morality of heavy-handed practices that have still not been forgotten.
Such states are also seeing their penal codes criticised as an obstacle to their accession, because they forbid certain sexual practices.
Many have received lectures on their levels of fraud and corruption, as if European VAT has not been, since 1993, a major factor for serious tax fraud.
Malta is even being reproached for attracting too many offshore companies because of its favourable tax laws.
As if Ireland has not been guilty of this with the CSFs and as if the United States does not practice this system on an enormous scale; a practice condemned by the World Trade Organisation, but tolerated by Europe that will climb down as many rungs as is necessary in its submission to the empire.
At no time has enlargement been the opportunity for a dialogue on experiences and the sharing of success stories.
Poland has good reason to point our that its agricultural heritage will be open to a European heritage of 8 million animals slaughtered for foot-and-mouth disease or BSE and 136 000 people incubating the fatal atypical Creutzfeld-Jakob disease.
Instead of enriching and preserving the heritage of the vegetable and animal biodiversity of these Eastern countries, not to mention their heritage of social relations that have not yet been broken by this ultra-capitalist savagery, the European Commission debases this historic meeting to the level of an unconditional annexation.
An Anschluss, in fact.
This explains why the dossier has been entrusted to a German Commissioner and the European Parliament report to a member who is, as if by chance, also German.
Things are, it is true, clearer than ever.
There is enlargement of course, but as in 1990, it is still German.
The 1945 brackets are being closed.
The Empire is rebuilding itself.
Mitteleuropa is here, everlasting in its geography and its history.
.
(NL) Mr Brok' s assumption is based on close ties between NATO and the European Union.
It is true that Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary were recently persuaded to join NATO with the prospect of a possible acceleration in the accession process to the EU.
This line of thinking takes no account of the fact that four current EU member states, namely Ireland, Sweden, Finland and Austria, do not belong to NATO and neither do they have any ambitions in this direction.
I am opposed to the idea that NATO must be seen as a military organisation of five member states, being the US, the European Union, Canada, Norway and Turkey.
Moreover, in my opinion, Mr Brok' s views are not only problematical in respect of NATO.
The enlargement of the EU can heighten national contradictions, partly because many of the companies still existing in the east fail to meet the environmental acquis for which we can, at best, expect typical, temporary low-wage industries modelled on the Mexican example in return.
The new Member States will be plagued by the problems of the former DDR on the one hand, and of Mexico, which serves as the US' s poor backyard, on the other.
Mr Brok' s optimism ultimately leads to a Europe full of unsolved problems, partly because he disregards all the social issues.
.
(FR) At a time when the Member States of the European Union are finally putting together, following the Erika catastrophe, a more stringent set of provisions for maritime safety - a field in which the common interest is obvious - it can only be regretted that the space set aside for this crucial subject in the various resolutions relating to the candidate countries directly involved should be so discreet.
No one can forget the images of the wreck of the Erika and the views of its home port, Valetta.
We are all aware that the merchant fleets of six candidate countries appear on the Paris Memorandum blacklist.
In addition to Turkey, these are Malta, Cyprus, Latvia, Romania and Bulgaria.
These countries' adoption of the Erika I and Erika II packages and their commitment to get on top of the issue of accepting flags of convenience should be made one of the priorities in accession negotiations.
The safety of our coastal regions depends on it.
Carlsson report (A5-0251/2001)
Madam President, a few days ago, during the summer, I went on holiday to Estonia.
While I was there, I saw a fisherman - although it was summer, it was very cold up there in the north - fishing in the Baltic Sea.
I stopped for a chat and learned that he was a pensioner who was trying to catch a few fish to supplement his pension.
"Why are you doing that?" I asked him.
"Don' t you have good pensions?"
"I am afraid that our pensions are very low" he replied.
I therefore hope that we will make sure that pensions are large enough in all the candidate countries, especially Estonia.
- (DA) I have voted against the reports on enlargement of the European Union inasmuch as the real political goal of the EU' s project of enlargement is the economic and political subjection of the populations of the candidate countries.
It is about annexing a group of countries and not about real negotiations between equal parties.
A long-term strategy for peace and prosperity would be aimed at opening the EU' s markets instead of making unreasonable demands upon the candidate countries to enact extensive legislation over which they have no influence.
The most important task for the People' s Movement against the EU is to internationalise grassroots opposition to the EU project as a whole and to work for a free Europe in which there are full opportunities for open cooperation that are not stymied by the EU' s closed, supranational bureaucracy.
I would like to give an explanation of vote with regard to the votes cast on today' s enlargement reports and firstly state that I agree with the points Patricia McKenna made concerning foreign and security policy matters in connection with enlargement.
At the same time I wish to say that I voted in error in favour of Amendment No 4, which was tabled for Mrs Carlsson' s report, as in fact I opposed this amendment, which I consider to be of dubious value with regard to the area' s stability.
Schroedter report (A5-0252/2001)
Madam President, I voted for the accession of Latvia to the European Union.
In the Baltic States, there are many cultural treasures which I am sure many pensioners - and many young people as well - from throughout the European Union would like to visit.
It can only be a good thing to have the possibility of seeing these marvellous works of both nature and man in the European Union, which should therefore be enlarged to include Latvia as well.
Souladakis report (A5-0253/2001)
Madam President, Lithuania has a great problem of energy and unemployment.
I voted for the motion but I call upon the European Union to provide more substantial financial and other aid to combat the lack of energy and the shortage of jobs in the State of Lithuania.
Gawronski report (A5-0254/2001)
Madam President, Poland must be the first candidate country to enter the European Union.
This is because the peaceful revolution which brought Eastern Europe into the democratic world, the world of democracies, originated precisely in Poland, as we all know, with the work of Solidarnosc and the election of a Polish Pope.
I therefore voted for the motion and I hope that there will soon be Polish representatives with us in this Chamber.
.
(FR) As a member of the EU-Poland Joint Parliamentary Committee, I am happy to be able to give my opinion on the report by Mr Gawronski.
This is, in fact, an analysis of the state of progress of accession negotiations with Poland and to check that the Copenhagen criteria, the conditions to be fulfilled at both political and economic levels and in terms of the implementation of the acquis communautaire, are being respected.
As far as Poland is concerned, the government has shown its willingness to implement the necessary reforms that will allow it to join the European Union as soon as possible.
It appears that, on the face of it, Poland will be able to participate in the next European elections in 2004, which I am delighted about.
There remain, however, several recurrent problems, notably in the area of agriculture.
It is extremely important that a compromise agreement be reached between the Polish authorities and the Commission on Poland' s participation in the common agricultural policy and, on the basis of Commissioner Fischler' s proposals, to implement a phasing in of direct payments, which should gradually integrate the Polish agricultural sector into the Community system.
It also seems necessary to return to a question that has not been mentioned in the report for it raises too many controversial issues.
All the same, I would like to remind you of the painful problem of the restitution of property confiscated after the Second World War.
I am, of course, aware that the Polish authorities are finding it particularly difficult to solve this problem for both financial and emotional reasons.
However, the debate should be held in such a way that a balanced solution can be found which, hopefully, will deal carefully with all the sensibilities involved.
Lastly, the efforts of the Polish parliament to adapt national law to the acquis communautaire must be highlighted.
It is obvious that these could be seen as measures that simply complicate people' s daily lives.
A policy of information and communication should therefore accompany such measures to convince the Polish people of the advantages of joining the European Union.
Whatever happens, I would insist on the fact that, for citizens of both Member States and candidate countries, the cost of enlargement in every sense of the word is nothing when compared with the cost of non-enlargement.
We all have a historical responsibility for this matter.
.
(FR) This report 'urges' Poland to speed up the effective implementation of the acquis communautaire so that she can respect the commitments she has given and fully benefit from the advantages inherent in accession to the European Union.
But what exactly is the content of the acquis communautaire that the Polish people, especially the Polish farmers, can expect?
We certainly support the demand of all candidate countries, especially Poland, not to be treated like members of an EU second division.
Yet the CAP reforms and structural funds require much more than strict budgetary calculations.
Agriculture plays a major role in satisfying needs and fundamental rights, from the right to the sovereignty of food to questions of health and the environment, via regional balances and jobs.
Candidate countries such as Poland should participate fully in the definition of an entirely new European agricultural policy.
As far as the Polish industrial machine is concerned, it is whipping itself into shape for a Europe that has demoted it from the rank of favourite to that of outsider in terms of accession.
In fact, the formulae applied have left entire regions disaster stricken, with an official unemployment rate of 16%.
The socio-economic failure of Poland will be that of so-called 'liberal' formulae imposed by accession.
This is the reason why we have not voted for this report.
JÃŒrgen SchrÃ¶der report (A5-0255/2001)
Madam President, Mr Fatuzzo is not alone here, which is nice for him.
We Members of Parliament are not normally late going to lunch, but I wanted to explain why I voted against Mrs Nicholson of Winterbourne' s and Mr SchrÃ¶der' s reports.
Of course, I want to welcome these countries, the Czech Republic and Romania, to the EU with open arms, but I wanted to protest about Parliament' s attitude to nuclear power.
It is not our task to advise independent countries on how they are to manage their affairs regarding energy, and our own credibility suffers if we discuss the issue of nuclear power time and time again in a populist manner that ignores the facts.
Numerous international study trips have been made to Temelin, for example, and it meets all the international criteria.
Why should this brand new nuclear power station be demolished?
Romania, on the other hand, has coal-fired power stations that are 40 years old - they are nearly as old as me - so it is only reasonable for them to build the modern Canadian nuclear plant there.
I must just say that if people in the candidate countries are reading our thoughts on nuclear energy they are almost certainly choking on the coal dust and their food is going down the wrong way as well.
Madam President, I wish to associate myself with the comments just made by Mr Vatanen.
I too did not support the JÃŒrgen SchrÃ¶der report, specifically because paragraphs 43 and 44 call into question the completion of the Temelin nuclear power plant and, in fact, contradict the earlier paragraph 42 which welcomes the Melk Accord between the Czech Republic, the Austrian government and the European Commission in December 2000.
The content of that accord and, in particular, the investigations into the environmental impact assessment that was agreed, have substantially been carried out.
On my examination of the information there are no safety reasons why the commissioning of Number 1 reactor should not proceed.
On the basis of this contradiction in the report I did not support it.
Madam President, the Czech Republic has asked to accede to the European Union and I have voted for the motion.
Point 7 of the report, on pages 7 and 8, says that, in order to reduce the deficit, the Czech Republic must reform its health and pension systems.
I do not agree.
Health and pensions must not be used to balance States' budgets.
The health and pensions of the citizens must be the last item on a State' s budget to be altered.
A good administration must come first.
. (ES) The Spanish delegation of the PPE-DE has voted in favour of the report by Baroness Nicholson on the accession of Romania to the European Union in view of the explanations given by the rapporteur with regard to the adoption of Romanian children by Spanish families, explanations which I am grateful for.
It considers that, in this way, the concerns of future Spanish mothers and fathers, who have correctly carried out all the necessary procedures for adoption and have then been extremely alarmed by the revision measures and paralysis of cases adopted recently, may be effectively dealt with.
The Spanish delegation of the PPE-DE is actively monitoring the implementation of these measures and will take all necessary action with the Romanian and Community authorities to protect the rights of children to be adopted, by means of the introduction of provisions which will remove any possibility that, under the guise of adoption, cases of trafficking in children may be covered up, as well as the rights of parents who have a generous desire to adopt and who, to this end, are making every kind of sacrifice.
.
(FR) The report 'is concerned about the rising budget deficit, which, after deducting privatisation receipts, could reach 7% of gross domestic product in 2001, and therefore calls on the Czech government to carry out urgently needed reforms to the healthcare and pensions system' and 'recalls that budgetary consolidation must not be carried through in such a way as to compromise the mid-term objective of social cohesion in accordance with the European Social Model, in particular the fight against poverty and social exclusion' .
In direct opposition to European ideology, the rapporteur adds, as if in response to pressure from the demonstrations in Prague against the IMF and World Bank summit, that 'future-oriented public investments are urgently needed for the improvement of social protection, public health and education' ...
This schizophrenia will become more and more apparent between the proclamations of good intentions and the 'liberal' formulae directed towards mass privatisations and competition.
It is proof of the refusal to draw up an effective balance sheet for failed policy and disintegrating formulae.
We demand a moratorium on these policies and criteria for European construction that do not impose methods that are detrimental to standards of living and basic needs.
For these reasons, we were unable to vote for this report.
. (DE) The FPÃ members voted for the enlargement report on the Czech Republic.
However, I wish to reiterate our position on paragraphs 42-44 of the report.
The Melk Accord between Austria and the Czech Republic has failed to achieve the desired results so far.
Its objectives have not been met.
A satisfactory outcome can only be obtained if the Temelin issue is dealt with at European rather than at bilateral level.
What is required, therefore, is a European initiative on the closure of Temelin which sets forth a timetable and financing options for its final phasing out and involves the Commission and the Member States.
With regard to Mr SchrÃ¶der' s report I wish to say that hazardous nuclear power stations are not the internal problem of just one country.
For that reason it was important to adopt paragraphs 43 and 44 of the Temelin report.
It is to be hoped that they will give the right message to the Czech government and also that the zero variant will be taken seriously in any discussion of Temelin' s future.
Wiersma report (A5-0256/2001)
Slovakia has applied to enter the European Union and is making progress in incorporating the Community acquis into its legal system.
The Pensioners' Party voted for the accession of this country, and I am pleased to note, as page 14 of the report states, that Slovakia has authorised the use of many different regional languages in its Republic.
This is an example that we ought to follow in all the Member States.
.
(NL) Unfortunately, the country reports hardly mention the risk of eastern newcomers reverting to their traditional situation pre-1940, when they were the West' s poor relations. At that time they had to export cheap minerals and agricultural products in order to pay for the import of expensive industrial products.
Only by sealing their markets off from disrupting and currency-consuming imports did they manage to protect their industry and create a level of security for 40 years.
If we do not afford the newcomers any sustainable protection, they will not be able to protect themselves against the clearance sale of land and businesses to people living in countries with a stronger economy, nor against the imports from such countries.
This could result in them being condemned to long-term poverty and deprivation.
This also brings with it the risk that the electorate in those countries will favour forces which will promote themselves as protectors of national independence, national identity and the national economy.
Certainly in Slovakia, with its weak economy and Roma and Hungarian minorities which are not favoured by a majority of people, poverty not only incites an aversion to the EU, but also creates internal conflict.
A time bomb is ticking away unnoticed under the EU' s enlargement plans.
QueirÃ³ report (A5-0257/2001)
I voted for the report on the state of accession negotiations between Europe and Hungary.
Although I fully support this report, I would have preferred it if it had stated that the Hungarian citizens, in company, moreover, with all the other citizens of the States of Europe, should be informed that, in joining the European Union, they will benefit from being able to add the years of work performed in the State in which they live to the years of work they have performed in other States.
Thus, accession to the European Union will bring better, larger pensions for many cross-border workers.
.
(FR) The European Union promised Hungary a rapid entry into Europe.
However, this promise has not been kept.
This is why the report 'insists (...) on the need to fix firm dates for the conclusion of negotiations and accession - since the Treaty of Nice has now been signed - so as to help forestall any disappointment or even discontent on the part of the Hungarian public' .
Disappointment is becoming the norm, however.
The amount of time the process is taking is the main reason for this but also the widespread sacrifices we are trying to pass off as a bitter pill that must be swallowed in order to prepare for a brighter future at the heart of the EU, with certain countries having to swallow this very pill without even any guarantee that they will become full members of the EU.
The fear that people will associate social regression with structural adjustment criteria imposed by the IMF or by the EU is shifting the debate.
The report 'welcomes (...) the approximately 60% rise in the national minimum wages, and calls on the Hungarian government to encourage the signing of collective bargaining agreements by industrial sectors' yet the substance of the social measures advocated evaporates when the report 'notes the adoption of a new labour code based on the principle of the flexibility and mobility of labour with a view to adapting the rules and organisation of the labour market to the need for economic growth...'
This is a liberal formula that we do not accept, either for the new candidate countries or for the European Union as it stands today.
For these reasons, we were not able to vote for this report.
.
(PT) Despite having delivered, as you would expect, a favourable, vote on this report, I must express my disagreement with its conclusion No 13, which is the consequence of an amendment tabled in committee being adopted. This amendment requests the Hungarian government remove the provisions of the Penal Code, specifically Article 199, which discriminates against homosexual men and women.
If this were in fact the issue, the aforementioned conclusion would not require any comment.
The situation is, however, that following consultation with the Hungarian authorities, I have been informed that the penal provision in question only affects homosexual relations involving partners under 18 years of age.
This is not, therefore, a law of sexual discrimination, but one designed to protect minors, which completely changes my position.
Consequently, although I requested a split vote on this matter, I have voted against the paragraph in question.
Van Orden report (A5-0258/2001)
Bulgaria has also applied to join the European Union.
I am somewhat concerned by the political situation in this State, Madam President.
I hope that King Simeon, who has become Prime Minister of the Bulgarian Republic, but who does not hold an absolute parliamentary majority and who has acquired the reins of the country by bringing to the government ministers from the both the Turkish and the communist communities, will also be able to incorporate the Community acquis into the Bulgarian legal system without delay, so that the country can become part of the enlarged European Union as soon as possible, entering the European Union among the first wave of States, if possible, rather than the second.
Nicholson of Winterbourne report (A5-0259/2001)
Madam President, on the Nicholson report, I voted against it because paragraph 20 seeks to delay the completion of the second nuclear reactor at Cernavoda.
It is a "CANDU" nuclear reactor of western design.
There are no safety implications involved.
Paragraph 20 of the report calls for the creation of a sustainable energy strategy.
That strategy has already been put in place. It has been paid for through the PHARE programme.
I am surprised that a committee like the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy seems to be unaware of this fact.
For that reason I voted against the Nicholson report.
That particular item was inaccurate, unnecessary and an aggravation to a country which is seeking to join us.
I wish that the anti-nuclear people on these committees would realise that this constant sniping at the applicant countries on this issue is not doing our relations with them any good at all.
Madam President, I voted for the entry of Romania into the European Union. This is not solely - although it is partly - for the reasons contained in the report, but because I cannot disregard the relationship that exists between Rome and Romania.
It is a well-known fact that Romania is a community of people made up, for the most part, of the descendants of Roman soldiers who had set up a large camp there.
And it is a well-known fact that the language spoken by the Romanians is a Latin-based language, unlike the languages of all the other regions.
Well then, these ties have convinced me still further to do all I can and to support the - moreover, extremely positive - report on the state of Romania' s accession negotiations.
I hope that this country will manage to close the gap on the other States which have applied to accede to the European Union as quickly as possible.
. Recently a TV crew from Romania asked me, was I seriously suggesting that the condition of children' s institutions in Romania could jeopardise their application for membership of the EU.
These young journalists were totally amazed at the deep concerns many of us have about all aspects of childcare in Romania.
Our concerns about trafficking in children as the world was beating a path to their door in search of children became obscured between the desperation of parents looking for children to adopt and the clear indications that many of those who were facilitating commercial trafficking in children became part of the politics of Romania, and indeed those countries whose nationals were pressurising for open adoption, notably the USA.
Baroness Nicholson has, in her excellent report, highlighted these issues and by her deep concern has finally alerted the Romanian Authorities, and her report will hopefully result in the radical changes required to protect children.
.
(FR) Broadly speaking, we can only agree with the new strategy decided on at the Helsinki European Council of 10 and 11 December 1999 that aims to open negotiations with all Eastern European candidate countries - but not at any cost.
Although social degradation in Romania continues and in no area is the process of reform complete, the rapporteur dares to say that 'Romania today has opportunities for swift progress unequalled in modern times.
Firm political leadership, exceptional economic signals, clear articulation of, and commitment to, the reform process...'
Yet its true intentions come to light later on: '...a NATO decision to invite Romania to become a member of the North Atlantic Alliance in 2002 would be an important contribution to regional security; welcomes therefore Romania' s efforts to satisfy the requisite conditions for NATO membership and, in particular, Romania' s efforts to restructure its military sector and to adjust its defence policy' .
There is the strong possibility that Romania will be offered NATO membership as a substitute for accession to the European Union, which is increasingly unimaginable, since the reforms are prohibitive for development due to the huge costs involved in integration.
We are nevertheless asking Romania to prepare herself...for entry into NATO.
For these reasons, we were not able to vote for this report.
Volcic report (A5-0260/2001)
Madam President, I voted for the report which acknowledges the state of the accession negotiations between Slovenia and the European Union.
In two days time, next Saturday, I shall be the guest of the Slovenian State Secretary for Foreign Affairs in Ljubljana.
Why is that?
Because he belongs to the Slovenian Pensioners' Party, and this will be the first meeting between the Pensioners' Party represented at the European Parliament and one of the many pensioners' parties that exist in the candidate countries.
The most important of these is the Slovenian Pensioners' Party and I hope that this party, which is succeeding in getting Slovenia into Europe, will join forces with me in working to improve the lives of pensioners throughout Europe.
.
(IT) Regretfully, the Alleanza Nazionale delegation to the European Parliament is going to vote against Slovenia' s accession: regretfully because we believe in the democratic and Europeanist sentiments of the Slovenian people, a people which - we are sure - will make a substantial contribution to the integration of a Europe which is becoming increasingly capable of united political and economic action and of protecting the historical and cultural diversities of its communities.
However, Alleanza Nazionale cannot vote for Slovenia' s accession today because of the indifference displayed by the Slovenian government towards the legitimate, longstanding claims of the Italian exiles.
This indifference dashes our hopes, although we continue, nevertheless, to call upon the Slovenian government to acknowledge without delay that the concept of democracy also includes acknowledging the damages and suffering that they have inflicted on many Italian-speaking citizens in the past and providing appropriate compensation.
The accession of the Republic of Cyprus to the European Union is clearly a very different issue from the accession of the countries of Eastern Europe.
The accession of Cyprus carries far more weight and is far more important because it could be used as a lever for finding a fair solution to the Cyprus question based on UN resolutions and for defusing political tensions in the eastern Mediterranean, especially following the invasion of the northern part of the island by Turkish forces, which have persisted in their barbaric occupation for more than a quarter of a century now.
Accession will not disadvantage any of the communities on the island and it is interesting that, despite opposition from Turkey and the Denktash regime, the majority of Turkish Cypriots, 90% according to a recent article in the Turkish newspaper Radikal, are in favour of the accession of the Republic of Cyprus to the European Union.
Mr Ãoos' motion for a resolution is correct, balanced and well pitched politically.
If the Council takes its cue from the European Parliament, instead of constantly giving in to pressure from Turkey, we would have positive and quick results both for the Republic of Cyprus and for the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities.
Poos report (A5-0261/2001)
. (EL) The only good thing about the report by the Temporary Committee on the Echelon Interception System is that it admits that such a system exists and that similar systems also probably exist.
However, it tries to take our mind off our concerns by playing down its powers and general impact.
Worst of all, the report attempts to give personal and other data collection a legal basis, considering it a legitimate tool in helping to develop an EU security and defence policy to serve the needs of the rapid reaction force, to fight "terrorism" etc. It also considers that collaboration is needed with the intelligence services of the Member States of the ÃU.
All in all, it "urges the Member States to review and, if necessary, to adapt their own legislation on the operations of the intelligence services to ensure that it is consistent with fundamental rights as laid down in the ECHR and with the case law of the European Court of Human Rights" .
The report talks of "democratic monitoring and control" and "calls on the monitoring bodies responsible for scrutinising the activities of the secret services, when exercising their monitoring powers, to attach great importance to the protection of privacy, regardless of whether the individuals concerned are their own nationals, other EU nationals or third country nationals" .
It voices a degree of concern about industrial espionage, clearly in order to protect the excessive profits raked in by the monopolies.
In all events, the report proposes encoding messages as the main form of protection.
These positions are irritating and most provocative when compared with the rudimentary demand for protection for privacy and for trade union and political activity.
They are an attempt to convince us that we need to live with monitoring, with the personal electronic files of the Schengen Agreement and under the watchful eye of Europol and to shift the onus of protection to each and every one of us.
It is for these reasons that the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the report.
I voted for the report on Cyprus as well.
This summer, Madam President, as well as going to the seas in the north, I went on holiday to Cyprus.
I divided my time equally between the Greek and Turkish parts of Cyprus.
I went to the seaside and got a nice tan.
I spent time first with a beautiful Greek Cypriot girl and then with a beautiful Turkish Cypriot girl.
There was no difference between the first and second parts of the holiday: I had a wonderful time in both Northern and Southern Cyprus.
I therefore hope that Cyprus will enter the European Union as soon as possible.
I voted against the motion on Echelon because, in my view:
First, it plays down the importance and the role of a global monitoring system which is directed by the USA and to which a Member State belongs (United Kingdom).
Secondly, it draws conclusions which cannot be fully substantiated, such as that it is not used for military purposes.
Thirdly, the approach taken in the motion to the issue of legal data collection leaves the way open for what is extremely dangerous indifference in this area to continue.
Fourthly, it gives the United States its blessing to continue its spying missions within the European Union, subject to what are, of course, wholly inadequate conditions.
Fifthly, instead of calling for support for transparency and democratic scrutiny of secret service activities, it flirts with the idea of setting up a "proper" European Echelon system.
. I appreciate the hard work that my friend and colleague, Jacques Poos, has put into preparing this report but regret that I cannot vote for this in the final vote.
Had the amendments tabled by my friend Andrew Duff been passed, I would have been able to support the report.
Europe has, in recent years, seen and accepted the separation of the Czech Republic and Slovakia, the dissolution of the former Soviet Union and the gradual break up of Yugoslavia.
Yet we seem unable to accept the rights of the Turkish population of Cyprus to be accorded their rights to a separate administration and indeed, if this cannot be achieved, the right to secede from the Republic of Cyprus and follow a path of self determination as far from the smallest country in the world.
The Cypriot Turks have as much right to self-determination as the Cypriot Greeks.
For many years the Greek Cypriot sought enosis (union) with Greece.
The Turkish Cypriots should have the same right, though my own preference would be for two equal states united in some form of bi-zonal, bi-communal federation within the European Union.
. (FR) Cyprus is today the candidate country that has advanced the most in its negotiations with the European Union - 23 chapters provisionally closed out of 29 - and we can, on paper, envisage its accession taking place as soon as 2004.
In practice, however, this will pose formidable problems due to the illegal occupation of the northern part of the island, 37% of the total territory, by Turkey since 1974.
The European Union considers that the Cypriot government in the southern part of the island represents the whole island, in accordance with international law, and that it is therefore negotiating for the accession of all the island' s inhabitants.
It is right to take this approach, for to act differently would mean recognising border changes imposed by force.
However, the result could mean the inclusion in the EU of a closed area - for all communications with the north have been cut, except with Turkey, where human rights are not respected - the European Court condemned Turkey on 10 May for its behaviour in Cyprus - and where the economic situation is completely unregulated.
How can we manage contradictions such as these?
The Poos report that has just been adopted by our Assembly rightly states that if Turkey were to decide to annex the northern part of the island, "it would put an end to its own ambitions of European Union membership" .
However, if it is not annexed, if it refuses to re-enter into negotiations, that is to say, if the current situation persists, what do we do?
At the very least, it must be said that Turkey' s attitude does not correspond to what we would expect from a country wanting to be a candidate for EU membership.
. (DE) First of all, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Jacques F. Poos, on his report.
I am pleased that the Committee on Foreign Affairs has taken up my key demand, namely that the adoption of the Community acquis concerning equality between women and men is an indispensable condition for membership.
However, I wish to voice my disappointment, and that of the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, that other specific demands have been disregarded.
In this context, I should stress that the employment rate among women in Cyprus is far lower than the Community average.
Measures are required to promote women' s access to training and employment, improve the situation of women in the jobs market and help them to achieve a better balance between life and work.
I therefore think it is regrettable that Cyprus is not taking part in the Community programme on equal opportunities for women and men.
Given that it is considered the country that has made most progress in negotiation of the chapters concerning the Community acquis, it is hoped that in the first national programme for adoption of the Community acquis, Cyprus will confirm its involvement.
In the EU Member States, the concept of gender mainstreaming has been incorporated systematically into the most important policies and reforms undertaken in recent years.
In light of Cyprus' forthcoming accession to the European Union, Cypriot legislation needs to be adapted further to bring it fully into line with the other Member States, and gender issues should be dealt with in the framework of the Karolus programme, which aims to bring about better application of the Community acquis by an exchange of national civil servants.
Finally, I should like to underline that although Cyprus does have legislation to combat trafficking in women and domestic violence, progress is still required in both these areas.
.
(NL) Unfortunately, I am unable to support the Poos report because it assumes that the government which rules Greek-speaking southern Cyprus, is also authorised to conduct negotiations on the country' s accession to the EU on behalf of the Turkish-speaking north.
In the fifties, I shared the view that an undivided and independent Cyprus would be preferable to an island carved up between Greece and Turkey following decolonisation.
Unfortunately, this Cypriot state of unity which was established in 1960 did not appear to be viable and fell apart as early as 1964.
During my visits to Cyprus in 1964 and 1966, it was already clear to me how foreign troops, by UN order, kept the regions occupied by different population groups separated.
This was therefore long before the Turkish occupation of the north in 1974.
I do not expect that the withdrawal of that army will result in the Turkish-speaking minority wishing to rely again on the Greek-speaking majority.
A peaceful solution on the basis of free will is now only possible thanks to a confederation.
If the EU renders it necessary to take the north from the Turkish population, war will follow.
I denounce this war and the ensuing split between victors and vanquished.
Stenzel report (A5-0262/2001)
I too voted for the report on Malta, Madam President, and I have seen that point 8 of the report, on page 7, calls upon Malta "to introduce legislation against discrimination pursuant to Article 13 of the EU Treaty" .
But Madam President, we are asking Malta to do something that Italy, for example, has not done!"
In Italy, there is discrimination against the disabled and sick who are over 65 years old, who are not entitled to an allowance, and the sick who are less than 65 years old, who are entitled to an allowance.
I cannot see any difference between a disabled person over 65 and a disabled person under 65!
Collins report (A5-0249/2001)
This last report concerns the communication on the protection of passengers who travel by air.
This time, a pensioner, Mr Roberto Roberti, came to my aid.
As we left the aeroplane together in Strasbourg, he said to me: "What a horrible meal we had on the plane!
I wish they would serve Parma ham, spaghetti with pesto from Genoa, polenta from Veneto and sweet-smelling tomatoes from Naples!"
Well it is now lunch time, Madam President, and what better way to conclude the morning' s work than by saying "Buon appetito!"
.
(FR) We have approved several points in this report that are likely to bring about an improvement in air passenger protection, but we have not voted for it in its entirety because:
it seeks to exonerate airlines from a whole range of shortcomings by shifting fault onto airports and air traffic control, yet it is the fact that all airlines operate in order to make a profit that puts passengers at risk;
the deregulation and liberalisation of the air sector, on which this report mistakenly heaps praise, have stepped up this quest for profit and, as a consequence, have multiplied the problems arising from such an approach, for both passengers and airline workers.
It shows utter disregard for everyone involved to believe, as stated in the report, that passenger safety can be improved without affecting competition and to count on the voluntary commitment of the airline companies.
We wish to give notice that we have voted against Mr Collins' s report, not because we are opposed to providing information to customers or because we consider these issues to be unimportant but because we consider that these are issues which ought not to be discussed in the European Parliament.
. (DE) European air travel is expanding rapidly, and this trend is likely to continue in the coming years.
Protecting users of air transport, i.e. passengers, and guaranteeing their safety, health and consumers' rights are becoming more and more important as air transport increases, especially as the new possibilities for travellers to book and buy airline tickets via the Internet offer advantages but also pose risks.
The Commission' s proposal on which the report is based offers better protection to air transport users, especially as regards access to information about their rights as passengers.
It also offers the airlines the opportunity to enter into voluntary commitments with the airports.
I especially welcome the proposed strengthening of the legal framework to protect consumers, as it sets forth clear, binding and legally enforceable rules which must be complied with by all the airlines.
Experience has shown that these framework rules are essential so that air passengers are fully aware of their legal rights in the event of a dispute.
This does not mean that I am against voluntary commitments on principle, but I would prefer legally enforceable rules to govern the relationship between the airline and the airport as well.
This is not envisaged in the report, however.
The question which therefore arises is this: who is to regulate compliance with the voluntary commitments, and what methods should be used to address non-compliance?
Based on these considerations, we also support Mr Collins' demand that any issues which cannot be settled satisfactorily in the interests of consumers through voluntary commitments should be dealt with in separate proposals at a later date.
On behalf of my group, I therefore support Mr Collins' report.
. I warmly welcome Mr Collins' s report which calls on the European Commission to allocate research funding to study risks to long haul air passengers.
In view of current concerns over the health risks on long haul flights, such as deep vein thrombosis, this report comes at a fitting time.
The report also goes so far as to recommend additional measures aimed at protecting the rights of all European citizens, such as those with disabilities.
I fully support this. In addition, the report' s recommendation to appoint an EU air passenger ombudsman, to whom passengers can complain when encountering problems with airlines, would go some way towards empowering European citizens who have encountered problems with European airlines.
Finally, the call for a more simple procedure for logging complaints would simplify and demystify the complaints procedure for European citizens.
This would be a victory for ordinary citizens against big business.
Schmid report (A5-264/2001)
- (FR) We voted against this report, in protest not just at its accommodating attitude to the Echelon system, although we are not so ridiculous as to hope that the European Parliament can influence the decision of those who set it up, but above all in protest at the whole system of relations between states, as well as between financial and industrial groups, of which worldwide espionage is but one of the many consequences.
In their competing efforts to systematically bleed the planet, the big powers use political and military espionage as an instrument of their rivalry.
The industrial and commercial secrecy extolled by all the defenders of the capitalist system in order to conceal from their people the many ways in which they appropriate and waste the riches of society is inevitably accompanied by industrial espionage.
All these practices, in which every state that has the means to do so participates, infringe the democratic freedoms and rights of the individual.
Basically, this report' s only concern is to protect European industrialists from the handicap of their American rivals discovering their little secrets via the Echelon system.
Even the changes introduced by some of the amendments for which we voted do not alter our opposition to the report as a whole or our disagreement with all the minority opinions, the most innocent of which differ from the majority text only in the derisory desire to improve, control or enhance the morality of a system that can neither be controlled nor made more moral.
And we are certainly not claiming to be defenders of 'the logic of the free market' , which is nothing but the law of the jungle.
- (FR) I was one of those who had called for a committee of inquiry.
For the sake of efficiency, I then endorsed the idea of a temporary committee.
Today, I have no regrets!
Our committee (of which I was a member) did sterling work and Mr Gerhard Schmid, its rapporteur, proved highly capable.
A few months ago, most of the political leaders quite simply denied the existence of Echelon.
Now, in early September 2001, everyone (or nearly everyone) recognises that this American illegal espionage network covers much of the world and is 'watching' the commercial markets and the citizens' private lives!
True, this system is 'performing' less well than might have been feared, but it exists and that is intolerable!
The rapporteur proposes measures.
Several groups find them inadequate.
I can understand the views of some of them, because they are true democrats.
But I will not be told what to do by people, especially from the extreme right, who 'could not care two hoots' about the freedoms of the individual.
For me, what is important, indeed fundamental, is to bring this matter into the public arena.
Nothing will ever really be the same again, whether in regard to the WTO negotiations, the development of new technologies or research (see my amendments to the Sixth Research Framework Programme)!
Nobody will be able to pretend they did not know!
Thanks to the excellent Schmid report, which I endorse, our fight in this area is only just beginning.
- (DA) We have voted against the report from the Temporary Committee on the ECHELON interception system.
The report has a positive aspect, but all too many negative ones.
The positive aspect is the Committee' s confirmation that ECHELON exists.
Among the negative aspects, the following three points, in particular, must be emphasised:
1.
In spite of the Committee' s conclusion that ECHELON does in fact exist, no precise political consequences of this have been successfully formulated.
In our view, that is the least that could have been expected of a politically elected assembly.
2.
The committee has chosen to focus upon the illegal interception of communications from private businesses and completely plays down the serious infringement of the right to privacy as formulated in, for example, the European Convention on Human Rights.
What is more, the Committee draws no political conclusions in this area other than that the obligation under the Human Rights Convention to safeguard citizens' fundamental rights is also of benefit to individual citizens, who are urged to use encryption to protect themselves against the illegal interception of communications.
3.
The Committee observes that one Member State is participating in the ECHELON cooperation on the illegal interception of communications.
On this issue too, however, it does not draw any political conclusions at all. On the contrary, it encourages speeding up the development of European cooperation on intelligence matters - a form of cooperation in which the ECHELON country, Great Britain, is free to participate if it so wishes.
We are disappointed in the outcome of the Committee' s work.
The European Parliament has not complied with its responsibility to strengthen human rights.
The fight for human rights is seemingly strongest when solemn speeches have to be made.
When it comes to practical action, citizens' rights are subordinated to the interests of private enterprise.
. (PT) The report of the European Parliament' s Temporary Committee on the Echelon case states that there is no longer any doubt about the existence of a worldwide communications interception system involving the participation of the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, but seeks to play down its reach and capacity and fails to understand all the serious consequences of the existence of an indiscriminate communications interception system, and for this reason, I have voted against the report.
It is unacceptable that a network should be maintained for the gathering and processing, in a secret and completely unmonitored way, of potentially any type of information, specifically political, economic and military, which clearly breaches the fundamental right to respect for privacy, enshrined in Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights and in Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union, which demonstrates the need to completely dismantle this global telecommunications interception network.
Although the report suggests some measures for developing systems and adopting protection mechanisms, specifically to protect privacy, in the face of this system - and other, similar ones... and although it discusses measures of cooperation between Member States, which must take place at judicial level and not be information-gathering measures, on the basis of case-by-case analysis, under the supervision of the courts or even measures for monitoring information systems, particularly by national parliaments, what lies at the heart of all of this is that the system will continue to function and that an EU-level information system could be created and integrated into the CFSP and the CESDP, which is equally unacceptable.
It is incomprehensible that in the report' s conclusions, no request is even made to the United Kingdom to disassociate itself from the Echelon system and to Germany to close the interception base located in its territory.
It is deplorable that the EU is more deeply concerned with industrial espionage than with the monitoring of individuals and is quite nonchalant about the fact that some Member States have a system for spying on other Member States, with the participation and possible control of third countries, specifically the USA.
. Given that Parliament voluntarily limited itself in the nature of the Enquiry, there is much to be welcomed in this Report.
I am pleased that ECHELON' s existence is recognised and that the need for transparent international agreements is acknowledged.
However, there are 3 main reasons why I voted against the Report.
Firstly, I believe that member states involved in ECHELON must disengage from this murky, undemocratic system - the report does not make this clear.
Secondly, I feel there is a calm acceptance in this Report that the EU must run an intelligence system as part of the CFSP.
I believe that the CFSP threatens freedoms such as open access to information and personal privacy.
We know that, whatever the safeguards on paper, these do not always apply in practice.
Thirdly, the implications of such systems for individuals are not clear.
While the report says much about the need for protection of privacy and monitoring of the secret services, what should the individual do?
They can no longer communicate in confidence.
There is no real answer.
Thus, I cannot support the report.
- (FR) The main effect of Mr Schmid' s voluminous report is almost to make us forget the original question.
In fact, neither the rapporteur' s talent nor the courtesy of the chairman of this committee can make us forget that the strategy followed throughout was to drown the fundamental questions in a general debate which, ranging from moral judgments about the activities of the secret services to doubtful statements about technological matters, attempted to cover everything and everybody except Echelon and those who help to run it.
Yet at a time when the process of European integration is so clearly running out of steam, such fundamental questions would have deserved better than this deafening silence.
And we will certainly have to pose them again.
Firstly, to the extent that it has been shown that EU Member States participate in Echelon, does this whole business not amount to anything more than a blatant violation of the EU Treaty?
And if so, what sanctions are being envisaged?
The rapporteur answered yes to the first question.
But what consequences did he draw from this?
None, because he did not even address the tough but logical issue of sanctions, not even to explain why he refused to contemplate them.
So people are sleeping easy in London and Berlin, because this Parliament, normally so prompt to be roused to indignation by the slightest attack on the constitutional state in any of the four corners of the world, has not even remonstrated about a blatant violation of the principles of the Treaty!
Secondly, since it has become clear during our activities that the European Union cannot embark on any large-scale defence and security operation without technical and logistical support from NATO, is there any point in laying the foundations for a European system equivalent to Echelon without first giving a political clarification of the relations between the European states that are members of Echelon and the Union, and in particular between the Union and NATO?
For the real source of the rapporteur' s embarrassment is indeed the fact that so long as the EU so obviously remains technically and financially shackled to NATO, the supposed European solidarity will give way to Atlantic solidarity, the sequel to the cold war, which is incompatible with the existence of an independent, European common defence and security policy.
The plain fact is that the majority of this Parliament - the same Parliament that adopted preventive 'apartheid' measures against the new, democratically elected Austrian government, that seriously considered placing Silvio Berlusconi' s government under surveillance - is refusing to take measures against Member States that have now been proven to be supporting an activity that contravenes the provisions of the Treaty, that does serious damage to European firms and represents a permanent threat to individual freedoms.
The least one could say is that there are indisputably two weights and two measures and that to be fair we can only describe this business as a real scandal.
Yet for once, looking at the real problems raised by Echelon, we could have held a genuine debate on the basic principles and objectives of European integration: we could have seen the European nations for what they are, with their own history and their own loyalties.
We could have asked ourselves what type of Europe we wanted to build.
The answer this gives us by default - a Europe shrouded in fog and in words left unsaid, a coward that submits to the law of the strongest - is, in many respects, quite dismaying.
.
(NL) A few years ago, the existence of ECHELON was still emphatically denied.
After all, the organisation was secret, and the objective of such secrecy is to prevent the people from knowing of its existence.
Such a state of affairs is, of course, completely at odds with democratic decision making, transparency, public order and the protection of individuals.
It is a major step forward that it is now openly being admitted that an EU Member State has been working with the United States, Australia and New Zealand on worldwide espionage for a long time, something which may well adversely affect people, organisations and businesses within the EU.
However, the report does not draw any worthwhile conclusions from this.
It accepts that as a result of the outcome of the Second World War, with the United States playing a dominant role in Western Europe, such agreements were made and that these have persisted through time.
The conclusion should be that the United Kingdom should choose between membership with the EU and that of ECHELON, that cooperation with this system on the part of citizens of EU Member States will be penalised, that similar espionage systems of other Member States will be abandoned and that telephone traffic will no longer be tapped.
The passive stance of a two-thirds majority of this Parliament is sanctioning a Europe of snoopers.
I do not agree with this.
. (IT) I voted against the motion with great indignation: we would never have imagined that we might be spied on as Europeans, as free citizens, as businesses, not just by our Nato allies but even by our European partners as well.
There needs to be an enquiry into the United Kingdom' s behaviour in order to understand fully not just the government' s responsibilities but also what European sentiments link the United Kingdom to the rest of the European Union and even whether these sentiments and political will actually exist.
There are certain questions we must ask. Since this espionage system exists, why was it not used to prevent the violence which took place during the international summits, most recently the summits in Gothenburg and Genoa?
It there any plan to dismantle the system or to make it democratically useful to all so that we can achieve even the globalisation of personal thoughts?
How are the United Kingdom, and Germany too, going to explain this betrayal to the European citizens?
Could it be that the slowdown in European cohesion, which is becoming increasingly politically and culturally insipid and increasingly weak economically, is partly caused by new information being received and disseminated using Echelon?
These are important questions which require a committee of inquiry to be set up.
- (FR) There are two main reasons why I am opposed to the motion for a resolution drawn up on behalf of Parliament' s Temporary Committee on the Echelon interception system.
On the one hand, the proposal for a covenant between the European Union and the United States hardly seems relevant for, however good the intentions, it would most likely have no practical effect.
At the same time, if, as its supporters say, Echelon can act as an effective multilateral instrument in the fight against organised crime, terrorism, drugs and arms trafficking and money laundering, then it is not a covenant of mutual good intentions that we need to sign with the United States.
What we need to negotiate is the means of enabling every state that wishes to be involved in active international cooperation in these essential areas to join the Echelon system, which would thus become an open system.
On the other hand, the motion for a resolution is used as a pretext to address a whole range of questions that have no bearing whatsoever on the temporary committee' s real task.
In the midst of this hotchpotch we come across paragraph 5, which reflects the federalist obsession with seeing the next IGC make the Charter of Fundamental Rights legally binding, so that it can constitute a legal basis for appeal, as though the existing protection guaranteed both by national constitutions and by the universal and European declarations on human rights were null and void.
This really is a distortion of the debate on Echelon that cannot be accepted.
. (IT) The Italian socialist delegation and the other socialist Members, particularly the French socialist Members, abstained from the final vote on the Schmid report.
I too abstained from the vote, and I would like to explain why. I have good reason to believe my views are shared by the other Members.
I find it absolutely incomprehensible, not to say outrageous, that the European Parliament, particularly the Group of the Party of European Socialists, to which I belong, should have rejected certain amendments - the ones I referred to when I spoke during the debate: Nos 16, 17, 18, 19 and 22 - which seek explicitly to emphasise that large-scale, indiscriminate interceptions such as those performed by Echelon are a blatant violation of the human rights recognised by the European Convention on Human Rights and other international conventions.
In rejecting these amendments, with the support of the majority of socialists, Parliament has implicitly made it possible - although it may not be completely aware of this - for the private communications of European citizens henceforth to be listened in to by Echelon and similar systems 24 hours a day, with no respect for the principles of legality and proportionality upheld by the European Convention on Human Rights and our Charter of Fundamental Rights.
I call upon the Council and the Commission, who are more aware of the need to respect the principles enshrined in the Treaties, to correct this dangerous drift.
(The sitting was suspended at 1.43 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
Conclusions of the G8 meeting in Genoa
The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the conclusions of the G8 meeting in Genoa.
Madam President-in-Office of the Council, I give you the floor.
Madam President and honourable Members, I am glad to present on behalf of the President of the Commission a report on the G7/G8 summit in Genoa.
From 20 to 22 July this year, the Commission President took part in the G7/G8 summit, together with the current President of the European Council, Guy Verhofstadt.
The summit took a number of important decisions.
However, most of the media attention was focused on events taking place outside the summit, on the city streets.
These events confirmed that the G8 needs to engage in a genuine dialogue with civil society and with non-member countries.
Demonstrators must have the opportunity to express their opinions.
This is an inalienable right not only guaranteed in law but also defended in practice.
People are genuinely uneasy about various aspects of globalisation, and we must pay attention to their concerns.
However, violence disfigures any demonstration, even one held in an honourable cause.
We cannot allow peaceful demonstrators expressing genuine fears and concerns to be tarred with the same brush as those who commit acts of violence.
To combat violence, whether at Gothenburg or Genoa, we need to improve European cooperation in the field of law and order.
The Justice and Home Affairs Council discussed these issues in late July, and the events at Genoa show how urgent it now is to take action.
But I would like to remind all of you that according to Article 33 of the Treaty the primary responsibility for the maintenance of law and order lies with the Member States.
Member States recognise, however, that better cooperation is required between their law enforcement and judicial authorities in order to safeguard public order at European Council meetings and similar events.
The decisions of the Justice and Home Affairs Council were built upon the existing structures and existing legal instruments, which means that there will be no specific institutions to deal with these issues.
It goes without saying that the Commission has always stressed the need for all police and judicial actions to respect the civil and human rights of the citizens and the legislation providing for privacy protection and for the respect of civil liberties.
We have to reflect on a political response to the two hundred thousand demonstrators in Genoa.
It is the profound belief of the Commission that the Union should promote an active dialogue with bona fide organisations which peacefully exercise their rights to freely express opinion and assemble.
We believe that the European Parliament should play a major role in promoting this dialogue.
The demonstrators want us to tackle the widening gulf between the northern and southern hemispheres of our world, a gulf created by inequality, poverty, disease and war.
In spite of our efforts and even some achievements over the past forty years, tragic disparities and social injustice remain and we have a long way to go in overcoming them.
This is the challenge not only for the G8 but also for our Europe in the years and decades ahead.
The Union has to support those political leaders, especially in Africa, who are on the side of democracy.
It has to prevent illegal trafficking in arms between the North and the South.
And it has to implement policies that strengthen the economies of the poorest nations.
Policies such as the "Everything but Arms" initiative that has opened up our markets to products from the least-developed countries are a good example of this approach.
Fortunately, public opinion today is increasingly concerned about where the world is going and people recognise that this North-South inequality cannot be tolerated.
The Commission is well aware of the growing importance of civil society and is eager to involve citizens' associations and NGOs in shaping and implementing EU policies.
As the Commission President said yesterday, when discussing governance in this plenary, "the Union is still the only concrete, practical and democratic response to globalisation" .
It is therefore essential that the European institutions operate on the basis of five fundamental principles: openness, participation, accountability, effectiveness and coherence.
We need to engage in an open and systematic dialogue with civil society and to involve all stakeholders in designing the Union' s policies.
It is also essential to strengthen the Union' s voice and influence in the world so that Europe can make a greater contribution to international prosperity and stability.
Multilateral institutions are the key to harnessing globalisation, but of course we underline that we want to help reform the multilateral organisations, making them more open, more accountable and more democratic.
In this connection, a particularly important event took place in Genoa - the "outreach" meeting with leaders of several non-member countries.
This was a very useful meeting, enabling important representatives of southern countries to express their views directly and frankly and to discuss matters openly with the G8 Heads of State and Government.
As a result, the G8 decided to make Africa one of the main topics of next year' s summit in Canada.
The Commission for its part can be satisfied with several of the decisions taken at Genoa.
The documents on trade, food safety, climate change and communicable diseases, as well as the emphasis on Africa, by and large reflect the Commission' s preparatory contributions to the summit.
On trade, there was complete agreement on the need to launch a new round of talks at the ministerial conference in Doha in November.
This view was, by the way, reiterated last week in Mexico City.
During the discussion on trade, President Putin stated that Russia was ready to follow the example set by the European Union in its "Everything But Arms" initiative.
On food safety, the European side successfully insisted that the final Communication include a reference to the precautionary principle.
The G8 had a very long discussion on climate change, opening the way for the conclusions reached at Bonn a few days later and I believe you have discussed these conclusions at this part session.
The summit also provided an opportunity to launch the global health fund.
The purpose of this international fund, which will not be limited to the G8 countries, is to help reduce poverty by dealing with the problem of AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis.
The Community, for its part, is committed to providing EUR 120 million.
As on every occasion when the current presidency of the Union is held by a State that is not a member of the G8, the Union was represented at the summit by the Council President and by the President of the Commission.
The tandem arrangement worked extremely well and I am pleased to be able to underline that here.
We are sensitive to the fact that several aspects of the G8 will have to be changed in the future and not just cosmetically.
The Commission, for its part, will encourage a return to the original spirit of the G8 summits.
Indeed a joint decision was taken in Genoa to reduce the size of delegations and the summit to be held in Canada next year will be much simpler and - we hope - more effective.
Madam President, it was with some satisfaction that I listened to the statements of the Council and the Commission for we have, at last, started to address the fundamental subject of the G8.
Indeed, in recent weeks, we have endeavoured to discuss issues of law and order, and we will have the opportunity to deal with this subject as well.
However, there has been very little talk of the results of the Genoa Summit, which I consider to be positive, in terms of the fight against hunger in the world, against poverty and against AIDS; positive results of a summit under Italian management which, at last, saw the President of the United States and the President of the Russian Federation in dialogue across the table: these were things we would have not have believed possible, and so a powerful message of peace issued from the G8 cities.
We would have liked to launch this debate in Parliament on the contents of the summit before the summit actually took place, but were prevented from doing so by the rejection of our proposal by many left-wing Parliamentary groups.
We are convinced that, for the first time, as Commissioner Vitorino pointed out, the G8 witnessed a focused debate on practical issues between the leaders of the world' s most industrialised countries and the leaders of the African countries, in which they discussed practical issues and also launched a project for cooperation on the proposal for African union, presented by the industrialised countries with the aim of setting up a partnership with these countries.
An operation to reduce the debt of 23 countries by USD 50 billion, which is 70% of the total debt, was launched.
The go-ahead was given for a project which seeks to modernise the countries of the developing world: this is an extremely positive development.
Positive, tangible results were achieved, but then it was attempted to turn the G8 summit into a mere question of law and order.
There is much to be said on the subject of what happened, about the exploitation even of Parliament which went on. Parliament must not become the scene of debates on major national issues; it must not become the forum for national debates.
Clearly, there can be no objection - and we must make this quite clear - to anti-globalisation demonstrations carried out using lawful methods which do not involve acts of violence, but globalisation cannot be opposed, the summits cannot be opposed through violent demonstration and attacks on the police.
The inquiries carried out by the Italian Courts reveal that European citizens, who came to Italy from elsewhere to organise violent demonstrations of the Union, are also responsible.
Mr President, I would like to end by pledging once again the support of the Italian police force and stressing the need for closer cooperation between police forces and between Ministers for the Interior. Such cooperation may have not have been adequate at the G8 summit and we must concentrate on improving in this area.
Finally, in my opinion, the proposals made in Parliament to place Italy under observation are ridiculous. Italy does not need lessons in democracy from any political grouping in Parliament.
Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the Socialist Group has requested this debate for two reasons.
The first is because the conclusions and work of the G8 summit were obscured because the debate concentrated on public order.
I must especially thank Mr Vitorino for having talked to us about the results of a summit whose agenda was set by a government, that of Olivo, in Italy, and which was discussed in the European Parliament - Mr Tajani, you were engaged in a municipal campaign, but it was discussed here - and, furthermore, we have asked for a resolution on this debate which has been replied to and denied by the PPE.
We do not understand why they want to speak but refuse a resolution.
However, in any event, ladies and gentlemen, what I would like to point out is that we clearly said that the President of the Commission and the President of the Council were in the Genoa photo and we regret that they have not had time to come to this debate if they considered it so important.
And I must point out that some positive advances have been made.
Commissioner Vitorino has referred to them.
I would say that, on the cancellation of debt, little progress has been made.
The fund for AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis is a positive step, although it is still not enough.
Africa must be a priority; also the desire for flexibility in the TRIPs Agreements and the 'everything but arms' initiative as well as the extension of the system of generalised preferences are aspects which we Europeans should be proud of and should value more.
In addition to this there is our firm position on Kyoto which, despite United States resistance, has allowed us to reach a solution in Bonn.
I believe that as a Parliament we must bring this to account and hold a debate because, furthermore, my political family, the Party of European Socialists, which is a member of the Socialist International - we are internationalists and we have been globalised since the Nineteenth Century - is an organisation which is present in 160 countries in the world, and is not just an organisation of white men, that is to say, it is an organisation of all continents.
Therefore, the issue of globalisation which, at our last congress of the International in Paris, two years ago, led to a resolution on the challenges of globalisation, must be, as far as we are concerned, a permanent element of European policy.
Lastly, a comment on issues of public order.
My group has said, from the outset, that it is awaiting the conclusion of the investigation which is being carried out in the Italian Parliament on these issues, because we respect the Parliament of an important democracy which is a member of the European Union.
This does not prevent us from demonstrating a very critical position in relation to the rights of European citizens contained in the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
There are no public order policies which restrict citizens - and I say this to the Belgian Presidency - in their right to demonstrate and give vent to their feelings.
A responsible public order policy must guarantee those rights, not repress them.
Just as football cannot be prohibited because of fights between hooligans, rights cannot be restricted because there are nuclei of provocative vandals.
A final request, Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen: to mention civil society has become so commonplace that it is almost impossible to make a political speech without talking about it.
But what I cannot understand is that people talk about speaking with civil society and then they put a comma and say, 'and with Parliament, of course' .
Society becomes civil when it elects its representatives and therefore the first duty of the President of the Council and the President of the Commission, when they go to these summits, is to come to Parliament and report on them.
Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the events of the last G8 summit in Genoa could prevent us from focusing on the genuine major issues at hand.
