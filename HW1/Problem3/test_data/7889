With good conservation and better practices, we could give a better living to more people involved in fishing.
We could increase by something like EUR 4 000 million the value of the fish landed in the European Union if we could apply a little bit more care over a period of time to our fishing activities.
This is highly technical.
It is important that we do the research, keep up the revision and gradually convince people that the European Commission is not a hostile organisation sent from afar to persecute fishermen and prevent them from making a living.
We should not use occasions like this to make inflammatory statements about the necessity of reducing the size of fleets that are involved, because of the reduction in stocks, because of the high price of fish arising out of its scarcity in the European Union and the attraction of this type of food for health reasons.
There is a great urge to go out and catch more and more of it.
People complain about the Multi-Annual Guidance Programme and say it is not working.
Surely, a transport manager will not want to keep ten buses on the road if one bus will transport the passengers available.
The same applies to trains or trucks.
So why do we get this pressure from the fishing communities to maintain large expensive fleets if, in fact, the fish are not there and we are bound by quotas?
If the quotas are being observed, surely it is in the interest of the fishing communities of the regions and the individuals involved to go out and catch these fish with the smallest possible number of fishing vessels.
Surely it contributes more to regional and national economic planning to do that.
Do not swallow this foolish talk that we want to keep boats and that somehow or other this will keep people in jobs if the fish are not there.
There were banner headlines just because the Commission published, a few days ago, a report which indicated that some fleets would have to be reduced.
Those reports spread over from Scotland to Ireland and the papers were full of massive reductions in the number of people employed.
There is no need for it.
Let us sit down, come to the Fisheries Committee, listen to the officials, listen to the researchers and work out a sensible solution to the problems instead of trying to create an atmosphere of hostility.
We have one programme broadcast in Ireland that deals with the sea.
It is called "Seascapes".
The night before we had the Maastricht Referendum, they upped their tone and the temperature of their anti-European broadcasting, which goes on continuously, in an effort to ingratiate themselves with fishing communities who have the impression that somehow or another the European Commission is there to damage their interests.
Let us, as responsible public representatives, try to present the truth to our people instead of trying to mislead them and excite them and frighten them.
Mr McCartin appeared with his last remarks to be accusing honourable Members of this House of misleading the public.
I hope that was not true.
In case it was, then I suggest that he ought to be supplied with a map of the Scottish fishing areas to see just why it is so important to a lot of places where people can take boats out from.
Mr McCartin is far too polite to make any such accusation.
May I thank Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna for this excellent report, he is an acknowledged expert on this subject - and also thank the honourable Members who have spoken on this debate and expressed their thanks for the work of the Commission.
I am very happy to inform honourable Members that the Commission can agree to the amendments that have been put forward.
It appears to me to be an excellent example of the cooperation between our two institutions on this important issue of conservation.
Apart from this, the report fully supports the Commission proposal; and therefore I feel that I need not take up any more of your valuable time.
That concludes the debate.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution) EXPLANATION OF VOTE
Mr President, as representative of the Pensioners' Party I voted for the Varela report.
It is not the first time that I have intervened on behalf of young fish, but I do so because I would like them to have the chance to grow old and, if possible, become pensioners.
I have already received satisfied feedback, not only from fish, but also from human pensioners, for it is right to protect the young, even if they are only fish, as is the case here.
It is true that this could cause problems for a few fishermen who can no longer catch such large numbers of fish, but I am sure that the Commission will find a way to compensate the fishermen whose income will fall as a result of their observance of this directive.
I would like to thank the House for its patience in listening to my explanations of votes.
Mr President, I should just like to say that I hope the Conference of Presidents will take serious note of the numbers - or rather lack of numbers - of Members in the Chamber voting on that very important report.
Mr President, I would like to draw to the attention of Parliament' s administration the fact that the Members' coffee bar has been occupied.
There are fifteen people there in military uniform who have taken over one end of the coffee bar and are holding some kind of meeting there.
I should like Parliament' s administration to take immediate steps to put an end to this occupation, so that Members can have the use of both ends of their coffee bar.
You are right, the Members Bar is only for the use of Members.
We will ensure that is enforced.
This matter has already been drawn to the attention of the Quaestors.
Insurance
The next item is the report (A5-0104/2000) by Mr Langen on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the report from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on the operation of Commission Regulation No 3932/92 concerning the application of Article 81 (ex-Article 85), Paragraph 3, of the Treaty to certain categories of agreements, decisions and concerted practices in the field of insurance (COM(1999) 192 - C5.0254/1999 - 1999/2183(COS))
Mr President, this time the subject at the close of the sitting is not fisheries, but competition policy. We have discussed this subject in great depth.
It has not been too controversial, so it is also possible to discuss it at the end of such a sitting.
Since I am often here on Fridays anyway, I personally do not find this at all difficult.
The subject is exemption regulations, which are in force for the European insurance industry.
You all know that competition law has been one of the most important objectives of the European Union - and therefore of the European Commission - since the founding Treaties came into existence.
The general aim of competition law is to ensure that there is competition in the European Internal Market.
This serves consumers, promotes technical progress, and prevents monopolies and agreements.
Therefore, the rules on this are strict.
The Commission can and must take action in accordance with the rules, which have three different spheres of application: agreements or cartel agreements which are generally prohibited, abuse of a dominant market position, and public subsidies.
Over the past few years, the Commission, on all these issues, has repeatedly shown that it takes the provisions of the Treaties very seriously.
We will deal with the first of these areas today.
The general prohibition of cartel agreements is lifted under certain conditions; these are the exemption regulations.
Price fixing, restrictions on, or control of, production, dividing up markets, application of different prerequisites for the same services and the extra provisions of the Treaties, which often vary tremendously in Europe and exclude different services, are incompatible with the laws, even in the areas where exemption regulations apply.
Under Article 81(3), exemption regulations only apply - please listen carefully - when consumers receive an appropriate share of the benefit generated and no unnecessary restrictions ruling out competition are imposed.
A regulation of this kind has existed in the field of insurance since 1992, and expires in 2003.
The Commission is required to submit a situation report every six years. The present report is available.
The Block Exemption Regulation for the insurance industry lays down and permits common rules governing agreement on the calculation of premiums, the stipulation of policy conditions, joint coverage of certain types of risk, and safety precautions.
To date, agreements on claims settlement and registers of aggravated risks have not been included.
I hope that when the Rothley report on the harmonisation of civil liability insurance in respect of the use of motor vehicles is adopted after the third reading on Monday, the Commission can, and will, also incorporate - on account of the harmonised legal basis - the settlement of claims into this future exemption regulation.
It will then be much easier for European Union citizens, in future, to be able to settle claims abroad, including in EU Member States, with their own insurers, safe in the knowledge that these agreements are also then guaranteed by the Commission within the framework of the exemption regulation.
Parliament has made unanimous demands on the Commission in its proposal. These should be taken into consideration by the Commission when examining the proposal.
This concerns, firstly, the definition of market share in a globalised market, followed by detailed questions about the lead insurer, for whom this might not apply.
When there is one large and 20 small insurers, then the large one may not have more than 10 per cent of the market share for the exemption agreement to be accepted.
Whether this is correct or not is doubtful.
This concerns matters which are connected with the possibility of termination.
We want the notice period for an insurance company to be 6 months and not 12, and we want to bring about a harmonised basis for European standards in the settlement of claims.
All in all, I can say that Parliament is satisfied with this interim report and that it expects the Commission to make continuous progress on this matter and achieve an end result for the insurance industry within the framework of the exemption regulations in force, all of which expire in 2002 and 2003, including for other areas.
With this in mind, I would urge you to give your assent. Thank you very much.
Affairs and the Internal Market. I would particularly like to express my own gratitude to Mr Langen for his report and for the great clarity with which, in writing and in his presentation today, he has brought to our attention what this is all about.
I am glad to say that the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market is in substantial agreement with Mr Langen and finds no legal obstacles to this bloc exemption regulation.
As Members of the House will know, the bloc exemption creates exemptions from normal competition law, of the kind Mr Langen mentioned, in relation to the calculation of premiums where net premiums may be jointly calculated by insurers.
Secondly, in the establishment of standard policy conditions for direct insurance and common models illustrating profits from insurance policies involving an element of capitalisation.
It also creates an exemption to make possible co-insurance, common coverage of certain risks and, finally, the coordination of technical specifications for safety equipment and procedures.
The Commission says in its report that it is disappointed that the insurance industry has not taken up as much of that as it might have done.
These are all areas where it seems clear that there is a genuine public interest in not insisting on the strictest rigours of competition law.
What that draws to our attention, in a philosophical way, is that even in a competitive market, insurance is inherently a collective activity in which people share risks among themselves.
If I might make a remark about a currently controversial topic in my own country, I think it is a pity to see such vigorous efforts being made to de-mutualise excellent old mutual assurance companies which fully express the collective aspect of insurance, and I am sad to think of a raid being made on the Standard Life in this way.
Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Langen, and all those who have contributed to this draft resolution on the Commission's report on the operation of the insurance block exemption regulation.
The Commission welcomes the draft resolution, not only for its overall support concerning the Commission's application of the regulation, but also for the specific comments which it contains on how the regulation can be improved.
A brief word of background about the regulation in question is perhaps in order.
Before 1992, the competition directorate-general of the Commission was submerged by literally hundreds of notifications of agreements in the insurance field, many of which raised similar issues and were eligible for an exemption under Article 81(3) of the Treaty.
Rather than adopting hundreds of individual exemption decisions, the Commission adopted in 1992 a block exemption regulation granting exemption, with conditions, to agreements between insurance undertakings in four categories: agreements concerning the joint calculation of risk premiums, those concerning standard policy conditions, co-insurance and reinsurance, pooling arrangements and agreements adopting standards for safety equipment.
The Council Regulation of 1991 enabling the Commission to adopt an insurance block exemption regulation also authorised the inclusion of two further areas which the Commission, however, decided not to include in its regulation for lack of experience in those areas, namely agreements on claims settlement and agreements on registers of aggravated risk.
Following the adoption of the Block Exemption Regulation in 1992, most of the notifications on the Commission's table were withdrawn, but some were not, as the notifying parties considered that the regulation did not provide total clarity as to whether their agreements were eligible for exemption.
Most of these notifications concerned insurance pools.
The current regulation expires on 31 March 2003 and a new regulation will be necessary.
The future regulation should build on these strengths and remedy any weaknesses in the existing one.
The report produced by the Commission on 12 May 1999, which it was pursuant to Article 8 of the Council enabling regulation, was the first step in the process leading to the adoption of a new regulation.
It summarises in detail the experience of the Commission in applying the regulation and the various problems it has identified.
It does not, however, contain precise proposals for the future regulation.
These will only be decided upon after the end of the consultation process.
Considerable account will be taken of Parliament's resolution in this process.
Other interested parties, including professional insurance bodies and consumer organisations, will also be consulted.
The next step in the consultation will be a hearing organised by the Commission on 28 June of this year for an exchange of views between all those who have submitted comments on the report on the regulation.
This hearing responds in part to the call in the draft resolution for an informative debate on the regulation.
It is clear that the area in which most improvement to the regulation is needed is that of pools.
Significant change will be necessary here, but key questions exist in all the other areas.
The comments and suggestions contained in the draft resolution, for which I thank Parliament, are all relevant and interesting in this context, although each of them will have to be analysed individually and on its merits.
May I just respond at this stage to two issues of a similar nature raised by both Mr Langen and Mr Meijer, and that is the question whether the Commission accepts the draft opinion's recommendation that agreements on claims settlement should be included in the future block exemption regulation.
The Commission has an open mind at this stage as to whether agreements on claim settlement and agreements on registers of aggravated risks should be covered by the future regulation.
It takes good note of the fact that the draft opinion recommends the inclusion of agreements and on claims settlement.
The conclusion of the draft resolution that the regulation has been successful overall, but that a moderate enhancement is needed, is one that the Commission entirely shares.
The draft resolution is a most helpful contribution to this end and the Commission will keep Parliament fully informed and consulted on the process of revising the regulation.
That concludes the debate.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
(Parliament adopted the resolution) EXPLANATION OF VOTE
Mr President, I have, of course, voted for Mr Langen' s excellent report, and I congratulate him on his work and also on his report.
Both the public and ourselves are obviously pleased with the simplifications he has explained so clearly.
I would like for this to be the case in other areas as well.
You know that I am a great advocate of Parliament' s seat in Strasbourg and I have also regretted all the fuss again made this morning by those who wanted to prevent us from voting today, because they simply want to ruin the Friday sittings in Strasbourg and for everything to be concentrated in Brussels.
And these centralists are also, of course, setting their sights on Luxembourg - as a by-product so to speak - for Parliament' s Secretariat.
Certainly, I must also say that this does not always make things easy for France to defend Strasbourg as a parliamentary seat.
One of my groups of visitors found this out again on their way here this morning.
Their bus was stopped by the French police under the pretext that the driver would not have a French driving licence.
This particular company has transported thousands of my visitors here in the past ten years.
What is going on here then?
I must say that these visitors wonder, naturally, whether this is what Europe is all about.
Moreover, the French police do not seem to have heard of credit cards yet.
The visitors had to pool their French francs together to pay the horrendous FRF 5 000 fine.
This cannot be right, Mr President!
I will, of course, check ...
(The President cut the speaker off)
I am afraid I must cut you off, Mrs Lulling.
Explanations of vote must refer to the subject of the debate.
I gave you some leeway as you are such a distinguished Member of the House but I must cut you off there.
Mr President, last Sunday in Bergamo, my native town, I held a meeting on insurance and compensation for damages, which Mr Langen discussed in his report.
A young 20-year old, who had, sadly, suffered a serious road accident, rose to his feet and said: "I have suffered this serious road accident but I am, so to speak, content because I have received EUR 500 000 from the insurance company" .
Another person present at the meeting, who was about 40 years of age, said: "I suffered exactly the same road accident, but I only received EUR 200 000.
"An older man who was about 60 added: "I only received EUR 20 000" .
Another man who was about 70 years old said: "I suffered the same accident with the same results, and I was given EUR 1 000" .
An elderly 80-year old pensioner, who could not even get out of his chair because he was so disabled, said: "I did not receive anything at all from the insurance" .
There you have it. Insurance companies consider that the elderly are worthless.
But I say that the elderly are worth more.
I therefore call for measures to be included in the regulation that will put a stop to this injustice.
Mr President, I just wanted to ask one question.
I did not notice Mrs Buitenweg this morning and I would like to apologise to her for that.
I just wanted to ask whether Mrs van der Laan is here or have I missed her as well?
I will take that as an interesting intervention.
Adjournment of the session
I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament.
(The sitting closed at 11.30 a.m.)
Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday, 19 May 2000.
Tribute
We are very sad to hear of the death of Mrs Adelaide Aglietta on 20 May 2000 in Rome.
We all remember that throughout her intense political activity Mrs Aglietta was the political secretary of the Italian Radical Party.
She was Co-President of the Group of the Greens between 1990 and 1994.
She was tireless in leading a number of campaigns, particularly those promoting a federal Europe and human rights.
Mrs Adelaide Aglietta was a very courageous woman.
In the first place, she had the courage of her convictions and argued passionately in favour of them, but always with respect for the other party.
In spite of her long illness, she continued to pursue her political and parliamentary activities working tirelessly on her report on comitology and stubbornly continuing negotiations with the Commission and the Council until May 1999.
I may say that, for all of us, she will continue to be a model of courage and dedication to Parliament and to Europe, and I therefore ask you to observe a minute' s silence in her memory.
(The House rose and observed a minute' s silence)
Statement by the President
Ladies and gentlemen, since our last part-session, the European Union has been hit by blind and brutal terrorism once again: in Greece, with the murder of Brigadier Stephen Saunders, military attachÃ© at the British Embassy, killed by the terrorist group 'November 17' and in Spain, with the murder of Jesus Maria Pedrosa, a municipal councillor in the Basque Country.
In this way, for the third time in a few months, terrorism has once again attempted to silence the people in this region who continue to fight by democratic means to defend their freedom of expression and to work to promote the right to live in peace.
On the very day that these murders occurred, I felt bound, both in a personal capacity and on behalf of the European Parliament, to express our deepest sympathy and sincere condolences to the families of the victims.
I also assured the governments concerned of our utmost support in their fight against terrorism.
I am about to propose a minute' s silence as a tribute to the two victims but, as a stronger expression of our solidarity, I should like to tell you that I am quite prepared, if the Spanish authorities and the Spanish Members of the House deem it useful and appropriate, to visit the Basque Country to convey the constant message of this unanimous House, which is our utter condemnation of terrorism and our disgust at these barbarous and cowardly acts, and our support for all those who fight courageously, at the risk of their own lives, to ensure that peace and democracy finally triumph in the Spanish Basque Country.
(The House rose and observed a minute' s silence)
Madam President, I believe we must take good note of the fact that a representative of Euskal Herritarrok has expressed his regret at the murder of an honourable local councillor in the Basque Country.
All that remains in this case is for him to also condemn political methods such as shooting people in the back or in the back of the neck, because, Madam President, the Spanish Basque Country, which has the greatest degree of self-government of any Autonomous Region in the European Union, is unfortunately the only place in the European Union where this barbaric and condemnable political method still persists.
Madam President, on a point of order, on behalf of Euskal Herritarrok I would like to express my regrets at the death of JesÃºs MarÃ­a Pedrosa.
We should like to show our solidarity with the family and friends of the deceased.
Once again political confrontation shows its most dreadful aspect.
We are witnessing tragic moments, in human and political terms, that demand of all of us not to fall into uselessly reiterated condemnations which do not offer anything in the search for solutions.
We should remember that Nelson Mandela, winner of the Nobel Prize and of the Sakharov Prize, was imprisoned for 27 years because he refused to condemn the violent actions of the ANC.
The leaders of Sinn Fein have never condemned the IRA's violence.
This clear attitude has permitted a political breakthrough to a definitive settlement in the bloody conflicts in South Africa and Northern Ireland.
We in Euskal Herritarrok will stick to our commitment to work together with all those eager to find a democratic solution to the ongoing conflict in the Basque country.
Could we in this Parliament at last look for something new that will help a political dialogue in the Basque country, something similar to the Downing Street Declaration?
Madam President, I am grateful for your political will and for your willingness to go to the Basque Country so that the European Parliament' s anti-terrorist commitment may be clearly demonstrated to the Spanish, and particularly the Basque, public.
On the other hand, I believe that the words of the MEP from Euskal Herritarrok are a disgrace.
The MEP in question has no right to class himself alongside Mandela.
Nelson Mandela deserves a different kind of respect.
We heard Mandela in the European Parliament. He fought against violence and represented the legitimate interests of his people.
The legitimate interests of the Basque people are represented by the people who have been democratically elected.
I must tell the whole of Parliament, as Mr BarÃ³n Crespo has already done, that Mr Gorostiaga' s party sometimes goes as far as to regret the deaths caused by terrorists, perhaps because it has no choice, but it does not condemn them.
This attitude has even led the democratic nationalist parties to break municipal coalitions with Euskal Herritarrok because it is not possible to accept and comprehend the shot in the back and continual violence as political methods.
Words are insufficient when it comes to condemning not only the murderers, but also those who give them political support.
Madam President, I would also like to add my voice to those who this morning do not wish the current conflict in the Basque Country to be misinterpreted, because, Madam President, words are also lethal weapons and also lead to deaths in the Basque Country.
There must be no such ambiguity, when it comes to analysing death, in a forum such as the European Parliament, which is the temple of democracy.
Madam President, you will be very welcome in the Basque Country.
You will speak for the enormous majority of this House, because the enormous majority of the Basque people are against those people who, while claiming to speak for the Basque people, ride rough-shod over freedoms and fundamental rights.
Mr Gorostiaga represents nobody but that minority which, showing a complete disregard for the best European democratic traditions, tramples upon fundamental rights.
Madam President, go to the Basque Country, speak for us and show that we are crying out - hopefully not in the wilderness - for this to be the final death.
Madam President, I would like to thank you for your words of condemnation and condolence.
Of course, we also very much welcome the fact that you are prepared to visit the Basque Country.
Madam President, murder and shootings in the back provide no solution for the problems of the Basque Country.
Nor does the failure to condemn those people who carry out the most vile acts in this Europe which we are trying to build day by day - the Europe of freedom, security and justice. I am talking about the attacks on life, which is the most horrendous of all attacks on human rights.
Madam President, on behalf of the Basque Nationalist Party - which is the majority party in the Basque Autonomous Region - I wish to express our total condemnation and rejection of the death of JesÃºs MarÃ­a Pedrosa Urquiza, Municipal Councillor in Durango in Vizcaya, and our condemnation of any act of violence which takes place in the Basque Country or any other part of the world.
We have constantly rejected the use of violence in order to achieve political objectives.
I must also say that I regret having to take the floor in these circumstances, following this very recent act of violence.
Madam President, I am grateful for the fact that - as I said to you in my letter last week - in circumstances such as these, you are diligent enough to defend democratic principles, rejecting acts of terrorism on behalf of Parliament and expressing your support for the Spanish Government in the fight against this terrorism.
I reminded you that the Basque Government has spent 20 years working for peace in the Basque Country by democratic means and striving for a better future for all of us.
I believe that it is also fair to recognise the contribution, the action and activity of the Basque Government.
However, I must also point out that, over and above the terrorist acts and the violence which is and has been carried out in the Basque Country by ETA and also by the apparatus of the State - which we should not forget - there is a political conflict there which existed long before ETA.
There is a section of the Basque population which does not feel comfortable, which does not feel at ease with the current legal-political set-up in the Basque Country.
I believe that it is a good thing for all political parties with an open and democratic approach to sit down together to hold a dialogue so that we may, once and for all, find a way for all citizens in the Basque Country to feel at ease and to be able to live in peace, which is what we all wish to see.
Madam President, in my own name and on behalf of my political party, the CoaliciÃ³n Canaria [the Canary Islands Coalition], I would like to make public in this House my rejection and condemnation of the murder of Councillor JesÃºs MarÃ­a Pedrosa.
I would like secondly to make a call - an idealistic one perhaps - for peace and dialogue in that autonomous region.
Lastly, I think it is very positive and opportune that the President of this Parliament has announced this visit to the Basque Country.
Madam President, you have already mentioned the murder in Athens of the military attachÃ© to the British embassy, Stephen Saunders.
I would like on behalf of the MEPs of the New Democracy party and our group to express our outright condemnation of these attacks, not only this specific attack, but all the attacks carried out over the last 25 years by this phantom terrorist organisation, and my deep regret that we have as yet been unable to find the murderers.
Not only is there no justification for these attacks, they also bear no relation to events in the Basque country, not that there is any justification for those events, but the circumstances are different; they are merely blind and unacceptable attacks, the basic aim of which is to damage Greece' s relations with the other countries.
I should like to repeat our outright condemnation and to thank you very much for putting this matter at the top of the agenda today because it is through you that the outright condemnation of the European Parliament will be conveyed to Greece.
I should like to express my deepest condolences to Stephen Saunders' wife and children, whom we have seen on television.
We have witnessed their pain and we have seen that terrorists do not of course only hurt those they attack; they also in essence murder all those around them.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to state on behalf of the Communist Party of Greece that we most strongly and categorically condemn the murder of the military attachÃ© to the British embassy in Athens, Brigadier Stephen Saunders.
At the same time, we condemn the orchestrated plan being deployed against Greece and the attempt to establish a connection between this monstrous deed and the anti-imperialist sentiment of the Greek people.
We must not overlook the fact that the murder was carried out a few days after the report to the United States Congress describing Greece as a country which fails to cooperate fully in the fight against terrorism. A few days after the Americans expressed their anxiety about security arrangements for the 2004 Olympic Games and just before the police cooperation agreement between Greece and the United States of America was due to be signed.
We have no choice but to conclude that certain parties are taking advantage of this provocative act in order to demand even more oppressive measures against the political and democratic freedoms of the Greek people and it is among them that the physical and moral perpetrators are to be found.
Madam President, I too should like to thank you for your statement in connection with the attack on and murder of the British military attachÃ©.
The Socialist Group happened to be in session when the murder took place and I immediately took the opportunity, from the Socialist Party tribune, of expressing the condemnation of PASOK and of the Greek nation as a whole, which, of course, abhors such acts of terrorism, acts which are directed not only at the victims but at the security and political and economic welfare of Greece.
We cannot deny that a terrorist phenomenon has been a thorn in Greece' s side for many years.
We are taking and we shall continue to take all the measures needed to crush this organisation, but its greatest defeat, Madam President, is the fact that it is completely isolated within the Greek people, it does not strike the slightest political chord and these murders are simply tragic, abominable, monstrous deeds perpetrated by a group of fanatics which the Greek nation as a whole abhors and rejects.
Madam President, I too should like to express my outright condemnation of the murder of the British military attachÃ© in Athens both in a personal capacity and on behalf of the party which I represent, the Social Democrat Movement. At the same time, I should like to express our undivided support for his brave wife and remarkable children.
We feel the deepest regret and trust that, at long last, the authorities will succeed in cracking down on this terrorist organisation which has been a thorn in the side of Greece and its international relations for the past 25 years.
As you perhaps are aware, immediately after Mr ChevÃšnement made these remarks, I issued a press statement to express my personal outrage at such comments, which I considered quite out of order.
And, of course, even though I took the precaution of saying that this was my own personal opinion, since the European Parliament had not adopted any particular stance, I am sure that Mr ChevÃšnement clearly understood that, in so saying, I was reflecting the opinion of a significant majority of the Members of the European Parliament.
Madam President, I carefully read your statement in response to the speech by the French Minister for Home Affairs.
I believe that the matter of nationhood is a concept that is far too complex to be dealt with like this, on a point of order, in a forum such as this.
This is a far-reaching debate, engaging all European Union Member States, not one that can be brushed aside.
I think that the words of the French Minister for Home Affairs were understood correctly in Germany, and that we should follow the example of the sensible way in which the authorities there reacted.
Madam President, we are indebted to Mr Leinen for reminding us about this incident.
However, I would expressly like to thank you for taking the stance you did, in your own name as our President.
I would like you to know that you have our full and unequivocal support, and that we owe you a debt of gratitude.
Incidentally, we should refrain from entering into debate on this issue at present.
Madam President, the final draft agenda is based on a part-session starting on Tuesday 13 June.
On 7 June, I sent you a letter regarding the proceedings for Monday 12 June, Whit Monday.
You granted the request a while back to cancel the parliamentary sitting due to take place on this Christian public holiday, and rightly so.
Later on, however, it was announced that the Members could sign the attendance register between 3 p.m. and 10 p.m.
It now looks as if we will need to be financially reimbursed for cancelling a working day.
Madam President, how will yesterday' s attendance register be published and what can still be done to prevent this attendance register from costing the European taxpayer any money?
The electorate expect us to extend their democratic rights, not to act in our own self-interest.
To reimburse a day' s expenses for a public holiday would result in the electorate staying at home in even greater numbers at the next elections.
I would ask you to give Parliament the opportunity, by no later than July, to state that Monday' s signatures should not lead to reimbursements of any kind.
An exception could possibly be made for those who can demonstrate that they were required to leave on Sunday on account of the remoteness of their homes, if, for example, they live in Finland or Greece.
Mr Meijer, I think that you have not got the information quite right.
The group meetings were indeed held yesterday, attended by a great many Members, and it would not be fair if these Members were penalised.
Madam President, I should like to say that this is a very great day for the Danes.
We too have now been successful in obtaining television in our own language here in Strasbourg.
I am sorry that Mrs Banotti is not here, for I had promised to thank her personally if the bid were successful, but I hope you can pass on to her what I have said.
I just want to say, 'Mary, you are fantastic.
A small country was successfully taken into account, even if it did take a hell of a long time for this to happen.'
Thank you, Mr Blak.
We shall pass your satisfaction and thanks on to Mrs Banotti.
Madam President, on a point of order.
I will ensure that Mrs Banotti gets that information.
I will also be pressuring her to have Irish television here too.
I rise on a slightly more serious matter although, of course, I welcome the extension of all the media to our proceedings.
Madam President, you will be aware that since we met here last the Northern Ireland Assembly has been reconstituted.
Could I, through you, on our behalf, request that our sincere good wishes be sent to all concerned and all parties?
Let us hope that we are on the road to something extremely successful in the north of Ireland.
I can see that the House approves of your proposal, and I shall gladly do so, Mrs Doyle.
Madam President, just now you had to announce some extremely sad news.
Here, however, is a happier piece of news, and I believe I can speak for us all in expressing our relief and joy at the release, at long last, of the French journalist, Brice Fleutiaux, after more than eight months of being held captive by Chechen kidnappers.
I should like to pay tribute to his courage, but also to his clear-sightedness, because, even in his initial statements, he drew a clear distinction between his kidnappers and the Chechen people as a whole.
Many of us had some concerns for developments over the next few weeks, since the forthcoming summer recess appeared likely to lead to a decline in the competent political authorities' interest in the matter, and a consequent decline in the efforts undertaken.
We therefore planned to invite Brice Fleutiaux' s brother to visit the European Parliament, and he was happy to do so, as well as the journalists' unions, who were, likewise, ready to do so, and indeed, Madam President, you gave your personal endorsement to ensure the success of this initiative. I should like to thank you for that.
Fortunately we have no further need for this initiative, but I think we would be happy to welcome Brice Fleutiaux, should he wish to visit the European Parliament, this time as a free man and a man of honour.
Madam President, I am absolutely amazed that the Council does not wish to concern itself with the sanctions the Fourteen are taking against one Member State.
The European Parliament is best placed to know that refusing to engage in dialogue is not the way to solve problems.
Madam Chairman, what I want to speak about is the framework agreement between the Commission and Parliament which was approved by the Conference of Presidents last Thursday.
The agreement is still not available in Danish, it has still not been distributed to the majority of MEPs and it has not been discussed in any committee, and not at all in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs where I think we have the right and the duty to go through it.
It ought to be read and discussed among the Members before it is signed.
The text, which is available in French and which I obtained yesterday evening, is not, moreover, one and the same as that which was arrived at last Thursday as a result of the negotiations.
You will remember that, towards the end of the negotiations, Mr Prodi agreed that the word 'institutions' in the text should be changed to 'the Council and the Commission' , so that it will be possible, upon the President' s intervention, for documents which are issued by the Commission to recipients outside the Council and the Commission also to be issued to MEPs.
I have two criticisms of the framework agreement. It does not solve those problems typically faced by MEPs.
One of the problems is that, when we sit in a Committee and discuss a bill, the representatives from the different Member States, including trainees from the permanent representations who sit behind us, have the 'restrained' editions of the documents which we are debating but which, as MEPs, we ourselves are not entitled to receive.
It is a humiliating situation when students are sent documents to which we ourselves do not have access.
Another typical problem, which the framework agreement does not solve either, is that we often find ourselves in a situation in which we are able to read in the daily newspaper about a document which has been leaked from the Commission.
We are then asked by journalists if we can comment on this, but we do not even have access to the document.
I have just one more sentence....
(The President cut the speaker off)
Contrary to what you tell me in your letter, this framework agreement will be tabled before the plenary part-session in July, not in the course of the present part-session.
You have made a mistake in this case.
The groups will naturally have adequate time to examine this document.
Madam President, I should like to apprise you and the House of the following incident: last Tuesday, 6 June, I travelled from Brussels to New York in order to attend the UN World Conference on Women.
The travel document which I used was the pass issued to all MEPs by the European Parliament.
However, at New York airport I encountered serious problems with the authorities because I did not have a visa. That is because I am Greek and Greece is the only country in the European Union whose citizens need special permission to enter the USA.
I never realised, Madam President, that the special European Parliament pass was not valid for certain members because of their nationality and I spent two trying hours at New York airport until the authorities decided to grant me a visa so that I could attend the UN conference.
With all due respect for the laws and regulations under which a sovereign state is run, I consider that the problem which I encountered was more political than personal and I therefore ask that you give it your due attention.
Thank you. I shall take note of your comments.
We shall look into what we can do to proceed as you suggest.
Madam President, I should like to draw Members' attention to a very disturbing recent report by Amnesty International.
Amnesty International is an organisation that Parliament has used on many occasions to highlight human rights abuses around the world.
The rogue states that Amnesty International points the finger at have always dismissed the reports by Amnesty International and it is very alarming that in this case the same thing is happening again.
The report in question is the report on the war in Kosovo.
Amnesty International has found that NATO was in breach of many international laws as regards human rights.
It is extremely important that the Member States do not dismiss Amnesty International's report, because its reports have always been balanced, they have always highlighted any human rights abuses that are occurring, irrespective of how the report will be received.
Javier Solana, who is now head of CFSP within the European Union, was Secretary-General of NATO at the time and because of this gross abuse of human rights, Parliament has to take Amnesty International's report seriously.
We cannot allow NATO or any other organisation around the world to abuse human rights, to ignore international law and to kill innocent civilians.
This is not acceptable.
Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of the sitting of Friday, 19 May have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
Madam President, in Item 5 of the Minutes, on the "Readmission of third-country nationals" , after Mr Duff' s intervention on the verification of the quorum, it says: "The following spoke on this request: Mr Ribeiro Castro, Mr KnÃ¶rr BorrÃ s,... etc." .
However, if we read the verbatim report, we can see that Mr KnÃ¶rr BorrÃ s' intervention said: "Madam President, I should like to convey our support and sympathy for the people of Paraguay in the light of another attempted military coup.
That is all I wished to say.
I should like the position of this House to be made very clear" .
I must point out that what Mr KnÃ¶rr BorrÃ s said has nothing to do with the quorum, but with an important issue of international policy, i.e. an attempted coup in Paraguay.
There has been a declaration on this issue by the President of a political group - the Socialist Group - and we are also going to present a motion for a resolution on it, but I would like to ask the President, firstly, whether the Minutes should be corrected and, secondly, whether the Presidency has made any declaration, because I believe that it is important for us to show our solidarity with Paraguayan democracy.
Thank you, Mr Medina Ortega.
We shall check all this and correct the Minutes, if necessary.
Are there any other comments on the Minutes?
There are no further comments.
(The Minutes were approved)
Agenda
The next item is the final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents pursuant to Rule 110 of the Rules of Procedure.
Relating to Thursday: Relating to Thursday, and the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance, I have received several requests for amendments.
Firstly, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance have sent me a request to replace the item on "Fundamental freedoms in Serbia and Kosovo" with a new item on "Coups d' Ã©tat in Fiji and the Solomon Islands" .
Who wishes to speak to propose this?
Madam President, naturally we are very concerned about the situation in Kosovo.
You will understand that we are keen to keep this text.
The European Union is spending an enormous amount of money on the situation in the Solomon Islands and Fiji, and even Papua New Guinea.
We hope that these countries will retain their political stability but unfortunately, the situation over there is taking a turn for the worse.
This is why we think, due to the topicality and not on account of the content per se, it is necessary for the European Parliament to send out a signal.
We have always stressed prevention.
The entire region is in a state of disarray, which requires the greatest care and concern from the entire European Parliament.
This is why I would like to call on the MEPs to continue caring about Kosovo and Serbia.
We can return to this at some later stage, but for the sake of topicality, let us focus on Fiji, the Solomon Islands and the Pacific Ocean region for now and say something of significance about them.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, if we are going to talk about topicality then all I can say is that you cannot get more topical than Kosovo and Serbia.
The Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy have just got back from a joint trip to Kosovo.
While we were there we promised that we would do our best to adopt a motion of this kind this week.
I urge the honourable members to support this motion for a resolution.
We must bring pressure to bear on Serbia, and also on the Albanians in Kosovo, so as to make them put things to rights.
We can only do this using the modest means at our disposal, namely a motion for a resolution.
The Balkans region is a little nearer to us than Fiji as matters stand, and if it is money we are worried about then I am bound to say that we are footing the bill rather a lot in Kosovo!
Mr Corrie, I am quite happy to give you the floor, but I should like to know whether you are speaking for or against the proposal.
We are not here to start a debate.
We followed the efforts undertaken by yourself and by Mrs Kinnock, and we supported you in your endeavours.
We were behind you all the way, and we were delighted with the successful outcome achieved.
Let me make that point.
Having said that, I should be grateful if you would stand down at present, and let us proceed to vote on the proposal from the Greens and the Liberal Group.
(Parliament rejected the proposal)
Still on the subject of the topical and urgent debate, I have received another request on Venezuela.
This is from the Group of the Party of European Socialists, to replace the item on 'Venezuela' with a new item on the 'Coup d' Ã©tat in Paraguay' .
Madam President, there are two reasons as to why we are not debating the Venezuela issue.
Firstly, there is the respect we have for our own Rules of Procedure.
We are no longer in earnest about these debates on topical and urgent subjects of major importance, nor is our attitude to be taken seriously.
We decided in the AFET committee that we would adhere strictly to Rule 50 and Annex 3 of our Rules of Procedure, according to which an issue of this kind, i.e. an event that happened months ago, can no longer be dealt with as an urgent procedure, even if it is, of course, very important.
Secondly, demands are made in this motion that have been neither considered nor discussed in budgetary terms.
Hence we are calling for this issue to be withdrawn and replaced by an issue that is genuinely urgent and highly topical, i.e. the attempted coup in Paraguay and the arrest of the former rebel General Oviedo.
(Parliament approved the proposal)
(The order of business was adopted thus amended)
Madam President, I am astounded that there has been no mention of the request from my Group, which I sent you last night, on "Echelon" .
The fact is that, on 13 April, the Conference of Presidents gave an initial response to the request from 185 Members of Parliament for a committee of inquiry, with a majority in the Conference voting against the proposal.
Then, another proposal for a temporary committee of inquiry was tabled by our fellow Member, Mr BarÃ³n Crespo.
This is still under discussion, but although it looked initially as if the two proposals might be combined in such a way as to satisfy the requirements of the House as a whole, it now seems that the other request for a temporary committee of inquiry does not in any way agree with the proposal from 185 Members of Parliament.
Indeed, Parliament' s legal advisors have told us that it was impossible for any sort of investigation to be conducted, within the framework of a temporary committee of inquiry, into the involvement of Member States in the "Echelon" project and the role of the European institutions.
In short, no such inquiry is possible.
In my opinion, the logical course of events, although the Rules of Procedure are rather ambiguous, and Rule 151(3) is debatable, is that the decision by the Conference of Presidents should be followed up with a vote in plenary session on the Conference of Presidents' proposal not to set up a committee of inquiry.
My feeling is that the plenary assembly alone has the authority to make a decision on this matter or, if not, then we are falling short of the terms of the Treaty.
Article 193 of the Treaty clearly specifies that, potentially, this is Parliament' s responsibility.
Mr Lannoye, I did indeed receive your request yesterday at 10 p.m. I have to tell you that, at the present time, I have some doubts as to the admissibility of this request.
I wish to look into the matter in depth rather than adopt a position in haste.
It is, however, true, as you yourself indeed pointed out, that it is not particularly clear how Rule 150(3) of the Rules of Procedure applies in this case.
As I say, I wish to look into the matter in greater detail, and I shall inform you tomorrow morning at the start of the sitting whether there are grounds for including your request in the agenda, in which case the matter would then be put to the vote at noon, which is in fact what you would like, I believe.
Nonetheless, I wish at this stage to reserve judgement on the admissibility of this amendment.
Even if I had worked on the matter solidly since 10 last night, I think this would not have been nearly enough.
Madam President, Mr Lannoye has referred to certain decisions of the Conference of Presidents which I believe he has not described correctly. I am not going to go into the background to the issue.
In its meeting of 13 April, the Conference of Presidents decided by a majority to create a temporary committee.
According to the Rules of Procedure, that is a different option to the committee of inquiry.
I requested a report from the Legal Service which was received a week ago.
The issue was included in the agenda of last week' s Conference of Presidents.
Since the priority was to deal with other issues, it could not be discussed.
I understand that the final agreement reached was that we are going to discuss this issue at the Conference of Presidents.
Therefore, Madam President, I understand that the intention of Mr Lannoye and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance will become legitimate when you present the Conference of Presidents' proposal to this House, which may be in July, but at the moment I believe that Mr Lannoye' s proposal is not appropriate.
I believe that a proposal by the Conference of Presidents can be objected to, but the Rules of Procedure are very clear: it is the Conference of Presidents which must make the proposal.
In my opinion, it would not be normal to deal with this issue tomorrow, but rather an objection can be raised when you present the Conference of Presidents' proposal to this House.
I understand that it will not be possible before July because the only possibility this month would be Friday, and I do not believe the President of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance wants it to be this Friday.
Madam President, it is not my intention to start a debate on the interpretation of the Rules of Procedure at this point, but since you are going to look into the matter, Madam President, I should like to draw your attention to the fact that if the Conference of Presidents rejects a request for a committee of inquiry, then the Conference will naturally not make any such proposals and its vote against the request therefore means that the matter cannot be referred to the opinion of the plenary assembly.
There is an obvious gap in the Rules of Procedure in this respect.
In my opinion, the plenary assembly should make the decision. Proposing that a committee of inquiry should not be set up is effectively a decision as much as a proposal.
I think the House must decide.
The temporary committee of inquiry is a different problem, since this is not in response to a request by 185 Members of Parliament.
Mr Lannoye, I have taken note of your comments, and those of Mr BarÃ³n Crespo.
Request for the waiver of the parliamentary immunity of Mr Brie
The next item is the report (A5-0151/2000) by Mr MacCormick, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the request for waiver of the immunity of Andreas Brie.
Madam President, this is a request from the Generalstaatsanwalt of the Landgericht of Berlin to lift the immunity of Mr AndrÃ© Brie, a Member of this House.
The Legal Affairs Committee recommends to the House that we decide not to waive immunity in this case.
It would be helpful if I say a few brief words about the grounds for our recommendations.
The case concerns a demonstration mounted by Mr Brie and supporters in September 1998 when he, with eight others, unrolled and exhibited a placard at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin protesting against the gap in society between the haves and the have-nots.
This was repeated on other occasions.
The local prosecutor characterised this as a breach of Article 26(2) of the German Assembly Law, because it was held to be an assembly conducted without prior authorisation by, or information to, the appropriate authorities.
This gives rise to a question of immunity because, as Members of the House are aware, they enjoy immunity in their own Member States on the same terms as if they were members of their own parliament.
Under Article 46(2) of the Basic Law of the Federal Republic, Members of the Bundestag may not be called to account or arrested for a punishable offence, except by permission of the Bundestag, unless they are apprehended in the course of committing the offence or on the following day.
Under these circumstances, it is clear that were Mr Brie a Member of the Bundestag he would enjoy immunity from prosecution which has been launched against him.
Therefore, under European law he, as a Member of this House, enjoys immunity but Parliament may choose to waive that immunity.
Our recommendation is that we should not waive immunity.
This is a case of the conduct of political activity and the expression of political opinion.
The tenor of decisions of Parliament in such cases has always been that immunity is not waived.
There has been only one exception to this, where speeches directly and deliberately express holocaust denial or other forms of xenophobic attack on persons.
This is by no means such a case and it follows all the precedents in which Parliament has held that political activity should be protected.
This is not a matter of a benefit conferred on individual Members as politicians.
It is a matter of sustaining the conditions of a democratic assembly with free, open and frank public debate.
I have great pleasure in proposing to the House the report of the Legal Affairs Committee.
Madam President, I would like to confirm what the rapporteur, Mr MacCormick, has said in relation to the request for the waiver of Mr Brie' s immunity.
As he has highlighted, it has now become normal for this Parliament to guarantee immunity with regard to acts which have been related in some political sense to parliamentary activity.
We believe that the displaying of a placard at 6.50 in the morning, opposite the Brandenburg Gate, an action which involved just the 6 or 8 people who unrolled it, does not really constitute a serious disturbance of civil peace.
As Mr MacCormick has pointed out, there have been cases where Parliament has decided to waive immunity.
These cases particularly relate to Mr Le Pen, where he has denied, for example, the existence of the holocaust or made statements of a racist nature. This also involves those cases where words were accompanied by actions, such as when a stone was thrown and acid sprayed at the President of the United States.
In every other case, the judgement of this House has been to maintain immunity in the event that the political activity may have involved, at a low level, the violation of some administrative regulation, but this has never been put into practice.
I therefore agree with Mr MacCormick' s proposal not to waive Mr Brie' s immunity.
Madam President, it is possible that the rules concerning immunity which exist in many national parliaments, and also in our European Parliament, are in fact an historical remnant which is really not needed.
As long as these rules exist, however, they must apply equally to everyone.
In the case of Mr Brie' s crime, which we are now discussing, this clearly relates, in the first place, to political activity. It is a matter of a demonstration.
What is more, his crime really only has to do with the administrative rules in the police regulation and of his not having sought and obtained prior permission in accordance with these.
This is, of course, not enough to justify waiving immunity for, in that case, serious offences need to have been committed, for example assault or some other crime or an action which puts other people' s lives and security in danger.
This case is concerned only with a purely administrative violation.
I understand that the same view has been expressed by members of different parties in Germany.
I therefore think that the matter is quite clear.
On behalf of my group, I would therefore express support for the draft decisions tabled by the rapporteur.
Request for the waiver of the parliamentary immunity of Mr Kronberger
The next item is the report (A5-0158/2000) by Mr Zimeray, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the request for the waiver of Mr Johann Kronberger's immunity.
Madam President, Mr Zimeray has asked me to defend this report by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market since he is unable to attend.
The situation in the case of Mr Kronberger is completely different from the last situation we dealt with.
In this case we are dealing with a mere traffic offence, which has nothing to do with politics.
Mr Kronberger was returning from his parliamentary work, he turned left and caused an accident which injured two people.
There is no political element, no element of fumus persecutionis.
Mr Kronberger himself accepts the waiver of his immunity and has no objection whatsoever.
The closest precedent to this case was more serious, since it involved not only a traffic offence but also the MEP fleeing the scene.
I therefore believe that it would set a bad example if we were to safeguard the immunity of an MEP in the case of a violation of a mere traffic regulation.
Therefore, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market' s proposal in this case is that Mr Kronberger' s parliamentary immunity be waived so that justice may be done in the normal way.
That concludes the debate.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
Manufacture, presentation and sale of tobacco products
The next item is the report (A5-0156/2000) by Mr Maaten, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning the manufacture, presentation and sale of tobacco products (COM (1999) 594 - C5-0016/2000 - 1999/0244 (COD)).
Mr President, with regard to tobacco, many wonder what business it is of the European Parliament, the European Commission or our Health Ministers.
Tobacco is a natural stimulant.
You are supposed to enjoy it and politicians should not spoil this enjoyment.
But, Mr President, this is not how it is of course.
Needless to say, the element of freedom of choice and personal responsibility should be retained.
This is based on the premise that the decision is taken by an adult who knows all the facts, and therein lies the difficulty.
I believe that smokers are ill-informed on the effects of using tobacco and that they do not give their environment sufficient consideration.
This is our business.
And rightly so!
With a directive of this kind, the health aspects will inevitably be the focus of attention.
However, we are principally dealing with an internal market directive, which is why Article 95 of the Treaty has been taken as a legal basis.
There is doubt about this within the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, and their rapporteur has expressed this hesitation quite openly to us in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection.
This doubt is probably exacerbated by fact that the tobacco advertising directive case is now before the Court in Luxembourg.
I, however, do not share this doubt at all.
If it had been a public health directive, then other measures would have been proposed.
Then, we would have discussed points of sale, smoking at work, smoking in public places, possibly minimum age, which I personally do not support in any case.
We would certainly have mentioned the most effective policy against tobacco, namely a price policy.
We only need to look at the British and Swedish examples to see that this policy works.
What we are talking about here is the amalgamation and updating of three existing directives, two of which have already been assessed by the Court, where the legal basis was not commented on.
This draft directive has far too little in common with the one currently under discussion in Luxembourg to warrant a fair comparison.
However, we need to harmonise the internal market for tobacco products as a matter of urgency.
At the moment, we are entangled in national rules, which leads to barriers to trade and legal inequality among consumers.
Harmonisation, therefore, will benefit industry and public health.
For example, our discussions have led to the development of common testing methods and a positive list of additives, as is already in place in France, Germany and Belgium.
I would have liked to propose a list of this kind myself, but I believe that, at the moment, there is too much uncertainty surrounding such a list, to warrant such a proposal.
But the proposals made by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection could mean that such a list could be a reality as early as 2004.
In addition, this test procedure will bring about more openness regarding ingredients and additives, as well as prescribe conditions for the import to, sale within and of course - logically - the export from the European Union.
We, however, are keeping an open mind with regard to the problems which European industry could face in this respect, and so the committee has embraced the possibility of postponement until 2006.
We want to provide consumers with free choice based on more extensive information.
The best means of communication is the packet itself.
It has transpired that the current warnings which cover 4% of the front and back of the packet are completely ineffective and insultingly simplistic.
First and foremost, the information is misleading.
The terms 'light' , 'ultra light' , 'low-tar' and such like, are incorrect.
But indicating the different tar, nicotine and probably carbon monoxide yields also creates a false illusion - and young women, in particular, fall into the trap that certain cigarettes are less harmful than others.
This terminology should be withdrawn.
But in addition to this, we need more useful information, and this is what smokers want too.
They know that smoking is not good for you but they know precious little else.
I have tabled an amendment that tidies up the proposals made by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection in this respect.
The message on the packet should take up more space and should ideally be illustrated.
How much space, you may ask?
Well, enough space.
According to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, it should take up 40% or 50%.
I suggested 35% or 45% in a proposal which I re-submitted via my group.
But in any case, messages should not take up less than 30% of space on the packets, which is the proportion currently specified in Poland.
This is why, in my opinion, the 25% suggested by the European Commission is insufficient, although it is a huge step forward.
Finally, I would like to thank the delegates for their remarkable cooperation and I am also grateful to the European Commission and the President-in-Office of the Council.
This is bound to result in better policy.
Similarly, the dialogue with the health organisations and industry has been a positive step.
This Parliament has freedom of choice too and can now use it.
A choice between tinkering at the edges or taking forceful measures.
I call on Parliament to display the courage it takes to go far, because this will be to everyone' s benefit.
Mr President, smoking is bad for the health.
It is, however, naive to assume that we will manage to banish smoking altogether.
What matters most in our view is that we have a responsibility to make every effort to prevent people from taking up smoking at an increasingly young age.
With this in mind, Member States could consider increasing cigarette prices and prohibiting the sale to children under the age of 16.
I would like to make the following observations about the directive. With regard to the legal basis, I welcome the fact that the directive will now be put to the vote.
The European Parliament has political responsibility in this respect, and we do not need to wait for legal procedures.
This would be a first, we have never done this before and there is always something being drawn up somewhere.
Moreover, the legal offices of the European Parliament and the European Commission have confirmed the correctness of the legal basis.
Secondly, I would like to touch upon health.
First of all, I am in favour of excluding yields from the packets, which seems to have a misleading effect.
Lower tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide yields are just as harmful to health and are, in fact, sometimes even more harmful.
It is sufficient to indicate that these products are in the packets and that they are harmful to health.
People should, however, be able to gain easy and free access to product information.
Strangely, this proposal facilitates export for health organisations and industry alike, and has a positive effect on the votes.
With regard to health warnings, Mr President, given the range of wishes regarding the warning size, I have now decided in favour of maintaining the percentages quoted by the European Commission, which can now be considered a compromise.
It is also important to point out the dangers of passive smoking.
So far, these have been underestimated, but the serious effects are becoming increasingly clear.
Other than that, I am of the view that warnings should be kept as brief and punchy as possible. Longer texts render the warnings less forceful.
With regard to subsidies, I am in favour of phasing these out.
It is not credible to discourage smoking on the one hand and to stimulate the cultivation of tobacco on the other.
With regard to the market, Mr President, an open internal market entails developing equal starting positions for the industry in the different Member States.
This is why I am in favour of scrapping the ban on snuff.
This product is not healthy but not much worse than other products to warrant sole exclusion.
As for export, Mr President, I am of the opinion that the same health requirements should apply to sales within and outside the EU.
Concerning warnings, the rules of the importing countries could prevail.
In respect of the testing method, Mr President, it is important to arrive at a uniform testing method within the EU that has been established by an independent scientific body comprising experts from different related disciplines who would then be required to develop the testing methods.
Each Member State should then appoint a competent laboratory, either on their own territory or not, as the case may be, and tests carried out in these recognised laboratories should then have to be recognised across all Member States.
It would be a useless exercise if the same tests were to be carried out in all the Member States in accordance with uniform testing methods.
Finally, Mr President, I would like to point out the difference between cigarettes, pipes and cigars.
Smoking is bad for the health and all tobacco products are bad, but there are distinctions between the different products.
Everyone will agree that the target group of pipe and cigar smokers will be different to that of cigarette smokers.
Hence my proposal to draw a distinction in the directive between pipe and cigar tobacco with regard to the size (a smaller percentage) and colour of the warnings (namely not black and white but also to allow contrasting colours).
Cigar and pipe smokers are older, less frequent smokers in the main, and are mainly social smokers.
The product concerned is also more expensive.
If we mainly wish to discourage people from taking up smoking at a young age, this is not the target group.
Hence the distinction drawn.
Mr President, on the eve of the vote on this motion, I would like to focus on the problems raised by this directive and stress the responsibility we have had to display in order to iron them out.
Since the fight against smoking, which is the main cause of death in the Union, is the leading element in the fight to uphold of the right to health, it is important to be aware that this fight can only be won through dynamic but realistic consideration of the implications for production and employment.
I would argue that the balance achieved between these two elements of the text adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy makes up for the hard work of the last few months, and, in connection with this, I would like to thank the rapporteur, who joined us in taking a flexible approach to the matter and liasing openly with both the health associations and the producers of tobacco and tobacco products.
With regard, briefly, to the contents of the draft, I would stress that the Commission' s proposal has not only been adhered to but also further consolidated in terms of public health protection.
Indeed, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy proposes to ban all terms such as light, ultralight or mild, since they are considered to be completely misleading for smokers, and eliminate any possibility of derogation for the States.
The Committee and my group have declared that they are in favour of harmonising the ingredients and additives of tobacco products, and have called upon the Commission to present a proposal for a list of authorised ingredients before the end of 2004.
The rules governing warnings have also been consolidated: we were not content simply to increase the amount of space dedicated to warnings but the messages have been made clearer and more personal as well so that they will be more effective in dissuading consumers from smoking.
As I said before, this reinforced line of health protection could not have been sustained if we had not found common ground with the requests for gradual phasing-out put forward by the tobacco and tobacco-related production industry.
The most problematic aspect of this directive may well be, in fact, that it lays down the same shorter time frames and the same maximum contents for all cigarettes produced in the Union, whether they are intended for sale within the Union or for export.
Nobody wants to deny the principle that cigarettes are bad for Europeans as well as for the citizens of third countries, but you cannot ask an entire sector to change overnight.
In order to take into account the requirements of the tobacco producers and industry, we propose, in accordance with the outcome of the vote of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, to introduce a new amendment, Amendment No 98, to uphold the position which keeps the objective of converting the sector to another activity unchanged but grants slightly longer time periods for this to be implemented, through the application of maximum content levels for internal production as of 2004 and for export as of 2006.
In this way, we do genuinely frustrate the attempts of those who, in the name of production, even reject the requirement to introduce maximum levels of tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide.
And that is what counts.
Another delicate point is the granting of the derogation to Greece to allow it to continue to produce strong cigarettes up until 2006.
In this context, having discussed the matter at great length in the Group, we considered that we should keep the situation as it is: that is, keep the derogation for Greece and refuse to extend it to nicotine and carbon monoxide.
Finally, I would like to mention that all the work put in during these last months has been carried out in close cooperation with the Council working party, and inform you that the Portuguese Presidency has placed the adoption of this directive high on the agenda of the 'Health' Council to take place on 29 June.
We are on the point of a major achievement - forgive me, Mr Langen - because in voting for the Maaten report and rejecting the amendments which challenge the validity of the legal basis of the directive, we have the chance to make our contribution to a more general anti-smoking strategy and, thus, to the improvement of our health.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is just one figure to remember and keep in mind throughout the debate and, particularly, during the voting: 500 000 deaths per annum within the European Community are due to tobacco, which is to say, more than AIDS, tuberculosis or other infectious diseases.
And if we were to issue a directive on the social costs or on public health, then it would have to be a discussion about simply banning this fatal poison outright.
This is not, however, the case.
Here we are presented with a directive intended to facilitate the free movement of goods throughout the European Union by approximating Member State laws, regulations and administrative provisions on the manufacture, presentation and sale of tobacco products.
We must therefore concern ourselves not with prohibition but with establishing the same conditions for consumer information throughout all of the European Union regarding the content but also the potential risks they run in consuming these products.
In particular we must give thought to young people who do not have the necessary objectivity, and have only the image of young men and women smokers, and not the viewpoint that I was able to gain as a doctor on a respiratory medicine or cancer ward where I saw smokers dying in great pain from lung cancer.
This is not the future we want for our own children.
Let us also give a thought to other people' s future.
From this point of view, we must be pleased with Mr Maaten' s report and the amendments voted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, which improve the proposed directive.
All these provisions, however, still fall short of what is necessary in the way of consumer information, and too often the determination to reach a compromise has prevailed.
We must not let the text be distorted by amendments direct from the headquarters of the tobacco industry.
We must remain vigilant as to the content, size and presentation of these warnings, which must not be changed.
Several contentious issues still remain.
The labelling of tobacco products other than cigarettes must be subject to the same conditions.
The difficulty of measuring values or the fact that these products are not targeted at young people must not be used as an excuse for forgetting that these products, such as cigars, rolling tobacco or snuff, are harmful and must be labelled as such, especially since some, like the cigar or the pipe, may occasionally prove more attractive to young people.
The maximum tar content of 10 mg is still excessive and does not take into consideration the real amount actually inhaled and the habits acquired.
Tar content must be limited still further.
More worrying is the fact that the Technical Committee set up includes specialists from the tobacco industry.
How is this body supposed to be neutral when it includes so-called experts that have spent their time deceiving public opinion, now supposed to become impartial judges of the harmfulness and toxicity of the products sold by their own employers?
I feel that one would have to be extremely naive, and not, one hopes, just corrupt, to believe that such a body might be truly objective.
Especially since these consultants to the industry are prepared to allow the introduction of ingredients not only to increase consumption but also to increase habituation.
In conclusion, confronted with 500 000 deaths annually, confronted with the money spent by the tobacco lobbies, infiltrating even this House, we must, ladies and gentlemen, make a choice in favour of life.
Mr President, the Commission proposal introduces a series of stricter regulations for the marketing of tobacco products.
Our group shares the concerns about the harmful effects of tobacco and, apart from a few reservations, generally approves the Commission' s proposals, together with many of the amendments in Mr Ãaaten' s report, although I do not know how effective they will be, especially those which go over the top, as other members have pointed out.
Be that as it may, we shall vote in favour of most of them, together with those approved by other jointly responsible parliamentary committees.
However, there are a number of proposals and amendments which either have no bearing on the matter or which will cause serious economic problems without solving the problems which they are supposedly addressing.
The problem has been raised, albeit indirectly, of reducing and abolishing production aids for tobacco.
Clearly such a move will not help to reduce smoking because I have not seen any of the members on their high horses proposing a ban on tobacco imports and such a move would therefore merely promote tobacco production in third countries.
As for the proposals which say that money saved by abolishing subsidies will be put to certain uses, the members making these proposals obviously have no idea how the budget works.
Ex ante commitments are worthless unless they constitute actual policy worked out by the relevant bodies, rather than just a statement made in a parliamentary committee.
Another amendment abolishes the derogation previously granted to the Greek tobacco industry for nicotine, tar and other yields. In other words, it will upset the investment and production plans based on our decisions, based on the deadline previously granted.
And it will upset them retroactively.
What sort of law school did the people who approve such arbitrary reversals attend?
I should be most interested to hear the Commission' s comments on this.
Finally, industry is required to apply the same specifications to export products as it is to those marketed in the European Union, even if the importing countries require no such thing.
This measure is presented from a moral standpoint, which, however, does not prevent tobacco industries from moving outside the European Union and exporting their products throughout the world from third countries.
Multinationals are already doing just that.
Obviously, the rest will follow, with huge repercussions on economic activity and employment within the European Union.
Of course, the European Union could try - quite rightly - to impose its specifications on candidate and other countries with which it has close ties, perhaps even on the World Trade Organisation.
But instead of focusing on serious matters, we prefer a simple, or rather a highly simplistic and ineffectual solution.
I assume that the Commission, which has conducted a more in-depth analysis, will be able to enlighten us further so that, at the end of the day, we opt for a more balanced, more effective and more logical way forward.
Mr President, I must say it is rather paradoxical today to be discussing the intention to harmonise tobacco products and, at the same time, the intention to facilitate the free movement of what we all acknowledge to be a substance that is extremely harmful to health.
If the European Union sincerely believes that it can protect public health by covering cigarette packets with increasingly larger labels advertising the fact that "smoking kills" or "smoking causes cancer" , we are surely in the realm of the absurd.
Is harmonising these warnings a credible step when these toxic products are free to be distributed throughout the European Union, with the authorisation of the Union?
So let us leave the national states to deal with tobacco, with their own structures and their own cultural messages; let us leave them to engage in their own discussions with producers and consumers.
I refuse to believe that, in harmonising the warnings and labels, the European Union simply wishes to act for the common good.
I reject the idea that European citizens should feel reassured in a tobacconist' s in Lisbon or Paris, simply because the Europeanised, standardised product they will recognise there will be familiar to them.
As we all know, warnings serve no purpose, whether or not they are written in 'Helvetica' typeface.
Surely our duty is rather to increase consumers' responsibility rather than to make children of them by telling them what is good or bad for them.
Even if smokers have freedom of choice, we still have a duty to take preventative action, mainly with regard to younger generations.
We therefore support the amendments prioritising the protection of public health, particularly those prohibiting product descriptions for, whether it is "light" , "ultralight" or "mild" , tobacco, in the form of cigarettes, cigars or snuff tobacco, seriously damages one' s health.
Doctors in respiratory medicine, no doubt, but cardiologists too, are well aware of the fact, which they can observe every day, that tobacco is extremely harmful to health.
Calendar of part-sessions for 2001
Manufacture, presentation and sale of tobacco products (continuation)
Mr President, as far as debates go, Parliament is familiar with some absolute classics which crop up regularly: human rights, bananas, mad cows, and now tobacco.
We are here involved in revising three directives on the manufacture, presentation and sale of tobacco, cigarettes, snuff tobacco and other tobacco products.
And, at this point, we have yet another classic debate, the one which concerns the legal basis: is this a matter to do with the market, in which case Article 95 of the Treaty establishing the European Community applies, or the rules of operation or indeed health policy?
The matter has been referred to the Court of Justice of the European Communities.
The rapporteur from the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market suggests kicking the ball into touch by referring the debate back.
Whatever the case, we are required to examine the content of the report before us.
Regarding the content of the report, then, an accurate observation is made and the rapporteur makes some sensible proposals but, in the final analysis, the sideways shift sets in.
As everyone recognises, the observation that tobacco causes disease and ultimately death is perfectly accurate, in the same way that the poverty generated by ultraliberalism is also ultimately harmful to health.
Cigarettes contain tar, nicotine, carbon monoxide, additives, citrates, tartrates, acetates, nitrates, sorbates, phosphates, even fungicides, and all these end up causing lung cancer, cardiovascular disease and cot death in infants, with 500 000 people dying every year.
Of course, many more people die too.
On the basis of these facts, then, some sensible proposals have been made.
Tar content must be limited to 10 mg per cigarette and nicotine content to 1 mg per cigarette.
There are even sensible suggestions to prohibit ammonia, which increases nicotine ingestion and thereby also dependence, and to earmark 2% of the profits made by tobacco multinationals for scientific research.
These are intelligent and reasonable suggestions.
There are also plans to provide information on the dangers of tobacco, and to protect children and even the infants at risk from sudden infant death syndrome.
This, however, is the start of the sideslip into lack of realism, self-righteousness and fundamentalism.
In other words, from an accurate observation and reasonable proposals, we move towards a problem that is even worse than tobacco itself.
What is this sideways shift?
In the first place, there is the bureaucratic sideslip with the business of the label.
We are putting labels on everything.
Indeed, the ecologist' s neurosis is revealed by the fact that the subject of labelling is raised.
We have labels on meat, wine, GM products, chocolate.
It is the trump card that beats any freedoms.
And now, labels on tobacco but, mark you, for labelling tobacco we are talking serious business.
The label must cover 30% of the packet surface, 35% if the wording is bilingual, and 12.5% of the outer surface of the wrapping for pipe tobacco.
The label must be printed in black on a white background and the borders must be at least 3 mm and at most 4 mm wide, an average of 3.5 mm.
The labels must feature text, but not just any old text, it must be printed in black Helvetica bold type, 100% intensity.
Thus proving that tobacco affects not only the lungs but also the brain.
The label must also feature a free telephone number for a body which the smoker can call to ask what dangers his habit involves.
There must also be a slogan like 'smoking kills' , 'smoking is harmful to those around you' , 'smoking impairs fertility' , and 'smoking causes impotence' .
So, seeing how impotent our governments are to deal with immigration, lack of security, tax problems, and unemployment, we can only conclude that they are heavy smokers.
This is clearly not, however, a sensible measure.
Let me give one example: tobacco was introduced into Europe at the same time as the potato.
Tobacco farming was started immediately but it took several centuries for the potato to catch on. That is how irrational things can be.
Even if there had been a label on the apple to say that there was a risk of being thrown out of Eden, Eve would still have bitten into it!
What does that prove?
Well, it goes to show that slogans are not effective, just as a price increase would not be effective, as it would only increase smuggling and crime.
This is the sideslip into self-righteousness and hypocrisy.
We are told that there are social costs.
Yet the smoker pays excise duties of between 75 and 85% included in the price of tobacco.
In my own country, revenue from excise duties is greater than that from recording rights.
In other words, by smoking, the smoker is paying for the cost of his own cancer treatment.
People have said that it is inconsistent to allocate a billion to tobacco farming and then pay out for the campaign against tobacco.
True, but it is just as inconsistent to bomb Kosovo and then pay to rebuild it, or to eliminate internal borders and lose customs duties and then set up OLAF to defend the financial interests of the European Union.
In demographic terms, is it not inconsistent, ladies and gentlemen, to permit the loss of 5 million Europeans per annum due to abortions and then to weep over 500 000 deaths due to smoking?
Then there is the puritanical sideslip.
The rapporteur sends a shiver down my spine when he speaks of social aberrations, social instincts.
What I hear is: the Social Democratic Sweden of the 1960s sterilising fifteen year old adolescents because they were social misfits.
I hear: moral order, the Salem witches.
I hear: the Puritanism of northern Europe, these reformers desperate to reform everything, including the way we eat and drink.
I hear: northern Europe banning wine, on the pretext that wines are harmful to health, but not banning injecting oneself with all sorts of substances.
It is the same puritanical streak shared by Robespierre, Pol Pot, the Greens and the Quakers.
Our rapporteur is a Liberal and should not forget the lessons of laissez-faire Liberalism: let them live, let them be born, let them drink and let them smoke.
Mr President, we are right to be worried when ideology oversteps the limits of the law and merrily tramples individual freedoms underfoot to the point of advocating a tobacco-free Europe.
It is only totalitarian regimes that attempt to regulate the happiness of their citizens.
Nonetheless, the aim of this directive proposing to harmonise legislation on tobacco products is actually to oppose tobacco by every means possible, including those that are the most questionable on legal grounds.
The Commission is effectively misusing EC Treaty Article 95 which stipulates that the object of the single market may be sufficient justification to undertake approximation, but the Commission is justifying its action on the grounds of public health and consumer protection, which are covered by EC Treaty Article 152, and this authorises only encouragement and not actual harmonisation.
What are we to think of this crude misuse of Articles 95 and 152?
What are we to think of the rejection voted by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market?
What then will be the use of this committee and, indeed, of the European Union' s legal consultants?
What are we to think of the unemployment unavoidably generated by this directive which, in eliminating all subsidies to production, will toll the knell for the tobacco sector?
This affects one million jobs in Europe.
In France, 40 000 small producers are scraping a living thanks to this additional activity which is extremely labour-intensive.
What are we to think of a Europe which, according to the power of lobbies and special interests, permits the addition of vegetable fats to chocolate, authorises the use of GMOs and imposes restrictions liable to jeopardise the sale of local products on the markets and now to threaten tobacco production, even though it is perfectly legal?
As you will have understood, we shall be voting against this directive.
Is it too much to ask that Articles 95 and 152 be respected?
All we are asking for is a minimum of subsidiarity and a modicum of tolerance.
Mr President, the actions of the European Union, the Commission and, in particular, Parliament, in their endeavour to regulate the tobacco industry, continue to give the impression that they are disregarding the needs of the workers and growers of the industry - and by the industry I mean the production, industrial and, in particular, tobacco-growing sections.
You are all aware of how heated the debate in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy was.
There have been a large number of amendments, including the one tabled by myself, attempting to defend the production sector and the tobacco-growing sector in particular.
In Europe, 135 000 families work in the tobacco industry and it employs as many as 800 000 workers, most of whom are seasonal workers hired at harvest time and during production periods.
This is a major industry which, moreover, hires more women than men to do seasonal work.
Furthermore, from a production perspective, it would be very hard to change from growing tobacco to another crop.
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has adopted an amendment withdrawing subsidies for European tobacco production.
We are concerned as to whether this instrument will genuinely be an effective means of reducing tobacco consumption.
The most immediate effect will be to weaken the situation of European tobacco-growers to the benefit of production elsewhere in the world, and the price reduction will penalise the entire production system of the European continent.
Are we saying that, in order to reduce smoking in Europe, it is necessary to kill off European tobacco growers without even any guarantee that this will reduce cigarette consumption by a single cigarette?
From where I stand, a responsible smoking reduction policy needs to be based on an awareness and prevention campaign, especially in schools. It should not penalise those who are contributing to Europe' s wealth.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there seems to me to be no question as to the validity of the proposed directive on harmonisation of the manufacture, presentation and sale of tobacco products.
Obviously, the proposal to tighten up standards for maximum nicotine, tar and carbon monoxide content in cigarettes must be considered one of the ways of ensuring better public health protection.
As a member of Parliament' s Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I should particularly like to highlight the fact that tobacco producers are not opposed to the changes proposed by the Commission, insofar as these changes are justified on public health grounds.
Like them, however, I deplore the fact that the Commission has not carried out an impact study concerning the effect of the proposal on the production sector, as it did for a number of businesses, particularly small- and medium-sized businesses.
They thus failed to take account of the fact that, on the whole, European producers will not be capable of supplying products to the required quality by the deadline of 2003.
This leads me to advocate delaying the date when these new provisions come into force.
Let me remind you that the tobacco sector, involving 130 000 producers and 400 000 seasonal workers, is more often than not located in regions which present very few alternatives for farm production.
This is a social reality which must not be forgotten, especially since, in economic terms, European production accounts for less than 25% of European tobacco consumption.
In these circumstances, jeopardising the situation of European producers would only be of benefit to the multinationals involved in import and export.
I should not like to think that this might be our objective.
Mr President, I am keen to follow the line taken by our rapporteur, Mr Maaten, and would like to ask you, fellow-Members, to do the same.
Tobacco is no ordinary product of course.
We are familiar with the fatal risks associated with tobacco, we know the statistics which have already been quoted here today.
We also know about its addictive effect.
Typical use of cigarettes is extremely dangerous, life-threateningly so.
You can be unlucky and have a car crash, or abuse alcohol, but with tobacco, the life-threatening aspect is always there.
I very much welcome the emphasis which Mr Maaten placed on the dangers of passive smoking.
A tobacco ban would be inefficient and socially unattainable at present.
But it still remains clear that those who market cigarettes should not be allowed to do so.
The product is far too dangerous.
What can we do as regulators?
First of all, we need to realise that we are in an extremely absurd situation, straddling enormous state revenue on the one hand and enormous expenditure in health insurance on the other.
We should be able to admit to this.
European policy on tobacco is not very logical, to say the least.
We as regulators should at least try to practise damage limitation. We should compel producers to make the warnings to users as clear as possible.
It may be bureaucratic, but if you see how producers deal with other requirements, then I have to say that it is necessary to spell out our regulations very clearly.
Later on this week, Parliament will be discussing phthalates and PVC softeners, and when I see how very circumspect we MEPs are, how very careful we are in dealing with these products, if I compare this with the little we are asking with regard to a dangerous product such as tobacco, I have to conclude that this Parliament can be very selective in its indignation.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall not go over the health aspects of the directive again, for indeed I support the rapporteur wholeheartedly as well as the amendments tabled by my fellow Member, Mrs Roth-Behrendt.
I should like briefly to mention the matter of the potential unemployment created by this directive.
The tobacco industry presents itself as the harbinger of employment in Europe and claims to defend jobs, but what has the management in the tobacco industry actually achieved between the late 1980s and the present?
Jobs in the industry have been "rationalised" by 50%.
Employment levels in tobacco production, which formerly stood at 120 000 people, now involves no more than 60 000 people.
A World Bank study shows that a reduction in tobacco consumption worldwide will lead to an increase in job creation: for if the money spent today on tobacco is spent in future on some other luxury product, for example, this will create more jobs because the tobacco industry is one that has been rationalised to the bone.
It is therefore not true that the directive will cause job losses.
To return to the question of exports to third world countries, is the health of an African worth less than the health of a European?
The speeches made by some Members of this House, who I sincerely believe to be inspired by the arguments of the tobacco industry, are reminiscent of the debate on chocolate.
As soon as certain industries and certain employers in Europe stand to gain something, the solidarity advocated in our speeches no longer seems to apply.
This is one more reason to support Mr Maaten' s report, and also the European Commission' s efforts to extend the directive to exports too.
Mr President, for a long time, we have held the belief that to many, tobacco is a harmless stimulant and that its production creates employment for farmers and workers, particularly in economically weak regions.
The production and consumption of tobacco increased dramatically in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
It was then thought that smoking was normal and that any self-respecting man should light up a cigarette.
In my language, which is Dutch, there are two expressions which illustrate how smoking was viewed then.
The first one is: 'het is geen man die niet roken kan' [he who does not smoke is not a man], whilst the second one reads: 'een tevreden roker is geen onruststoker' [a satisfied smoker does not cause any trouble].
Since then, the production and distribution of tobacco has increasingly ended up in the hands of large international chains in whose interest it is to keep successive new generations of consumers dependent on them on a permanent basis.
Their growth market lies with young people, women and people with little education, those on low incomes and with few prospects in life.
However, there are also many men, especially those who are well-educated, who are trying to kick the habit of smoking, but it is just as difficult as it is to abstain from alcohol or drugs.
Tobacco generates big bucks.
This is why there are stakeholders who would prefer to continue to keep everything as free as possible within this market.
Freedom of production, import and advertising, and freedom to mislead and sponsor events which attract large crowds of people.
Tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide make people ill, as a result of which they die prematurely of heart or lung diseases.
Non-smokers run risks too because they are obliged to inhale the smoke of those smoking around them.
Accordingly, tobacco is not just about economic interests, rather it is far more of a public health problem.
It makes little sense to remind people that it is their individual responsibility whether they smoke or not.
This is not about one case in isolation but about the responsibility of all of us together.
We cannot leave the market free and subsequently blame the victims of smoking for their bad health.
This is not how we treat consumers of heroin or cocaine.
It is necessary to ensure that tobacco products are hard to come by and to warn the rest of the users about the risks as best we can.
The norm should be that smoking is abnormal and that new generations must be protected from this addiction.
From the public health point of view it is necessary that we no longer take the interests of tobacco producers and sellers into account.
The situation would hugely improve if the packets were to display the largest possible warning sign and if advertising and sponsoring were banned altogether.
In addition, it should not be possible for people to buy cigarettes at supermarkets, cafÃ©s or petrol stations as an afterthought.
If you are 100% determined in your mind that you want to buy a tobacco product, you should have to visit an outlet which only sells this product.
This could best be achieved in the same way as in the Netherlands, where soft drugs can only be sold in a limited number of outlets which need to have a council permit.
Some opponents of the currently proposed measures blame the rapporteur for making outrageous proposals.
To those opponents, I would like to reveal that in the Netherlands, Mr Maaten belongs to the Liberal Party which adopts the most non-interventionist approach to industry' s interests and which has turned the free market principle into its cardinal ideology.
If even a representative of such a party proposes to further regulate the market, then this is all the more proof that public health is at serious risk.
As representative of the Socialist Party, I would even go further than Mr Maaten or the majority within the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection.
I represent the section of my group which denounces the idea that tobacco production could only fall or disappear altogether once people have kicked the habit of smoking largely or completely.
I believe it has to precede it.
We do, however, fully agree with the other opinions in our group that American chains should not be in a position, on account of free imports, to plug the gap which will emerge if European production drops, and that economically weaker regions in Southern Europe should be given support in order to create replacement employment when tobacco production disappears.
Mr President, the Maaten report on today' s agenda has lead to this interesting debate. However, we must not forget that our business here is politics, which is quite a different matter from merely sitting here listening to technical arguments or pressure from the varies lobbies such as Philip Morris or the large multinationals: we should be thinking about the future of Europe!

In my opinion, the Maaten report, which is certainly technically sound and lays down appropriate parameters, represents a move towards the political will to protect the right to health, a right which must be protected and guaranteed for each and every European citizen.
It is, in effect, all part of the realisation throughout the world that smoking is harmful, and we have the figures to prove it.
Having established that, we can then discuss any other justifications we may wish to.
Smoking is harmful and we must use the Maaten report to regulate tax reductions, labelling and the other initiatives proposed in the report which are certainly, for the time being, important but not decisive measures.
I feel that the main point to be stressed is the need to create a 'non-smoking' culture.
Last century, smoking was part of the culture. It was important and provided a sense of security.
Now, however, we have to turn that culture on its head.
Of course, we must also stress the freedom of each one of us, of all citizens, to choose, and in this case I hope that we will choose the freedom not to smoke, freedom which, however, does not hide the harmful results and dangers of smoking itself.
On the other hand, I also have to consider the 400 000 workers and the 150 000 or so tobacco growers of the tobacco industry.
In this past century, we have succeeded in changing nuclear energy into something different, into clean energy. It would seem absurd not to be able to change or contribute to the transformation of such industries into equally productive industries which will develop economically and socially in the future.
It would be completely absurd, especially at the dawn of a new millennium, in an era in which man landed on the moon, if we do not manage to bring about a change in this industry or to provide accurate information regarding the genuine harm caused by smoking.
Well, in my opinion, we have two main tasks: we must endeavour to provide accurate information and give everybody the chance to choose whether to smoke or not, and I hope that they will choose not to - my own family has suffered bereavements through this - and, at the same time, we must bring about a change of culture in the relevant industries.
Mr President, smoking forms a serious threat to public health.
In the European Union, more than half a million people die each year as a result of smoking.
Due to the addictive effect, it appears very difficult to stop smoking.
Unfortunately, it is still the case that many young people take up smoking.
Tobacco manufacturers pursue a deliberate policy in this direction by lending cigarette smoking a sporty and macho image in advertising.
Once the tobacco industry has won over a young person, the industry is generally guaranteed another regular customer.
This policy of reeling in customers is helped by the fact that the addictive effect is enhanced by adding substances to cigarettes so that the nicotine is better absorbed.
In addition, with misleading messages such as "light" and "ultra light" , the tobacco industry is trying to create the impression that the relevant tobacco products are less harmful.
The European Commission' s proposal and Mr Maaten' s excellent report adequately address the above-mentioned problems.
I do, however, have two further remarks to make.
Firstly, European tobacco policy is not consistent, a point which has already been argued.
On the one hand, the use of tobacco is discouraged, but on the other hand more than EUR 1 billion is spent annually on subsidies for the tobacco industry.
It is high time that these subsidies were phased out gradually down to zero.
My second comment concerns labelling. I am in favour of strict labelling i.e. 40% or 50% of the packaging for health warnings is a workable compromise.
As for the content of the warnings, I think that the text "als u rookt, bent u uzelf aan het doden" [if you smoke, you are killing yourself] has just crossed the boundary of what is reasonable.
Warnings should appeal to the smokers' own perception of the environment and should not be formulated such that their effect is like water off a duck' s back.
Mr President, today' s debate reminds me, word for word, of the debate we had at the second reading of the directive on the advertising of tobacco products.
The same legal arguments are being used as a scapegoat by the very same Members of Parliament who, under cover of a putative sacrosanct legal coherence, are in fact defending vast financial interests.
I am sorry to see that over the years there has been no development in their arguments.
I regret this all the more because now even the cigarette industry itself is tending to acknowledge the fact that this debate should be obsolete.
Those who are now hypocritically rehashing yesterday' s legal arguments are taking part in an outmoded rearguard debate.
From a legal point of view, the debate of the future is the one dealing with the court cases which we are starting to see in Europe.
How is it possible to weigh the financial interests of a number of industrialists against the devastating effects of tobacco consumption upon health?
Every year, tobacco kills more people.
And, in comparison with the restrictions we are subject to in the context of mad cow disease, how is it possible that we are doing nothing about the 500 000 smoking-related deaths every year in Europe?
How is it possible not to shudder when thinking of our young people, our young women and our young mothers?
On the specific subject of agricultural subsidies in favour of tobacco production, I should like to see the European Union at long last adopting a consistent policy.
It is not possible, on the one hand, to offer significant subsidies to tobacco production while, on the other hand, releasing ever inadequate funds to combat smoking and cancer.
For years the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has been denouncing these budget decisions.
In terms of the common agricultural policy, new plans must be thought up with a view to finding alternative solutions for farmers.
I should like to see this directive apply to all tobacco products, not just cigarettes but also cigars, rolling tobacco and pipe tobacco for, while consumption of such products does not cause the same diseases, tobacco for oral use causes equally terrible devastation.
This directive will not, unfortunately, solve all the problems related to tobacco consumption, but it does at least aim to attempt to inform the consumer.
Mr President, anyone who follows this debate will see that there is a kind of war going on between those who are trying to protect health and those who defend tobacco.
However, as Mrs GrossetÃªte has pointed out, the problem stems from the fact that legal arguments have been given and that, by a small majority, the Committee on Legal Affairs decided that Article 95 was not the appropriate legal basis.
As a Socialist member and spokesperson in the Legal Affairs Committee, I would like to reiterate the objection to this point of view.
Article 95 is the article which takes up the former Article 100A of the Treaty, on the basis of which the three previous directives, which are now being remodelled in this new directive, had been adopted.
Therefore, to reject that legal basis now is to go against our previous tradition, to cast doubt upon what we had done, which seems to me to be above all very dangerous for the construction of a European legal system.
To speak of subsidiarity in this area, an area strictly relating to the internal market, which specifically involves the health of the citizens, regulated by Article 95, is a way of diverting the battle and, in my view, this is very dangerous because, while the defence of an economic sector seems to me to be important, and worthy of respect, it must not lead this Parliament to change the legal basis or, as is intended for example in another amendment, to suspend any decisions until the decision of the Court of Justice on the directive on tobacco advertising is adopted.
This directive which we are discussing today has nothing to do with the directive on tobacco advertising.
Therefore, Mr President, I believe that we must be consistent, maintain our previous attitude in this respect, maintain the legal basis proposed by the Commission and endorsed by the Legal Services of the three institutions and refuse to accept this abuse of the subsidiarity theory which would truly put an end to the existence of the European Union and the competences of this Parliament.
Mr President, as I was coming to Parliament this morning I remembered the night I sat by my father's bedside looking at his wasted body as the lung cancer finally claimed him.
I am sure I am not the only person in this Parliament to have lost friends or family through smoking.
The fact is that if the laws on drugs which apply in most countries across the European Union were applied consistently, then tobacco manufacturers would all be locked up behind bars and condemned as murderers for deliberately making their products addictive.
Yet when it comes to the greatest killer drug of all, we apply different rules.
There is no consistency and we say that people should be allowed to choose for themselves.
As a Liberal, I agree with that position: people should be allowed to choose for themselves.
However, everything possible must be done to ensure that those decisions are made with full knowledge of the consequences.
The manufacturers say that everyone knows the risks already; that there is no need to increase the size of the health warnings, and that they certainly should not adopt the sort of proposal I am putting forward, to supplement the health warnings with some hard-hitting pictures to drive home the consequences.
Frankly, the manufacturers have an addiction of their own: an addiction to trying to mislead us.
If the rules on advertising were changed, manufacturers would grasp the opportunity to promote their products in every possible way, because they believe that advertising works.
And we should accept that fact: advertising does work.
We should seek to turn the tables on them.
We should seek to ensure that the cigarette packs themselves are turned into instruments to promote health, not death.
We should follow the Canadian example and ensure that advertising is used effectively.
And the bigger the better.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by congratulating Mr Jules Maaten on his first-class report.
Smoking is a dangerous habit which even harms non-smokers, but at the end of the day, I am liberal enough to say that everyone should decide for themselves whether they smoke cigarettes, use dope, drink alcohol, or whatever. But it is up to the government to point out the harmful effects to addicts and other citizens.
The tiny label of 10% which we have at present is not effective then.
We need warnings which are much bigger.
But 80% of new smokers are young people under the age of 18.
The traditional warning that smoking harms your health cuts no ice with them.
The warning that smoking causes impotence could possibly work, especially if it is illustrated, as young people take a great interest in sex.
I would like to add one other point.
Anyone who has seen the film "The Insider" knows that the cigarette industry adds ammonia and other substances in order to encourage addiction.
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection has endorsed the green amendment in order to rule this out.
Fellow MEPs, I would like to call on you to back Jules Maaten' s excellent report.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, one cannot fail to notice the confusion - we hope not deliberate confusion - in the report by the Committee on the Environment, which is turning the campaign against smoking into a campaign against tobacco producers.
We do not dispute the fact that smoking damages your health and we therefore agree with the spirit of the directive proposed by the European Commission.
However, we must not forget that very little, in fact just under 30%, of the tobacco consumed in the European Union is produced in the European Union.
Most of it is imported.
Consequently, measures to reduce tobacco production will do nothing to reduce consumption; they will merely boost imports.
We need to take measures against imports and, once consumption has fallen to production levels, we shall have no objection to discussing production cut-backs.
I should like to concentrate on three separate points: first, we are categorically opposed to Amendment No 17 by the Committee on the Environment, which recommends a gradual reduction in production aids for tobacco.
This would spell financial disaster for hundreds of thousands of tobacco producers in Greece and other southern countries of the European Union, at no benefit to public health, for the reasons already stated.
Secondly, we are also categorically opposed to Amendment No 21 in the report, which abolishes the European Commission' s proposal to extend the date of application for tar yields by Greece to the end of 2006.
This extension was proposed because of the special nature of certain varieties of tobacco cultivated in Greece and abolishing it will hit tobacco production in Greece extremely hard.
Thirdly, we agree with the view that reductions in the amounts of harmful substances should apply both to cigarettes consumed in the European Union and to cigarettes produced for export.
It would be absurd to maintain that people from countries outside the European Union have greater resistance to harmful substances.
Mr President, I am satisfied that there is general consensus within the fifteen Member States that legislation governing the sale, presentation and advertising of tobacco products must be fundamentally changed.
The protection of the general public health of the citizens of the Union, must be a central priority for all European Union legislators at any time.
As a result of the Amsterdam Treaty we now have an equal say with the EU governments in the area of legislation on public health matters.
Let us use it intelligently.
The issue of cigarette smoking and the damage which cigarettes do to the health of the citizens of the Union is a very serious public health matter indeed.
For the most part I support the key amendments which were passed by the Committee on the Environment last month, in their call for the warnings on cigarette packets to be larger than proposed by the Commission.
The warning about the public health risk of cigarette smoking should cover 40% of the front of every packet and 60% of the back of every cigarette packet sold within the Union.
Labelling requirements in general should be stricter and include fuller health warnings and the list of ingredients should also be available on request.
Descriptions such as low tar, mild and light must in future be banned.
I support the elimination of such descriptions because they give the impression that smoking such cigarettes does not damage the health of individuals as badly as other cigarettes: this is clearly misleading.
Such slick advertising by tobacco manufacturers must not be permitted.
The Committee on the Environment has also called for warnings to be printed only in black on a white background, so as to give such warnings more impact.
The committee members also consider that general warnings such as smoking kills are inadequate and I agree with this analysis.
Messages such as "Smoking kills half a million persons each year in the European Union", or "85% of lung cancers are caused by tobacco" should be the messages printed on cigarette boxes in the future.
Mr President, I suspect that in my group as in most others there is a wide range of views, from people who think that smoking is a matter for consenting adults, largely but not necessarily in private, to those who think that sellers of tobacco should suffer capital punishment and that those who smoke should be incarcerated in secure hospitals.
But all of us would agree that the primary purpose of this measure is to protect children and to deter them from a habit that may kill them.
The best way is not to worry about maximum levels of content but to worry about minimum levels, so that the first taste for a child is so foul that they do not seek to repeat the experience.
Certainly we should support the ban on the use of labels such as mild and light or anything that suggests that the product is safer.
The truth is that people inhale more deeply to get the taste and so can actually damage themselves more.
Such labels are deceptive and dangerous and should be banned.
Otherwise labelling is of marginal and temporary impact, whatever the picture, whatever the words, and there is some danger of a cigarette card mentality emerging, with the different messages becoming collector's items.
The export issue is probably the most difficult.
It is one for balanced judgment: on the one hand, it is odd to say that what is not good for our citizens is okay to export to other countries; but on the other hand, it is presumptuous of us to say what standards other countries should adopt and on balance I come down in favour of the second approach.
Lastly, we have the issue of subsidies for growing tobacco, paid by our taxpayers to people in our Europe.
It is immoral and obscene that we allow subsidies for growing something that we know will kill and will cost us billions of euros in health care for smokers.
Our governments must stop this and we must stop them supporting it.
Mr President, this was a highly controversial report within the Industry Committee which only approved its opinion by 29 votes to 26.
The division in the Environment Committee was overcome as the major groups managed to agree a compromise.
On behalf of the Socialist Group, we support this compromise.
We reject the view that the legal basis of the report is wrong.
We support the creation within the EU of a single market in cigarette and tobacco products.
At the same time, within the limits of Community law, we would like to use the opportunity of maintaining and strengthening public health protection within the EU.
We believe that nicotine and tar levels need to be further limited and new limits should be imposed on carbon monoxide levels.
We believe that health warnings should be bolder, clearer and larger.
Nevertheless, my concern is that in some areas, our good intentions are in advance of common sense.
If we are to have a single market, surely we should have mutual recognition of the common procedures for testing.
It would be absurd to make each Member State test separately.
Secondly, I hope that countries outside the EU will follow our lead in cutting limits on nicotine, tar and carbon monoxide.
It seems absurd that we insist on exporting jobs from the EU to applicant countries and others to produce cigarettes that will be legal to import for personal consumption within the European Union.
Thirdly, I accept that the latest research indicates that smokers compensate for lower tar levels by smoking light cigarettes differently.
Nevertheless, banning such terms as "mild", "light" and "low" threatens to make illegal long-established extra-European brands like "Mild Seven" with all the consequences for the WTO rules and it will merely increase sales of thesauruses to the tobacco industry.
If I were to be mischievous, I would recommend "Organic Green" or "One" as appropriate substitutes.
Despite these reservations, I hope the general thrust of the report will receive strong support from Parliament.
Mr President, allow me to adopt a rather Swedish and personal tone.
Swedish snuff is most certainly not good for you and is not to be confused with any sort of 'health food' .
It is a very addictive drug, and I most certainly would not want the tobacco industry, by which I here mean Swedish snuff manufacturers, to be given the opportunity to market snuff in the rest of Europe as something healthy.
That would be devastating.
In spite of these misgivings of mine, I cannot quite understand our allowing all other forms of tobacco product - cigarettes, cigars and pipes - which are in themselves more dangerous for the individual who uses them.
These tobacco products are most certainly and without any doubt harmful to health.
The fact that snuff is less dangerous to people who use it is, in actual fact, less important.
What gives snuff an advantage is the fact that nicotine addicts can use it without affecting the environment.
Passive smoking is probably the most insidious effect of tobacco.
We can experience this on a daily basis, both in this Assembly and in this House too.
There is smoking going on everywhere, something which sometimes causes acute difficulty in breathing for those who are allergic to smoke, among fellow Members of Parliament too.
One ought not perhaps to refer to one' s own experience in this Assembly, but I myself took up smoking when I was very young.
At that time, it was not only cool to smoke, but it was even useful.
Rather tubby young ladies, in particular, were extremely well served by cigarettes.
Fifteen years ago, my husband contracted a serious lung disease.
Then, if not before, I painfully learned the cost in terms of suffering of the smoke produced by myself and all smokers.
I now regard myself as a nicotine addict. But I am not bothering anyone else.
Mr President, the right to health should be enjoyed by all citizens of the European Union, which is why we consider the draft directive on the manufacture, presentation and sale of tobacco products to be extremely important.
It has been proven that certain types of cancer and cardiovascular and lung diseases are directly related to smoking.
It is our duty to provide proper and adequate information on what smoking does to your health.
It is our duty to promote health through a public awareness, information and behaviour modification programme, especially for the most easily swayed section of the population, i.e. the young.
The Commission proposal is based on Article 95 of the Treaty, taking account of a high level of protection of public health by harmonising the internal market in tobacco products and we agree wholeheartedly with this.
We also agree that tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide yields should be reduced and that the terms 'light' and 'ultra light' should be abolished because they create the erroneous impression that smokers are at less risk.
We would also like to have a positive list of additives.
As far as the form and content of the message are concerned, it is important that it should be clear, comprehensible and brief if it is to be noticed at once, and we therefore consider it imperative to increase the surface area covered.
However, I should like, Mr President, to touch on what I consider to be another important matter.
It is idealistic to believe that we will stop smokers smoking if we abolish production aids for tobacco in Europe.
Those who have still not been persuaded that smoking damages your health will continue to smoke cigarettes imported from third countries, thereby undermining agricultural production in certain areas of the Union.
I think that a fundamental study of the financial and social fallout is needed if we are to avoid hitting tobacco producers.
Mr President, 500 000 EU citizens die each year from smoking - that is 1 400 a day.
Even if a small number of people stop, it will have huge health implications, not only for smokers but for passive smokers as well.
It is important that we fight delaying tactics today.
The EU already regulates health warnings and tar yields.
Smokers also have a right to know that there are more than 600 additives licensed for use in tobacco products.
They have a right to know that "light" and "mild" branding is misleading.
People inhale more if they have a light cigarette than any other cigarette.
The health warning should be large and explicit.
We must warn of the dangers of smoking, the dangers of lung cancer and also the danger of bronchitis and asthma.
People must know that it is not just lung cancer but other lung diseases and other diseases as well.
We must warn of the dangers of passive smoking.
I know the dangers of smoking and the dangers of passive smoking.
I started smoking when I was 11 years old.
I ended up smoking 40 a day.
I had chronic bronchitis and I was told by the doctor that I had to give up as otherwise my life would be in danger.
My health has been damaged by smoking.
There was no warning when I took up smoking.
Maybe I would not have taken it up if there had been.
Now I am the victim of passive smoking.
I just have to pass a cigarette and I have an asthma attack, especially in this building.
I have asthma attack after asthma attack.
I am a good example of why we should adopt this report now.
Even if one person stops smoking as a result of this, or does not take it up; even if one person is not inconsiderate any more; even if it stops one person being hospitalised because of other people's smoke, it is worth it.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, smoking is unhealthy and smokers should be aware of this.
Sound and clear warnings about all kinds of diseases and disorders are therefore, in our opinion, a matter of greatest importance.
I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the rapporteur on the dynamism and perseverance he has displayed in this connection.
The European Union too, should know that smoking is unhealthy.
In fact, it should put its money where its mouth is.
The Tobacco Directive is a good opportunity to demonstrate that the internal market is not just about the free movement of goods.
We have to attach clear health requirements to the goods within the internal market.
It is not just the tar and nicotine yields which are at issue here, but also mainly additives.
Additives which encourage addiction should be banned at the earliest opportunity, as far as I am concerned.
The other aspect of the Union policy is the issue of tobacco subsidies.
It would indicate a lack of consistency if we continued subsidising tobacco products in the knowledge that smoking is unhealthy.
If phasing out subsidies has social and financial implications for the tobacco growers in the poorest regions, we are all jointly responsible for finding a solution.
Smoking is unhealthy.
We are all agreed on this, but should we be sharing this with the entire world?
This is one of the most interesting and principle questions in today' s debate.
It would be a considerable change in policy if we were to impose European standards on other countries.
If this change were extended to other fields, it could mean that European companies would only produce for the European market.
This would, as such, lead to a certain degree of regionalisation of the world economy, a regionalisation which, in the case of the tobacco industry, would be at the expense of the position of Europe-based companies.
The question is whether we want this.
To impose standards on other countries can come across as presumptuous, moralistic or patronising.
After all, other countries can set their own standards which industry has to comply with.
A sound approach, however, would be to make the European standard compulsory in the case of export to countries where such standards are lacking.
In this way, we would at least avoid other countries, especially Third-World countries, being lumbered with second-rate cigarettes.
Mr President, although I value the work of rapporteur Maaten, I have to say that I am greatly disturbed by the European Parliament' s inconsistent line with regard to tobacco.
The report once again reflects the ambivalence of the European Union - as has been highlighted in this debate - which subsidises the tobacco cultivation by more than EUR one billion and collects more than EUR 70 billion in tax money annually on the one hand and which curbs the sale of tobacco products on the other.
I would also like to emphasise that it is not up to the European Parliament to deny tobacco products, which are legally available on the market, a fair chance of commercialisation.
What strikes me in the debate is that we seem to overlook the objective of this directive.
It aims to reinforce the internal market by promoting better harmonisation and by removing barriers to trade.
In this respect, I notice an imbalance in the present report, an imbalance between the need for harmonisation and the aim of protecting the consumer.
I take exception to the fact that the consumer is considered as someone who cannot judge for himself what he should or should not do.
The proposed warnings on the packet completely miss the point.
Whatever the dimensions, the information will remain ineffective.
Information on the dangers of smoking will need to be conveyed in a more effective way if we want to achieve the objective.
Above all, we should not forget that it is - and should remain - up to the citizens to decide for themselves how they wish to conduct their lives and they should be able to continue to do so.
Mr President, I believe that the objective of achieving greater protection for the consumer in relation to tobacco consumption is absolutely shared by all of us.
To this end, it also seems to me to be fair and beyond all doubt that the tobacco industry will have to adapt to stricter conditions of manufacture, presentation and sale, such as those proposed by this directive.
In this respect, I congratulate Mr Maaten on his work.
Nevertheless, we cannot put the cart before the horse if we want this work to succeed.
The reality is that Europe produces and exports tobacco and, furthermore, its cultivation is subject to significant subsidies.
As has been pointed out, this does not just involve the interests of the large multinationals.
It involves the legitimate and fair way of life of hundreds of modest families.
If we wish to prohibit these subsidies, let us prohibit them, but not without truly seeking alternatives which are proven to be viable.
With regard to exports, it seems logical that the European Union should apply the same levels of content for cigarettes for consumption within the internal market as for those intended for exports.
In this respect, a proposal of time limits may seem logical.
However, we cannot deny or forget the authority of each state to manage the risks within its own society.
If we believe that we can and must teach someone something, we must do so firstly - and this has been said here - through education and increasing awareness and not through an imposition which has dubious results as an instrument for reducing the consumption of tobacco.
Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking Commissioner Byrne, something which has not been done today, for I do in fact think that it is a good proposal that the Commission has come up with, a proposal which I should really like to have voted for without changes.
It is a good contribution to reducing the poison content of cigarettes and to providing far better information about the damaging effects on health of cigarette smoking.
I find it sad that there are MEPs who are trying to weaken the Commission' s proposal.
I am thinking, for instance, of the discussion about the legal base.
In my opinion, this is a ridiculous discussion.
The legal services have agreed that the legal base is in order, and I must say, as a lawyer, that I am rather embarrassed about the fact that the majority of members of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market are so unqualified and frivolous and completely confuse the law with their own political wishes.
On the question of when the proposed legislation is to come into effect, I would say that I do not think that there is any argument, either technological or industrial, in favour of postponing the date when the lower limit values are to come into force.
I should like us to decide on the end of 2003 as the time when the legislation is to come into effect but, as a compromise, we could agree to the end of 2004, if necessary.
In my opinion, what is at issue here is an unnecessary impairment of public health.
Turning finally to the question of exports outside the EU, I wish to say that, in my view, it would be immoral if we were to allow the export of cigarettes which, on health grounds, we prohibit our own citizens from smoking.
Under those conditions, I simply do not think that we can allow ourselves to export more cigarettes which are a danger to health.
I could live with a compromise in the form of the year 2006, but I could not compromise any further on this point.
I hope that, in the voting tomorrow too, we shall arrive at a result here in Parliament which does not significantly weaken the Commission' s proposal.
Mr President, tobacco use is the single most preventable cause of ill health and premature death throughout most of the world.
In Scotland, which I represent, one in five people will die of smoking-related diseases.
We have an opportunity of doing something about that this week.
We must pass this report into law and thus save lives.
The reality that smoking kills is not getting across at the moment.
We need a bigger, bolder and clearer health message to make smokers more aware.
If the size of the health warning directly reflected the risk to health, the label would cover the whole cigarette packet.
Half of all long-term smokers will eventually be killed by tobacco and of these half will die during middle age, losing 20 to 25 years of their lives.
This directive will save lives because it is going to alter the content of cigarettes by reducing tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide yields and do away with misleading descriptions, such as "light" and mild".
Consumers, especially young women, are being sold the idea that so-called "light" or "mild" cigarettes are better for them, as if they were the tobacco equivalent of low-fat yoghurt.
However, low-fat yoghurt does not rot your teeth, blacken your lungs or put you on a ventilator.
Yet smokers of mild cigarettes smoke more deeply to get the same nicotine hit as smokers of other products and receive the same level of damage.
