Meetings of Council working parties have revealed this to be an issue that my experts are discussing and one where we shall certainly be able to work out a solution in respect of the European small claims procedure, too.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, this takes us to another very delicate area.
There has, of course, been a Proposal for a framework decision on combating racism and xenophobia from the Commission, which was presented on 29Â NovemberÂ 2001.
Despite intensive discussions in the Council, it did not prove possible to reach agreement on this proposal in FebruaryÂ 2003.
Following on from this, the Italian delegation presented an alternative version of the Proposal for a framework decision in MarchÂ 2003, but this, too, failed to meet with agreement from the delegations.
Subsequently, on 24Â FebruaryÂ 2005, the Council instructed its working party on substantive criminal law to continue the discussions on the proposal.
Accordingly, the working party resumed the work on the proposal, based on the state of affairs reached in 2003.
The debate on this framework decision at the Council meeting on 2Â and 3Â JuneÂ 2005 made it clear that there is no scope for consensus among Member States.
Naturally, this was a bitter pill to swallow, especially for those Member States who have given this framework decision their strong support.
In view of the past history of this framework decision, which I have just described to you, a resumption of negotiations does not strike the Austrian Presidency as promising at the present time.
Nevertheless, the Presidency does not want to let this very important dossier â and especially the political message behind it â come to a complete standstill, and so we shall be holding a seminar on this subject, also in agreement with the Commission and the European Monitoring Centre for Racism and Xenophobia, before the end of our Presidency.
We expect there to be about 100 participants in this seminar.
The seminar will take place in Vienna from 20â22Â JuneÂ 2006 and will discuss selected problems connected with this proposal.
As I am sure you can imagine â indeed, this also emerged from the recent discussions on the caricatures â we find ourselves once more in the midst of the area of tension between our political message â that we unambiguously oppose racism and xenophobia â and freedom of expression.
It is this very tension that we have to defuse if we are to really make important progress.
These are also exactly the kind of issues that are to be discussed at the seminar.
It is intended that two representatives of each of the Member States, acceding countries and candidate countries participate in this seminar.
We also intend to invite NGOs, in particular, who are familiar with the issues, and also representatives of the Council of Europe, of the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, of the EU network of independent experts in fundamental rights, and of the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance.
It goes without saying that representatives of Parliament will also be invited to participate.
Parliament will receive an official invitation to this seminar in late March.
The programme will also have been finalised by then, and we shall be able to present it.
In addition, as already mentioned in connection with Question NoÂ 4 on the protection of fundamental rights, I should like to point out that the European Council decided in DecemberÂ 2003 to establish a European Fundamental Rights Agency, a fact it confirmed in DecemberÂ 2004.
The Councilâs ad hoc working party on fundamental rights and citizenship is currently examining the proposal for a regulation presented by the Commission in JuneÂ 2005.
The Agency is scheduled to start work on 1Â JanuaryÂ 2007.
We know that this is a very tight schedule, but we hope to be able to keep to it.
The Austrian Presidency attaches the highest priority to this issue and hopes to be able to conclude the negotiations so that the Agency can start work on schedule.
Â Â  There are some difficult issues â such as Holocaust denial and protecting freedom of speech â but it is scandalous that in 2006 there is still no EU-wide response to the alarming and increasing problem of racist violence.
It must be possible to get EU-wide agreement on the core issue of preventing the day-to-day racial harassment and hatred suffered by many of our citizens and residents.
Some countries, such as Greece, Italy and Portugal, currently fail even to record racial attacks.
Please name the obstructive Member States that are holding up this framework decision agreement and make a big push during your Presidency to outlaw race hate crimes.
All power to your elbow!
Â Â  â I could not agree more with the honourable Memberâs statement.
From the Presidencyâs point of view, we of course have every interest in sending out an important political signal on this, too.
We assume that the seminar we are holding will objectify the matter again and, by means of expert opinions â particularly large numbers of expert opinions â will produce an outcome that will make it possible for us to strike the necessary balance in future between our shared aspiration: namely, to oppose racism and xenophobia most effectively, but without putting freedom of expression at risk as a result.
At all events, we wish to make quite considerable progress, and we hope that, given a new impetus, it proves possible for the Finnish Presidency to successfully conclude this dossier, or at least to continue the negotiations, on the basis of our work.
Â Â  â Mr President, Minister, racism and xenophobia have even penetrated sport and football.
I am sure you know full well that we had numerous episodes against coloured athletes and footballers at numerous events and numerous â mainly football â games in England, Spain, France and so on. Does the Austrian Presidency intend to recommend that Germany take measures against racism and xenophobia during the World Cup next summer and how will you address them, given that you will still have the Presidency?
Â Â  â We are assuming that Germany is governed by the rule of law and that it is up to the German authorities to take suitable measures to combat racism and xenophobia, including during the World Cup.
I am quite certain that Germany will take the appropriate measures.
Â Â  My question, Question NoÂ 8, also deals with xenophobia.
Ministers go on here with very long replies.
Is it not possible, out of courtesy to Members, to take questions together when they relate to the same subject?
I come here every month to table questions but they are never reached.
We reach a very small number of questions, and answers are allowed to go on forever.
The very next question in my name addresses the issue of xenophobia and I do not know why it was not taken together with Question NoÂ 7.
Â Â  Mr President, on a point of order, the Minister of Justice of Austria has come all this way.
We were told to table questions to her.
We had to wait until March.
Some of these questions were tabled in December, but we waited patiently for three months to put the questions to her.
Now she has been allowed to answer precisely two questions in three months!
It is not her fault, we are delighted she came â thank you for coming, Minister â but would you please convey to President Borrell that this is a failure.
It does not work.
It is not a good system for the Minister to come and answer two questions after three months.
Â Â  â MadamÂ President, I have actually answered Questions Nos 7 and 8 by Sarah Ludford and Gay Mitchell together, but I of course welcome supplementary questions.
Â Â  Given that xenophobia and racism is often evident at sporting events, would the President-in-Office consider, as part of the plan, using sport as a way to fight xenophobia?
From acorns grow oak trees.
In my own constituency, Crumlin United Football Club â a club for young people, where Robbie Keane came from â each year holds a sports festival weekend where people not only play sport but also have cultural exchanges.
Would the President-in-Office consider having a weekend across the European Union where similar sporting and cultural exchanges take place, so that we use sport to fight xenophobia?
Â Â  â MadamÂ President, MrÂ Mitchell, I think that that is a good idea in principle, as I, too, believe that we must together fight to ensure that racism and xenophobia in Europe do not stand a chance.
I also see that sport is capable of building bridges in this regard, because when young people, especially â who are our future, after all â and often adults, too, exercise together, they can then go on to undertake activities together.
It is not only sport that has a potential role to play here, however; I also see definite opportunities in the field of culture.
Even though the two are not directly connected, we have to try to build these bridges in many different areas.
Racism and xenophobia are very often connected with prejudice.
Prejudice tends to arise out of unfamiliarity with other cultures, because unfamiliar things are often associated with fear.
Since fear, in turn, gives rise to negative feelings, it is entirely possible, of course, for racism and xenophobia to arise.
For that reason, everything that could result in our getting to know one another better, getting to know other cultures even better, is welcome as a means to beat xenophobia.
The question is â since the honourable Member specifically addressed me as a Minister for Justice â whether the Council actually has the competence to do this under the EU Treaty.
I do believe, however, that this is an important political message that all of us together should pass on.
Â Â  My sincerest thanks for these comments.
We shall discuss them with the Council Presidency and consider how to proceed next time to the satisfaction of all parties.
Â Â  â On a point of order, I am not sure that the point has been understood.
The Austrian Presidency chose to change the system for answering Council questions, which meant a three-month wait for many people who are listed here, including myself.
Mr Newton Dunn made that point.
We have waited for three months.
The Minister has been very gracious.
It is not her fault that the Presidency decided to change the system.
The Minister has been incredibly gracious in answering an extra question.
I have never seen that happen before.
However, can you please now review that decision and go back to the old system?
This one simply does not work.
We have put down serious questions on radicalisation and other issues, which have now not been answered after three months.
Please consider going back to the old system.
Â Â  Questions which had not been answered for lack of time would receive written answers (see Annex).
That concludes Question Time to the Council.
Â Â  The next item is questions to the Commission (B6-0013/2006).
Â Â  Madam President, please excuse me for taking up a little time before we begin Questions to the Commission, but I wish to express my surprise, even consternation, at what has happened to one of the questions that I had presented specifically for this sitting.
While last week I was told that my question on the maintenance or modification of the decision to reduce the number of Spanish translators in the European Commission was going to be the third question to be replied to during this Question Time, last night I received a communication indicating that the President of Parliament had judged my question to be inadmissible.
I have received a letter today from Mr Harald RÃžmer, the Deputy Secretary-General, in which he explains to me that this decision has been made because an oral reply was given to a similar question from me in February.
Mr RÃžmer has surely only read the title of my question, which is the same, but has not read the text.
The text of my question in February and that of my question this month are entirely different.
Could anybody tell me, for example, when the Commission has said whether it is going to reduce the number of translators in the Spanish service to 67 by the end of the year or how it is going to sustain such a decision at the next European Union-Latin America Summit, which will take place in Vienna.
I do not accept the statement that my question is inadmissible.
I believe that it infringes my rights as a Member of Parliament, and I demand that my question receive a reply, if not during this sitting, then next month.
Â Â  . MadamÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the question raises an important issue since it refers to funds for a project that is essential for us, specifically, a research project on the issue of crime.
For technical reasons it is not possible to increase the funding, as MrÂ Newton Dunn requests, since this is a project from 2004 that is to finish in 2006; it is possible, however, within the framework of that programme, to organise seminars covering the activities and analyses of the new Member States, as MrÂ Newton Dunn would like to see.
In addition, there is another different programme, again financed by the Commission, which specifically applies to all the Member States, including, therefore, the new Member States, and covers precisely the collection of statistical data and information on five types of serious offence: corruption, fraud, illegal trafficking in cultural assets, counterfeiting, piracy and the sexual exploitation of children and pornography.
On these issues the project under way covers all the EU Member States.
Â Â  I would like to thank the Commissioner for that.
I think we are on the same wavelength here, and he knows that.
We actually had the same objective.
So thank you for that information, Commissioner.
I would just like to ask when you expect the results to be available.
When will the programme be ready so that we will actually have some harmonised statistical collecting across the EU?
Â Â  .
MadamÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the project currently under way will finish in April 2006, in a few weeksâ time; the next project has already started and will finish during the course of the year.
We can therefore confirm that this year we will have up-to-date statistics, both for the Member States who were members before 2004, and later, by the end of the year, for all the other Member States.
Â Â  . The question concerns interest rate policy and monetary policy.
On behalf of the Commission, I must say that monetary policy â and therefore decisions on interest rate changes â is the sole responsibility of the European Central Bank.
Its independence is enshrined in the Treaty.
It is the European Central Bankâs primary objective to maintain price stability in the euro area by ensuring that medium- to long-term inflation expectations in the euro area remain solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability.
The European Central Bank supports economic growth and job creation in the euro area.
The current level of interest rates across the entire maturity spectrum remains low by historical standards, both in nominal and real terms.
As regards the last part of the question on the economic outlook, in its last interim forecast the Commission expected economic growth in 2006 to accelerate to between 1.9% and 2% in the euro area, which is close to estimates of the areaâs potential growth rate.
However, the Commission is cautious about commenting on the policies of the European Central Bank, as that is the Bankâs sole responsibility.
Â Â  Madam President, Commissioner, the necessary institutional respect and caution does not prevent us from making political assessments of the decisions of the institutions, as in the case of the European Central Bank, whose interest rate rise, at a time of low economic growth and lack of job creation in the European Union, is rather worrying for millions of Spaniards, millions of European citizens, millions of small businesses throughout Europe and millions of families with mortgages.
That is why I said, Commissioner, that I would urge the Commission also to make a respectful political proposal to the European Central Bank.
Â Â  . The political message is that the European Central Bank is a very independent body, as determined in the Treaty.
As an economist and former Central Bank leader, I can elaborate on this subject.
I can only say that Europeâs monetary policy objectives are based on the fight against inflation, which has great social importance, and in this context the adjustment of monetary policy is quite a sophisticated mechanism.
All borrowers want an interest rate which is as low as possible.
These rates are very low at the moment in Europe and they do not harm economic growth.
I can only speak as an economist.
The position of the Commission is that interest rate policy remains in the hands of the European Central Bank.
Â Â  â MadamÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, of course, interest-rate policy also has a decisive influence on public debt.
What are the Commissionerâs views on interest-rate policy in relation to the Stability and Growth Pact?
Â Â  . Throughout history governments and central banks have adopted different and radical measures.
For instance, in the United States interest rates were raised suddenly to 17% and the additional money supply was then really pressured down.
But, at this stage, the change of interest rate is quite modest in the Central Bank.
It is in accordance with the forecasts, economic considerations and outlooks.
We do not intervene in those policies.
Â Â  Commissioner, three states â Slovenia, Lithuania and Estonia â are going to join the eurozone next year.
If those three small economies succeed in joining, what impact will that event have on interest rates and inflation in Europe?
Are there signs of any change?
Â Â  . As to changes if these countries join the euro, you all know the situation and that the criteria adopted in the Maastricht Treaty are very strict.
I can only discuss this issue as an economist.
As a citizen of one of these countries, of course I support enlargement of the euro area, and countries with proper financial policies will definitely strengthen the euro area.
It would also mean enlargement for the euro and its influence in the world.
These countries have a stable budget policy so they will increase the credibility of the euro.
Â Â  . The question concerns simplification and a more user-friendly space for educational mobility and programmes connected with youth, culture and citizenship.
As you know, the proposal on education and the new generation of programmes in the field of lifelong learning, youth and culture were adopted in 2004 for the period 2007-2013.
We are preparing for this, the programmes are still not fully adopted, but they will replace existing programmes and will also contribute to clearer and simpler conditions for users.
The new programmes, once fully established, will enable individuals to benefit more from a true common European area of mobility.
Hopefully, appropriate funding will be available.
These programmes will allow institutions in the fields of education, training and culture to improve the way they operate together.
In this context, the simplification of administrative and financial procedures is a key issue.
Successive evaluations and large-scale public consultation exercises have demonstrated that the current programmes would indeed benefit from simplification.
That, however, requires efforts at different stages, at the level of the administrative arrangements for the programmes themselves and at the level of the Financial Regulation and its implementing rules.
At programme level, it is proposed to reduce the number of programmes in the area of education and training by putting Erasmus, Leonardo da Vinci, Comenius and Grundtvig under the same umbrella: an integrated lifelong learning programme.
The design of the new programmes â especially in the youth, culture and citizenship area â is intended to simplify access for the potential beneficiaries.
For example, in the new Culture 2007 programme we have created a more open and accessible programme in terms of its very structure, with three main objectives compared to the former eight.
It is thus easier to grasp its essence, specifically because it takes a non-sectoral approach, where any player can feel welcome, and is explicitly aimed at the diversity of beneficiaries.
Furthermore, the Commission aims to simplify the application and the reporting systems involved and, of course, to accelerate the selection procedure.
We have included provisions to that effect in the draft decision.
During the ongoing codecision procedure for adoption of the programme decisions, both Parliament and the Council have supported the Commissionâs aim to achieve maximum simplification, not only in the form of the programme actions but also in their administrative and financial requirements, and to find the right balance between flexibility and ease of use on the one hand and clarity of purpose and appropriate financial and procedural safeguards on the other hand.
As regards the Financial Regulation, the Commission has proposed a series of amendments which are currently under examination by Parliament.
These amendments will, inter alia, introduce the principle of proportionality, which means that the administrative and accounting requirements should be proportional to the size of the grant.
As to the implementing rules, progress has already been made because in July 2005 the Commission amended the detailed rules for the implementation of Financial Regulation No 1, which led, among others, to the following improvements in terms of simplified procedures.
Firstly, the requirement for external audit in support of payments is now obligatory only for intermediate payments or payments for the balance where the grant exceeds EUR 750Â 000 for actions and EUR 100Â 000 for operating grants.
The second amendment is that the limit on flat-rate amounts has been increased from EUR 5000 to EUR 10Â 000.
In addition, several flat-rate amounts are now possible in one grant and the Commission can authorise the use of flat-rate amounts even if they are not specified in the basic act.
Â Â  â Thank you very much, Commissioner, for your full and informative reply.
I am delighted about the simplification measures you presented.
However, should we perhaps understand that simplification also applies to the financing of these programmes?
Citizens fear that these programmes will not be financed as lavishly as in the past.
Are these fears justified?
Â Â  . Thank you very much for the additional question.
I listened with great interest, if only via a broadcast, to the speech of the President of the Federal Republic of Germany, as he talked enthusiastically about education, young people and the ERASMUS programme.
I think this is the proper attitude for a Head of State and European citizen who believes that through education and mobility we can achieve much more in the economic, social, cultural and political fields.
I therefore strongly believe that the new programmes for voluntary groups and young people in the field of education, as well as culture, should be enhanced in quantitative and qualitative terms, as they are of such importance both to individuals and to the Community as a whole.
The situation is now chiefly in the hands of the partners discussing the financial perspective, but I believe that we are passing a very timely message to the country holding the presidency, to Parliament, to the Commission and to the entire enlarged European Union.
IÂ am particularly grateful for the ongoing support of this House in respect of EU educational programmes.
This is much needed .
Â Â  Madam President, we are currently talking about integration and a sense of belonging to Europe, and a few minutes ago we were talking about racism and xenophobia.
I believe that there are common elements in all of this.
A few months ago I visited Canada, and there I saw a very complete programme of integration of immigrants and their families.
I would like to ask the Commission whether it intends to create any programme for integrating young immigrants, so that we too may reduce racism and xenophobia, since these new European citizens also have a sense of belonging to our community.
Â Â  . I am sure that using education as a tool against racism and xenophobia for social inclusion and for integration is also a very acutely perceived and common task.
An integrated, free, democratic Europe can be based only on integrated, free, democratic societies.
Member States, their governments, public authorities in the broader sense and European institutions are thus invited to support such tools.
Some of the programmes are already being used to that end.
The European Youth Pact, adopted last year, is one of the special tools for integration and provides some answers for the youth of Europe, young people who have many difficulties or are in vulnerable situations in individual countries.
Social inclusion is one of the most important parts of social policy.
I do not want to speak on behalf of my colleagues, but these issues are taken into account and promoted via different programmes which we have in our remit.
More can be done on the basis of coherent policies at European and national levels.
This is an ongoing issue, to be dealt with not only via education but also via sport, culture and intercultural dialogue.
These are very useful and efficient tools for promoting social inclusion and integration and for combating problems such as violence, hooliganism, racism and xenophobia.
Â Â  â MadamÂ President, like all his colleagues, the Commissioner speaks of simplification, and these complicated European procedures are a major point of contention.
Could he perhaps give me a couple of specific examples of what is being newly simplified and what is now going to improve?
Secondly, are records being kept of the effective costs of managing the programmes and of the amount of funds from these programmes that will directly benefit the European public in future?
Â Â  . I mentioned Erasmus because the German President used that example.
I believe he was right to mention it because it is probably the most famous and popular programme.
There have been 1.4 million Erasmus alumni since 1987.
They are very influential programmes for individuals and societies.
People get a lot from those programmes.
They are asked for more and more.
I have expressed gratitude for the support in Parliament for these programmes because they have impact.
The future of Europe without those programmes would be more in question.
The programmes have an impact on other areas: Erasmus was the driving force for the Bologna Process, which is very influential for any student, any professor and any university in Europe.
I mentioned some of the proposals that are already in the implementation rules adopted by the Commission.
The Commission has proposed more than 100 amendments to the Financial Regulation.
It is now your turn to decide, and to improve it.
As of January 2006, we have established a new executive agency that deals with all individual cases and individual projects and works closely with national agencies.
This centralised system for the operation of our programmes is a reasonable tool.
National agencies operate in Member States in concrete national languages.
They are much closer to citizens, which helps to provide the best service for the users of the programme.
Perhaps we can go into more detail in future, when we discuss the Financial Regulation itself.
There are some concrete measures and proposals on how to simplify life for the user of small grants, in contrast to the millions used for infrastructure or research projects.
We also want to put more money, for example, into Erasmus or lifelong learning programmes because we believe the EURÂ 125 per head, per month, is not very substantial European support when we look into the real costs of daily life in our countries.
So âmoreâ also means more in the social dimension.
This money is often decisive for those who need European grants to study abroad.
Â Â  . Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Action Plan known as the European Agenda for Entrepreneurship was approved in 2004.
Under the Action Plan five strategic policy areas were established for the European Agenda for Entrepreneurship during the current years.
The first of these areas deals with stimulating entrepreneurial thinking among young people.
Recently, on 13Â February, the European Commission adopted, as part of the Action Plan, aÂ communication called Fostering Entrepreneurial Mindsets through Education and Learning. In the communication, the Commission outlined a set of recommendations for the Member States, since the European Union does not have any formal power or competence in this area.
The idea is to strengthen the role of education in shaping an enhanced entrepreneurial culture in Europe and European companies.
Education should stimulate the entrepreneurial spirit in young people and open up new possibilities for their future, along with the means for developing basic entrepreneurial skills.
One of the objectives of the communication is to improve the way that young people are being prepared for their future lives, future occupations and jobs.
The Commission believes that the benefits of entrepreneurship and education in the field of entrepreneurship should not be measured merely by the number of new companies or innovative enterprises and new jobs.
Entrepreneurship is first and foremost aÂ key competence for all, as it helps young people to be more creative and enterprising, to have more self-confidence, and to work and take decisions in a more socially-responsible manner regardless of the activity in which they may be engaged.
Viewed in this light and against the broader scope of competences being advanced under the 2010 Education and Professional Training Programme, entrepreneurship is one of the elements in the reference framework of eight key and basic competences for lifelong education.
We consider these key competences to be crucial for self-fulfilment, social inclusion, active citizenship and employability.
They also include aÂ civic, cultural and educational dimension.
According to the communication, the Commission considers the fostering of entrepreneurial mindsets through education and professional training to be fully consistent and compatible with the aims we have set ourselves and with those formulated by MEPs, including even the author of this question, MrsÂ Maria Badia iÂ Cutchet, within the context of improving general education in all areas and ensuring that in the future European citizens shall remain free and independent, with better conditions for development.
Â Â  Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to thank you for your words, which have definitely reassured me a little, because, having read this Communication, I am rather concerned that we might be going too far in subjecting education to the exigencies of competition and the market.
I am currently coming into contact with many students and I am convinced that some of them intend to be entrepreneurs in the future, but many others may have completely different interests: cultural or humanitarian interests.
Â Â  . I am sure that we are not all business people, nor will all our children be business people, but it is important that we understand how businesses operates.
We believe â and when I say âweâ, I also mean Member States, because there is strong consensus on the set of key competences, which include entrepreneurial initiative â that it is about an ability to understand the complexity, an ability to take initiatives, to turn initiative into action and take up personal responsibility.
This is also good for employees, not only for employers: employees who are active and creative are good employees for any serious company.
That is why we believe that such ability is very helpful for the whole of society and individuals and that it is not just about propagation and production of businesses and business people.
It is about a mentality which should also be more mature in a changing environment, in an environment which requires a deeper understanding of influences and dynamism.
Â Â  â Commissioner, in principle, it is good that the Commission is taking initiatives in the field of entrepreneurship, such as the CIP, and also here.
After all, jobs only arise where something is being offered for sale.
Does the Commissioner envisage any prospect of these initiatives being presented to a rather wider public, including as part of the Commissionâs public-relations activities together with CommissionerÂ WallstrÃ¶m?
Â Â  . This should be part of a communication or promotion by colleagues in the Commission and this House alike, because Europe tends to compare its potential with that of many other partners.
I think we have the potential, but most blockages or obstacles stem either from our rules, that is to say, how we organise our economies or societies, or from our mentality.
That is why I fully support MrÂ RÃŒbigâs point that this basic concept â the key competences including education for entrepreneurship, education for culture, cultural awareness, citizenship and, of course, languages, mathematics, science, digital literacy and learning to learn â is important for everybody.
Lifelong learning is and must be based on some basic competences, and these include an entrepreneurial ability or mindset.
Therefore, I also would like to invite you and all friends of SMEs, all friends of initiatives taken by our citizens and institutions, to promote the important concept of lifelong learning.
I was not surprised but encouraged during the last Question Time when a colleague spoke of lifelong learning as a right of citizens, a right of an individual vis-Ã -vis the State or its authorities to have access to lifelong learning, not just to basic or secondary education.
To implement such systems, we also need greater mental readiness.
Thank you and let us work together on this.
Â Â  Question 48 was declared to be inadmissible (Annex II(A)(3) of the Rules of Procedure).
For one year, Turkey has issued a one-lira coin (worth EURÂ 0.60) that bears an incredible similarity to the two-euro coin.
For example, the portrait of Kemal AtatÃŒrk displayed on the one-lira coin can easily by mistaken for King Albert II.
Owners of vending machines in the EU have suffered considerable losses on account of the technical similarities between the coins in terms of weight and thickness.
There are also problems concerning sorting machines in banks, not to mention ordinary citizens, who may not even be aware of the risk of confusion.
How does the Commission view this latest move by Turkey?
To what extent is it permitted for a country to issue coins bearing such striking similarities to the euro?
What does the Commission intend to do to protect European citizens?
Â Â  . The question concerns Turkish coins issued from the beginning of 2005, which are quite similar to EU coins.
Of course the Commission shares the concern of the honourable Member of Parliament about this issue.
That sort of thing should not happen.
The right to issue coins is one of the most fundamental sovereign rights of a country.
However, informal consultations are recommended.
There is a network called the Coin Registration Office, established by the International Mint Directors Conference.
Member mints are assumed to have consulted the Coin Registration Office when preparing a new coin, so that similarities can be avoided.
Obviously that was not done properly in this case, so coins have appeared which are similar to euro coins.
That was not the first time such a thing has occurred.
In 2000, in some countries, some coins were very similar to euro coins.
Even in my own country, when I was in charge of that area, we issued coins which were similar to Deutschmarks and we therefore had to change our production.
The Commission is working with the Turkish authorities and they have promised to modify their coins slightly.
The production of coins is very expensive and a large exercise.
However, there is no panic and the risks are very limited.
The vending machines â which are the main issue â can be adjusted.
Our estimation is that there are some old models of vending machines that are more difficult to adjust, but the majority of new ones can be properly adjusted so that they can take the correct coins.
Visibly they are quite different.
If these coins are handled in the retail trade, they can easily be distinguished.
So the risks are limited.
The Commission has also worked with manufacturers of the coin mechanisms to keep them informed that mechanisms must be adjusted to this problem.
We are working with the Turkish authorities to ensure that the new production of coins will be slightly modified so that they will not be so similar to euro coins.
Â Â  â MadamÂ President, Commissioner, I do realise that there are no grounds for panic, as you say.
Nevertheless, I should like to ask you whether it would perhaps be desirable to raise this issue as part of accession negotiations with Turkey, to ensure that such coins are taken out of circulation very quickly.
After all, there is also the temptation for the Turkish parallel societies in Europe â in Germany or Austria, for example â to misuse these coins.
Would it not be possible to speed up the process â even though, as you say, minting coins is very expensive â in order to reduce the harm to Europe and the European economy?
Â Â  . This must be negotiated in all frameworks, including the accession negotiation framework.
There is some kind of gentlemanâs agreement that this sort of thing should not happen.
If it does, then the producers of smaller coins must make some adjustments so that the situation with the use of similar coins can be avoided.
This will be negotiated.
I will have an opportunity to meet the members of the Turkish Government soon, so I will definitely raise the issue within a certain time, because, as I say, the production of coins is a huge and very expensive exercise.
In time we can solve this problem, but until then we will work with the producers of coin mechanisms to avoid possible damage.
Â Â  . Questions 50 and 51 are quite similar but, if necessary, I will answer them separately, although the concept will be the same.
I must begin by saying that the European Schools constitute one of the most complicated issues in my area of responsibility, and there are a lot of problems.
The system is very independent and complicated.
Governance of the system does not fall to the Commission, and in fact the Commission is just one member of the Board of Governors, which consists of 29 members.
The rapid enlargement of the European Union has brought a lot of people to our locations â not only to Brussels â and we have a lot of problems regarding the lack of places needed for children in schools and other facilities.
One solution, which is extremely necessary, would be to open a fourth Brussels school in Laeken in 2009.
Why Laeken?
That decision was taken by the Belgian Government.
Belgium is the host country and makes quite a significant contribution to the school infrastructure.
All the infrastructure is provided by the host country.
I have been in touch with the Belgian Government and ministers.
President Barroso has taken this issue up with the Belgian Government to speed up this process, and 2009 is earlier than originally envisaged.
Now it is a matter of deciding the schoolâs internal arrangements for the language sections: which language sections will be opened and which will be transferred.
First, it is too early to say that anything has been decided.
It is still under discussion and the Commission is only one part, and definitely not the dominant part, of these discussions.
The Board of Governors will take the decisions.
Of course, the Commission tries to provide input based on its experience and knowledge, and to participate in this process and secure the interests of parents of the European institutions as well as to ensure transparency and fair process.
At its meeting on 25 and 26 October, the Board of Governors adopted a list of criteria on how to deal with the language sections.
A working group, the , was established and the Secretary-General of the European School presented a preliminary document to this group.
Again, the Commission is actively participating in this group, but we are only one partner.
Finally, that must take all considerations into account and come up with a proper solution.
Some preliminary solutions â options A and B â were discussed, but it is really too early to say that one solution is preferable to the other.
That group is now discussing intermediate options which adopt the best parts of both solutions, which include one principle â supported by the Commission â that the children currently enrolled in one of the existing schools in any section should not be obliged to move to Laeken.
That is probably a good idea for parents whose children already go to those schools.
It is very difficult to imagine that the definitive solution will satisfy everybody, but we must find a solution which ensures that the pupils will get the best education.
We are working with the Board of Governors and with the Dutch Government, which is presiding over the Board, about the reform of the European schools, because there are a lot of problems, including structural problems, and, obviously, this system must be modified.
This is my conceptual answer and I cannot say today that we have prepared any hidden agendas or solution.
We work with the very seriously and I can assure you that we take these issues very seriously, but it is a very difficult area and a lot of problems have accumulated, and now we have to find final, long-term solutions.
We will work hard with the Belgian Government and the Brussels authorities to find some transitional solutions to solve short-term problems and shortages in all our facilities.
That is the picture today.
Â Â  You are right, of course, Commissioner: Questions Nos 50 and 51 should be taken together, as the subjects are interconnected.
There are also very large numbers of Members who are interested in this subject.
First of all, however, I shall give the floor to the two authors for their supplementary questions.
Â Â  MrÂ Kallas, thank you for your reply.
Since option B clearly seems better than option A from many points of view, I wonder whether you are now able to rule out the idea of the Commission raising a costs issue?
Specifically, can you say that the issue of a slight increase in costs will not lead the Commission to block the option which of the two appears to be by far the better?
Â Â  . Of course, the Commission is footing most of the bill of the European Schools and the problem of cost is also a serious issue.
However, I would not focus primarily on that issue of cost; I would focus mainly on the working system and on providing the best possible education for pupils.
In that regard, option B is not the best one.
With regard to option B, which foresees having almost every section everywhere, there will be much fragmentation, with small groups and small classes, in which case we will be faced with the problem of ensuring good quality teaching and good quality education.
Therefore, option B is not the best one.
Yes, it is also much more expensive, but we in the Commission do not regard the cost issue as the first and most important issue.
The most important issue involves securing the efficient functioning of the system of European Schools, and there are also many problems concerning the future quality of education.
Â Â  â MadamÂ President, the Commissioner speaks of complicated procedures, a complicated situation.
We are all aware of this, but the situation is further complicated if the Commission is not prepared to introduce greater transparency into its decision-making process.
After all, the decisive meeting of the Board of Governors is coming up in mid-April.
Why is the Commission not prepared to simply say, on the basis of its own criteria: this is how far we have come, these are the figures, and this is how far we can go?
If the Commissioner just perpetuates the obscurity, he cannot expect an improvement in satisfaction within the language sections.
Â Â  . Thank you very much, but I do not share the opinion that we are not being transparent in this process.
The whole process has been transparent for all parties and those options have been there.
If you like, the Commission will be taking the greater initiative in preparing those options.
Logically, however, a final consensus must be reached that involves the parentsâ organisations, the schools themselves and the teaching staff.
The Commission is providing its input and is most definitely considering all possible options put forward by other parties.
We are trying to play a part in finding a final solution that is more or less acceptable to everybody.
We have been transparent throughout this process and we are now thinking about some kind of compromise solution, an intermediate option between options A and B. So the process has been transparent and involves very complicated negotiations with all parties.
Here the Commission is one negotiating partner and it also wants to respect the other parties, including the Belgian authorities, who have a substantial input to make.
Â Â  MrÂ Kallas, if option A, to which reference has been made of the two under consideration, namely the option that provides for a transfer of sections, were adopted, would there be a risk that many families would have their children in different schools?
Given that, from the data disseminated within the , it appears that the demographic increases in some sections, such as the Italian section, will be greater over the next few years than that of many other nationalities, is this not a factor that should lead the Commission to choose option B from among the alternatives cited?
Â Â  . The final decision will be taken by the Board of Governors.
You mentioned that the children could end up attending different sites.
I read in the basic concept papers about the criteria for this.
The Commissionâs opinion is that we should endeavour by all means to avoid that kind of thing.
Children of the same family, siblings, must go to the same school.
Option B has some tremendous weaknesses in terms of the future development of education.
We do not share the view that option B is the best one, but intensive work will be done to find solutions that satisfy as many parties and parents as possible.
Â Â  MrÂ Kallas, I return to the same issue: criterion F, of those adopted in October, stipulates that if a section exists in more than one school then it must be located in schools on the outskirts and in central schools.
I would like to make it even clearer: if option A put forward by the were chosen, the Italian section would be the only one to be penalised by being located in two schools on the outskirts: Uccle and Laeken.
Do you not consider, MrÂ Kallas, that the aforesaid option A is discriminatory in respect of Italian pupils?
I ask you therefore to make an undertaking on this point, by rejecting option A and adopting option B.
Â Â  . I will not say that we will support option B. I have not said that we will support option A either.
We are trying to find a compromise solution. If you want me to say that I will give all appropriations to option B, I cannot.
I must reiterate that the decision-makers are the Board of Governors, along with the working party â the â which includes parents and other interested parties.
That is the process.
With this kind of complicated question I always try to find some kind of compromise solution.
That is probably also the case in this complicated area.
The next meeting of the Board of Governors will take place at the end of April.
All possible solutions and aspects will be discussed.
Your question about the Italian section has been raised many times and others are also involved.
We have tried to find a balanced solution and not to penalise anybody.
Â Â  . I am deeply aware of the pending cases of international adoptions of Romanian children and the understandable anxiety surrounding this issue among the families who would like to give these children a new home.
As part of the legislative reforms in preparation for acceding to the Union, and with the support of the European Parliament over the years, Romania recently adopted new legislation on child protection.
According to this legislation, which entered into force on 1 January 2005, international adoption is a last resort, if a suitable in-country solution, ranging from smaller homes to foster care, cannot be found.
Through this law, Romania has aligned itself with the legal provisions of the European Union in this area, as also embodied in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.
The application of these provisions must be seen within the context of former abusive practices relating to international adoptions in Romania.
As to the more precise legal aspects, it should furthermore be noted that there is currently no Community legislation in the field of international adoption.
In fact, Council Regulation (EC) NoÂ 2201/2003, which provides for mutual recognition of judgments on parental responsibility, explicitly excludes adoption from its scope.
This means basically that the in the area of child protection has been implemented in Romania and Bulgaria.
The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child is taken as a foundation in both Romania and Bulgaria.
The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child does not distinguish between the internal and external borders of the European Union.
Â Â  This question is not the only one on the subject; there are also Questions Nos 55 and 56.
If the honourable Members are in agreement, we can take these questions together.
First of all, however, I should like to give the floor to the author of the question, MrÂ MedinaÂ Ortega, for a supplementary question.
Â Â  Madam President, I believe that the adaptation of Bulgarian and Romanian legislation to European rules represents progress, because, when it comes to adoptions, the most important thing is the protection of the child.
Unfortunately, however, we know that in these countries, as in others, there are children who are not living in comfortable family situations, and we have families here in the European Union who would be prepared to take on a parental role with every kind of guarantee.
I know that there is no European legislation on this issue, but there is the possibility of the European Union mediating, in some way, with the Bulgarian and Romanian authorities in order to guarantee that European Union families who are prepared to take this kind of action do so under the best possible conditions and in order thereby to facilitate adoption by European Union families, when necessary.
I would like to know whether you believe that there is any possibility of action on the part of the Commission in this area.
Â Â  . We are working together with the Romanian Government in a very consistent manner.
We recognise that it has revised its legislation and that, on the basis of that legislation, an expert group is reviewing the pending cases.
That expert group should finalise its work in the course of this month.
We are in regular contact with the Romanian authorities on this issue.
Our view is that as long as they respect the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and European legislation, then it is up to the Romanian Government and authorities to look for a solution.
As regards the situation in the childcare sector, it is our understanding, on the basis of the very detailed progress reports, that it has improved on the ground, not least because the European Union has provided substantial support for the restructuring of the childcare sector, accounting for around EURÂ 160 million in the last 15 years.
In overall terms, the screening process of applications for inter-country adoptions registered before the entry into force of the new legislation is expected to be completed this month.
We expect that the Romanian authorities will inform all the applicants individually.
Â Â  MrÂ Rehn, you have already partly answered my question, which deals with the problem of pending adoption cases; on the basis of calls made by the European Parliament in various resolutions, a group of experts has been set up to examine the suspended cases on an individual basis.
I would like to know if there is any news available on the timetable with which the requests are being dealt with and thus if we will have information on the results of the work achieved to date by this group.
Â Â  . We are in regular contact with the Romanian authorities, and as a response to the honourable Member I would say that the Romanian authorities are on track concerning the solution of pending petitions for adoption, filed before entry into force of the new law on 1Â January 2005.
The Romanian authorities have established a working party which should finalise its work on 31Â March, and the Commission is committed to a close follow-up on this issue.
We will report to the Council and Parliament on this issue in our comprehensive monitoring report which will be adopted, as scheduled, on 16Â May.
Concerning the other elements of your question, the 82Â 000 children currently under social protection, residential care, foster care or placement in enlarged families are benefiting from a child protection structure in line with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, and this is also the case for access to health care and education.
Â Â  .
I have partly responded to this question, so I will cover only those parts which have not yet been covered.
First of all, in addition to a general evaluation of child protection and the situation of the disabled and mental healthcare system in Romania, we have organised a peer review on mental health in order to assess the situation on the ground.
The expert report resulting from this peer review is awaited.
We are conducting a total of 15 expert reviews, or peer reviews, both in Bulgaria and Romania, on a number of critical issues, and this is one of the essential areas in which we are conducting this peer review, which is done by both Commission officials and the best Member State experts in this field.
Concerning care for disabled people, the main focus is now on developing an inclusive strategy that aims at closing and restructuring large residential institutions by developing alternative community-based services, support for families and smaller residential units.
We provide, for instance, up to EURÂ 15 million.
Moreover, a public awareness campaign is ongoing in Romania in order to raise awareness on rights of people with disabilities.
Although reform in this sector is still very much in its early stage, from the point of view of the Commission we estimate that the country is now on the right track in this regard.
Finally, the persistent problem of ill treatment in psychiatric hospitals in Romania needs to be addressed immediately.
This was stressed in our comprehensive monitoring report of October, and the significant deficits in living and care conditions in some establishments need to be tackled.
We have strongly advised the Romanian authorities to make mental health a priority area and devote sufficient resources for this purpose.
The Romanian authorities are strongly encouraged to take advantage of the current PHARE assistance and draft a strategy and action plan for the mental health reform.
Of course, the key is implementation.
The feasibility of the practical arrangements made should be demonstrated, for instance through allocating sufficient financial resources.
This is what the peer review will look at and this will be part of the progress report in May 2006.
Â Â  â Commissioner, could you address the issue of caged beds in Romania?
When we talk about issues of concern, it is a valid question that you might take up.
We have huge concerns about that.
In terms of the peer review, which I welcome, will it involve going in without notifying institutions of visits?
I believe that is crucial.
Have you any estimate â at Commission level â of how long it will take Romania to tackle what is a huge problem for the country?
Are you convinced that should Romania accede next year, it will continue on that path towards reform?
I believe that it is only by pressure that we will make progress.
I should like to ask, when we talk about children who are abandoned in maternity hospitals and the issue of inter-country adoption, that we put the child at the centre of this issue, rather than any other concerns.
Â Â  . I am ready to provide further details of the peer review if needed.
They normally carry out both previously agreed and on-the-spot missions with visits to different kinds of establishments in different fields, ranging from the rule of law â i.e. the court system and prosecutorsâ offices â to the field of childcare and mental health.
They carry out the same kind of actions.
How long does it take in this field?
That is a very relative concept.
Our concern is that there has to be a credible track record which shows that Romania is genuinely on the right track.
This will be the focus of our peer review.
You touched on the crux of this whole issue: childcare must be at the centre of our evaluation and this is what we are aiming to do when we conduct and present the results of the peer review.
In this context we have also studied the suspicion about the use of caged beds in Romania.
I can assure you that during the Commissionâs 15 years of follow-up we have never had any suspicion proven about the use of caged beds in Romania.
The Commission will follow the issue up within the framework of our regular contacts with various non-governmental organisations.
Â Â  â Madam President, I should like to thank the Commissioner and to say that we all agree that we need to help Romania improve the conditions and protection of children and to improve healthcare.
I should like to ask the Commissioner if the Commission can channel more Community resources within the framework of 'twinning projects' in order to improve healthcare, protect children and improve conditions in mental hospitals.
I should also like to ask if the European Commission can cooperate with the World Health Organisation and with other international organisations in the health sector to improve the situation in Romania.
Â Â  . We have twinning structures with Romania in a number of fields relating to the reform public administration in Romania.
We have found that for Eastern and Central Europe â the so-called new Member States, as well as the future Member State of Romania â twinning has been one of the most effective arrangements for disseminating knowledge.
Yes, we intend to consider twinning also in this field more and more in the future.
It is a very useful practice and the Phare framework programme provides for it.
We have to study it more carefully to see what practical arrangements can be made.
Â Â  Commissioner, if you really have not seen the evidence of the caged beds in Romania, I refer you to the front page story of a recent edition of the London and to the well-documented cases published by the Mental Disability Advocacy Centre.
I hope that you will say to Romania, as indeed to the other countries that have engaged in this barbaric practice, that caged beds are inappropriate for children, the confused elderly or for people with mental health problems in any civilised country, and certainly in a Member State of this European Union.
Â Â  . I have already responded on the basis of a very careful assessment by the Commission.
As I said, we have never had any proof about the use of caged beds in Romania but, if you have some concrete evidence in this regard, I am willing to study it and I will ask my civil servants to take another look at it and we can then raise the matter with Romania if need be.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0028/2006) by MrsÂ Bauer, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on social protection and social inclusion (2005/2097(INI)).
Â Â  . Mr President, at midday today, President Horst KÃ¶hler stated that many people fail to understand present-day Europe.
If somebody sees the enormous amounts of energy that Europe has been investing in the reformulation of its migration policy, I am convinced that they would find the problem of child poverty in Europe incomprehensible.
While we talk about the lack of highly trained migrants, we register unavoidable and huge losses as a result of child poverty, losses that future generations will rightly call us to account for.
Therefore, it is not a mere coincidence that the report on social protection and social inclusion tabled before you focuses mainly on child poverty, because while 15% of European citizens are at risk of poverty, this figure is 19% in the case of children, and based on 2004 data, in 12 of the 25 member states the risk of child poverty is at least 25% higher than in the adult population.
I would like to emphasise that this is not an emotional or perhaps a legal issue, because the International Convention on the Rights of the Child contains binding clauses in this respect.
Europe is also faced with the problem that in the following decades, as a result of the population growth crisis and the aging of society, it will need fifty million new migrants in order to maintain current employment levels.
Child poverty, the exclusion that accompanies it and the high rate of early school-leaving cast a doubt on the possibility of developing a knowledge-based society without leaving social strata further and further behind.
The Commission is right to treat the issue of child poverty with priority, but on the other hand we find that we do not have accurate data, that there are no comparable data concerning child poverty.
It is obvious that this situation must be rectified urgently.
In my report I would have liked to emphasise that social inclusion represents added value to the Lisbon process.
European social policy requires a new solidarity between generations, because the damage caused to the human resources of the future by child poverty and the related undereducation should not be underestimated.
I could obviously mention many other problems presented in the report, but as time is short I shall only mention one more, namely the displacement of older work force from the labour market.
Although there is an anti-discrimination directive in place in this area, discrimination still exists, but it is more difficult to track.
I am convinced that the Commission chose the right direction when it set clear and traceable objectives for the modernisation of social protection.
And last, but not least, I would like to thank the Secretariat of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs for their excellent cooperation, and to express my thanks for the amendment proposal of my colleagues.
And not least, I would also like to thank them for being here and participating in the debate.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you all very much, especially the rapporteur, MrsÂ Bauer, for her report, and I am delighted that I can report complete agreement between yourselves and the Commission regarding the fact that the Lisbon Strategy is based on the positive combined operation of economic policy, employment policy and social policy.
I appreciate the backing expressed in the report for the Commissionâs initiative aimed at modernising and making more effective the open method of coordination for the areas of social protection and social inclusion.
The question is one of how to contribute more through social policy to the aims of the Lisbon Strategy, while at the same time strengthening the coordination of these policies.
Contributing more through the Lisbon Strategy process of social coordination involves developing active functions of social protection and demonstrating added value on the basis of the jobs and growth created.
From a practical viewpoint, both the new common goals for the open method of coordination and the partial thematic goals just adopted by the Council will be carried across into national strategies.
The new national bodies will first of all present a strategic approach for every Member State regarding the modernisation of their policy in specific areas.
The Member States will then present the three thematic plans: social inclusion, pensions and health care.
The Commission has also adopted a communication that initiates a public consultation on possible targeted measures at a Union level relating to adjustments in minimum wages and the inclusion of persons excluded from the labour market.
The consultation also includes the European Parliament and other organisations, of course, but in view of the theme under discussion it will be extended to public bodies at all levels, as well as to organisations, interest groups and social partners.
Your report also ushers in the possibility of new inter-institutional agreements which would cement the role of Parliament in implementing the open method of coordination.
It is true that the participation of Parliament in work within the context of open coordination remains limited by the fact that there is no overall statutory framework in place.
For my part, I can assure Members that I am backing the efforts of officials in my departments to pursue further dialogue with Parliament.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I greatly welcome the report by Mrs Bauer, which we have debated in the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Equal Opportunity and which we support.
The report presents its aims from the perspective of an equal position for men and women, outlining the needs of women especially in the area of social inclusion.
I would like, however, to discuss not only women but also the ways in which poverty and social exclusion affect children and young people.
Let us not forget how our attitudes to poverty in developed countries have changed compared to the past, in an environment where the display of wealth and prosperity has led to a lower living standard coming to be regarded as something diminishing.
I would go so far as to say that it is viewed as a humiliating and abnormal state, which people can sort out by themselves.
What I mean by this is that the media and advertisers present a picture of overwhelming affluence, and people who do not achieve this suffer from feelings of helplessness.
Success and the material abundance that comes with it are apparently open to all, so that those who do not achieve it are excluded from the advantages that society has to offer.
This exclusion does not relate only to material factors but also to education, health or security in old age, and is passed on from generation to generation.
Children from constrained social environments have difficulty securing access to higher education, travel less and have lower living standards.
Poverty is of course not as drastic here as it is in developing world countries, but even so, in the way that it is concealed through shame and statistically under-reported, it leads to feelings of exclusion from the normal world, and to a sense that something that is normal and everyday is at the same time unattainable.
Why should this be so?
How do we explain to a child that, in contrast to others, they must do without various things?
It is true that social differences have always existed and have determined childrenâs development over their entire lives.
Never, however, has abundance been taken for granted as the norm to such an extent, and the lack of financial means has not excluded people from as many opportunities as it does today.
This is the paradox of developed societies.
A decent standard of living is more widely available than before, but so much the worse for those who, for various reasons, do not achieve it.
I would draw your attention to the fact that this is not a matter merely of material effects, but also of inadequate social protection, above all in the case of children and young people, and this has both moral and personal safety consequences for the future of society, since social injustice leads to tension, which as we see all around us, can explode in the form of violence or can lead to a withdrawal from reality through drugs or escapist entertainment.
I do not undervalue charitable works, but it remains the case that social protection and social inclusion must be incorporated into a system, and people must be entitled to use it.
Charity is a gift and in modern societies that defend the dignity of man it should be a matter of extreme resort, which cannot replace a good social policy that corresponds to the needs of Europe in the 21st century.
Â Â  â Mr President, the first joint report by the European Commission on social protection and social inclusion is already an old text which was written in January 2005 and which needs to be examined together both with the conclusions of the Presidency of the European Council and the interim report on the Lisbon Strategy.
The Bauer report is a carefully constructed text and for that I congratulate its rapporteur.
It is divided methodically and presents all aspects of the urgent need for the central objective of the Lisbon Strategy to continue to be a drastic reduction in poverty and social exclusion by 2010.
The two rounds of the open method of coordination on social integration at the level of the 15 and, since 2004, the 25 Member States have demonstrated that the rationalisation of the open method of coordination needs to be safeguarded in social protection and in social integration.
Certainly, economic growth and increased employment are the means by which higher levels of social cohesion will be achieved, in conjunction with effective systems of education and training.
From this point of view, the Bauer reports reminds us that measures need to be taken which aim to prevent early departure from education and training and help students who graduate with poor qualifications in particular to move into school and the job market.
Particular mention is made of investment in education and lifelong learning, in that participation is stagnant, which is why private initiative is also called on to participate in this.
It is a very strong means of combating poverty and social exclusion.
Attention also needs to be paid to eliminating child poverty and that is why the rapporteur, Mrs Bauer, quite rightly emphasises that the intergenerational inheritance of poverty needs to be addressed by speeding up the Commission's work with a Children's Charter, the objective of which will be to uphold their rights.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to thank Commissioner Å pidla, and Mrs Bauer, for the report and for the initiative regarding social protection and inclusion.
That we have close to 70Â million people living at risk in the European Union is a shameful statistic and is not acceptable.
Poverty is a result of the actions of human beings and it can be resolved by the actions of intelligent human beings.
We know what solves poverty, yet our economic system continues to reproduce misery for tens of millions of people and, as has been pointed out, continues from generation to generation.
We do so because we fail at national level to integrate the various economic, social, cultural and environmental policies that we pursue.
We fail to mainstream the solutions that various boards and reports have identified.
One of the single most important solutions is not, as is often argued, a job; it is actually education: education from pre-school, certainly primary education, and at a minimum through to secondary education.
Employment obviously plays a key role, but it must be remarked that too many of our homeless, and indeed our poor, actually have a job.
It is therefore clear that the job must be a quality job with decent pay and conditions if it is to have an impact on resolving the issue of poverty.
I would argue as well that social protection has to be seen as broader than simply social security.
Our public services should be seen as mechanisms for social protection.
Health services, education services, transport and cultural services not only help to protect those who are at risk of poverty, but also keep tens if not hundreds of millions out of poverty by their very existence.
If they did not exist there would be many more millions of people on the breadline.
I would argue too that the notion that social security is simply a safety net needs to be avoided and that in reforming our social security systems we have to give particular attention to eliminating poverty traps.
Â Â  . Mr President, esteemed Chairman, colleagues, the elimination of poverty and social exclusion is one of the European Unionâs strategic priorities.
The Lisbon Strategyâs interim report was critical of the Member Statesâ actions, or rather inaction.
15% of the population of Europe, or 68 million people, a third of whom are children, live in poverty.
Disparities between the wages of men and women are on average 20% to the disadvantage of women.
Poverty naturally breeds poverty.
Social equilibrium serves the interests of the whole of society.
Personal failure is not the main reason why people fall into poverty.
Social inclusion, taking every policy into consideration, and an end to the wasting of human capital would provide a direct stimulus for the progress that we wish to achieve through the Lisbon Strategy.
This is also emphasised by the report presently under discussion.
Europe must get its house in order once again.
The Scandinavian countries are a good example of this.
These countries have economies that are without doubt within the top ten in the world, and at the same time have the most effective social protection systems.
I would like to emphasise particularly the call made in the report to begin negotiations for the selection of policy areas in which the Open Method of Coordination will be applied.
Europe must consider that if we now have 38 non-working pensioners for every hundred workers, this may double in the coming decade unless a change in employment policy is implemented.
This problem must be dealt with today, however.
Lifelong learning and the raising of employment among older people are crucial objectives.
The legislation of several Member States unfortunately contains provisions that promote age discrimination in the labour market.
Such practices should be eradicated from the European judicial area.
In addition to other risk groups, the greatest danger of exclusion is among over women over 50, and this becomes more severe in retirement.
The fact that the report devotes great attention to this is very welcome.
It calls on Member States to ensure that when their pension is calculated, women are not punished for gaps in their employment history arising from parental or childcare leave.
A part of the report I consider essential is the appeal to all Member States â especially the new ones â to review their solidary pension systems, taking into consideration menâs shorter life expectancy and the great wage differences between the sexes, which are reflected in the size of the pensions earned by widowed pensioners, and often push them below the poverty line.
I would like to thank Mrs Bauer for her expert work, and I hope that the principles set down in this document will soon be implemented in the legislative practice of the Member States.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I should like to thank Mrs Bauer for the work she has done on this excellent report, and the Commission for its initial document.
One of the points that comes through from the report is that there is multiple deprivation often linked to discrimination; that if you look at some of the groups that are particularly affected â women, as we have just heard, people with disabilities, those from black and minority ethnic groups and those both older and younger â you can see why the Article 13 directives on anti-discrimination are so important and why they need to be implemented as fully as possible.
The concentration on child poverty is welcome.
We know that there are links between poor nutrition, poor housing, a poor environment â the poor often live in the worst environments â and poor educational prospects, which then follow through peopleâs lives and indeed those of their children.
I welcome the call for a Green Paper on child poverty.
We need to look at that in the context of social cohesion overall, because it has implications for the gap between rich and poor.
Mr De Rossa mentioned the difficulties about education and employment.
The real cause of poverty is not having enough cash.
You cannot simply rely on a trickle down from growth in the economy.
You have to take specific action to address those at the bottom.
Take the example of the UK, which comes out quite high in terms of risk of poverty.
Despite the number of efforts made by our government at the moment, you see that the share of the poorest 10% in the populationâs net income is 2.8%, while that of the richest 10% is 28%: ten times as much.
You can see it in my own region, inner London, the richest area in the European Union, which also has tremendous levels of poverty.
We need to change those percentages and increase that of those at the bottom.
I agree about the importance of public services and the role that social security has to play within this.
Member States should be looking at whether their social security systems operate to allow people to go through training and to take up educational possibilities, or whether they in fact constrict them because these people have to be ready for work at any moment.
I would also echo the comments made about the open method of coordination and the role that the European Parliament should be playing in this, not least in reviewing the national action plans and their outcomes.
Â Â  . â Mention has already been made in this debate of the high levels of poverty and social exclusion, which affects over 70Â million people in the EU.
As the report says, in 14 of the 17 Member States for which figures are available, child poverty increased in the 1990s.
The current trend is for the situation to worsen, with higher levels of unemployment, increased precarious and poorly-paid work, flexibility, the privatisation of core sectors and services.
Given that poverty is a violation of human rights, greater attention must be paid to its causes.
Accordingly, the necessary measures must be taken to promote social inclusion, as viewed from a multidisciplinary perspective.
Hence the proposals that we tabled, aimed at changing macroeconomic policies and at moving social inclusion, employment with rights, public health, education, and access to justice, culture and decent housing to the top of the political agenda.
We therefore advocate replacing the Stability and Growth Pact with a genuine development and progress pact, and the Lisbon Strategy with a proper economic and social cohesion strategy.
In turn, we believe that the accent should not be placed on the proposal for a directive on the creation of the internal market for services.
Experience has taught us that the open coordination method provided for in the Lisbon Strategy has not reduced poverty.
As a result of the Lisbon Strategy, the priorities have been liberalisation and privatisation of public sectors and services, which have served to exacerbate poverty and hinder social inclusion.
Given that these measures were mandatory, the open coordination method did not force any Member State to reduce poverty, and that is the difference with this hypocritical process.
Public policies are crucial to reducing poverty and to guaranteeing human rights, hence the need for, on the one hand, a universal public social security policy that is marked by solidarity, and, on the other, for the privatisation of health systems to be rejected, as we have proposed.
Similarly, the State has a vital role in guaranteeing high-quality public education and labour rights that do not infringe the dignity of the workers.
Consequently, we insist that it is not enough simply to regret poverty.
The neoliberal policies at the root of the increased number of people at risk of falling into poverty must be reversed.
This is the challenge that we put to the Chamber, in the hope that this will not be simply yet another toothless debate.
Â Â  . In paragraph 37 of Parliamentâs report, which taken as a whole is to be welcomed, we read the conclusion that the rapid change arising from globalisation and the wide use of information and communication technologies increases peopleâs vulnerability to social risk.
Globalisation and information and communication technologies are assessed as risks.
In my view, it is a society in which the rapid change arising from globalisation is not accompanied by the wide use of information and communication technologies that is under threat.
Threats arise when the benefits of change are regarded as risks.
The wide use of information and communication technologies increases peopleâs educational and training opportunities, and also their opportunities to join the employment market, especially for the most socially vulnerable groups such as the disabled.
With the help of e-government, social groups or individuals can be directly involved in social dialogue with national government.
For this reason, too, in social policy we ought to emphasise those measures that help people to make use of these opportunities.
Welfare society and information society development policies ought to be coordinated.
Let us leave fears about the rapid spread of information technology to the dictators of North Korea and Belarus.
Â Â  Â MrÂ President, it is regrettable that according to the latest statistics, the increase in the number of billionaires in the world has not been mirrored by an increase in the wealth of all citizens.
The opposite is the case.
The number of people living in poverty is constantly increasing in the countries of both the old and the new Union.
Clearly, poverty, lack of social protection and the necessary social inclusion are problems experienced more acutely in the new Member States.
In Poland, for example, we have a paradoxical situation.
A former Socialist state is now providing less protection for its citizens than states that have always been capitalist.
To the social problems of the countries of the old Fifteen we add our own specific ones, such as high unemployment amongst well-educated young people or the lack of access to general medical care.
Commissioner, the Union is often criticised for a surfeit of regulations, but it seems to me that it lacks a particularly important one.
The Union should oblige Member States to set a social minimum.
This would enable all citizens to feel safe.
In addition, it would promote social inclusion by lowering the level of fear about survival.
Â Â  Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I feel that todayâs debate on the subject of social protection and social inclusion is highly pertinent, since although there was a 3% decline in the level of relative poverty in the years 1995â2000, the level of 15% is undoubtedly alarming.
I fear that, in view of the numbers and the current situation, it will not be possible to eliminate poverty and the social exclusion it produces by 2010.
These phenomena are the result of structural changes that accompany the social and economic development of our society.
There are changes on the labour market, technological changes in society, demographic changes, ethnic diversity, changes in the make-up of households and the redefinition of the roles of men and women.
Assistance must therefore be aimed primarily at the groups most under threat, the unemployed, single-parent families, the elderly, those living alone, families with a number of dependents, ethnic minorities and disabled people.
The fact that poverty often has an impact on children too is in my view extremely sad and alarming.
Of all the key political priorities for solving issues of poverty and social exclusion, I would emphasise education.
The issue is to ensure the right level of education, a smooth transition from educational institutions to the workplace and the integration of disadvantaged groups into the education system through the use of e-learning.
Education is not just school, it is a targeted system of lifelong learning.
The fulfilment of these and other priorities requires financial resources, however.
The new Member States in particular are not able to make sufficient use of the financial instrument for this area, which is the European Social Fund.
I therefore call on the new Member States, especially the Czech Republic, to do as much as they can to ease the bureaucratic burden on applicants in respect of the recently drafted programme documents for the period 2007â2013.
I would like to conclude by thanking Mrs Bauer for a fine report.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, pension policy, poverty reduction, and health and long-term care are key tasks for us and key issues for all citizens of the EU.
Parliament must therefore considerably increase its involvement in open coordination in all aspects of social protection and social inclusion.
The current procedure is totally unacceptable.
The state of affairs we are discussing today is already outdated.
The Council has already discussed the Commissionâs follow-up communication.
For this reason, an interinstitutional agreement is urgently needed.
The Commissioner has said today that he is committed to a dialogue with Parliament.
I am most obliged to him for this, but we do not want just a relaxed dialogue; what we really want is the conclusion of an interinstitutional agreement laying down crystal-clear rules.
Furthermore, in future, the issues of the reconciliation of professional and family life should increasingly be dealt with, and particular attention paid to childcare, within the framework of the open method of coordination in the field of social protection.
Â Â  MrÂ President, increasing globalisation leads to restructuring of both enterprises and the labour market.
Another consequence of globalisation is the emphasis on the international level, not just the local and national.
There is a growing tendency for large enterprises to force small and medium-sized ones off the market, with a significant impact on the livelihood of the local communities.
The nature of restructuring varies from region to region.
In the old Member States it raises concerns about job losses, and in the new Member States the concerns are about stopping production and wholesale redundancies.
In the new Member States the labour market has been hard hit by the development of hypermarkets and supermarkets, especially those built in town centres and on large housing estates.
These large shopping centres have wrecked the livelihoods of small traders and service providers in the immediate area, many of whom have been forced to close down.
For every job created in a hypermarket, five to eight are lost in the surrounding area.
Investors often fail to take the human factor into account, or the individualâs natural environment and historic legacy.
MrsÂ Bauer was very right to identify this issue in her report.
To sum up, the primary victims of restructured workplaces are their workers and suppliers, including agricultural producers.
Help and support must be provided to these groups of people.
They should be offered the opportunity to find new jobs, new professions or new markets for their products.
Â Â  I believe that the most socially committed country is one that creates the conditions for high-quality jobs and ensures equal opportunities for its people.
And high-quality jobs can be ensured through investment in human capital, lifelong learning, the encouragement of flexibility in the labour market and through legislation that favours the economy.
Citizens need favourable external circumstances in order to do their work and be creative, as well as to satisfy their basic needs.
It is a different story, however, for at-risk groups such as the elderly or young people without working experience, the sick, disabled persons and single mothers or families with several children.
All these groups need our attention and help if they are to be socially protected and not excluded from society.
However, I cannot understand the Councilâs decision, in the negotiations on the Financial Perspective, to reduce the funds earmarked for education and grants for young people, an area where relatively modest funds can be used to make a significant impact in education, the study of foreign languages, the development of international links and attitudes towards the European Union.
We are striving for these values in almost all of our documents.
While we continue in the European Union to adopt concrete measures that are specifically at odds with our words and our understanding, we cannot arrive more rapidly at the goals we have set.
Perhaps never before in human history time has passed by as quickly as it passes today, and there is nothing to indicate that this tempo will slow down.
For this reason we also need rapid and simple solutions in adapting to these changes, in order to achieve greater economic growth and better social protection for at-risk groups in the population.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, as a Social Democrat I believe that work is the only source of wealth, and yet labour is losing its position to machines â in other words, capital â as a factor in production.
Many pensioners in the old Member States enjoy a comfortable retirement, because the governments of these countries have legislated so that the workers are required to support them at a certain level, while many people who make do with a low wage when they are working in the benefit of society are in danger of falling below the poverty line once they reach retirement.
In all too many of the Member States, pension systems are basically pyramid systems.
I would like to draw attention to the fact that the last to join the system â the young â will no longer be able to find the people who are supposed to support them later with their wages.
Their work, wages and financial liabilities do not make it possible to have children or save money.
I commend Mrs Bauerâs report, but pension problems cannot be solved with a single report.
We can, however, take steps today to secure the future.
Both state and private sector pension schemes must contain tangible money, and not be based on promises alone.
Estoniaâs transition to a funded pension system has been successful.
Europeâs competitiveness and sustainability would benefit greatly if the old Member States were able to replicate that success.
I hope that our parliament will soon return to the topic of pension schemes.
Â Â  â Mr President, The real challenge for the European Union is to provide an opportunity for breaking out of the vicious circle of social exclusion.
It is unacceptable that 15% of European citizens, approximately 68 million people, live with the awareness of the risk of poverty, as described in the European Commission report released on 27Â January, 2005.
It is unacceptable that social exclusion affects the most vulnerable social groups, women and ethnic minorities.
These are the groups that suffer disadvantages in obtaining and maintaining a job, the wages received, welfare, healthcare, education and access to cultural assets.
The report states that in Hungary the percentage of those threatened by poverty is lower than the European Union average, that it is under 10%, similar to the figures in the Czech Republic, Sweden, Denmark and Slovenia.
However, in the Republic of Ireland, Slovakia, Greece and Portugal this figure is 20%.
Commissioner Vladimir Spidla emphasised in his speech that during their lifetime, women spend four times more time caring for others than men.
When we acknowledge the social value of this fact, we will be providing a real opportunity for bridging the gap.
The poor and the vulnerable groups of society can only break out of the vicious circle of social exclusion if we create work opportunities for them, if we ensure a market-oriented training for them.
Finding work means having an income, which facilitates social integration and improves the financial situation of the individual.
This is the real challenge, let us meet it!
I propose that the report be accepted.
Â Â  â I would like to thank Mrs Bauer for her skilfully prepared report.
However, it would be better if we could see a system, showing which priorities need our attention first.
In my opinion, the most important priority is the child, as he/she is the beginning, and an adult is only the consequence of the upbringing of that child.
If children do not attend school, they will not have jobs to go to.
If children are constantly hungry, they will begin to beg and even steal.
If children experience violence or are sexually abused, once grown up, they will become violent themselves.
If children have no parents or are separated from them, then the street will be their home.
All the cases mentioned are a splendid pretext for the criminal world to give refuge to such children and to bring them up to be offenders.
Such children will not enter the job market, as they can only do those things which are unsuitable for the job market.
Therefore, the basic priority ought to be the eradication of the causes which make children unsuitable for the job market.
If we fail to eradicate the causes, then the other measures named in the report will only be a battle with the consequences.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the high standard of this debate and of the proposals submitted by Members, and I would like again to confirm my willingness to work alongside you towards fulfilling the aims of the Union and fulfilling the role given to us by the citizens of Europe.
I can assure you that the Commission is contributing determinedly to further raising the profile of the social dimension in the Lisbon Strategy.
I would like to suggest to you some ideas for our work in the future.
We must first raise the profile of European coordination.
We have managed to develop a balanced approach, which places emphasis on the need to combine social aims with financial targets.
This is a great achievement and it is fundamental to reinforcing the faith of citizens in the reforms.
We must enhance the partnership between the Member States and the Union.
The European strategy for growth and employment and the social agenda do not belong to the Commission or to the European bodies.
They are based on the obligation of all participants, Member States, European citizens, parliaments, social partners and interest groups as well as all the institutions and organs of the Community.
Success in this partnership will require a clear separation of roles.
The Member States will implement the intra-state level reforms and the structural policies approved within the framework of the revised Lisbon Strategy.
The Union will continue to support reform efforts and will at the same time make use of all new instruments, assistance from the Structural Funds, respect for fundamental rights, support for social dialogue and the establishment of proven approaches.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0058/2006) by MrÂ Grech, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the guidelines for the 2007 budget procedure â Sections II, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII(A) and VIII(B) and on the European Parliamentâs preliminary draft estimates (Section I) for the 2007 budget procedure
Section I â European Parliament
Section II â Council
Section IV â Court of Justice
Section V â Court of Auditors
Section VI â European Economic and Social Committee
Section VII â Committee of the Regions
Section VIII(A) â European Ombudsman
Section VIII(B) â European Data Protection Supervisor (2006/2021 (BUD)).
Â Â  . Mr President, the report which I have presented for Parliamentâs consideration and approval outlines the main guidelines for the 2007 budget pertaining to other institutions.
The main part of my report, however, is dedicated to Parliamentâs budget.
The report places major emphasis on the need to consolidate what has been successfully achieved in these last few years.
No major projects are being contemplated for 2007, which should provide us with enough time to carry out an in-depth stocktaking exercise and enable us to examine and evaluate critically and objectively what needs to be done in the coming years.
In a framework of budgetary constraint, we need to implement budgetary rigour in all ongoing activities, ensuring added value for taxpayersâ money.
I wish to stress the importance of the application of activity-based budgeting, which would result in more rational and analytical estimates.
Moreover, appropriations should relate to specific activities.
This would help to avoid cancellation of appropriations at the end of the year.
The institutions have to base their estimates on well-defined needs, avoiding duplication of functions, focusing on core operations and eliminating malpractice and all bottlenecks.
In this respect, the institutions are invited to make better use of their resources, leading to more interinstitutional cooperation, which should be conducive to more efficiency and hopefully more savings.
It is reasonable to assume that some administrative tasks could be shared amongst the institutions, without the latter losing their independence.
This could create economies of scale and increase the effectiveness of services.
Another key issue in the report relates to information policy, which addresses Parliamentâs objective of bringing Europe and its institutions closer to its citizens.
In order to improve the perception that the citizens have of the Union, the implementation of an effective, strong information strategy is crucial.
Having said that, however, I still contend that in any information project particular attention should be given to the extent of participation and cooperation of political groups, the pluralism of opinion, the value of its contents and its cost structure.
In the final analysis, the level of success of any project will have to be measured in terms of its positive impact on EU citizens.
In terms of staffing, keeping in mind the exceptionally strong recruitment exercise which took place in the last three years and the Streamline software system, which should be in place by the end of the year, it would be justified to assume that with the exception of enlargement and an extremely limited recruitment of specialised staff, no new employment should take place in 2007, which would result in real economies in the future.
In my report I also addressed a number of additional priorities for 2007, relating mainly to buildings policy, enlargement, assistance to Members, a statute for Membersâ assistants, and training.
Regrettably, in view of time constraints, I will be unable to deal with all those topics in any detail.
It is unfortunate that this budgetary procedure starts in a context of uncertainty, due to the absence of a new interinstitutional agreement.
Understandably, we should do our utmost to reach an agreement on the financial perspectives but not at any cost.
We cannot and should not pay lip service to high-flown buzzwords such as âgrowthâ, âemploymentâ, âresearchâ, âsocial solidarityâ and âenlargementâ and at the same time not provide the funds or flexibility to achieve them.
In other words, if we really mean what we say, we should put our money where our mouth is.
Moreover, and under these circumstances, it would be advisable, at least at this stage, to work on the assumption that we will be retaining the self-imposed ceiling of 20% of Category 5 expenditure.
Having said that, however, we know that the self-imposed ceiling is not an irrefutable and fixed law.
In future we should not be hesitant to challenge and review this agreement if we are truly convinced that it makes more financial and budgetary sense to do so.
In conclusion, I trust the various guidelines highlighted in this report, if effectively adopted, will improve the efficiency, quality, performance and transparency of the European institutions, offering more added value to the European citizens and hopefully more added value to the institutionsâ credibility.
Â Â  . Mr President, first I would like to thank the rapporteur, MrÂ Grech, for his excellent proposal and the agreeable levels of cooperation we were able to achieve during discussion of the report.
MrÂ President, Parliamentâs budget has to be dealt with effectively, responsibly and credibly.
This is conditional on several factors.
Firstly, we have to stop talking about an annual 20% increase or ceiling.
We should be talking about and implementing only a budget based on actual needs.
We must always consider our accountability to the taxpayer.
This will cultivate the credibility expected of Parliament.
One important example of this is information policy. We should not embark on ambitious projects, such as our own television channels, but instead we should always ensure that the political groups are actively involved in all of Parliamentâs fields of information.
We must also plan all the information we give out well beforehand in order to determine the costs of projects and the personnel needs involved.
The best example of the provision of information is visitor groups, and now we must really make haste to ensure that the EUR 5 million which was decided on last year is made use of as quickly as possible.
I would furthermore like to mention one amendment connected with Parliamentâs day nursery.
This perhaps does not sound like a very politically important issue, but the issue of how we treat employees with children is very important from the point of view of the status of Parliament as an employer.
This is a question of equality more than anything else, and we cannot punish single parents and women who have children and who wish to work in Parliament.
For this reason, a nursery should be maintained as close to Parliament and public transport services as possible.
The proposal that has just been made to stop using the Eastman Nursery is obviously very alarming, and I hope that agreement can be reached on adopting this amendment.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I too want to thank Mr Grech for his hard work and the excellent report he has produced on the guidelines for the 2007 budget procedure.
I really hope, as the report suggests, that the institutions can submit realistic requests based on budgetary rigour in the light of the current tight financial situation.
Like the rapporteur, I am convinced that in all the institutions we can work more cost-effectively, without compromising standards.
I would urge all those responsible â which means each of us and all members of all the institutions â to keep this in mind and change our working habits accordingly.
I should like to highlight some other aspects of the report that I believe are particularly important.
We have had a reference to the area of information and communication.
I applaud the emphasis on results as opposed simply to spending.
Expensive solutions are not always the most effective.
As the rapporteur suggests, we should not be afraid to discontinue tools or strategies that are not delivering the desired results.
That means regular monitoring and clear and appropriate distribution of responsibilities.
We have had a reference to information tools.
One idea that has been explored is web-TV.
I am firmly in support of that idea.
Very many young people actually get most of their information from the internet.
If it is properly managed and properly handled, it could be a new way of connecting with citizens and pushing forward our objectives.
We need to find better ways, but this needs to be properly handled.
I am very much in favour of the idea of having web-TV and seeing how all the institutions can work together to get our information across to different members of society.
Â Â  . Mr President, Mr Grech has drafted an excellent report on next yearâs guidelines for the Sections of the Budget other than that for the Commission.
My warmest thanks go to him accordingly.
A feature of next yearâs budget is once again the establishment of the new activity-based accounting system in all the institutions.
Just as the rapporteur insists, it is important that all institutions should adopt the same budget nomenclature, in which case Members of Parliament and other interested parties would be better placed to monitor implementation of the budget.
It is important to obtain comparable data on the costs and results of different activities.
A feature of next yearâs budget is the anticipated enlargement.
Romania and Bulgaria are very likely to join the EU next year.
This will result in special requirements which have to be taken into account.
We need to emphasise the importance of organising the linguistic service and the employment of staff.
That way we are assured of a smooth transitional phase.
The rapporteur quite rightly focuses attention on the fact that Parliamentâs budget should remain under the 20% mark for all EU administrative expenditure.
This will be an indication of Parliamentâs administrative discipline.
Mr President, the intention in next yearâs budget is to pay very particular attention to the provision of information.
This in itself is a very good thing.
We must nevertheless insist that the provision of information remains relevant and appropriate.
We cannot afford solutions that are too costly, especially if there is no corresponding benefit to be had.
We need to focus attention on services for visitors and visitor groups.
Although there have been improvements to the current facilities for showing visitors around, they leave a lot to be desired.
There are too few rooms for visitors to assemble in, and there is too much queuing.
It would be good if there could be greater use made of experts from the EU institutions from outside Parliament on Parliamentâs premises so that visitors could be given a more diverse picture of the organisation than they are now.
The real costs of visitor groups should be met more effectively.
More important than increasing the number of visitors is the more comprehensive reimbursement of the travel expenses that current visitors incur.
With regard to further discussion of the budget, we would hope that next yearâs appropriations will be proposed right away in the preliminary draft budget.
All too often there tend to be more and more demands concerning the budget while it is being debated throughout the autumn, which should be regarded as unacceptable.
With these remarks I wish to express my support for the draftsmanâs proposal.
Â Â  . Mr President, I shall speak about the Committee of the Regions and the European Economic and Social Committee.
Both these committees have had their day.
Their value to the EU is disproportionate to the costs entailed in current integration.
The original idea behind the committees was that they would increase the EUâs democratic legitimacy.
However, the European Parliament has now in large measure taken over this role.
What instead remains is a Committee of the Regions whose own freedom from responsibility is called into question by the majority of the Committee on Budgetsâ members.
We have also seen how both unions and employers have conducted successful campaigns outside the Economic and Social Committee.
No one questions the fact that these parties are nowadays well established and can make their voices heard without the help of an EU-funded institution.
We in the EU should instead seek submissions from the parties concerned directly.
In doing so, there would be opportunities not yet taken advantage of for making savings.
What is more, it would be advantageous to obtain responses from organisations and parties that are not necessarily completely dependent on the EU budget.
I therefore believe that the appropriations in the 2007 budget should be substantially limited.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, in a parliamentary democracy, peopleâs representatives can, must, should and may set an example.
If so many of us are now forced to require the people in our countries to make sacrifices, this can only function, in the spirit of democracy, if we, too, make sacrifices.
Reducing Parliamentâs budget from EURÂ 1.2 or 1.3Â billion to under EURÂ 1Â billion is the way to achieve credibility.
To make a couple of suggestions, the many Members who have promised to claim only those travel expenses actually incurred from now on should pay back the surplus.
In 2004, just 37 Members accounted for a ludicrous EURÂ 234Â 000.
We know that EURÂ 26Â million are squandered because of incorrect use of interpreting services.
The many minutes of needless silence here cost further millions, and so it goes on.
EURÂ 100Â million a year have been spent on something or other, and so we look for something to enter it against.
Let us have an end to this.
We would have no problem at all in saving the EURÂ 300Â million; and in so doing we would not only spare ourselves negative headlines in the international press, but also earn ourselves positive ones.
I am saying this as a pro-European.
You will wake up again tomorrow to read something you call scandalous, but no, it is what is happening here that is scandalous.
I am sorry, but Europe cannot progress unless savings are made right here, at the top, at long last.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to refer to what my group believes should be the inspiration behind Parliamentâs budget, that is to say maximising the efficiency of Parliamentâs work while minimising its cost.
When drawing up the European Parliament's budget, we should respond to questions such as these: are we providing the Members with the instruments they require to carry out their duties?
Do the Members of the European Parliament have access to interpretation into all languages, to the rapid translation of documents and correct legal and technical assistance?
Do the Members have a good computer system and sufficient auxiliary staff?
From an external point of view, do the Members receive the correct information?
Do the political groups participate in the drawing up and control of that information?
Do the Members of the European Parliament need new information systems, or do they need to make better use of the existing ones?
The Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has presented specific amendments in response to these questions.
Furthermore, we should think about minimising the cost.
Is it necessary to reach the 20% ceiling?
Would it not be better for this House too to be demonstrating that austerity and saving are basic principles of behaviour?
I hope that 2007 will follow the trend of 2006 and that under no circumstances will we return to generalised spending.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I should like to thank my colleague, MrÂ Grech, for the clarity and rigour of his report, which is both comprehensive and pragmatic.
The paragraphs dedicated to our institution â the only democratically elected representation of the people of the EU, in the words of Mr Grech himself â captured my full attention, particularly those relating to visits to Parliament.
The recent debates on the Constitutional Treaty and the outcome of the referendum in my country, which I personally deplored, highlight the fact that too many of our fellow citizens are unaware of the meaning and importance of the European Union for their everyday lives.
Fears and received ideas often take the place of information.
From my brief experience as a new MEP, I have also learnt that, each time that I have had the opportunity to receive visitors â in Brussels or in Strasbourg â no matter what their age, their origin or their socio-professional background, they have returned home convinced, I hope, of the value of the European Union or, at any rate, better informed about it and still interested in it. Of that I am sure.
One well-known rule of marketing says that a dissatisfied customer tells eleven people and that a satisfied person only tells four people.
So let us increase the number of satisfied citizens, because if they are better informed, they are in a better position to spread the European idea among our nations.
Yet in order to do that, we must act on the Grech report and increase the number of visitors per MEP. I support MrÂ Grechâs request.
Recently, the European Parliamentâs information office for France organised a fascinating European forum in my constituency on the theme âA Dialogue on Europe: bringing the European Union and the citizen closer togetherâ.
Many participants regretted that the number of sponsored visits to Parliament was not higher.
This is a genuine request.
I have one more point to make: as far as welcoming our visitors and organising our work are concerned, our assistants have an invaluable role to play.
They share our lives as elected representatives and freely make their time and brainpower available to us, but wide disparities exist among them, and their social situation is often precarious.
As MrÂ Grech points out in his report, they truly deserve finally to be granted a genuine and meaningful statute.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, for my part, should like to begin by lending my support to the work of our fellow Member, MrÂ Grech, and commending the very high quality of his report.
In the present context, and given the problems that we are encountering in the framework of the negotiations with the Council on the 2007-2013 financial perspective, this report is timely in taking stock of the financial resources that should be implemented in 2007 for the purposes of funding the main institutions of our Union: Parliament, the Council, the Court of Justice and so on.
I wish to lend my support this evening to the requests concerning both the principles of sound management and those designed for the purpose of achieving added value, but I should like us to extend these principles to all of the institutions and also, of course, specifically to the EU agencies.
We must make even greater efforts to optimise our working tools, the management of information tools, the costs related to data transmission and, finally, our human resources policy.
I, for my part, should like to emphasise our communication policy: it must allow our fellow citizens genuine access not only to information, as was explained a short while ago, but also to all the different facets of the Union.
In fact, it must be genuinely possible for EU citizens not only to understand the decisions that we make on their behalf, but also to embrace this magnificent blueprint for a society that we are building not only for, but also â I hope â with, them.
To this end, we must step up our communication efforts and allocate resources in line with the implementation of a communication policy that is modern, effective, educational and, in short, adapted to our times, not least through the use of tools such as Web TV
In the same way, I feel that I must stress the importance of also making greater efforts to host visitors and the press at the various buildings in which the part-sessions are held.
With the prospect of future enlargement, there is no doubt that there is a lack of adequate infrastructure.
I very often find myself receiving delegations in the Parliament buildingâs corridors.
Â Â  Mr President, as a British citizen I strongly oppose the budget settlement that Mr Tony Blair purports to suggest that he negotiated in December.
I prefer to call it âthe great giveawayâ.
Opening your cheque book and asking how much is not my idea of negotiation.
Allowing Britainâs contribution to rise from an average of GBPÂ 3Â billion net to more than GBPÂ 6Â billion per annum from 2007 is totally unacceptable and squanders Mrs Thatcherâs hard-earned rebate.
I therefore voted against acceptance of the budget when it came before this Parliament, but I suspect that my reasons were somewhat different to those of most of the other Members of the institution who also voted against it.
No major political party in my country, except my own, is prepared to campaign honestly and openly on European issues at election time.
It is the famous elephant in the room that everybody avoids talking about.
They are helped by a supine media that is only too willing to participate in what is effectively a cover-up.
Mr Blair and his government may think themselves very clever in avoiding a proper debate on the EU at the last general election.
However, there is a downside.
How can they legitimately claim to have a mandate for giving away all this extra taxpayersâ money, most of which will be used to subsidise projects in eastern European countries, at the expense of under-funding our own domestic infrastructure?
I have looked at the guidelines in this report and most of it is just a glorified wish list full of buzzwords like âEuropean heartâ and âraising the gameâ.
In my view, if the EU really is interested in raising the game, it could start by asking for less money, not more, and it should initiate a major study on the means necessary to return the powers it has taken from democratically elected governments.
Well, that is my wish list.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will be tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the report by Ingeborg GrÃ€Ãle, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC, Euratom) NoÂ 1605/2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities (COM(2005)0181 â C6-0234/2005 â 2005/0090(CNS)) (A6-0057/2006).
Â Â  . Mr President, today I would like to congratulate Parliament on a very important day that finalises our discussions on the Financial Regulation.
It is an important week because Parliamentâs opinion will be put to the vote in this House.
I wish to congratulate both rapporteurs on the job they have done.
I acknowledge the huge job done by them in tabling these amendments.
I would like to confirm that the Commission will include the vast majority of Parliamentâs proposals in its new revised proposal.
I would also like to confirm that the objectives of Parliament and the Commission are more or less the same.
In light of these shared objectives regarding the simplified rules and the reduction of red tape, I am pleased to announce that we will, very soon after Parliamentâs vote, put forward our new revised proposal.
We know that the Council is ready to give us a final decision and final opinion very soon.
I would like to give you a few examples of the many amendments we are very eager to include in our new proposal: an explicit reference to the principle of proportionality â this will help to define a lighter procedure for smaller projects; information for grant applicants and standardised application forms for the same policy areas; and reinforcing the division of procurement contracts into specialist and/or partial lots.
The fourth element that we are positively evaluating is the two-step procedure in the grant application process, which will avoid unnecessary costs in the initial phase.
The Commission and Parliament are not the only two players in the current legislative process.
The European Economic and Social Committee and the Court of Auditors delivered their opinions between October and December 2005.
The Council is about to complete its first reading.
I should like to stress that the legislative process of revision of the Community financial rules has now made substantial progress.
Our common goal is to have new, simpler and more modern financial rules, better adapted to the new generation of spending programmes, hopefully applying from January 2007.
That is why the timing is so important and why we cannot miss our deadlines.
I am committed to working hard in the forthcoming interinstitutional negotiations and encouraging a conciliation process aimed at achieving an effective consensus between Parliament and the Council.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, CommissionerÂ GrybauskaitÄ, ladies and gentlemen, today I am tabling 135Â amendments to the Financial Regulation in this House.
I was delighted at the Commissionerâs announcement today that she intends to incorporate some of the quite fundamental points of this report in the Commissionâs revision.
Parliament is using this initial rolling revision of the text â a text so important to the administration â as a means to eliminate fundamental problems.
We have heard some very fundamental, harsh criticism of the bureaucratic procedures.
Numerous organisations applying for grants, companies participating in supply and service tenders, and indeed those in the Commission and other institutions who apply the Financial Regulation, have contributed to our reform and to Parliamentâs amendments.
I am very much obliged to you all.
Your professional advice will enable the improvement of the procedures.
Those in this House to whom I am particularly obliged include PresidentÂ Borrell and of course my colleagues in the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control, primarily MrÂ Pahor and everyone who has worked on the proposals in the intergroup over a period of months.
It was not only thanks to the constructive cooperation, but also to the general sense of the pressure to reform, that the two committees adopted the report either by a vast majority or unanimously.
My personal assistant, MrÂ Sichel, has accomplished a great deal in this regard; I should also like to thank him most sincerely for this.
In addition, those in the Commission to whom I am obliged include CommissionerÂ GrybauskaitÄ, Director-General MrÂ Romero, and MrÂ Taverne and his staff for the numerous fruitful discussions, which I sincerely hope will continue, and really look forward to.
Everyone â including myself, with my years of experience of dealing with the Financial Regulation â is wondering what kind of Europe this is that requires such complicated, costly application procedures.
Up to one third of the amount of each grant is lost on the cost of the application procedure.
Year after year, organisations throw away substantial sums on participation in European policy tenders, even though they have no prospect of success.
Forty pages of forms and an additional 500Â pages of manuals is not the exception but the rule.
Only 5â25% of applications are successful.
At costs of up to EURÂ 200Â 000 per application, you can imagine the money that is being squandered in Europe every time an organisation participates in an EU tender.
What kind of Europe is it in which companies no longer wish to participate in tenders because they have to submit two annual balance sheets, even for routine applications?
Indeed, the Commission has already worked very intensively on this, and it will continue to work on it and to make changes to the important implementing rules.
I should also like to encourage CommissionerÂ GrybauskaitÄ in this, and would be most obliged to her if she were to take up all of Parliamentâs proposals, as we do not want the Commission to be equated throughout Europe with ponderousness, red tape and money-wasting; we want it to be seen as a service provider for all those wishing to implement and support European policies.
Our most important amendments will be put to a roll-call vote tomorrow.
As CommissionerÂ GrybauskaitÄ has already announced, some are to be incorporated.
I should also like to present a few more.
One concerns a database for the notification of applicants, avoiding the submission of multiple copies of documents and thus saving time and money at the application stage.
We should also like to see Commission decisions rather than voluminous contracts.
This could make procedures less protracted and â particularly in the case of small grants â less burdensome.
Our main point is that, in future, the Commission should assist applicants with the procedures.
This is a cultural revolution, but it will be beneficial all round, particularly to the reputation of the EU.
Our objectives are improvements in predictability, reliability and legal certainty, and, for the purposes of improving flexibility, an amendment has been tabled regarding the limited transferability of commitments, which would otherwise lapse.
I shall be tabling another oral amendment tomorrow, which, whilst refraining from specifying an amount, nevertheless refers to a maximum sum.
The negotiations on this will depend on the Financial Perspective.
I would appeal to the Council not to leave the situation as it stands.
What kind of procedures are they that block outflows of funds whilst Member State organisations are losing so much money?
This Parliament has recognised that we cannot go on as we are doing, especially as the complex bureaucratic procedures are not even particularly successful at achieving the objective of protecting Community funds.
That is the reason for my final request: let us strive for a new version of the Financial Regulation in the medium term.
In the Member States, financial regulations are simple documents for administrations, because they have to be used daily.
The EUâs Financial Regulation must not count as the most complicated the administration could have conceived for its self-management.
This item, too, remains on Parliamentâs agenda.
I should like to thank you all once more for your cooperation, and I hope to be able to count on your support tomorrow.
Â Â  â First, two expressions of thanks; the first is to rapporteur MrsÂ GrÃ€ssle, who has been a great inspiration to all of us who worked with her throughout the preparation of this report. Then also to the Chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control, Mr Fazakas, who under this great pressure of time did everything to see that the two committees enjoyed excellent cooperation in bringing this report before Parliament.
As co-rapporteur and draftsman of the opinion regarding the Financial Regulation, I would stress that the main purpose of the report was to make the Financial Regulation and its rules of implementation less bureaucratic, easier to understand, simpler and, most importantly, more user-friendly.
In this way we might also ensure a more effective use of budget funds.
As the rapporteur has stated, the report devotes special attention to the area of public procurement and donations.
Indeed at a number of meetings we heard, particularly from non-governmental organisations, that they no longer wished to cooperate with the European Union, since the bureaucratic procedures were too long and above all too expensive.
No one, myself included, would wish to change anything in the Regulation in such a way as to render the use of taxpayersâ money less transparent.
In drafting the report, we were attempting to find some kind of new, more successful balance between the effective use of money on the one hand and democratic control over such use on the other hand.
In particular, the committee chaired by Mr Fazakas, the Committee on Budgetary Control, is extremely sensitive with regard to this issue.
That is why the opinions of the Court of Auditors have frequently been of decisive importance for both rapporteurs and especially for the Committee on Budgetary Control, and why they have also been accommodated in this report.
May I close by saying that no one, especially in politics, wants any financial scandals.
And no matter how well written they are, there is of course no set of rules that can entirely prevent them, yet they may facilitate the more or less successful management of budget funds and the more or less general confidence of the public in its legality and effectiveness.
Finally I would make so bold as to claim that this report is headed in the right direction, that the proposed solutions enable a kind of new, successful balance, and I look forward to the report being adopted tomorrow.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteur on her splendid and bold work.
This report sends a clear and strong message to citizens that the European Parliament wants them to have easier access to EU funding.
A lot of importance is given to the debate on the Financial Perspective, which is about how much money will be in the EU budget.
That is fine, but we should not neglect the equally important issue of how that money should be spent and how we can make it easier for citizens to benefit from it.
What is the use of speaking of large sums of EU money when people on the ground are feeling increasingly frustrated about excessive bureaucracy in accessing funding, long and incomprehensible applications and officials who do little or nothing to explain them?
No wonder many people simply give up before even trying.
That is wrong and we should change it.
We should change it by reforming the Financial Regulation and making sure we make things easier and more accessible.
That is what the rapporteur's report does: it introduces several measures to make access to funding easier and, in that sense, it turns virtual EU money that one may get into real EU money that one can actually access.
That is good news for citizens, but it is also good news for NGOs and small businesses.
I therefore call upon the Commission to be our ally in this reform.
Our message is clear: if we truly want to reconnect to the people, we should make things simpler.
Â Â  . â Praise in this case is no mere formality, but an acknowledgement of the rapporteurâs extraordinarily coherent, committed work aimed at achieving two clear objectives, namely the simplification and proportionality of the scope of the rules.
From this perspective, this is an extremely good report, for which we should not be sparing in our praise.
I should like to say at this point that it is vital, in my view, to analyse the next steps in this process of reform of the financial regulation.
We must ensure that, throughout the next financial perspective, we in Parliament continue to exercise the power of codecision, as we did in the past, so that we can accomplish four key tasks in the near future.
The first such task is to update the budgetary guidelines in certain areas, for example the annuality principle and budgetary flexibility mechanisms; secondly, to reduce exceptions to the absolutely essential minimum â in so doing, we would confirm the overriding importance of the financial regulation on sectoral legislation, and put an end to duplications and discrepancies between on the one hand, the basic regulation, on the other, the implementing regulation and, between the two, the sectoral regulations; thirdly, to clarify the duties, powers and responsibilities of the various budgetary actors and ensuring that these duly reflect budgetary accounting standards.
The fourth and last task will be to incorporate the financial regulation and the financial framework agreed upon in the Interinstitutional Agreement and to make them consistent.
These tasks may seem simple, but are in fact complex and require very careful attention.
Â Â  . Mr President, firstly I wish to thank you, rapporteurs Mrs GrÃ€Ãle and Mr Pahor, for the enormous task you have undertaken in preparing this topic.
The amendment to the Financial Regulation has been an immense job of preparation, and one that is very technical and tough-going.
It has taken a lot of time and concentration.
Mrs GrÃ€Ãle has untiringly chaired many meetings of work groups.
The very fact that Parliamentâs opinion is clear to everyone is precisely due to this excellent preparatory work.
My warmest thanks go to them for that.
The Commissionâs proposal aimed to revise the Regulation that had been in force for three years.
The main objective has been to eliminate and simplify bureaucracy and increase flexibility, while at the same wishing to guarantee financial security.
The background to this is the development of a new administrative culture.
In 1999, after the crisis which ended with the Commissionâs resignation, a work group of experts proposed that the administration of the EU be organised in such a way that personal accountability would be clarified and at the same time financial administration simplified, this legislative package included reform of the budget structure to make it activity-based and a revision of the Financial Regulation and the implementation acts relating to it.
Now is the period of interim evaluation.
One could say that the original ambitious objective has been partially achieved.
Currently we are obtaining a clearer picture of the costs and results of the EUâs various policy areas.
There is still a great deal of bureaucracy, however, and there are considerable controls and checks in place.
The Commissionâs proposal to amend the Financial Regulation is along the right lines, I believe, although modest in its aims.
The delegation of power and responsibility still lacks boldness, and activity-based administration is still a long way off.
In our opinion, the rapporteurs adopted just the right approach in endeavouring to relate necessary administration to a manageable sum of money.
At present the procedures are sometimes so complicated and expensive that action does not result in the achievement of the objectives we aspire to, such as cooperation with the private sector.
The report adopted by the committees is, we believe, too cautious.
We would have liked a bolder, more liberal approach.
In our view, Parliament is still involved in âmicroadministrationâ.
The main issue in administration is results, and not the procedures involved in its implementation.
Complicated administrative processes only serve as protection for ineffectual civil servants, freeing them from having to make decisions.
Financial administration must be based on rational decisions and personal accountability.
These comments aside, we are nevertheless prepared to support the report in its entirety, and we await the forthcoming debate on the implementation acts.
Â Â  . Mr President, I too should like to extend warm thanks to Mrs GrÃ€Ãle for her work, for even sacrificing her Christmas break, as I understand, and for the many fruitful meetings we have had together.
Reform of the Financial Regulation really is desperately needed.
The dismissal of the Santer Commission brought about stricter rules and a review of the control mechanisms, something to which my group has always been committed.
We have also had to conclude, though, that this clean-up process has overshot the mark somewhat.
It has led to excessive bureaucracy for subsidy applications, and it is mainly the NGOs, the non-governmental organisations and small and medium-sized enterprises that have borne the brunt of this.
There is now such fear of inappropriate spending that European officials, where possible, will pass the buck to the subsidy applicants.
As a result, we still have not got what we set out to achieve, namely a Commission in which officials are really responsible and can also shoulder that responsibility.
I am, then, very much in favour of the amendments that are before us, the majority of which aim to simplify procedures.
The principle of proportionality is being mooted and I am also delighted with Amendments 110 and 101 which deal with the percentage rule.
The situation at the moment is that when beneficiaries raise own resources, it is likely that they will need to pay back much of the grant, with the counterproductive effect of giving a disincentive to raise own resources in future.
The Commission has pledged that it will adopt a number of basic points from those amendments, but, as ever, the devil is in the detail, of course.
As you saw with the proposals that are before us, it is this Houseâs intention to simplify procedures.
This is not only dependent on the Financial Regulation; much will also depend on the implementing provisions which the Commission will be drafting.
I therefore hope that you will adopt the principle that simplification must be introduced, which will really lighten the load.
There is much talk at present of reducing the pressure of rules imposed by Europe, and people immediately think of the large enterprises which would otherwise be obstructed in their competitiveness.
It is also just as important, though, for the small enterprises and non-profit organisations to start to benefit from a reduction in administrative costs.
While it is important that the Commission should bear this in mind when it drafts the implementing rules, I hope, too, that the Council will accept that this is not just about large enterprises, and that smaller businesses and NGOs should also benefit from a reduction in the administrative burden imposed by Europe.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, as I take the floor in the debate on MrsÂ GrÃ€Ãleâs report on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Community, I should like to draw the attention of the House to the following issues.
Firstly, the European Commission believes that after three yearsâ operation of the Financial Regulation there is no need to change its structure or the fundamental principles and concepts it contains.
Secondly, the Commission does, however, propose a whole series of changes affecting fundamental budget principles and the validation of claims amongst other issues.
According to the proposal, the Communityâs claims are to be dealt with by the Member States in the same way as national financial claims.
In addition, the proposal sets a five-year period for them to extinguish.
This is to apply to both public procurement and contracts.
These provisions incorporate the changes required to adjust to the new Community directive adopted in 2004 concerning public procurement and grants.
The aim is to simplify provisions on controls and guarantees.
The rapporteur proposes a whole series of amendments to the regulation amended by the European Commission.
The changes are intended to make implementation of the Unionâs budget easier and to facilitate access to budget funds by the beneficiaries.
I support most of these amendments and earnestly hope that the Financial Regulation, as amended by the European Commission and Parliament, will enable funds set aside in the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective to be distributed in a more efficient and transparent manner than has been the case to date.
This will be particularly important for the new Member States who are due to receive several times more funding for 2007-2013 than they have in the past.
As I conclude, I should like to thank MrsÂ GrÃ€Ãle for a good report.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, like the last time we reviewed it, we are debating the financial Regulation today during a night sitting.
I hope that, like last time, the Presidency-in-Office of the Council will be receptive to our proposals and not be a wary Presidency which wants to maintain the status quo, ignoring the fact that circumstances have changed and that the operating rules must be improved in order to improve budgetary execution.
Like last time, we again need the Commission to be understanding towards Parliament and demanding towards the Council.
The rapporteur has obtained the support of a large majority for her proposal, both in the Committee on Budgetary Control and in the Committee on Budgets, and has included valuable contributions aimed at eliminating bureaucratic obstacles and protecting the taxpayersâ financial interests from fraud.
With regard to the amendments presented, I would like to draw attention to the rapporteurâs compromise proposal.
The proposal of other political groups to authorise carry-over for all of the unused commitment appropriations is unrealistic and may affect the principle of annuality and, above all, it does not favour our position on the recycling of unspent funds, which is part of the negotiating strategy in the financial perspective.
Restricting the sum, as the rapporteur does in her compromise amendment, seems more reasonable and, above all, more effective in terms of defending this strategy.
Furthermore, Mr President, I believe that the strategy should clearly separate the vote on the legislative proposal from the final adoption when we have a definitive wording from the Council.
