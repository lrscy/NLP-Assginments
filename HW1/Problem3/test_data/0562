The way to fight anti-democratic forces is with democracy.
He should end the state of emergency, announce a date for elections and a date on which he will give up his uniform.
He should then call for an open and wideranging debate about the future of Pakistan.
I am convinced such a debate would reveal that the vast majority of Pakistanis reject extremism and fundamentalism and wish to live in a country at peace with itself, at peace with it's neighbours and on good terms with the West.
Council's strategy for the Bali Conference on Climate Change (COP 13 and COP/MOP 3) (debate)
The next item is the debate on
the oral question on the Council's strategy for the Bali Conference on Climate Change (COP 13 and COP/MOP 3), by Guido Sacconi, on behalf of the Temporary Committee on Climate Change to the Council - B6-0379/2007), and
the oral question on the Council's strategy for the Bali Conference on Climate Change (COP 13 and COP/MOP 3), by Guido Sacconi, on behalf of the Temporary Committee on Climate Change to the Council - B6-0380/2007).
author. - (IT) Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am sure that I do not need to remind you of the importance of the Conference of the Parties in Bali which is now imminent and in view of which we have asked for further information on your strategy, on the line that you intend to take.
As the European Union, we are independently committed to an extraordinary effort, if I may put it that way, even though we know that it does not represent the ultimate solution.
Our shared goal is to keep global warming within two degrees of levels in pre-industrial times, fully aware that this is a high-risk threshold, and that it will be necessary for some areas of the world, for some parts of Europe, to make provision, as planned, for a policy of adaptation.
If we really want to pursue this difficult goal, however, we know that a new international treaty is absolutely crucial.
As we know, the European Union's burden of responsibility is limited (14% of global greenhouse gas emissions).
A new international treaty taking account of the changes that have taken place since Kyoto, in particular the extraordinary and explosive growth of the Asian giants: indeed, Bali is a crucial step in that direction, and while it will not be the place at which agreement is reached, it will be the place at which negotiations will start and it will therefore be very important for Bali to come up with a clear negotiating mandate, with precise deadlines, with a view to conclusion by 2009.
In recent months, the world context has changed from the political, economic and cultural point of view, from the IPCC reports whose final synthesis will be released at the end of this week, and is to be presented in Valencia, to the award of the Nobel Prize to Al Gore and the IPCC's scientists.
A great deal has changed in recent months and we can therefore be optimistic, albeit in a critical and vigilant way.
I would therefore like to sum up the purport of the resolution which we have drawn up and which we are sure will be adopted in this House tomorrow by a large majority; it is an offering, an offering to the negotiators to help them to take a tougher line as these negotiations are being launched.
I would like to thank Mrs Hassi who, with the other rapporteurs, has managed to provide a synthesis, to prevent the whole thing from becoming an overdressed Christmas tree.
The focus is very much on those negotiations and that is how we put it before you.
author. - (FI) Mr President, I wish to express my thanks for the excellent levels of cooperation with the shadow rapporteurs of the political groups in the negotiations on this resolution.
Climate change is happening now, and it is advancing more quickly than predicted.
A dramatic indication of this was that at the end of last summer a million square meters of the ice in the Arctic Ocean melted, an area the equivalent of Finland, Sweden and Norway combined.
The message the scientists are sending out about the advance of climate change and the urgent need to cut emissions is becoming an ever more alarming one.
It is also echoed in the advance information on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change meeting in Valencia this week.
It is important that there is no gap left between the Kyoto Protocol and the next climate agreement.
That is why the post-2012 treaty must be ready no later than 2009.
At Bali the EU must do all it can to achieve a negotiating mandate to allow global warming to remain under two degrees.
The leading role assumed by the EU is crucial to this.
We are showing the way with our own measures to reduce our own emissions, but also by coordinating international negotiations.
It is vital to get all the industrialised countries involved, including the United States of America, although that will not be enough to save the climate.
It is just as crucial to get big developing countries, such as China and India, to accept limits on the increase in their emissions.
This is perhaps the hardest challenge in the history of international diplomacy.
We have to understand that if China, India and other similar countries accept limits to their emissions, it will mean a huge change in their way of thinking and the way they do things.
We have to be prepared to give them something back in return.
In other words, we also have to provide financial assistance for the breakthrough in clean, climate-friendly technology in these countries.
I would like to remind everyone that Nicholas Stern estimated that 1% of global gross domestic product each year would be needed to protect the climate.
After the Second World War the United States delivered 2% of their GDP in the form of Marshall Plan aid.
It was important to get reconstruction under way after the war, but it is still more important to prevent a comparable catastrophe as a result of climate change.
We must therefore also be prepared to pay for climate protection.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the time is approaching when the Indonesian island of Bali will welcome delegates to the 13th Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Climate Change, who will be asked once again to use their experience and negotiating skills to make history.
In light of the first period of compliance with the Kyoto Protocol, from 2008 to 2012, the worrying scientific information that has emerged meanwhile on recent developments in relation to climate change highlights how urgent it is to find a collective and effective response to this challenge, since the very future of our planet is at stake.
In this context Bali is the final opportunity to launch negotiations on a global and comprehensive agreement on the post-2012 climate regime.
We are aware of the difficulties of this judicial process.
The European Union will go to Bali with the same sense of purpose that has guided it over the last 15 years, during which we unhesitatingly and unambiguously took on the role of leader of the international community in this great global challenge.
The European Union's major objective at the Bali Conference on climate change will relate to the process itself, i.e. to ensure that a global and comprehensive negotiating process is set in motion.
I would also like to inform you that the EU considers the following aspects to be essential for creating an effective and appropriate post-2012 framework: firstly, to continue to develop a common perspective on the problem so as to achieve the Convention's major objective; secondly, to reach agreement on the adoption of firmer commitments by the developed countries as regards global emission reductions; thirdly, to facilitate the provision of new equitable and effective contributions by other countries, including incentives created by new types of flexible commitments to reduce the intensity of greenhouse gas emissions associated with economic development; fourthly, to expand the carbon market, particularly by reinforcing innovative and flexible mechanisms; fifthly, to reinforce cooperation in the areas of research, development, dissemination, forecasting and transparency in the technological sector; and finally, to intensify efforts to adapt, particularly as regards risk management tools, financing and technology.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the figures speak for themselves.
We were on the front line in Kyoto in making greater commitments than were asked of us, and today the EU and its Member States have clearly defined ambitious targets that again put us on the front line in combatting climate change.
As the President-in-Office of the European Council emphasised in New York, climate change is now undeniably one of the greatest challenges facing humanity, and has moved from the realm of theory to become an effective and widespread concern for the people of the entire world.
This is a global challenge that requires a global response, the effectiveness of which will depend on the international community's collective action.
That is why we insist that every effort must be made to negotiate the global comprehensive agreement, as I said, under the United Nations Framework Convention on climate change, which represents and must continue to represent the central and essential reference framework for all actions and initiatives to be taken in this area.
It is therefore time for other states to assume their responsibilities and to play a real and proportionate role in the global battle against climate change.
Encouraged by the debate between the Heads of State and Government at the recent Lisbon Informal Summit on Europe and globalisation, which clearly showed that climate change is an EU priority area, and also by the Environment Committee's 30 October conclusions on the preparation of COP 23, we will go to Bali committed to contributing actively to achieving a result that can be translated into concrete, perceptible progress on the future of the climate regime.
Bali represents not the end but rather the beginning of a journey, the 'road map' that has been talked about so much in recent years.
It is a complex and difficult challenge, but one that can be achieved and that cannot be put off.
The EU for its part is prepared to lead this challenge, since that is what our people want.
Mr President, thank you for the opportunity we have had today to exchange views on the EU's position at the UN Conference in Bali opening on 3 December.
The Commission and the European Parliament made a decisive contribution towards adopting an ambitious European policy on climate change.
It took a leading role on the international scene and a constructive position with regard to our main partners among developed and developing countries.
I look forward to continuing this close and fruitful cooperation in Bali, where Parliament will be represented by a strong delegation.
The question submitted by the Temporary Committee on Climate Change concerns the most important issues we will be facing in Bali.
One such issue is how to secure the support of our main partners for starting negotiations, with a view to concluding an international agreement that will aim to ensure that global warming is limited to 2Â°C.
The Bali Conference will undoubtedly be a milestone in the international endeavour to combat climate change.
Bali will be a first practical test of the international community's determination to translate political declarations into action.
There are many encouraging signs.
Climate change is now a first priority in international policy; it is an issue of direct concern to Heads of State or Government around the world.
A month ago, the first meeting of its kind, called by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in New York, sent out a very powerful message: climate change is now recognised by all leaders throughout the world as an issue requiring urgent and decisive action by the international community.
The recent meeting in Bogor also confirmed that there is a shared view among a steadily growing number of countries that an agreement must be reached in Bali on starting official negotiations aimed at concluding an agreement on climate change for the period after 2012.
The discussions so far have also shown that there is a convergence of views on the main points to be included in the agreement for the period after 2012.
Of course, some would prefer clusters (reduction, adaptation, technology, funding) to establishing the main points of agreement at Bali, which is the position held by the EU.
It is nevertheless true that the EU has to large extent managed to set the agenda for the Bali Conference.
The EU strategy on climate and energy, approved by the European Council in March 2007 on the basis of a related motion from the Commission, has had a decisive effect on the aims and level of ambition of the Bali Conference as well as the architecture of the post-2012 agreement on climate change.
The EU strategy has formed a basis for a series of multilateral and bilateral discussions.
At the end of this month, the EU will discuss the issue of climate change as a matter of priority at the EU-China and EU-India summit conferences.
It is up to our partners in the developed countries to respond to and cooperate on the targets set by the EU, acting at all times on the basis of scientific data.
The developed countries must continue to take the lead by making ambitious commitments to reduce emissions in absolute terms.
We have the economic and technological means to limit greenhouse gas emissions.
If we and the other developed countries do not take the first steps, how can we expect the rapidly developing, emerging economies to take action, especially on the scale required?
Nevertheless, the forecasts for emission increases worldwide leave no doubt that the developing countries must contribute.
We are not asking them for the time being to commit themselves to emission reductions in absolute terms.
However, with our help the developing countries must slow the rate of increase in their emissions.
Thus on a global scale, at some point in the next 10-15 years, once we have reached a peak in CO2 emissions these can begin to decrease in absolute terms.
This is the only way we can keep the increase in the average temperature of the planet within the limit of 2Â°C. In this context, we must focus on specific proposals to strengthen funding and investments in clean technologies and the transfer of these technologies to developing countries.
We therefore support the initiative of our Indonesian hosts to invite finance ministers to a meeting on climate change and funding, to be held in Bali during the Conference.
To retain its leading role internationally, the EU must above all achieve results within its own territory.
The Commission will approve the package of measures on climate and energy at the beginning of next year and will plan the necessary measures for achieving our targets, namely a unilateral reduction in emissions of 20%, or 30% if an international agreement is achieved.
This package of measures will include proposals on the allocation of responsibility and obligations among the Member States in order to improve the EU Emissions Trading System and achieve the targets for renewable energy sources.
Measures to be taken at Community level must also play a part in reducing emissions.
One such area is our forthcoming proposals on CO2 and motor vehicles, as discussed in the European Parliament at the October plenary session.
The Commission will propose a legislative framework for achieving the Community target of 120 g/km by 2012.
The Commission will also present the legal framework for capturing and storing CO2, with the necessary guarantees on environmental protection.
Bali is only the start of the negotiation process, as the President said earlier.
We must now prepare and secure the widest possible international support for the way ahead that we have planned.
The EU will intensify bilateral contacts with major partners and will take full advantage of the forthcoming summits as well as all the important international meetings.
As I have said before, despite encouraging signs internationally, there are nevertheless serious differences of opinion.
For instance, there is disagreement on how to combat climate change, and in particular the type and nature of the targets.
The US is continuing to oppose binding targets.
Targets of this kind are of fundamental importance if we wish to ensure the effectiveness of our agreement and the strengthening of the global CO2 market.
We shall continue to cooperate with all those in the United States who can help towards bringing about a change of attitude at federal level.
In the United States itself, a very lively dialogue is already being conducted on the issue of combating climate change.
From various sections of the United States we are receiving clear messages and appeals for decisive action in the run-up to the Bali Conference.
Through your various contacts with colleagues in other parliaments around the world, with representatives of industry and with civil society, we are counting on the support of the European Parliament in promoting the EU's ambitious aims regarding the issue of climate change.
We need this support in our efforts to strengthen international cooperation on climate change.
(Applause)
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FI) Madame President, first of all my sincere thanks go to Mrs Hassi for her cooperation on this resolution.
Obviously this is perhaps going to be one of the most important, if not the most important, conferences on climate change.
Unfortunately, not much progress was made in the last five conferences.
Now at last the time has come to decide upon concrete measures for the period after 2012.
What all the earlier conferences have had in common is that, instead of souvenirs in the shape of real breakthroughs, we have seen a pat on the back for the EU for leading the way in its unilateral actions and environmental aspirations, and then off we go again for another year.
The problem is that global measures are needed urgently for what is a global climate problem, although they have seemed difficult to produce.
For example, a year ago Nairobi failed to show any indication that there would be commitment from any of the important new countries to emissions cuts from 2013.
We have therefore had to hope that negotiations outside the Kyoto Protocol framework will result in emissions cuts among the world's four largest polluters, the United States of America, China, India and Russia.
Perhaps the most tangible challenge for developing countries is the notion of solidarity.
At one time no one could have foreseen the extent to which emissions would start to increase, and now around half of all emissions come from the developing countries, mainly China and India.
Of course their citizens have a right to economic growth, but it is in everyone's interests that that growth be as clean as possible.
The negotiating situation is thus awkward, but then also is the practice.
It may tempt companies operating in global markets to continue to invest in places where there are not proper environmental standards or emissions limits.
For people in the developing world, however, there is no solidarity in having their environment contaminated.
Furthermore, to move emissions is not to cut them.
The outcome, then, is that three out of every four emissions are increasing rapidly.
How do we move forward from this situation?
Will there be time to decouple industrial production from country-specific restrictions and instead produce a worldwide scheme for the industrial sector and an international carbon economy?
The priorities should be energy content, eco-efficiency and low-emission technology and its development.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PT) President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I will begin by sincerely congratulating the rapporteur, Mrs Hassi, for her opening text and for her capacity to generate commitments on this complex issue.
The text to be put to the vote reflects the genuine effort made by the various political groups to send a clear, effective and mobilising message to Bali.
This is the only way to ensure the conditions for achieving the central objective, which is to transform the Bali meeting into the departure point for all global partners to assume clear and quantified policy commitments for combating climate change by 2009.
Everyone has had to make sacrifices and adjustments.
The objective will have been achieved if this text is widely approved by Parliament.
That will give democratic legitimacy to the EU's pioneering spirit in the area of the environment and climate in the eyes of the whole world.
This pioneering spirit has created added responsibilities, however, particularly as regards the quality of the specific proposals presented, which must meanwhile include both reductions and adaptations.
Account must be taken in particular of the fact that the greatest adaptation costs are now falling upon the poorest regions of the world that have contributed least to the problem and which are least equipped to resolve it.
The proposals must meanwhile ensure that the various international reduction responsibilities are distributed equitably, proportionally and fairly.
Environmental commitments will have to be adjusted to the development process the poorest countries and regions are entitled to, including access to normal standards of well-being and comfort, whether for the less developed countries or for the huge populations in the emerging economies.
While the pioneering European approach is a duty, it should nevertheless also be seen as an opportunity to gain environment-related technological and innovative comparative advantages.
This will only materialise, however, if environmental concerns and commitments gradually become the rule of operation of the global economy.
If not, the EU's good practices will distort competition and disappoint its citizens.
In this context Parliament makes the practical suggestion that national commitments should be complemented by the exploration of global sectoral commitments with a view to creating benchmarks and internationally accepted good practices for all sectors of industry and services involved in international competition.
This is a very ambitious agenda, but the EU must assume the responsibilities corresponding to its role of positive leadership which is so very important for the survival of the planet.
Madam President, Minister, Commissioner, the start of negotiations for what will become the new Kyoto Agreement in Bali in December is, of course, extremely important.
Parliament is preparing itself though this debate and a resolution, and the Council has also prepared itself through a resolution.
What is still lacking, I believe, is clearer cooperation between the EU's various institutions.
A big responsibility rests here with the Portuguese Presidency.
The European Union must speak with one voice in Bali.
An important element is how the situation of developing countries is to be managed and how they are to be able to combine economic development with environmentally friendly technology.
They need our assistance.
Not only in fine words, but they need money, methodological development and access to new technology.
We need to focus our efforts on various policy areas and the aid must be changed so that it is also climate friendly.
Part of the solution also depends on the second point I intended to mention in the debate - forests.
Large areas are being devastated today and we all know what that means for the climate.
But it is also a catastrophe for the people who live in these areas when their livelihoods disappear.
A method of working must be developed in which we pay developing countries and ordinary families to look after and take care of forest areas.
Sustainable production is extremely important.
A completely untouched forest is good from the point of view of biodiversity, but a rotting forest emits large volumes of methane gas.
What we need is a growing forest where the final product is taken care of in a way that locks in the CO2 and other greenhouse gases.
Bali will be a big, difficult and chaotic meeting.
The best we can do is prepare ourselves well so that the actual start of the negotiations is good.
For that this debate is an excellent tool, but we must also make preparations together with our friends through a strong transatlantic dialogue and dialogue with China and India.
We know that 25 states emit 83% of the gases we need to stop and, Commissioner, Minister, a true friend is a person who asks how you are doing and also stops to listen to the answer.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - Madam President, can I too congratulate Mrs Hassi on her work and contribution to this debate.
I also want to congratulate Al Gore, the former Vice-President of America, for being recently awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his sterling work in highlighting the need for international action to arrest climate change.
Receipt of this prize is an international recognition that climate change has risen to the top of the international political agenda.
It is international action that is now needed, so that we can all collectively ensure that carbon dioxide emissions are substantially reduced in the near future.
I thus fully support the 20/20 and 50/50 EU commitments to reduce carbon emissions.
Bali represents a real window of opportunity for us to agree an official mandate and framework in order to secure clear and firm international commitments for post-2012.
In Bali let the foundations of the building blocks and road map commence, based on: a shared vision; firm commitments from developed countries; the expansion of the use of carbon markets; the strengthening of cooperation on technological research and the reduction of deforestation.
Also, let us not forget that the EU needs to deliver here at home and to lead by example.
Therefore, I look forward to President PÃ¶ttering's proposal in February on how this House, the European Parliament, can itself reduce its carbon footprint.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, it has become standard practice in the European Union, as we heard again today from the President-in-Office of the Council, to speak of a leading European role in the international effort to combat climate change.
When I cast my mind back to March and the decisions taken at the summit to set targets of a 20% reduction in CO2 emissions, a 20% increase in energy efficiency and a 20% renewables quota by 2020, that does indeed sound like a leading role.
I find it highly regrettable that negotiations with the Member States on the energy package did not progress far enough for us to underpin these summit decisions in Brussels prior to the Bali conference.
If the countries with which the EU intends to negotiate in Bali take a look behind the European scenes and see the arduous nature of the negotiations with the Member States on energy efficiency and renewables, they will realise that the whole business has been nothing short of a tragedy.
I believe it is an ominous sign when we demand giant strides on the global stage but are only prepared to tiptoe forward cautiously at home.
It is not as if a lack of technology were a problem for us.
Our problem is that we totally lack the political courage to effect the sea change that was discussed in March in our energy and resource policies.
I have to say that, when the Reul report was adopted at the last Plenary part-session, I was horrified to hear that we were back to talking about nothing but coal and nuclear-power options, and it fills me with utter shame that Europeans should now be offering African countries nuclear power as a solution to climate problems.
I believe some Europeans must have taken leave of their senses.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Madam President, the text before this House is the result of collective work by the Climate Committee.
That committee, set up on ad hoc basis with a mandate of great importance, has undertaken major consultation and discussion initiatives, and has drawn up an instrument which Europe can use to play a major role in the thirteenth Conference of the Parties in Bali.
The crux of the policy proposal is clear and forceful.
What is needed is a political and multilateral approach which is based on the UN, and takes account of the IPCC and major changes not just in technology but also in the social model.
Technology transfers, cooperation and a new environmental and development approach are needed.
The proposal of 3.20% by the Commission and the Council is only a starting point in this sense, albeit a positive one.
Our thinking needs to be wide-ranging and forward-looking, and frankly the future cannot involve a return to technologies of the past which are old, dangerous and controversial, such as nuclear technology.
We also need to start thinking about innovative proposals that we ourselves have put forward in our parliamentary debate and which are now being taken up in a more authoritative way by leading figures such as Chancellor Merkel.
I am speaking of the per capita calculation of emissions, which we have proposed, together with Mr Prodi, and which is very important in the light of the current situation in which there now seems to be an inequality in emissions and in which those emissions all have to be reduced in an egalitarian way.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Madam President, may I make the following points on behalf of my colleague, Hans Blokland.
To begin with I must thank Satu Hassi most warmly for all the important work she has done to arrive at the resolution now before us.
In view of the upcoming Climate Change Conference in Bali it is important to record the European Parliament's position on climate policy as concisely as possible, and Satu Hassi has done just that.
Now that the European Union is focusing hard on climate policy, it is time for other parts of the world to follow suit, including those countries which have not yet ratified the Kyoto Agreement.
In Bali the European Union should demonstrate its credentials as a leader, not paternalistically but in a spirit of cooperation.
I see the Bali conference as a perfect opportunity for us all to sit down together and consider what action is needed on climate policy after 2012.
It will take joint efforts worldwide to preserve the quality of our world and safeguard our future.
(DE) Madam President, allow me to extend a warm welcome to Stavros Dimas.
We look forward to our discussions with you in Bali about the path that Europe intends to pursue in the field of climate policy.
I see the pursuit of climate policy as a challenge for all of us.
It is not the preserve of misty-eyed environmentalists or of liberal merchants but a challenge to which we must all respond together, and the Temporary Committee on Climate Change is starting to do just that.
Not everyone appreciates this yet, but we have nevertheless made a good start.
Bali is a milestone - no doubt about that.
A post-Bali gap, which would also be a post-Kyoto gap, would be a disaster, not only for the environment but also in terms of economic policy, because industry cannot invest without hard and fast data.
It is also a matter of where we stand at the present time and what we actually have to offer in Bali, for we must have something to offer, otherwise we cannot expect other continents to join us in a common effort to solve the problem.
This is why it is right and proper that we should be committed to making offers here.
Three times twenty per cent amounts to a great deal, and we would be happy to hit these targets.
I still see major obstacles ahead, to be sure, but we shall make it.
Besides, precisely because we need to set a good example, I do believe we shall arrive at a European environmental foreign policy that serves to influence the search for answers to questions such as why these huge conflagrations break out across the globe, producing more CO2 than all of Europe's power stations put together.
I believe Europe has to get involved here, and we are well on the way to doing so, and then Americans within the United States - not necessarily through their government - will be given a positive stimulus to move forward too.
That is precisely where we are heading.
I regard climate change entirely as a golden economic opportunity.
If we do not take it, others surely will.
(FI) Madam President, the credibility of the leadership shown by the European Union in the area of climate policy will be measured in December in Bali. The result must be global will in the shape of a clear mandate to prevent the earth's temperature from rising by more than two degrees.
The European Union has already made its own decisions. If the goal is to be achieved, however, it will take the commitment of all the industrialised countries, the United States and Australia for example, to quantitative cuts in emissions.
We can no longer afford to have the sort of debate we have had up to now as to whether we should reach this target through technological development or by setting binding targets.
We need both.
Only binding targets and adequately stringent emissions targets, however, will make companies switch to cleaner and more environmentally friendly technology.
We have to remember, as has been said here, that to get all the parties to adopt the treaty will take solidarity, especially with the developing countries, which are the worst off of all.
We also need, however, to reach a clear negotiating position with developing countries, such as China and India, on quantitative reductions in emissions in the future.
Again I would like to thank all those who have been involved in drafting this resolution for Parliament, and especially Mrs Hassi and the groups' negotiators.
You have done some excellent work.
(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, a word of welcome to Commissioner Dimas, who will be on the front line in Bali.
Global warming is an urgent, very serious and genuinely global problem in respect of which a global consensus is urgently needed.
That makes it necessary immediately to put forward proposals to control greenhouse gas emissions which are more equitable and more widely accepted than those of the Kyoto protocol based on the principle of 'grandfathering', i.e. 'whoever has polluted most, can continue to pollute most'.
That is unacceptable.
For that reason I think that we have to put forward a bolder proposal.
I tabled an amendment, as has already been pointed out, which can be summarised in slogan form as 'one person, one right of emission', something suggested by Germany's Professor Lutz and also welcomed by Chancellor Merkel.
If every person is to be given the same right of behaviour, the same access to natural resources, it is important for Parliament to support this process which, from the point of view of the emissions trading mechanism, could bring the developing peoples a quantity of resources of an order of magnitude greater than that of international cooperation and easier to control.
In return, that would also require a commitment to respect carbon deposits such as the equatorial forests.
The principle of equity should provide a baseline for a gradual improvement that has to start from a baseline if emission figures admissible in 2050 are to be calculated.
It is therefore crucial for 'grandfathering' to be gradually reduced.
It is precisely because the matter is so serious and urgent that we have to set matters in motion so that that final outcome can be swiftly achieved.
Madam President, one of the most effective strategies the EU can employ in Bali is to lead by example.
The first piece of new European climate legislation to be decided upon since the March Council is the inclusion of aviation in the Emissions Trading System.
So the outcome of that is vitally important, not only in itself but for the signal that it sends to others at the Bali Conference about whether the EU is genuinely serious about its climate change commitments.
So far, frankly, the outlook is pretty grim.
The Commission's initial proposal was hopelessly weak and the fact that the Council has been unable to reach a common mandate for a first reading agreement sends extremely negative messages.
I therefore urge both the Council and the Commission to raise their game substantially and quickly.
Success in Bali also depends critically on whether equity is at the heart of any new agreement.
That is why proposals must be based on convergence towards equal per capita emission rights, such as the approach known as 'contraction and convergence'.
I urge the Council and Commission to follow that approach.
Finally, I would caution against an over-reliance on carbon-offsetting mechanisms.
As a colleague of mine memorably pointed out, carbon offsets are about as useful as an anti-smoking campaign that pays someone else to stop smoking in the developing world while you continue cheerfully puffing away.
It is irresponsible and critically ineffective.
- (EL) Mr President, Commissioner, the remit of the Bali Conference is to promote an ambitious and realistic post-2012 framework.
There is no room for further delay.
Global warming must be addressed immediately and drastically.
Ecology and economics can and must coexist.
The ensuing benefits will greatly exceed the financial cost.
However, this requires a broader agreement, with specific commitments to reduce emissions, and not mere wishful thinking.
Commitments must be made to combat emissions from international air and sea transport.
There is a need to capture greenhouse gases through sustainable forest management and a change in production standards and consumption, as well as through land use.
However, in order to achieve this, the Commission must remember forgotten aims relating to the bold promotion of renewable energy sources.
It must promote more ambitious targets and demonstrate a stronger political will.
This is what we expect, Mr Dimas.
(SL) The European Union is a world leader in combating climate change and developing new environmentally friendly technologies.
But for how much longer?
Awareness of the need to reduce human impact on the natural environment is growing in a large number of countries.
This is being followed by strategies, plans and measures, even in countries in which environmental protection was, even recently, not a priority.
Take for example China, which a delegation of the Temporary Committee on Climate Change visited recently to familiarise itself with the situation there.
Although as a developing country under the Kyoto Protocol China does not have to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions, it is becoming aware of the problem of global warming and has already begun to take action.
It has adopted a national climate change program in which it has, amongst other things, set itself a large number of ambitious targets.
All this demonstrates that we cannot rest on our laurels if Europe is to retain its global influence.
I therefore call upon the delegation in Bali to put forward Europe's position in the fight against global warming accordingly and with a single voice.
In my view, a sufficient reduction in warming is possible only if we succeed in setting up a global market in carbon.
Price, that is to say money, is an extremely effective mechanism for attaining goals in human society.
In seeking to reach an agreement on global measures we cannot forget about implementing our own targets.
We must steadily develop our own policies and continue to introduce innovations in energy, transport and other sectors which also cause greenhouse gas emissions.
Only with effective and successful implementation at home will we be successful in our negotiations and cooperation with third countries.
I hope that the delegation in Bali will have a very successful visit and successfully put forward the positions set out in our resolution.
(NL) Madam President, next month in Bali the European Union must bring its full political weight to bear in order to make the conference a success.
To that end we very much need the support of the developing countries and also of countries like China and India.
To date those countries have contributed very little to climate change, but they are seriously affected by its repercussions.
Europe must offer help to those countries and reach out to them so that they can adjust to climate change, and we must invest in technology transfer.
I am optimistic that in 2009 we can really get down to brass tacks and conclude a good agreement which the United States can also sign up to.
But if the rest of the world does not follow Europe and agree binding targets, we shall need a plan B and even a plan C.
Plan B would be to set worldwide targets for reductions in every sector of industry, and if that does not work plan C would be to slap import levies on products from countries that refuse to implement the climate policy.
The proposed resolution is a good one and it merits our full support.
My compliments to Satu Hassi and the shadow rapporteurs.
(ES) Madam President, an average per capita emissions level has been proposed for everyone but be aware that what may be fair in social terms may end up being impossible in ecological terms.
Environmental objectives must incorporate countries such as China and India, they must incorporate equity.
However, environmental convergence between North and South must take place quickly and the level of emissions must be very low if it is to be an effective measure rather than smoke and mirrors.
At the same time we should consider fiscal and commercial measures to slow trade both in highly polluting products and in products which have been manufactured using dirty technology.
External climate protection of this kind may provide a response on the part of the European Union to the growth of emissions in our products from Southern countries and we can collect the income generated and then invest it in clean technologies in the South.
(SV) We will soon be deciding how we will be able to combat global warming after 2012 when the Kyoto Agreement comes to an end.
We have a very good basis.
We need reductions of up to 80% by 2050, assistance for developing countries to reduce their emissions, measures against the meat industry, which is responsible for almost one fifth of global emissions of greenhouse gases, more flexible patent laws which make it easier to spread green technology, certification of biofuels to avoid them coming into conflict with food supplies, and the conservation of the world's forests.
As has been said, this is all wonderful.
What is missing and what we must do in the future is to take measures against the constantly growing flows of traffic within the EU, EU subsidies and the fact that markets tend to be given priority when the EU legislates and implements.
There are eleven amendments, most of which I think are good and strengthen the thrust of the resolution, which is that it is the rich world which is responsible for climate change and must therefore take the lead in radical reductions.
I am troubled by Amendment 7, which aims to use nuclear power to combat the greenhouse effect.
We should not replace one environmental problem with new problems.
(SV) Madam President, it is almost 15 years since the Climate Convention was signed at the Rio Conference and yet the fact is that climate emissions are rising faster today than ever before.
This shows how inadequate international cooperation has been so far.
The EU must continue to take a leading responsibility through measures at home - everything from tougher requirements for the cars of tomorrow to increased aid for alternative sources of energy.
But 'domestic action' is not enough.
Mr Florenz asked what we can offer the rest of the world.
That is a good question.
I believe we can offer three things.
First, clean environmentally friendly technology to all developing countries which are in a phase of modernisation, not least China and India.
They are fully entitled to their development, but they do not need to repeat our mistakes.
Providing support for technology and knowledge must be a priority in the EU budget.
They gain from it, but we also gain from it.
It is equally important for us to accept our historical responsibility and provide support for adaptation measures to all the low-income countries which will be greatly affected by storms, floods and extended droughts.
The money which has so far been put aside in various adaptation funds and the initiative recently taken by the Commission, the 'Climate Alliance', is not enough.
It is absurdly small.
The need is hundreds of times greater.
Third, as Mrs Ek underlined, it is important to pay attention to the role of forests, not least tropical forests.
We must give the forest owners an incentive not to chop down forests but to preserve them.
Climate policy does not stand and fall with Bali, but success in Bali will, of course, improve the chances of achieving a final agreement in 2009.
In order to facilitate this I assume that the Commission and the Council will listen to Parliament, not least with regard to the need to do much more with regard to technical cooperation, adaptation measures and forest issues.
(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at their spring summit the Heads of State and Government took good decisions on the fight against climate change.
Their decision on greenhouse gases provides for a 20% reduction in the 1990 emission levels in Europe by 2020.
It was also agreed at the spring summit that the reduction target would be raised to 30% if other industrialised nations committed themselves to cutting their greenhouse-gas emissions.
The EU should therefore make every effort to encourage other industrialised nations to sign up to the post-Kyoto agreement.
I should like to refer to another specific point, namely transport, for it is important that we should succeed in securing the inclusion of transport in the post-Kyoto agreement.
In Europe alone, transport produces 21% of all greenhouse gases.
International aviation in particular was not covered by the Kyoto Protocol, because the ICAO, the International Civil Aviation Organization, gave assurances that there were plans to create a global system.
This pledge has not been honoured in the period since 1997, and I am afraid we are still waiting for aviation to be incorporated into the Protocol.
I hope that this step can be initiated in Bali.
(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, there is a serious climate problem.
No one is denying that.
The political issue, however, is how we approach the effort to solve the problem.
I must say that we have had great difficulties with the present report as regards the manner in which the problem is being addressed.
Problems are not solved by describing doomsday scenarios and speaking of human-rights violations or by adopting a disheartening tone instead of proposing solutions.
The aim must be to search realistically and objectively for solutions, weighing up diverse arguments.
In this respect I find it regrettable that we have not been prepared to countenance divergent assessments regarding the causes of climate trends and changes.
I am all for the inclusion of ambitious goals, but it is also essential to ensure that they are achievable, otherwise our climate policy will be ineffectual.
It is also wrong to establish taboos and say that the subject of coal and the development of clean-coal technology or the subject of nuclear power are off limits and that the only answer is renewable energy.
Such an approach completely fails to address the problem.
What is needed is a comprehensive debate in which all aspects are examined in detail and in which we are all open to a variety of instruments and to information from a wide range of sources.
I believe we should also consider, as part of that debate, what impact we can achieve with what resources.
How do we maximise the impact?
We should also reflect on costs.
I believe we should not only focus on the way in which national political decisions are taken but also consider, as one or two colleagues have said to me, how the development of technology can be spurred on and supported.
I do not see any sense in holding today's debate and then, two or three hours or two or three days later, discussing Lisbon strategies and the like in the same chamber.
These two debates must be rolled into one if we want to fight climate change and mitigate its effects.
In my view there has been only a limited opportunity here to voice the critical comments that we aired in our deliberations in committee.
I hope that the next time, when we deal with the full report from the Committee on Climate Change, we shall have a chance to put forward a rather wider spectrum of arguments.
(DE) Madam President, I should like to add my voice to the numerous compliments that have been paid to the rapporteur for this good and objectively presented report, which also received the support of a good majority of the Committee on Climate Change.
It goes without saying that we expect results and a clear mandate for Bali.
This must include shared but differentiated responsibilities for the industrialised nations, the states with emerging economies and the developing countries.
This resolution also indicates clearly that we expect results by 2009.
In the legal instruments the European Parliament adopts - and speakers have already referred today to the inclusion of aviation in emissions trading as well as to CO2 emissions from motor vehicles - we must send very clear political messages to the rest of the world, to the other continents.
That is an essential condition if we are to bring all countries on board.
- (EL) Commissioner, allow me first of all to congratulate you on your efforts in this important international issue of climate change.
Mr President, the fight against climate change should inspire the creation of a new development model.
This model will redefine the existing policies in the direction of environmental protection, linking economic activity with respect for natural resources and social welfare.
The EU should play a leading role and ensure that the negotiations do not end in a broadening of the flexible mechanisms of the Kyoto Protocol.
The aim in Bali should be an agreement with an environmental perspective.
The agreement should also make use of the opportunities for technological innovation, economic development and job creation.
For example, transition to a low-carbon world economy, by linking carbon markets to emissions trading systems, would be a move in the right direction.
The Bali Conference should be an opportunity to formulate a comprehensive proposal for the post-2012 period with binding, long-term targets.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is a debate of unquestioned importance that we have had regularly here in the European Parliament.
The issue of climate change and the European Union's preparations for the Bali Conference have been a recurring theme during these monthly sessions that I have attended.
That clearly highlights the importance Parliament rightly attaches to it, and only this morning climate change was on the agenda once more in connection with our debate on globalisation.
In my opening speech I referred to the six fundamental objectives the European Union is taking to the Bali Conference.
These are clear and defined objectives which I assume are well understood and fully endorsed, and naturally our aim will be to achieve them all.
I also stated very clearly, however, that this is a difficult, complex and politically delicate process, but we will obviously do our utmost to reach a conclusion.
Some fellow Members have suggested that the EU may not have been the leader it has often claimed to be in this process.
I cannot share that opinion, because if there is a bloc, organisation or entity that has shown practical signs of having ambitious targets, of seeking to go further and of showing a real concern for a problem that affects our citizens, then that entity is the European Union.
We have established our own emission reduction goals that cannot be and have not been equalled anywhere in the world, and we have also made significant efforts to save energy, to invest in renewable energies, etc. We must therefore be proud of our efforts and of our work and must not slacken them.
Finally, I would also like to say that I have taken note of the recommendations and suggestions made in Mrs Hassi's resolution.
Some of those suggestions were referred to here by Mrs Ferreira, and the Council will certainly bear the recommendations in mind.
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, first of all I would like to thank the speakers in today's debate for their positive contributions.
There is an emerging consensus that global efforts are needed to win the battle against climate change and that Bali must set out the process and content of the post-2012 climate agreement.
The European Union will intensify its bilateral contacts with key partners to gain support for this line.
However, we also need to look beyond Bali.
Let us not forget that Bali is just the start of a negotiating process.
Making sure that we get on the right track in Bali is, of course, fundamental.
But we will need to step up our efforts to forge common views and develop common solutions with all our partners over the coming months and years.
The EU-China and the EU-India summit, as well as the EU-Asia summit, all this November, are the next steps to generate even more convergence and political momentum for the post-2012 international climate agreement.
As regards the United States and Canada it will be vital to continue but also to go beyond contacts with the Federal Government.
The international carbon market partnership (ICAP) with US states and Canadian provinces, which I signed on behalf of the European Union in Lisbon on 29 October, brings together partners who are actively pursuing the implementation of carbon markets through mandatory cap and trade systems.
I look forward to continuing these discussions with Members of the European Parliament in the run-up to Bali, and thank you very much for your support.
I have to underline that without the continuous support of the European Parliament we would not have had an energy and climate-change package earlier this year and without your support we do not have any hope of achieving a better result in Bali.
So please come in Bali with high ambitions and try to help us as you know how to do.
I am now closing the debate, and I have received a motion for a resolution, in accordance with Rule 108(5), on behalf of the Temporary Committee on Climate Change.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow - Thursday.
Strengthening the European Neighbourhood Policy - Situation in Georgia (debate)
The next item is a joint discussion on:
the report by Raimon Obiols i GermÃ  and Charles Tannock, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on strengthening the European Neighbourhood Policy; and
the Council and Commission statements on the situation in Georgia.
Rapporteur. - (ES) Madam President, I inherited the role of co-rapporteur of this report from our colleague Mr Beglitis, who is now a Member of the Greek Parliament, and I did so with a degree of trepidation, but I must now say that I am very satisfied with the result achieved.
First, because of the good working relationship with my co-rapporteur Mr Tannock, and also because I have had the opportunity to work with a group of extremely competent assistants and officials, and finally because a high level of consensus was reached in the drafting of the report.
It has also been possible to accept most of the amendments, which were likewise submitted in a spirit of agreement, and I feel the outcome has been satisfactory.
The report supports the Commission document of December 2006 on the assessment and future development of the European Neighbourhood Policy and, having regard to the consensus reached, we can currently say that Parliament and the Commission share the same vision, the idea that the European continent and the Mediterranean are interdependent realities which cannot be viewed in isolation, and that the neighbourhood policy offers new channels for relations and for cooperation with societies facing common challenges and problems, as well as major opportunities for joint progress.
The report points up a number of aspects which can make the European Neighbourhood Policy as strong and as ambitious as possible.
I shall quickly go through five of them:
First, the principle of a broad policy schema in a framework of differentiation, a principle of differentiation, so that the European Neighbourhood Policy is viewed not as a standardised, mechanical routine, but as the means by which the European Union can organise relations with its neighbours while being flexible enough to respond successfully to different situations.
Secondly, the idea of a balance between the countries of the East and the countries of the South.
We must not prioritise one side over the other, but must have a fully balanced approach at all times.
Thirdly, the idea of strengthening, using the neighbourhood policy, the structure of the Euro-Mediterranean policy, the aspect on which I worked most closely in this report.
This does not mean superimposing policies, establishing an over-elaborate, over-complicated framework, but creating synergies so that the European Neighbourhood Policy can mean the strengthening of the general structure of the partnership policy or the Euro-Mediterranean association.
Fourthly, the idea of moving from cooperation towards integration in all areas where it may be possible to do so.
This would mean that in the coming years, those sectors which are prepared for it would share policy areas to help develop rapprochements and synergies in key sectors such as energy, transport networks, intercultural dialogue, the environment or education.
And finally, involvement on the part not only of government policy or parliamentary institutions but also, as far as is possible, of many other active sectors in involved civil societies, the more the merrier.
To that end the European Neighbourhood Policy should also tackle the basic issue of communication and visibility.
I would say, the history of the overall policy of Europe in relation to its neighbours.
Finally, I would like to note that at the moment it faces its first challenge of visibility, of history, with the proposal for a Mediterranean Union made by Mr Sarkozy.
Yesterday we heard the French President speak, and I think he introduced some very positive nuances in that he noted that his proposal for a Mediterranean Union excludes no one, first of all, secondly it must be added to the acquis of the Euro-Mediterranean policy and, thirdly, it must try to go beyond it.
I could not agree more with this idea of trying to simplify the general political and institutional framework of the European Neighbourhood policy, in particular with regard to the Mediterranean area.
rapporteur. - Madam President, I too would like to join in thanking both Mr Beglitis, who is now a Greek MP in his national Parliament, and his successor Mr Obiols i GermÃ  for excellent cross-party cooperation and eventual consensus as co-rapporteurs of this key report.
It is self-evident that everybody needs good neighbours.
In an uncertain and ever-changing world, the EU needs to develop good and enhanced relationships with countries on its periphery that are based on security, stability and mutual benefit to all.
So far the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) is proving to be a valuable tool in this process, in creating a ring of friends aimed at improved trade, travel and political cooperation, particularly against terrorism and people trafficking.
But, of course, of utmost importance are the shared values and in particular reinforcing democracy, the rule of law and human rights as our main priority.
ENP policy was conceived somewhat hastily, I have to say to the Commission.
Some would argue that a blanket arrangement for all southern Euromed and Eastern European countries and the South Caucasus neighbouring countries cannot be an enduring foreign policy idea for the European Union.
Nevertheless, our report fully accepts that for the foreseeable future this unitary policy is here to stay and Parliament will engage with it as it is.
Nevertheless, clearly Moldova is not the same as Morocco.
Countries in the southern dimension are not European and therefore have no real prospects of EU membership.
In the East, which is my side of the report, however, there are at least two countries in my view - Ukraine and Moldova - that are allowed to accede under Article 49 of the Maastricht Treaty, as they are undeniably European in nature.
Certainly, matters in terms of visa facilitation, readmission and, post-Ukraine's WTO accession - which we hope will happen next year - a deep EU free trade agreement, these are all progressing well with a country such as Ukraine, and I hope these will be extended to Moldova and eventually to other South Caucasus countries in due course.
In my view the eventual ENP aim to the East must be visa-free travel.
The ENP will help generally to consolidate these countries' wishes to anchor themselves firmly within EU institutions.
In Moldova's case, the ENP may prove to be a significant boost to the resolution of the Transnistria frozen conflicts.
Nevertheless, these Eastern European ENP countries need to know for sure, by the EU Council and Commission, that membership is ultimately available to them and that the ENP is not just a delaying tactic to frustrate these countries' membership ambitions.
The report also recognises the suffering of the people of Belarus and the bravery of the country's democratic forces.
We need to be ready, as and when the Lukashenko regime crumbles, to welcome Belarus back into the ENP and grant it, too, a European perspective.
The report proposes the development of a joint parliamentary assembly for the European Parliament and Eastern ENP countries, provisionally dubbed 'EURO-NEST'.
It draws on the success of similar structures, such as the Euromed Parliamentary Assembly, which is already up and running and basically is the southern dimension of parliamentary cooperation for the ENP, as well as the Barcelona Process, and the more famous ACP Assembly.
I am personally convinced that EURO-NEST would strengthen democratic institutions in Eastern ENP countries.
It would hasten an end to the isolation of Belarus and enable, for instance, Azerbaijani and Armenian parliamentarians to discuss the potentially explosive Nagorno-Karabakh frozen conflict, where a war could once again break out, given the amount of petrodollars flowing into the Azerbaijani Government's treasuries and the rhetoric on both sides of the divide.
The EU has become far too dependent as well on Russian energy resources, so we all agree that we must develop alternative sources.
That is why our report, when it went through the Committee on Foreign Affairs, proposed the idea of bringing Kazakhstan potentially one day as a possibility into the ENP.
However, now, I am afraid to say, this is sadly no longer supported by the major political groups, so it may well be taken out of the report tomorrow at the vote.
We would have had access through this process to Kazakhstan's vast natural resources, while the EU would help further reforms in this vast - geographically speaking - secular country of strategic importance.
If it is indeed pulled closer one day to Russia and China, which I am sure is the intent of those two powers, we will be ruing the day that we took such a precipitous decision to keep Kazakhstan at arm's length.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr President, Commissioner, whom I would particularly like to applaud for dedicating so much of your time, work, effort and enthusiasm to developing and implementing the European Neighbourhood Policy.
I acknowledge all that commitment, work and effort and must applaud you for it.
Ladies and gentlemen, the European Neighbourhood Policy, to which from now on I will refer simply as ENP, is an essential policy for the EU.
The ENP is a fundamental element of the architecture of the Union's relations with the ring of states surrounding it.
Stability, security and development are interconnected processes.
Relations between the Union and its neighbours must be strengthened, both to the East and to the South, so that the ENP provides a global, single, inclusive, balanced and coherent policy framework.
Despite the specific nature and individuality of each country and each society, common interests and challenges exist that must be faced together.
The fact that we are strengthening the ENP is first of all evidence of the merits of this policy.
We are concerned only with strengthening and deepening policies that have been successful.
We all acknowledge, however, that we must continue to reinforce and strengthen the ENP.
Since the Commission presented its proposals at the end of last year, Member States have reached a broad consensus on the need to strengthen the ENP and the measures required to do so.
In this context, on the Council's behalf I would like to thank the two rapporteurs, Mr Tannock and Mr Obiols i GermÃ , for their excellent and exhaustive report.
Parliament's opinions are particularly important and valuable, especially for implementing the strengthened European Neighbourhood Policy, and will be taken into account as we go forward.
As you know, the German Presidency presented an interim report on strengthening the ENP that was endorsed by the Council and by the European Council last June.
The June Council also adopted conclusions reiterating the main principles of the ENP.
Firstly, the ENP consolidates a strategy based on partnership and cooperation.
Our objective is to help our neighbours to modernise and to reform.
For this purpose and to ensure that the strengthened ENP is effective, it must be followed by all the member countries as part of a privileged partnership with a view to achieving the necessary reforms.
The imposition from Brussels of a calendar of reforms is certainly not the best way to obtain results, which is why we have listened to what the partner countries want from the strengthened ENP.
Secondly, it is a global, single, inclusive, balanced and coherent policy framework.
The Member States agree that the offer of intensified relations applies to all partner countries, while maintaining an overall balance between the East and the South.
Thirdly, the aspects of differentiation set out according to the performance and assistance per measure continue to be essential in the EU's relations with neighbouring states.
The ENP's policy framework obviously needs to remain sufficiently flexible to take into account the needs of each partner and the extent to which they effectively and visibly make and are prepared to make progress on the reform track.
EU support should therefore be tailored even more to the needs of partners and their priorities as set out in the ENP action plans.
Finally, the European Neighbourhood Policy remains distinct from the process of enlargement and does not prejudge any possible future developments in partner countries' relationships with the EU.
Participation in the ENP in itself makes it possible to bolster national transformation processes in the interests of our partners' citizens, independently of an EU accession perspective.
We must therefore be cautious and not amalgamate two things which are different.
Article 49 of the Treaty on European Union provides that any European State which respects the principles of the rule of law, freedom, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms may apply to become a member of the Union.
Any application for accession will be examined in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty.
I would now like to refer to the strengthening of the ENP.
As you know, one of the key aspects of the strengthened ENP is to make best use of the Union's financial weight.
The increase in funding for partners under the new European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument is already a sign of the Union's enhanced commitment.
To encourage reforms even further, a governance facility has been created based on objective and transparent allocation criteria.
Funding will be allocated via this facility for the first time this autumn.
Work is also progressing on the establishment of the ENP investment facility, which is intended to improve the impact of the Union's budgetary contributions and to help to mobilise major donor resources.
This new mechanism will be fully compatible with existing financial instruments, particularly the Euro-Mediterranean investment and partnership facility.
In order to further encourage and support regulatory and administrative reform and institution-building, we aim to open up Community agencies and programmes to ENP countries through a gradual approach.
Some progress has already been made in this area.
The Commission is negotiating the necessary protocols on the general principles for participation in these new Community programmes with the first group of ENP partners.
Israel, Morocco and the Ukraine are likely to be the first countries to benefit from this measure.
I would like to conclude with some remarks on what we consider to be the key elements of the strengthened ENP.
First and foremost, one of its essential components is increased economic integration, which must be achieved in particular by the gradual adoption of comprehensive free trade agreements.
The opening of negotiations on such agreements, however, must be preceded by the accession of partner countries to the WTO.
It is also essential to facilitate mobility for certain categories of people between the partner countries and the EU.
As a clear and tangible sign of the Union's openness to its neighbours and in line with its common approach on visa facilitation, we concluded visa facilitation and readmission agreements with Ukraine and Moldova.
We will also discuss visa facilitation for certain groups of people from Eastern Europe so that they can participate in ENP-related events, building on equivalent measures that have been applied for groups of citizens from the Euro-Med countries since 2003.
Finally, I would like to refer to the commitment we recently assumed in relation to the Black Sea and countries in that region.
The Black Sea Synergy initiative aims to strengthen cooperation among the countries of the region and deepen the EU's relations with it at all levels.
In general terms, the European Neighbourhood Policy is in the interests of both the Union and the partner countries.
It is now time to make it a more attractive, effective and credible policy that guarantees security and prosperity for all.
Member of the Commission. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I regard the European Neighbourhood Policy, the intensification of which we are discussing today, as a key strategic policy, and I would like to record my sincere thanks to the two rapporteurs for their report, a truly important document which will also serve to fill our sails for the next leg of the ENP voyage.
We want to use this neighbourhood policy, of course, to project our stability and to encourage reforms.
In view of the international challenges confronting Europe, the success of this policy is also vital not only to our prosperity but also to the prosperity, stability and security of both ourselves and our neighbours.
That is the basic idea.
I also thank you for the key elements that were developed in the report.
It is a differentiated policy, a policy that must have a coherent political framework.
It is a policy which is also designed to generate synergy within a regional structure - Black Sea Synergy in one area and the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership in the other.
It is a policy based on recognition of the need to support particular sectors.
Implementing and further intensifying the neighbourhood policy is thus an absolute priority.
I am therefore grateful for the support of Parliament, which is essential.
The results of the major European Neighbourhood Policy Conference on 3 September also show that our partners and our Member States are now fully in agreement with this prioritisation.
The conference was a real success, because it brought all of our ENP partners and all the Member States together for the first time, along with representatives of the various authorities and of civil society.
A clear consensus emerged on the substantive priorities of the neighbourhood policy, from economic integration to greater mobility, and from energy policy to political cooperation.
Parliament can play an especially prominent and important role in the realm of political cooperation, and of course you are also a catalyst for the development of democracy, for human rights and for reforms leading towards the establishment of the rule of law, to which we naturally attach the utmost importance here, and which serve as a compass of this neighbourhood policy.
The neighbourhood policy is already yielding definite results too.
One need only consider how much we have intensified our cooperation with Ukraine in the ENP framework since the Orange Revolution.
The fact that Ukraine has now held free and fair elections for the second time undoubtedly constitutes a success.
I hope that the political decision-makers in Kiev will now maintain the momentum of recent weeks.
We shall continue to work with you on the implementation of major reforms too, with the aid of the substantial ENP Action Plan.
Negotiations are progressing on an enhanced agreement, which, as you are aware, is intended to bring Ukraine as close as possible to the European Union.
We shall also continue, of course, to support Ukraine's accession to the WTO so that we can establish a comprehensive free-trade area, and we have already - as you know - concluded a visa-facilitation agreement with Ukraine and hope that the same can be done soon with the Republic of Moldova, each of these agreements being accompanied by an agreement on readmission.
Morocco is another enthusiastic beneficiary of this neighbourhood policy, and is using it astutely as an engine of modernisation, which is precisely what we wanted to happen.
We have very clearly commended Morocco's progress on the basis of its detailed internal reform programme, and the new aviation agreement and Morocco's close energy cooperation with the EU, for example, are good models of fruitful cooperation.
Only last week I was in Rabat for talks, at which I also initiated further progress on the joint reflection process we began in July with a view to meeting Morocco's request for advanced status in the ENP framework.
I am confident that in the second half of next year we shall be able to present appropriate proposals on a new and advanced form of association.
The neighbourhood policy, then, is working, but we must go further, of course, in our efforts to make it even better, even more effective and even more comprehensive.
Last December the Commission published recommendations on ways of strengthening the ENP, which our President-in-Office of the Council has already presented.
I believe we have taken some very important steps.
For example, our eastern partners lacked a regional dimension, but now we have launched this Black Sea Synergy programme as a tailor-made process for the East.
It gives the East what the South has long possessed in the form of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership, and the first meeting in the Black Sea Synergy framework will take place in 2008.
We have also made progress towards opening Community programmes and agencies to our neighbours.
This year we shall also be awarding the first allocations from the new Governance Facility, through which we are demonstrating that we can and will offer more to those partners that display genuine reforming zeal.
In addition, before the year is out we shall have established the Neighbourhood Investment Facility.
Its purpose is to help mobilise funds for the neighbourhood policy over and above our normal budget, primarily to make it possible to fund the large-scale projects in areas such as energy and transport.
I do believe we can claim some successes, but we now need your continued support and that of the Member States to enable us to make further improvements and take further steps.
I am thinking mainly of closer economic integration and of more intensive free trade with our partners.
Their integration into the EU internal market is, of course, a very powerful reform lever.
For this reason we must also gradually open our market, even to what we call sensitive agricultural goods and services, in which our partners have certain competitive advantages.
This means that we must also ask ourselves whether we are prepared to do that.
The second thing I am thinking of is further visa-facilitation measures, which are urgently required to facilitate contacts between people in different countries.
These measures can often be taken within the existing rules, provided there is enough political will to use the available scope, and we must continue to develop the political dimension of the neighbourhood policy.
This relates to the frozen conflicts we see in the partner countries on our eastern borders, conflicts that seriously impede our neighbours' progress towards reform and, in some cases, threaten our own security.
For this reason the neighbourhood policy must help to create the right climate for the resolution of conflicts such as the one in the southern Caucasus.
In the Mediterranean region, I shall naturally continue to press for progress in the Middle East, especially in the Quartet framework, and I very much hope that the meeting in Annapolis and the subsequent donors' conference in Paris will materialise so that further genuine progress can be made in the Middle East.
We are also prepared to help the parties to the conflict in the Western Sahara in their quest for a long-term solution.
In the coming period our neighbourhood policy will be sharply focused on practical implementation.
We must all pull together in order to maintain and intensify the dynamics of reform that have developed among our partners.
Next month the Commission will adopt another communication on the neighbourhood policy, in which we shall outline the steps which the EU needs to take in order to deliver further tangible results in 2008, in other words our own contribution.
In April we shall then present the country-by-country progress reports, in which we shall analyse where our neighbours can further improve the implementation of the action plans.
At the beginning of December some fundamental questions will have to be asked, such as whether the Commission is fully aware of the various capacities and goals of individual neighbouring countries.
As I have said, however, we can make a good deal of progress on the basis of this differentiated approach.
It seems to me that importance also attaches to the concept of ownership and the local potential for putting the ownership principle into practice, as well as to even greater involvement of civil society, an area in which we could still do far more.
I must not omit to add a few words on the events in Georgia, which we have been discussing together.
I merely want to add that we are very concerned about the latest developments in Georgia.
We regret the excessive use of force on the part of the Georgian state security forces in breaking up demonstrations and closing down independent television stations.
I believe we need an independent inquiry into these incidents.
We also remain concerned about the continuing state of emergency and the restrictions on the freedom of the media, for curtailing constitutional rights and closing down media operators are draconian measures which are inconsistent with those democratic values that underlie our bilateral relations with Georgia and that Georgia has pledged itself to uphold.
We therefore expect these measures to be lifted without delay.
I welcome, on the other hand, the decision taken by President Saakashvili to hold presidential elections and a referendum on the date for parliamentary elections, thereby meeting the main demands of the opposition.
I hope this will help to ease tension, and I appeal to all involved to keep political disputes within the bounds of the normal democratic process and to return from the streets to the negotiating table.
We need the right conditions for a fair and transparent electoral process.
I just wanted to add that.
Do forgive me for taking longer than usual, but since I bear particular responsibility on the basis of the precept that politics is about people, you will understand that these matters are particularly close to my heart.
Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development. - Mr President, the Committee on Regional Development views a strengthened European Neighbourhood Policy as a key tool first and foremost to bring our neighbours closer to the European system of values.
An efficient and open ENP can provide multiple incentives for boosting economic, legal and social reforms in countries bordering the EU.
True, the ENP is not to be seen as a direct route to EU membership.
Therefore, the conditionality principle in the EU approach should provide workable mechanisms to encourage necessarily economic and democratic changes in our partner countries, in accordance with their own willingness and progress.
The ENP can only function as a two-way street.
On a political level, I think the ENP would provide us with a wonderful opportunity to deepen regular political dialogue with countries which are willing to align their foreign policy positions with those of the EU, countries like Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia, Armenia and others.
The Committee on Regional Development stresses the crucial importance of cross-border and interregional cooperation programmes in implementing the ENP.
These programmes should include economic and environmental as well as social and cultural aspects.
I would like to stress another principle: ENP should not be limited to cooperation between governments and institutions.
It has to involve civil society and especially stimulate grass-root exchanges between citizens, NGOs and local authorities.
Therefore, it is important to facilitate efficiently visa requirements for local border traffic and for specific population groups.
We also call on the Commission to develop guidelines for local and regional authorities on their specific role in implementing the ENP action plans to develop the ENP further.
Finally, in the Regional Development Committee's opinion, the ENP should also include cooperation in preventing and dealing jointly with natural disasters.
We encourage the Member States to include this aspect in the cross-border cooperation programmes.
Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs. - Mr President, in these times of globalisation and insecurity about the future, our neighbours need clear signs from the European Union.
They need to hear that we consider them as partners.
They need to know that we support them in their transition towards democracy and a better life.
Therefore I welcome the Commission proposal for strengthening the ENP by offering our partners new incentives for reforms.
As draftsman of the opinion for the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, I want to insist on the importance of the ENP as a means of enforcing an area of freedom, security and justice that goes beyond our borders.
We cannot afford to leave our neighbours dealing alone with security issues, organised crime and illegal migration.
In today's world, each of these phenomena has a global impact and these challenges are our challenges.
The ENP is ultimately a win-win policy.
Building an area of freedom, security and justice is in our mutual interest for the EU and for our neighbours, for the sake of all our people.
I am being told that the Presidency of the Council had not been informed that the debate was a joint debate on the European Neighbourhood Policy and the situation in Georgia.
We shall therefore give Mr Lobo Antunes the opportunity to deal with the latter topic now, with the change of speaker.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) I really did not understand why this debate should cover both neighbourhood policy and Georgia.
We do not have much time, which is why I would like to say very quickly that on 18 November last, as you know, the Presidency issued a declaration expressing its deep concern at recent events in Georgia, and called for dialogue between the parties and a search for solutions to the current crisis that did not violate democratic principles and fundamental rights, namely freedom of expression.
We would also like to stress that it is essential for the Government of Georgia to restore confidence in the legitimacy of its actions and to do its utmost to ensure respect for the principles of democracy.
From our point of view the current situation remains a cause for concern, but we very much welcome the Georgian Parliament's announcement that the state of emergency will be lifted on 16 November next, the day after tomorrow.
We hope that this will actually come to fruition rather than simply remaining an announcement.
This is an important step towards restoring democratic normality in Georgia, since presidential elections have been announced for the near future and all the democratic conditions necessary for those elections to take place must naturally be guaranteed.
We are also pleased that dialogue has been established between the authorities and the opposition.
I can inform you that the Council is working with Georgia in exerting political and diplomatic pressure to ensure a rapid return to normality.
Our Special Representative for the region is active and is currently in Georgia.
I can also inform you that the situation in Georgia will be on the agenda of the next General Affairs and External Relations Council.
Some three weeks ago I personally chaired an Association Council between the European Union and Georgia, when I was able to highlight the economic progress the country was making and to refer with some hope to the democratic developments that we considered to be positive.
We sincerely hope that what is currently happening in Georgia is not a backward step, since that would naturally be highly detrimental to the positive aspects of the development of both the political and the economic situation that we thought were encouraging.
I assume that the Georgian people and the Georgian authorities are aware of that.
A backward step is neither possible nor acceptable.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (PL) Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, I would like to refer to one aspect of the excellent report prepared by our colleagues Mr Tannock and Mr Raimon Obiols i GermÃ .
This is the idea of the EURO-NEST Parliamentary Assembly.
The main purpose of EURO-NEST, as proposed in the report, is to put into practice the idea of creating a circle of friends of the EU on the parliamentary level and making them friends among themselves.
This is to supplement the policy of neighbourliness pursued by the executive bodies of the EU.
EURO-NEST would be a parliamentary forum for dialogue, the exchange of experiences and multilateral cooperation.
It is not just a matter of strengthening contacts between the European Parliament and the national parliaments of Ukraine, Moldova, Azerbaijan, Armenia and Georgia, as well as with representatives of democratic forces in Belarus.
For us, the most important issue is that our neighbours should have dialogue and cooperation among themselves, that they should get to know each other better, develop trust in each other and benefit from the best examples of democracy, free speech and respect for human rights.
The concept of EURO-NEST was supported by the majority of the members of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs.
I would hope that it will also gain the support of all of Parliament.
I would like to address my colleagues from the Liberal Group, who submitted amendment number 5, which proposed replacing EURO-NEST with the existing organisation PABSEC.
I would like to say that PABSEC, the Parliamentary Association on Black Sea Economic Cooperation, fulfils a completely different function.
First and foremost there is no role within that organisation for the European Parliament.
Thank you to my colleagues from the Socialist Group for their understanding.
The compromise formula, replacing amendment number 11 and emphasising the need for better intergovernmental cooperation, will make it possible to delineate this form of cooperation in the proper way.
I am convinced that EURO-NEST will provide an additional impetus to strengthening partnership with our eastern neighbours and will complement relations with regard to our southern neighbours as part of the Barcelona process.
It will be a signal that, in the European Parliament, we treat our neighbours seriously, and proof that we are strengthening ties with our eastern neighbours, irrespective of party divisions.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PL) Mr President, in the report under consideration there are some important statements and they come at a good time.
The situation in the countries to which the report relates (I am speaking mostly about the eastern area) is a very dynamic one, bringing, as can be expected, many new experiences.
It is very good that European institutions - the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament - are speaking with a common voice, a voice that reflects the function for which the institutions were created, and for these introductory statements I would like to thank the Commissioner and the Minister.
I would also like to thank the rapporteurs.
The Socialist Group in the European Parliament supports the development of a European Neighbourhood Policy, a strengthened European Neighbourhood Policy, provided that it is prudent and effective.
During work on this report we avoided many unnecessary disputes.
We avoided a rather unwise discussion on whether neighbourliness with the East is more important, or neighbourliness with the South.
That would be like asking a child 'who do you love more, your Mummy or your Daddy?'
We avoided any unnecessary debate on whether or not a European Neighbourhood Policy takes the place of a policy aimed at EU enlargement.
These, too, are unreal dilemmas, but these matters received clarification.
A European Neighbourhood Policy can be effective if it is carried out jointly.
'Jointly' means that it is carried out by the European Union as well as by interested countries.
It cannot be the same towards all countries, because these countries have different degrees of democracy and are interested in implementing this policy in different ways.
How delicate a matter this is you have seen for yourselves, in observing what took place recently in Georgia, which has just been the subject of discussion.
Satisfaction because of another democratic election in Ukraine has been clouded by the fact that these were the second elections in two years in that country.
One could say a mixed satisfaction.
As far as the East is concerned, our policy relates to an area that is constantly troubled by intrigue organised by the Russian Federation, whether this is obvious or hidden.
Finally, as the Minister said, this policy can only be successful if it is accompanied by resources, political will, effective action and an absence of naivety, especially if the creation of new institutions is involved.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FI) Mr President, neighbourhood policy is one of the priorities of the EU's foreign policy.
The European Neighbourhood Policy is part of a wider aim to promote peace, stability and economic prosperity.
The implementation of the ENP also demands much from the EU, as the strategic goals of the 27 Member States have to be able to be compatible.
It is important to avoid east-west confrontation, although, obviously, the Member States of the EU have different priorities when it comes to cooperation.
Cooperation is needed in all directions.
As all the EU Member States are involved as well as 16 partner countries, it is also understandable that people should have strong misgivings in the development of this policy as to how the different partner countries can be included in the collaboration.
The ENP policy's strength, however, lies in the fact that it provides the EU with more resources to aid the partner countries than would be the case if each country were approached separately and from totally different angles.
The ENP's comprehensive approach also ensures that EU policy does not depend on the regional and national predilections of each country to hold the presidency.
My group offers its unambiguous support for the development of the ENP and the priority areas highlighted by the Commission, which are economic integration, the mobility of people, energy (to which we would definitely like to add climate change), and financial and technical assistance.
(Applause)
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, the European Neighbourhood Policy gained more impetus at the same time as the last enlargement of the EU.
It now helps to encourage neighbouring regions to move towards the European value system.
It is the sine qua non for realising objectives that are in both sides' interests, that is, a guarantee of security and stability and the promotion of values such as respect for human rights and full democracy.
At the same time, within the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy it is worth emphasising the particular significance and identity of countries such as, for example, Ukraine.
This country should have a special status within the group of countries included in the ENP and should be given priority treatment, first and foremost because of its role in Europe's cultural heritage and its historical ties with neighbouring countries.
Granting Ukraine privileged status is also particularly important because this country has a pivotal role to play in ensuring energy stability and security for the whole European Union.
The issue of Ukraine and opening the way for its full membership of the EU should therefore be considered on an individual basis, taking into consideration that it is Ukraine that is the EU's principal partner in the east European neighbourhood.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FR) Mr President, I should like to say, firstly, that I am sorry this is a joint debate because the crisis in Georgia ought to have been the subject of a debate in its own right.
Last weekend, the President of this House sent me to Georgia.
I have just returned and I should have liked to deliver a report on events there and the various meetings I had.
Two minutes - sadly - will not be long enough for me to do that.
Before talking about Georgia, however, I should like to welcome the latest arrival among the European Neighbourhood Policy countries, namely Mauritania - a country which I recently visited as head of our election observation mission there.
What is clear today is that the serious crisis in Georgia has certainly put our European Neighbourhood Policy to the test.
Can this neighbourhood policy be really useful?
It is now legitimate to ask that question in the light of the situation in Georgia.
What I can tell you, colleagues, is that, four years on from the non-violent Rose Revolution, the communities in Georgia are truly shocked by the violence of which we saw something on our television screens: the violence directed against Georgia's people and the violence used to close down Imedi TV.
They are shocked because they do not understand what is going on.
I am therefore grateful to the Commission for calling on the Georgian authorities to instigate an inquiry - an independent and transparent investigation - because people want to know exactly what happened and how it happened.
We visited the country and, of course, we heard two versions of events: the opposition version and the authorities' version.
Both are admissible.
It is very clear that two versions exist, but people are calling for genuine transparency.
Obviously we must remember not only, as our colleague reminded us, that Georgia is vulnerable - and we do know that - but also that Georgia has to compromise with a 'big brother' constantly lying in wait to catch it out.
When the Georgian authorities draw our attention to Russia's omnipresence, we need to consider the sort of things that happen.
We had an example with our visa facilitation arrangement with Russia, benefiting people from Abkhazia and South Ossetia who hold Russian passports, even though these areas are part of Georgian territory, and thus placing Georgia in an awkward position.
None of this is news to you, Commissioner.
What we must demand today - in addition, obviously, to lifting of the state of emergency - is the immediate restoration of freedom of expression and media freedom and of course, most importantly, an assurance that there will be free and transparent elections.
Georgia today is capable of organising such elections.
It demonstrated that just last year when it held transparent, democratic local elections in full accordance with international standards.
It is now time - and I am addressing the Council here, for I believe it has been somewhat harsh with the Georgian authorities - for us, with our European Neighbourhood Policy, to demonstrate that we can be useful.
We need to show the people of Georgia that there is some point to the ENP.
The European Union must not let them down.
That is the message we should convey very strongly to the Georgian authorities.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (ES) Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, first I would like to thank Mr Tannock and Mr Obiols for presenting the report and, without further ado, to inform you that my group is critical of the evolution and approach taken in the neighbourhood policy.
We are critical because in 2004, when establishing a neighbourhood policy based essentially on promotion of human rights, specialised technical advice, a better balance in terms of trade and people in migratory flows, we clearly saw possibilities opening up; however there is no doubt that since the approval of the financial instrument it would appear that the impression we give is that what we are basically interested in is establishing free-trade areas, free-trade agreements and cast-iron control over migratory flows, while leaving to one side any reference to the promotion of human rights and the requirement to respect them.
There are two clear examples towards the west and the south, namely the conflict in the Sahara, to which Mrs Ferrero-Waldner has referred, and the conflict with Israel or, to put it another way, the responsibility of Morocco and the State of Israel for two conflicts: the occupied territories of the Western Sahara and the Palestinian conflict.
I sincerely believe that in those areas the neighbourhood policy would have to be much more demanding of those two States in order for them to assume responsibility once and for all for conflicts which in the one case has been going on for almost a hundred years, and in the other has been in existence for forty or fifty years without having been resolved.
We therefore believe that from that point of view we would have liked the European Union to take a much more rigorous position when establishing the neighbourhood policy.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, this report clearly demonstrates how the Europhile political elite in this place are completely out of touch with reality and the wishes of their constituents.
The report asks for the processing of visas to be urgently improved so that travel from some non-EU states can be made easier and less burdensome.
This is not what most Londoners want.
They do not want to make it easier for people to come to Britain: they want to make it harder.
They want to be more selective of the people we invite to our country, not to extend the current open-door policy.
The report anticipates Ukrainian entry to the EU.
Ukraine has a population of 46 million and, as EU citizens, they would all have the right to enter Britain.
The majority of my constituents do not want millions more people given the right of entry to Britain.
They do not want any more indiscriminate immigration from Eastern Europe.
We already have enough immigrants driving around London without tax and insurance; we have enough criminals, drug dealers, fraudsters, people traffickers and sex slaves.
Another crackpot idea in this report is the call for a EU Neighbourhood Parliamentary Assembly - another talking shop of politicians, out of touch with reality, dreaming up more ways of wasting taxpayers' money.
These politicians would, of course, need to be handsomely rewarded for their efforts.
It should surprise no one that one of the authors of this report is a member of the British Conservative Party, a party that pretends to be Eurosceptic at home, but is enthusiastically Europhile here.
No wonder that in London Mr Tannock is known as the Member for Eastern Europe.
I totally oppose these policies; they damage the interests of my constituents.
That is why I will be re-elected in London in 2009, and Mr Tannock may not be.
Mr President, recital C of the report says that the European Neighbourhood Policy 'should remain distinct from the process of enlargement, whereas participation in the ENP does not preclude, for the eastern neighbours which are clearly identifiable as European countries, any perspective of EU membership in the long term'.
For some reason that rule seems not to apply to Turkey.
Here we have precisely the opposite situation.
Turkey is clearly identifiable as a non-European country, is not part of the European Neighbourhood Policy, but it does aspire to membership of the EU.
It has never really been clear why Turkey was not included in the ENP.
The Commission said at the outset that as an applicant country Turkey's inclusion was not appropriate.
That is odd, because in other cases the point is specifically made that the Neighbourhood Policy and the enlargement process must remain distinct from one another.
For Turkey clearly a sui generis rule applies.
All this, I fear, has to do with ideological obfuscation.
Even assuming total commitment to negotiations on Turkish accession, we ought to have included Turkey in the European Neighbourhood Policy, if only for reasons of prudence.
If the negotiations had to be suspended, as they should have been long ago, Turkey could then have been absorbed directly into an existing structure.
It did not happen, and things will only be more difficult as a result in future.
(PL) Mr President, after today's vote I found out - perhaps it was only I who found this out - that the Identity, Tradition and Sovereignty Group ceased to exist at the time that the President of the Parliament announced this information.
However, I note that, according to the list of debates, this Group does still exist, so I am not at all sure who made the mistake: was it Mr McMillan-Scott when he announced that the Group had ceased to exist, or the person who writes these lists?
Mr Siwiec, the electronic mechanism has still not been updated, but Mr Claeys has not already spoken on behalf of a group which ceased to exist a couple of hours ago, rather he spoke as a Non-Attached Member.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, I am indeed astonished at the words of Mr Batten, who comes from the cosmopolitan United Kingdom and yet is spreading narrow-minded and xenophobic propaganda here with his false allegations.
That has nothing to do with the proud tradition of his great country.
The neighbourhood policy has surely become the European Union's main instrument of foreign policy now that we are entering more of a consolidation phase following the accession of twelve countries altogether.
For this reason it is important that the instrument of the ENP is used in an appropriate and concentrated manner, and indeed this is clearly being done in some respects.
The neighbourhood policy also gives us a solid instrument for active involvement in matters relating to the conflict in the Middle East, as Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner indicated.
I do believe the emergence of solutions in Georgia so soon after the outbreaks of tension, and the fact that fresh elections are to be held, are partly connected with the effects of the European perspective and the neighbourhood policy, and show that we are on the right track here.
The policy gives us the means to look after our interests, to forge links, to serve the interests of our partners and to foster the development of human rights and democracy.
When we discuss Belarus in this context, Commissioner, I find it interesting how we are managing to find a suitable way to link the instruments for human rights and democracy in a situation in which the neighbourhood instrument cannot yet have the same impact.
That is an important exercise, which we must repeat in the coming year.
We have here an eastern neighbourhood policy and a southern neighbourhood policy.
Both are equally important, but the method need not always be the same, because the eastern neighbourhood policy also has this dimension of the European perspective, which means that there can be different starting points and, to a certain extent, different prospects too.
A policy that has to do with association agreements, with partnership and cooperation agreements and with the objectives of getting a country such as Ukraine into the WTO and then creating a free-trade area - with steps towards that kind of development - seems to me to be a very important instrument of progress.
This is a policy of joint responsibility.
It is not a matter of the Central European Member States alone looking eastward and the Southern Europeans looking southward; the whole European Community is responsible for both parts.
For this reason, I have to say that I cannot accept proposals such as that for a Mediterranean Union.
I would very much like to see people in Spain and France concerning themselves with Ukraine, and Swedes and Germans taking the same interest in Morocco.
That, and not a new division of the European Union, must be our policy.
(Applause)
(NL) Mr President, first may I wholeheartedly, on behalf of my Group, echo the appeal which Elmar Brok addressed to us all just now.
It shows how important the neighbourhood policy is to the European Union's external activities.
We welcome the plans to strengthen the ENP, but this does not mean that the ENP is the finished article.
The EU must keep looking for ways of making the policy more effective.
Differentiation - as others have said too - is the key to making the neighbourhood policy a success.
The ENP applies to a huge area, from Morocco to Ukraine.
Europe's influence is not the same in all these countries, and Europe is not equally attractive to all of them.
Within the context of the ENP, the EU must offer its partner countries the cooperation agreement that best meets its expectations.
This is a given which we think should be reflected in the Commission's priorities.
Georgia's European aspirations are different from those of Azerbaijan.
Tunisia is less important to the EU than Ukraine and Lebanon does not have the same weight as Morocco.
Hence the need to consider each country individually.
We must concentrate on those countries where the ENP's key objective of bringing neighbouring countries closer to Europe appears the most achievable.
The report also talks about the ENP countries' eastern neighbours.
We think it is a good idea, as part of the recently adopted Central Asia Strategy, to work for solid ties with the countries in question.
In so doing, the European Union could certainly draw on experience from its neighbourhood policy.
We do not, however, endorse the idea of giving countries outside the region the status of ENP countries.
We would do better to focus on a coherent approach to Central Asia rather than dragging certain countries into the ENP.
Lastly, stronger parliamentary cooperation with the ENP countries to the east is only useful if it is accompanied by multilateral cooperation by the region's governments.
If a parliamentary assembly were to be set up, there would also have to be a ministerial assembly, as in other regions where we have created parliamentary assemblies of this kind.
In our view there could only be a parliament of this kind if the Council and Commission also created an intergovernmental counterpart.
(FR) Mr President, as rapporteur on the South Caucasus, I should like to use the opportunity of this report by Mr Tannock and Mr Obiols i GermÃ  - whom I congratulate, by the way, on their work - to tell you my impressions of the situation in Georgia, based on a visit I made there on 5 November, at the height of the demonstrations.
I found it a very complex situation.
The major reforms that had been undertaken were, on the one hand, impressive, particularly in relation to the economy and to combating corruption; on the other hand, the difficult social climate has to be borne in mind, with very high unemployment and a third of the population living below the poverty line.
The most striking thing is the very tense, indeed aggressive, political climate, with the opposition levelling extremely grave accusations at the President, then engaging in public retractions that simply raise more questions.
The Government responds with repeated accusations of foreign - i.e. Russian - interference, and produces video footage in support of its claims.
The events of 7 November - the declaration of the state of emergency, the violent police crackdown on demonstrators and the closure of the television station - underscored the extremely worrying nature of the situation.
Obviously actions like this do not sit well in the traditional European framework of values rooted in the rule of law and fundamental rights; and they need to be explained.
We must hope that the presidential election scheduled for 5 January will allow democratic debate to return to the fore.
It will be up to the Georgian people to decide what is rumour and what is fact, and whether to focus on their disappointments or on the challenges ahead.
It will be up to us, however, to encourage them and to assist in the organisation of genuinely democratic, properly conducted elections, in accordance with international standards.
The issue at stake is the credibility and stability of democracy in Georgia.
(LV) Ladies and gentlemen, after the Rose Revolution, Georgia demonstrated its wish to subscribe to European values.
It expected our understanding and sensitivity.
Unfortunately, we have totally ignored this wish.
Last year I called for CIS peace-keeping forces to be replaced by international peace-keepers.
I suggested a review of the legality of issuing Russian passports in Abkhazia and South Ossetia, which alters the national make-up of Georgian citizens.
I proposed that the Commission and the Council should adopt the same visa facilitation for Georgia that is currently granted in Russia.
However, these calls for more active involvement in resolving Georgia's problems fell on deaf ears.
This disregard has done much to encourage the current situation.
The path of democratisation and reform often means internal political crises, especially in this situation, where they are provided by a large neighbouring state.
The European Union must listen to Georgia and must demonstrate its solidarity through deeds as well as words.
Thank you.
(DE) Mr President, the official aim of the European neighbourhood policy is to create, and I quote, 'a ring of stable, friendly states' around the EU.
A very large amount of money is being spent on it - EUR 12 billion for the period from 2007 to 2013.
For what purposes?
There has been much talk of human rights, but it is all about asserting the interests of the EU.
For example, there is talk of establishing a free-trade area.
For whose benefit, I ask.
There is a lot about protecting borders and controlling migration.
Specifically, the report says, if I may quote parts of it, that Parliament 'stresses the need to improve the capacity of ENP countries to manage migration flows, effectively combat illegal migration, ... to intensify their cooperation in the fight against ... terrorism (and) supports the neighbours' involvement in the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (Frontex) and the European Police Office (Europol)'.
These are things that we do not support, and so, as my colleague Willy Meyer-Pleite has said, our group will not be voting for the report.
(NL) Mr President, the Commission's commitment to the state of Israel under the European Neighbourhood Policy is a matter close to my heart.
Only yesterday the Commission demonstrated it here in the person of its eminent spokesman Dr Andreas Eldina.
Keep it up, Commissioner.
I know I have the backing of our co-rapporteur, Mr Tannock, and of the chairwoman of our Israel delegation, Mrs HybÃ¡Å¡kovÃ¡.
I have one burning question to ask.
What specific new possibilities does the Commissioner envisage for strengthening the European Neighbourhood Policy in regard to Israel, certainly in view of the highly developed political and economic status of the Jewish state?
In short, is it not altogether appropriate to differentiate here within the European Neighbourhood Policy?
I think it is.
Indeed!
(ES) Mr President, it is very important for our neighbours to be a circle of prosperous, stable, peaceful countries where power is based on democratic models and where there is full respect for basic rights.
This idea must be a basic premise for the European Neighbourhood Policy, a policy which should encourage and help our neighbours to undertake the reforms necessary to make the values I referred to above effective.
The issue of political, economic and social reforms is, for me, an essential part of the report which we will approve tomorrow.
A second thought is that the neighbourhood policy must have regard to each country's specific characteristics.
Differences must not be drawn on the basis of the continent to which the country belongs.
Neighbours are just that: neighbours.
That is the important point.
The fact that some of them are also European may have consequences in terms of potential accession to the Union, but not for the purposes of neighbourhood policy.
That is a more general assertion with which I agree, because it would be a mistake for us to discriminate against one group of countries in favour of another.
There cannot be a first-tier neighbourhood policy and another, second-tier, neighbourhood policy.
Neighbours on the southern shore of the Mediterranean have noted with some apprehension that the enlargement to twenty-seven may lead to a degree of exclusion by the enlarged Union; a neighbourhood policy which prioritises Eastern Europe or the Caucasus may well fuel that fear.
The southern Mediterranean countries have very ancient links to the Union.
They are crucial to us in key fields such as security, immigration and energy.
Many of our Member States have, as we know, extremely close historic, political, human, cultural and economic links with them.
This, then, is the second major point in my speech.
We should not differentiate between Europeans and non-Europeans in the neighbourhood policy.
The policy must, as Mr Brok has just said, be one of shared responsibility.
In view of the above, Mr President, I do not share the doubts expressed in numbered paragraph two of the report about the meaningfulness of the ENP's geographic scope.
Moreover, I would not have split the report into two sections, one on European neighbours and the other on Mediterranean neighbours.
A single document would have been better.
To close, my congratulations to Mr Tannock and Mr Obiols.
(DE) Mr President, the question is whether developments in Georgia show that the neighbourhood policy has failed.
I believe that is not the case.
They show that there may still be a need to raise the profile of the neighbourhood policy, for much of what has happened there was foreseeable.
The fact is that the successes and the credit side of the Rose Revolution in Georgia have been tarnished in recent months and years by a good few authoritarian decisions which have encroached on the powers of the judiciary.
Compounded by the social situation, this has resulted in the recent unrest, and I hope we are now strong enough to ensure, together with President Saakashvili, that a dialogue is initiated and that transparent and free elections are conducted with genuine freedom of expression, resulting in truly democratic choices.
A second reason why the neighbourhood policy needs to be strengthened is undoubtedly this whole discussion regarding further enlargement.
Our intention is now to discuss enlargement to the south-east, to negotiate with the countries of south-eastern Europe and Turkey and to bring the process to a conclusion.
This is not the time to anticipate subsequent rounds of enlargement, but rather to strengthen relations with our neighbours, and some of those neighbouring countries, in so far as they are situated in Europe, will have the chance to join the European Union at a later date, though some will not.
This strong link, however, must exist.
The third reason has already been mentioned.
I believe that such abstruse ideas, if you will pardon the expression, as a Mediterranean Union that would draw a line right across the European Union, a Mediterranean Union in which, as President Sarkozy suggested yesterday to the Conference of Presidents, the other Member States of the EU could have observer status, should and must be prevented, to which end we must have a common neighbourhood policy and work together to strengthen relations.
It is legitimate to envisage an EU-Black Sea community and an EU-Mediterranean community, but it will always be the task of the European Union as a whole to maintain and strengthen relations with these neighbours, a task which also involves supporting the efforts of the Commission.
(HU) Mr President, the Union's objective is to create an area of prosperity, stability and security with its neighbours.
There have already been some serious and solid results in this area, but there have been serious failures too.
There has not been any real progress in the area of frozen conflicts, and we do not see any ideas for solving the Transnistrian, Abkhazian, Palestinian or Western Saharan crises.
The countries of the neighbourhood policy do not constitute a whole, either geographically, culturally, economically or politically.
This is why a differentiated, country-specific approach is needed - it is not certain that what is good for Jordan will be good for Ukraine.
Political and budgetary balance needs to be created as soon as possible between the eastern and southern dimensions of the neighbourhood policy.
However, this must lead to reinforcement of the eastern dimension, since it is an obvious consequence of the fact that the European Union was recently enlarged, with the accession of new Member States.
We have had many promises from the Commission about this, but we are waiting for the Commission to keep them.
Thank you.
(PL) Mr President, for the European Neighbourhood Policy to be effective, it must be constantly monitored and adapted to the geopolitical situation.
Only in this way will it be able effectively to implement the tasks required of it by the EU.
The European Neighbourhood Policy still faces considerable challenges.
These challenges consist not only in providing effective assistance for the creation of interstate or economic cooperation.
Today it is also of vital importance to have an answer to the question of how we can help to remedy the situation in those countries where freedom is under threat.
I am thinking particularly of Russia and Belarus.
The European Neighbourhood Policy must be a tool to exert influence on the authorities of those countries where political freedom and democracy are no more than a show, where journalists from independent media lose their lives in unexplained circumstances, and where opposition is systematically and often brutally removed from public life.
Countries that act in this way must be made aware that such practices will be exposed and roundly condemned by the European Union.
(HU) Thank you, Mr President.
The last three years have proved that the European Neighbourhood Policy is a very important instrument for ever closer cooperation with the states concerned and for increasing the stability and security of our Community.
The neighbourhood policy also puts us under an obligation, mainly if the fragile system constructed up to now in one of the countries concerned is at risk.
I would like to draw your attention to the situation in Georgia, where the democracy, constitutionality and vigorous economic development that have been built jointly are threatened.
The mass demonstrations and riots have made the situation uncertain.
I am convinced that the subversive intentions of Russian superpower policy lie behind the situation that has developed.
The greatest attention must be paid to strengthening the system of democratic institutions.
After the declaration of a state of emergency, or excessive action by the armed forces against demonstrators, bringing the presidential elections forward was the right step in this direction.
Georgia, led by Saakashvili, is a committed partner to the EU, and despite numerous problems it is showing significant progress in the areas of reform and economic growth.
The EU, that is, the Commission, the Council and Parliament, in cooperation with the OSCE, have taken an interest in resolving this tension using peaceful means.
We must give all our support to this.
The EU is a 'soft power', in other words the method of persuasion through involvement was proved by the Georgian situation, when President Saakashvili drove the intensified process back into the pool of democracy.
I feel it is particularly important to have a systematic review of the effectiveness of the neighbourhood policy in the mirror of the Georgian events.
Georgian power is being put to the test.
In any event, dialogue with the divided opposition, which cannot be excluded from this process, is inevitable.
Despite our support, Tbilisi must prove how strong the country's democratic system is in the January elections.
(ES) Mr President, as special envoy of the Spanish Presidency of the OSCE I have had the opportunity to visit one of the most conflict-torn of our neighbourhood areas: the Caucasus; the best thing that could happen with all the 'frozen' conflicts is, given what is going on in Georgia, for them to remain 'frozen', because we have achieved no clear improvement in any of them; indeed, the events in Georgia, which have been admirably described, demonstrate how difficult the road to full democracy is.

Today the Caucasus is the front line of the new cold war, the localised cold war.
Upon arrival in Tbilisi, one is greeted by a huge image of President Bush and, upon arrival at the border with Ossetia, by a huge image of President Putin, symbolising the new confrontation which we thought we had overcome.
What has happened has happened, but it is now our responsibility to use the neighbourhood policy to help ensure that the elections in January are free and fair.
It will be difficult.
It is difficult to go within a few months from a state of emergency where demonstrations are violently repressed, where the media are closed down with brute force, to an atmosphere of freedom which enables a free, democratic election to be held; it is difficult to imagine that we can go from a situation in which the Ombudsman is beaten in the city streets by the police to a situation in which people can freely choose their president.
But such are the facts of the matter.
We, the European Parliament, must be heavily involved and must participate in overseeing the elections with the OSCE through the observers we must send, because the area concerned is the one where most progress towards democracy is at stake in one of the most conflict-torn areas in our neighbourhood.
(FI) Mr President, I too want to thank the authors of this report for the excellent job they have done.
I would like to point out how important the role is of local and regional authorities and civil society in the implementation of the European Neighbourhood Policy.
When we want to promote European values in the neighbouring countries, of crucial importance are cultural and student exchanges and successful practical projects jointly realised.
The Committee on Regional Development is also reminded of the excellent experiences of the partnership principle in cohesion policy.
These should also be used to advantage when the ENP is being implemented.
A genuine sense of rapprochement will also be achieved if the impediments regarding border traffic are relaxed and the movement of students, researchers, artists, journalists, entrepreneurs and others is facilitated.
(PL) Mr President, in speaking of the European Neighbourhood Policy we must remember, first of all, to support those governments that respect basic freedoms and human rights, and to encourage those rights in countries where they are not respected.
This is of fundamental importance for the stability of the European continent.
The list of countries included in the ENP is a long one.
I would like to draw your attention to two countries, Ukraine and Belarus, which may be included in the ENP.
Ukraine must be a priority for us, and current negotiations with that country should lead to the conclusion of an association agreement and then make it possible for that country to become a member of the EU.
Such a policy should provide us with an insurance policy against Russia's developing ambitions and yet another attempt to make Ukraine a vassal state.
Finally, Belarus - the Commission's initiative to invite Belarus as an observer to the ENP conference would seem to be premature.
We should bear in mind that this country is still under the dictatorship of Lukashenko, breaching human rights and the rights of ethnic minorities.
The EU would do better to provide more effective support for the people and the opposition within Belarus.
A reduction in the cost of visas for Belarussians, and particularly for students, could be a positive signal in this direction, and the Commission should introduce this without delay.
Mr President, I should like first of all to congratulate the Commission on having collaborated on such a unique concept as the ENP.
Now finally we have a clear distinction between the enlargement instrument and the ENP.
Europe is in a very peaceful process.
So far it is extremely successful.
The ENP represents a necessary amount of creative thinking which will guard and protect peace and stability for our kids.
Energy security, immigration and counter-terrorism are all core issues.
The more clear, precise and analytical and the less political that we are, the better we are equipped to face these threats.
Allow me, then, to use this particular context and to ask about the legal basis.
Some action plans will expire soon.
Specifically I point to the EU-Israel action plan, which is due to expire in April 2008.
The German Presidency created the reflection group.
Its main task is to come up with clear working action for the future.
In between, Madam Commissioner, your work, our work, is very positively reflected in Israel itself.
The Council and Commission received a non-paper reflecting on the simple fact that Israel wishes to enhance our bilateral relations, to have the EU and Israel meeting annually, to have regular high-level cooperation.
Madam Commissioner, my question is how the Commission will reflect on the Israeli non-paper and especially how will the Commission work on a new action plan?
How will our new action plan or enhanced action plan reflect our concerns - counter-terrorism, the fight against extremism, xenophobia, energy security and of course human rights issues, as well as international issues, the Geneva Conventions?
How will all this be reflected and how we will answer the reflection group and the German Presidency?
Mr President, I am also very concerned about the crisis in Georgia and I have to admit that I am negatively surprised.
Recent developments are very unfortunate and regrettable for all those who are in favour of the democratic development of Georgia.
The reports of organisations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch and the Georgian Ombudsman's report are very disturbing.
Given the situation in the country at present, I welcome the statement by the Speaker of the Georgian Parliament that the state of emergency will be lifted on Friday and that within two days from today normal life will hopefully return to the Georgian citizens.
The situation, in my opinion, undermines the reputation of the Government and also of Mr Saakashvili, who rose to power with peaceful protests in 2003, and that cast him as the most democratic leader in the Caucasus.
The fact that President Saakashvili has already called presidential elections on 5 January 2008 is a positive step that has already helped to ease the tensions in the country.
But the Government has to hold a democratic and free election in accordance with international standards in order to show to the world that the country is moving on.
Therefore the Government must guarantee that the election campaign will ensure freedom of expression to all the candidates.
I welcome the dialogue which is taking place between the authorities and the opposition; it is a progressive sign.
I also expect and call upon all the parties involved to act with responsibility during the whole electoral campaign and to engage constructively in the challenge, which is free and safe democratic elections.
(PL) Mr President, it is vitally important that, in tandem with the neighbourhood policy, the doors of the European Union should remain open to our East European neighbours.
Membership can be a long-term possibility, as it is dependent on the progress of reforms and on compliance with the Copenhagen criteria, but it has great symbolic and political significance.
I know, based on the example of my own country, that the possibility of EU membership alone has the power to mobilise society to take the path of economic reforms and democratic change.
Today, in the European Parliament, we are sending a clear and positive signal to our eastern partners, and now we await their reaction, not only in political declarations, but also, most importantly, in practical economic and social measures.
We expect them to go down the path of reform and democracy, to reform their justice systems and make them independent of political influences, to fight corruption and to create a positive environment for economic growth.
I am convinced that a democratic and wealthy Ukraine, Moldova and - let's hope - one day also Belarus would be good not just for the inhabitants of those countries, but also for the whole of the European Union.
(PL) Mr President, the neighbourhood policy is one of the mechanisms aimed at supporting the creation of an area around the EU where cooperation without conflict is possible, as well as avoiding the formation of a cultural and economic divide at the EU borders.
I agree with the concerns expressed by the authors of the report that it would be a mistake to include the countries around the Mediterranean in this same policy.
It would be much better to create an EU-Mediterranean partnership with its own proper mechanisms.
I believe that only those countries that have land frontiers with the European Union should be included in the neighbourhood policy.
Participation in this policy should be a step to the country in question gaining EU membership, obviously only if this is something that the countries themselves and the EU want.
In the future we will have to think about the creation of a separate EU-Asia policy for cooperation with countries in Asia that want to cooperate economically and politically with the European Union, for example, countries such as Georgia and Armenia.
We have to separate our activities by region.
(LT) We are aware of the fact that the aim of the European Neighbourhood Policy is to create a secure circle of safety and stability around the European Union, to develop close relations with neighbouring countries as well as to enable these countries to implement democratic reforms, based on respect for human rights, the rule of law and economic and social development.
My question would be this: what price are we prepared to pay to achieve these objectives?
Having considered past experience I would like to point out that adequate funds are essential for the development of the European Neighbourhood Policy.
In my opinion, EUR 11 billion for a seven-year period for 16 countries is not very much.
More efficient coordination of financial instruments and policies is an essential part of improving the funding of the European Neighbourhood Policy, and the evolving EU budget reform is an excellent opportunity to lay solid foundations for the much more efficient development of the European Neighbourhood Policy in the future.
There is no way I could agree with Mr PflÃŒger, that it is just a case of squandering taxpayers' money.
The second point I would like to emphasise concerns relations among EU neighbour states.
It is essential that they maintain good relations and support one another.
No doubt they would be able to solve most of their problems by working together.
In view of this the European Parliament should express its forthright support of EURO-NEST - the EU Neighbourhood-East Parliamentary Assembly - as well as show political determination and offer financial support for the implementation of this project.
EURO-NEST would provide new momentum for more efficient implementation of the European Neighbourhood Policy while substantially increasing the parliamentary dimension of this policy, within which the European Parliament would be able to fulfil its honourable mission.
(PT) The European Union's role in the world is now absolutely vital if we are to achieve certain balances which are essential to the pursuit of global peace and justice.
The logic of associating with some countries through bilateral agreements in particular must therefore not undermine the development of a multilateral approach that a global vision requires of us.
The undeniable influence of universal human rights and the guarantee of fundamental freedoms in the EU's relations with the world must underpin any dialogue with any partner in the world, especially in connection with the Mediterranean region.
Because of this region's geographic proximity to Europe, its age-old affinity, its cultural diversity and its constant political instability, the EU must act very firmly to ensure those fundamental principles.
I therefore congratulate the rapporteurs for the importance they attach to this in their report on the European Neighbourhood Policy.
The proposal tabled by President Sarkozy, meanwhile, on the Mediterranean Union is completely out of context.
Although it is extremely useful because it revitalises the debate on the Mediterranean, it proposes on the one hand to dismantle the current partnership while, on the other, it disowns the EU's fundamental principles regarding the supremacy of universal human rights and fundamental freedoms in particular, considering them to be secondary issues according to a case-by-case pragmatism that would foster a multi-speed relationship.
It is not our role to foster the slow-down our partners take refuge in, or to foster divisions.
We must promote development and progress, especially in terms of rights, while always guaranteeing that we use our investments to provide opportunities for growth and economic development as a whole for the entire region.
Guaranteeing completion of the free trade area in the region in 2010, among all its peers, is therefore an achievable objective, but we must never abandon our respect for humanist and democratic values and rights.
(RO) I appreciate Mr. Tannock's report.
We need neighbours that meet the European Union standards, no matter if and when they become members of the European Union.
For this reason, I believe the Neighbourhood Policy should become proactive, namely we should not only monitor the development of the situation, but also support the given countries in their efforts to meet the required standards.
Regarding the situation in Georgia, President SaakaÅvili's decisions to organize early presidential elections, a referendum for establishing parliamentary elections and to lift the state of emergency are salutary.
All these actions will contribute to the restoration of a democratic climate favourable to resuming debates and negotiations for the viable settlement of the sensitive situation in Georgia.
I support the idea of the need to reinstate the mechanisms of the rule of law, freedom of expression and freedom of the media.
I ask all the political forces in Georgia to cooperate in order to draw up a law regulating audio-visual activity, which would prevent situations like the recent one.
The party now governing is the one that, beginning with 2003, has initiated and supported a coherent system of reforms in key fields that, in their turn, have generated visible economic development, propelling Georgia towards a functional market economy and an authentic democracy.
Under the same government, the creation of mechanisms for more efficiently actually implementing the action plan with the European Union has been supported and the evolution towards a European direction has been intensified.
At the same time, Georgia has become a strategic partner in the neighbourhood policy, which is indispensable for solving the frozen conflicts in the region, a good mediator, an important partner within regional cooperation and a strategic ally in energy cooperation projects and transport.
The claims and attitude of the opposition should be taken into consideration, but evaluated in the context of the entire political and economic situation, both internally and in the region.
I believe we should carefully watch what happens in the conflict areas in Georgia, as well as the attitude of the Russian Federation, especially in the context of the near deadline for making a decision on Kosovo's status.
(FR) Mr President, I intend to speak specifically about the Mediterranean region which, as the rapporteurs have reminded us - and I thank them for doing so - is very important to Europe in foreign-policy terms.
It is my support for substantial European commitment in the Mediterranean region that prompts me to warn against the risks of diluting Europe's Mediterranean policy within its overall neighbourhood policy.
We do not want to see rivalry developing between eastern European countries and our southern neighbours.
The ENP should bilaterally complement the multilateral Barcelona Process, which, I would remind you, has been the framework of reference for structuring relations in the Mediterranean region since 1995.
That being so, neither the ENP nor any other project directed at the Mediterranean countries should be allowed to obscure or replace the Barcelona objectives, based on the three pillars of partnership in political, economic and social development, which are the only way of promoting effective regional integration.
I therefore need to highlight two points.
First, we must maintain a balance in apportioning funding between the eastern European and the Mediterranean countries.
Our ability to sustain a strong and ambitious European policy for the Mediterranean region depends on getting that balance right.
Secondly, with regard to the projected Euro-Mediterranean Free Trade Area - the subject of my report to the House earlier this year - I would emphasise the importance of a coordinated and gradual approach, enabling the countries concerned to cope with the pace and intensity of an open trading system, while taking account of their own specificities and particularly the fragility of some sectors of their economy.
Trade that serves the cause of development must remain our aim.
In conclusion, I should like to see these aspects addressed in the report because they are necessary to the definition of a clear Mediterranean policy based on a strategic long-term vision of development and stabilisation in this region.
- (EL) Mr President, let me congratulate the rapporteurs on their thorough examination of the topic.
However, I must point out that if one of our basic aims is to create an area of peace, we must pay attention to the political future of the countries in question.
Let me cite Egypt as an example.
Do any of us know what will happen in the post-Mubarak era?
I fear not.
Do we not realise that sooner or later Egypt will be taken over by the Muslim Brotherhood, a large Islamic extremist organisation?
We must therefore understand that all our planning in the area will be undermined by such a situation.
I do not want to repeat here, yet again, the proposal I made last year in the previous debate on the report.
I suggested the creation of a commonwealth among these countries in order to strengthen relations in the political neighbourhood.
Allow me to end by pointing out that the European political neighbourhood was promoted in tandem with the accession of the Ten, with the aim of mitigating the formation of new lines of division with neighbouring countries.
For this reason, the European political neighbourhood must remain unified, geographically cohesive and balanced between its eastern and southern parts.
In addition, since the countries making up the European political neighbourhood display political, economic and even cultural differences, the principle of diversity is as ever crucially important, but it must not be used to widen the gaps between these countries.
Mr President, Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner was right at the beginning that the ENP should stimulate democratic reform.
The Georgian Government has to fully restore the normal democratic process in the country and strictly abide by the principles of the rule of law in all its actions.
In particular, we should express our concerns about the serious violations of the right to free expression and access to information.
What is needed in this situation is resuming the political dialogue and finding a compromise in the interests of the people and democracy in the country.
I am particularly alarmed by the violence exerted by the police force against peaceful demonstrators.
The events of these last days show failure on the part of the government to bear criticism.
The excuse of the alleged plot of a coup d'Ã©tat, implying some Russian influence, is highly controversial to say the least.
Moreover, it is clear that any successful opposition challenger, whom at this moment we do not see on the political scene, is highly unlikely to be pro-Russian.
We welcome President Saakashvili's decision to call early presidential elections.
Today's news that the state of emergency will be lifted is also a positive sign.
From now on, we expect that all the necessary conditions for free and fair elections will be met.
One of these conditions is the freedom of expression, and this means that all media that have been forcibly closed down during the recent developments, like Imedi TV, and Kafkasya TV, should resume their normal activities.
We should be very clear on that.
I believe that President Saakashvili will be bold enough to reverse the negative trends established over the last weeks.
After his election he started a good reform policy in Georgia, which has to be supported.
I also firmly believe that the democratic development of the country should be closely monitored and supported by the European Parliament.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, because of the time I will be very brief, though that is in my favour since I will be present at question time.
This has been a long and intense debate, which I think has covered every essential aspect of the neighbourhood policy.
I also believe that broad consensus has been reached on fundamental issues such as the need for the neighbourhood policy to be a comprehensive and inclusive policy geared towards the North but also towards the East and the South.
It must also take the specific characteristics of the countries to which it is addressed into account.
We must of course take our partners' specific characteristics and needs into account, just as we must also use the necessary instruments in line with those needs and specific characteristics.
The European Neighbourhood Policy has a single objective which is valid for all the partners, which is to establish a partnership leading them towards economic and social progress and towards strengthening the rule of law and their democracies.
I have to say, however, that in this and other forums I sometimes hear the reflection or indeed suggestion and advice that we should possibly increase the resources and possibly increase the instruments.
These are generous ideas that I understand, but we must also be aware that increasing the instruments or increasing the funding, i.e. the resources, very often simply does not work because our partner countries' absorption capacity is limited.
We would obviously like to see an increase in resources too, but the truth is, as I have said, that our partners' absorption capacity is very often limited, so giving them more financial resources will not make the programmes more effective or the results quicker or more visible.
I believe the Commission has made the right choice of areas in which partnerships should be established with the countries which are in these associations with us.
The Commission acts in a broad variety of areas, including administrative capacity building, reinforcement of the judicial system and the provision of support for civil society organisations and for education and training - a whole gamut of areas are covered by this neighbourhood policy.
As I have said, the single and most important objective is obviously for these partners to be able to experience a development which is also in the European Union's interests.
The Council will naturally continue to monitor closely the proposals the Commission submits for its approval in connection with the European Neighbourhood Policy, and is naturally also always prepared to discuss and debate ideas, suggestions and proposals with this Parliament.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I will also try to be as brief as I can.
I will just say that I think it was a very fruitful debate and I wish again to thank the two rapporteurs.
It was really clear that a great number of Members wanted to speak in this very important discussion.
I shall make just a few points in response to some questions.
Firstly, it is true that Mauritania is now a partner country in the Euromed process, but it is not a Neighbourhood Policy country.
I just wanted to make this clarification; the funds for Mauritania will still come under the ACP heading.
On my second point, I wish to be very clear.
There was criticism from some Members that human rights, democracy and the rule of law were not our major objectives.
On the contrary.
If you look at any of the action plans, one of the major parts is always a basis for developing as much as possible human rights, democracy and the rule of law.
But, of course, it takes time and we are working particularly with those countries on the question of the judiciary and the justice system, which is, of course, a basis for making differences on the ground.
Then one of the Members of the Independence/Democracy Group said that he did not want to have more migration.
I want to tell him that visa facilitation always goes hand-in-hand with readmission agreements, so we are trying to combat illegal immigration, but we also want to try to facilitate people-to-people contact and sometimes apply some ideas for legal immigration, which is also necessary for many of our countries because of the ageing population.
Fourthly, on frozen conflicts, of course the Neighbourhood Policy alone cannot solve all frozen conflicts.
