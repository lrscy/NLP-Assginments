Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner Byrne, MrsÂ Oomen-Ruijten mentioned before me that one in four Europeans die every year of cancer, that is almost one million people: alarming figures that mean that we have to be ambitious regarding prevention.
What we have before us today is a recommendation.
Of course, we know its limits, but this cannot stop us from being ambitious, I have said it and clearly too.
This, I believe, is what we are endeavouring to do in the committee and I would like to stress briefly the main points that were improved on the original text.
First of all, lowering the recommended age for mammography screening for breast cancer from 50 to 40, was, I would say, obvious in light of the statistics on prevalence and current practice in several Member States.
Then, combining the cervical smear (pap test) with the HPV test to detect cervical cancer. This is a crucial addition since human papilloma virus kills 12Â 800 women every year in Europe.
Figures published by experts show that the introduction of the HPV test would help to reduce this number of deaths by at least a third.
Allow me, in passing, to commend the Czech Republic because this accession State is the only State in Europe that currently reimburses for this test.
Thirdly, and we are now moving on to the male population, the introduction of screening for prostate cancer with the PSA test.
This is also a matter of urgency: prostate cancer is the most common type of cancer in men and the second cause of death after lung cancer.
It can be permanently cured if it remains localised in the prostate.
This blood test is very simple, routine and should be recommended from the age of 50 years in our text.
I would also just like to say how important it is that everyone, including the less well informed, has access to screening, which is why I wanted to recommend mobile screening campaigns here.
It is also in this same general mindset of informing the public that I would like to conclude by stressing, over and above the precise recommendation and before screening, the importance of primary prevention when talking about cancer.
Health education, diet, the fight against smoking, sport, moderate exposure to the sun, like many measures at national level and behaviour at an individual level, will enable us to prevent these avoidable cancers from developing.
Â Â  MrÂ President, if there is one certainty about cancer it is that early diagnosis increases the chances of cure.
Screening is therefore vital, in particular for people exposed to mutagenic or carcinogenic substances.
Equality of access to screening programmes also needs to be guaranteed for all.
To this end, awareness campaigns, which seek to inform the public, are imperative.
The Mussa report recalls these basic principles, and we will definitely vote in favour of this text.
The report also proposes to create cancer registers to target, in the first instance, population groups that show a high incidence due to environmental factors or those linked to dietary habits.
This route is fundamental, because we need to go further.
Screening, which is certainly essential, is in fact only a secondary prevention measure.
We need to act beforehand, to assess the influence of factors such as nutrition, environment, and life style, and to try to reduce their importance.
That is real prevention: eliminating the causes or the circumstance propitious to the disease rather than trying too late to cure them.
I am extremely concerned by the latest statistics that show that lung cancer linked to smoking has spread, in particular in women, and also cancers of the breast, uterus or prostate, that are directly linked to the influence of hormones.
We need to bring to the fore the determining factors in the development of these cancers: endocrinal disturbances, dietary hormones or others.
In the same way, the increase in prostate cancer in certain groups of farmers is directly linked to the use of pesticides.
In addition, it has been proven that pollution, electro magnetic waves or other chemical factors increase the risk of some cancers.
Just remember the problem linked to asbestos and the 70 years it took to manage to ban it; only now are our hospitals seeing the full consequences of it.
We need to tackle these problems at the roots and extend public health policies to other areas if we really want to fight cancer in Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, cures for cancer are still being sought, but year by year we see progress.
The formerly unmentionable disease has, to some extent, overcome the stigma, not least because of advances in medical science, giving hope to patients and families.
These depend on early diagnosis, which comes from screening.
The extension of screening needs, as Mr Mussa said, to be based on science.
I and my colleagues very much welcome his report.
There are so many questions about cancer.
Concerning breast cancer, screening is well advanced.
We must look at how we can extend that to other age groups.
We must investigate how we can persuade more men to be aware that breast cancer is a matter for men as well as women and come forward to be screened as well.
Bowel cancer is a new area for screening, with new tests available.
Again, the issue will be how we can educate people â especially men â to come forward to be screened.
For cervical cancer, the pap smear has proved its worth.
Now we need the HPV alongside it.
I very much support Mr Mussa's amendments in this regard.
Lung cancer is the most deadly.
Worldwide, 1.3 million people have lung cancer; 80% of these people die within a year of diagnosis.
We need more PET scanners.
We only have five in the United Kingdom.
I understand that there are 60 in Germany and 150 in the United States.
We need to highlight these disparities.
For prostate cancer, there is screening and the PSA test.
There is a demand for these, as we have heard.
We should do these tests if and when the evaluation shows its worth.
We need the cancer networks.
We need the information campaigns highlighted in the amendments that Mrs Oomen-Ruijten and I have tabled.
Screening means diagnosis.
Diagnosis means lives saved.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, you have already said that one in four European citizens, approximately one million a year, will die of cancer, one of the main causes of death in the European Union.
Your proposal to the Council on cancer screening was supported and backed by the representatives of all the political groups in the European Parliament.
The rapporteur said that younger and younger people are suffering from various new forms of tumours.
Information for and health education of citizens on the prevention and timely detection of symptoms which give danger signals, together with reliable screening, have brought about positive results, such as, for example, with breast cancer, which affects a large percentage of women of reproductive age.
Even with those new forms of tumours which cannot be completely cured, a greater chance of survival and better quality of life are now assured.
I thought it advisable to strengthen the Commission proposal with amendments intended to give citizens equal access to screening, treatment and monitoring services, based always on best practices.
Similarly, the need for counselling for those who ultimately contract cancer is proving to be a basic parameter in the final outcome of the disease.
Even saying the word 'cancer' is avoided in numerous countries.
Citizens react with fear and panic to anything to do with cancer.
We can change fear into productive awareness and care.
Only thus will we limit deaths and illness while, at the same time, having a positive effect on all the other social repercussions.
To close, allow me to congratulate the rapporteur on his essential interventions in the original proposal.
Â Â  Mr President, while I appreciate the Commission's proposals are an attempt to find best standards and establish common best standards across Europe, that will have to be done on the basis of Member States agreeing to cooperate in this area.
It will require political commitment in many countries going far beyond the current commitment in terms of political will and financial investment in cancer testing and treatment.
Reports have shown that up to 90% of the people diagnosed with breast cancer can be cured if they are diagnosed early enough.
It has been established that up to 100% of cervical cancers can be cured and prevented if proper testing is carried out in the correct age group along with FPV testing.
Clearly this is an area where huge progress can be made in preventing mortality and also a lot of pain and suffering for the individuals concerned and for their families.
It is important to have this debate.
I just want to give some statistics on the Irish situation specifically, not because I want to criticise the Irish Government but because, if we are to get cooperation across the board in this area, it is necessary to show how bad the situation is in some countries.
For instance, less than 4 000 of the 12 000 patients who require radiotherapy in the Republic of Ireland each year receive it.
Public patients face a three-month delay for radiation treatment they have been told is both necessary and urgent.
The first five-year analysis of cancer trends in the Irish National Cancer Registry, published in February 2002, showed that 50% of patients with lung cancer received no cancer-specific treatment; 7% of those with leukaemia were not offered chemotherapy; two-thirds of patients in the Republic with last-stage stomach cancer received no cancer-specific treatment.
Regional variations and the availability of radiotherapy have a particular impact on poorer patients, since many cancer sufferers have to travel long distances and stay away from home for long periods.
The Republic's two radiotherapy units are based in Dublin and Cork, so, while 39% of patients nationally have radiotherapy for breast cancer, only 24% living in the west of Ireland have it.
Unfortunately things are not getting any better, because funding for those services has been cut.
That is the kind of situation we are faced with.
I appeal to the House to support the report before us and for the Commissioner to make it clear to all Member States where these appalling statistics apply that they must get to grips with this issue and save lives.
Â Â  . â First, I should like to thank the rapporteur and the Members of this House for their comments on this report.
I can reassure you that cancer prevention still figures very high on my agenda.
As some Members have rightly stated to me in writing, after 15 years of continuous European Community efforts and involvement, this represents a significant and visible success for the Community in an important area of disease prevention and health promotion for European citizens.
Work on cancer, including screening and surveillance, will be taken forward by the Commission.
The cancer screening recommendation will be taken forward by Member States' authorities and the Commission, once it is adopted by the Council.
Funding will be through ongoing projects within the previous 'Europe Against Cancer' programme and through the new public health programme.
For 2003, a number of cancer-related projects have been identified for funding.
Under the current contracts, a fourth edition of the European guidelines for quality assurance in mammography screening and the first comprehensive edition of European guidelines for best practice in cervical cancer screening will be finalised in 2004.
The Commission has already enhanced the prevention of diseases, including cancer, in the new health programmes draft work programme for 2004.
The draft specifically provides for a reference to cancer under the first and third strand objectives.
This will enable cancer surveillance applications to be fully considered.
Project proposals on the status of best practice in the Member States, as well as in acceding countries, would also be covered.
In the light of the views expressed today, the Commission intends to review the situation of cancer prevention even further with regard to the public health programmes work programme of 2004.
We will then have to decide how to best underpin the Commission's role in cancer prevention, while implementing the Council recommendation on cancer screening.
As the matter is especially important for acceding countries too, we are considering a meeting between experts from these countries and cancer screening experts, in order to ensure that the achievements of the cancer networks benefit the new Member States as well.
The points raised in the report and during the debate today have demonstrated clearly the importance of the issue.
In the report of the Committee on Environment, Health and Consumer Protection, 33 amendments are proposed.
A further amendment was tabled for the plenary session.
The Commission can in principle support 11 amendments, namely Amendments 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 10, 11, 14, 15, 19, and 22.
In addition, we partially support four amendments, Amendments 1, 29, 30 and 32.
In addition to general improvements in the wording of the text, the acceptable amendments concern, for example, improving compliance and equal access for European citizens, as well as enhancing the role of the Commission in following up the implementation of the Council recommendation.
The Commission cannot, however, support the remaining 19 amendments.
Amendment 25 cannot be supported, as all rules and regulations on data protection in the Member States must be in accordance with Directive 95/46/EC.
Exceptions, for instance for medical registries, must be in accordance with Article 8 of the directive.
Thus the amendment would simply reiterate the 'acquis communitaire'.
In addition, Amendments 5, 13 and 34 cannot be supported.
They refer to tests that have not been successfully evaluated in randomised controlled trials.
Finally, Amendment 33 cannot be accepted.
Even though it makes the necessary distinction between evidence-based tests and new tests currently under evaluation or new variations of recommended tests, these new tests are already sufficiently covered by Articles 6(c) and (d).
To mention a few specific ones would immediately raise the question as to why only those tests have been singled out.
Â Â  â Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Â Â  â The next item is the report (A5-0353/2003) by MrÂ Paasilinna, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation on Establishing the European Network and Information Security Agency (COM(2003) 63 â C5-0058/2003 â 2003/0032(COD)).
Â Â  . â Mr President, network and information security has become increasingly important, with growing use of the Internet and other information and communication technologies.
In todayâs society, much depends on networks and information systems.
Yet, in order to fully realise the advantages of the information society, people need to be able to trust the system.
It has become clear that we have to make a common effort to strengthen network and information security in Europe.
In 2001 the Commission presented a communication on a policy framework and in February 2003 a proposal to establish a European Network and Information Security Agency.
Now, nine months later, we are about to witness a first reading agreement on ENISA.
Let me take this opportunity to thank the rapporteur, MrÂ Paasilinna, for his thorough work, as well as the political groups which have helped to reach a satisfactory compromise with the Council.
It is very positive that there has been such a strong will to negotiate and to reach an agreement.
The European Parliament has contributed a lot to this process, as it has to the important telecom-related legislation over the past three years.
I am happy that Parliament has been able to overcome a number of difficult issues and to reach this compromise.
The compromise has to be confirmed today and tomorrow by this House, in order for the Telecom Council on 20 November 2003 to adopt a political agreement which would allow the Agency to start at the beginning of 2004.
That is what the European Council called for last spring.
I want to thank Parliament for the support it has given the Commission.
This support has enabled the Council to make concessions on the involvement of industry by introducing a permanent stakeholders' group.
Although not fully in line with what the Commission wanted in terms of composition and voting rules for the Management Board, the compromise proposal has made the management of the Agency considerably lighter and given the Executive Director the main management tasks.
The Commission has looked carefully at Parliament's compromise amendments and can accept them.
The present text from Parliament has clarified the objectives and tasks of the Agency.
It will be a learning process to transpose the tasks into a more operational set of actions, but I am happy to see that there is wide agreement on the general lines of what the Agency should do.
As for the composition of the Management Board and its voting rules, the Commission would have preferred a reduced composition, together with an extension of the simple majority voting rules.
We consider that the extended management board with two-thirds majority voting rules is a potential obstacle to the smooth functioning of agencies.
In this specific case the Commission has, however, decided to accept a deviation from the proposed framework for regulatory agencies of December 2002, although that should not be considered as a precedent for future agencies.
This Agency will operate in the sensitive field of security and it urgently needs to be put in place now.
I hope Member States will do their best to participate in the Management Board in order to make the Agency work successfully.
This Agency is a major step forward for Europe or at least for eEurope.
Member States have shown a willingness to cooperate actively on this issue in order to strengthen the internal market and to help the European citizens, businesses and administrations make full use of the networks and information systems.
This will be a signal both to stakeholders in Europe and to countries outside the Union that we take the issues of network and information security seriously and that Member States and the Commission, with the support of this House, are ready to act.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, the Presidency is aware that communications networks should be seen as key, vital infrastructure in modern economies and, as such, should be protected: their protection and their security is a matter of public interest.
Personally, as MrÂ Gasparriâs representativeÂ âÂ who has, I am sorry to say, been detained in Italy today due to the grave tragedy that has struck our country, and is involved in paying our last respects to the soldiers killed in IraqÂ âÂ I would like to confirm the Presidencyâs past and ongoing commitment to the issue of security of networks and information.
The European institutions have, moreover, shown that they are aware of the urgent need for joint action that will enable the Agency to actually be operational from the beginning of 2004, as the Heads of State or Government recommended to the Spring 2003 European Council.
The Internet and communications technologies are certainly the innovations that have most characterised our society in recent years and that have influenced how the overwhelming majority of human activities are carried out.
However, over and above the obvious advantages, these technologies have introduced a series of problems into our society that are linked to the poor reliability of the instruments used.
Security requirements have changed rapidly over the past 20 years, in line with the development of networks and computers, which are ever more omnipresent in public and private life.
Broadband connections give the user the possibility of having a permanent connection to the Internet; new wireless applications allow access in practically any place and the possibility of connecting almost anything to the networkÂ âÂ from personal computers to household appliancesÂ âÂ continues and will continue to develop peopleâs use of the Internet.
Controlling security has become a difficult and complex task and the user is faced with problems of the availability, integrity, authenticity and the confidentiality of data and services on a daily basis.
The complexity of technology means that several components and elements have to interact and makes human behaviour a crucial factor.
Apart from being a source of malfunctions, computers and networks can, however, also be subjected to attacks on information systems.
Today, an attack on an information system can put entire nations in serious difficulty.
To reduce the likelihood of such an event, every country needs to take effective action to improve the security of its ICT infrastructure; given the cross-border dimension of the problem, however, structures need to be defined in which national experiences can be gathered together and become common heritage.
The experience of recent years has taught us that sharing experiences and information, and, more generally, international cooperation, are the most efficient weapons for creating a mentality of security in the information society.
During its term in office, the Presidency has, therefore, made every effort to try to address this issue.
The proposal for a regulation that Parliament is looking at today is the result of greater agreement, by the institutions, on the need for a joint approach at European level regarding security of information.
A convergence of positions was arrived at following an increase in concern from both the public and the private sectors regarding crime and even phenomena that are only potentially dangerous linked to the new technologies.
The more communications networks become features that are essential and central to the functioning of our modern markets, the greater the endeavours we will have to make to ensure and create a secure, protected environment for those operating at the different levels.
One of the Agencyâs objectives is to create a joint committee in Europe for issues relating to information security, which is necessary to guarantee the availability and security of networks and information systems in the Union.
From this point of view, the Presidency upholds the importance of creating a new culture of security, in which such a concept is not just taken to mean a cost for operators to bear, but as a real and genuine opportunity for market development, also to be achieved by boosting consumer confidence.
The Agency should be able to facilitate the enforcement of Community measures on security of networks and information.
The assistance provided by the Agency will help to implement Community legislation in this area, thus contributing to the smooth functioning of the internal market.
This will strengthen the ability of the Community and of the Member States to react to problems of security of networks and of information systems, as well as to the development of the information society in general.
The actual model proposed by the Agency is innovative.
In fact, it is based on the knowledge that measures in the area of security of networks can only be tackled in close cooperation with all actors in the world of communications: with market operators and with users of communications services.
Our institutions have the opportunity to render an essential service to the public and to the European agencies by creating this Agency, for the consensus we hope for at first reading is possible, which is an indication of a great sense of responsibility and of deep understanding of the sensitive nature of this matter.
The negotiations were laborious and complex, but the positions of the Council and Parliament were gradually reconciled, evidenceÂ âÂ and I repeatÂ âÂ of a great sense of responsibility.
I hope, therefore, that, in a few days, we will be able to celebrate the adoption of this regulation.
To conclude, I want to thank CommissionerÂ Liikanen, the rapporteur, MrÂ Paasilinna, and MrÂ van Velzen, MrsÂ Mann and MrsÂ Plooij-van Gorsel, as well as, of course, all the other members of the committee.
Â Â  . â Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the security of information systems is a major concern of today and a subject of discussion in modern and vulnerable societies.
Power supply networks, water supply and sewage, traffic control, hospitals â everything can be thrown into chaos any time, any place.
The Bastel virus this autumn was perhaps the first where business lay behind the destruction it caused.
The hackers or crackers used it to aid a shady business, chiefly pornography, one presumes.
Stealing sensitive information on ordinary people is also obviously a crime, when you think about it.
Various sorts of violation of peopleâs privacy can happen on an absolutely massive scale.
This sort of thing has to be tackled.
Its lack of security is becoming more and more a barrier to the development of the networked society.
Last year 75% of European companies had no information security strategy.
Less than 2% of investment in information technology is put into information security.
In two companies out of every three information security is as yet not considered a strategic issue.
The Data Protection Act should have entered into force in the Member States in October.
Under this law unsolicited email cannot be sent without the specific consent of the receiver.
Spam accounts for more than half of all email, and, for many, more than 90%, as is the case too with many of us in this House.
The credibility and reliability of email are now being wrecked.
We voted on this subject in this House last year.
At the time almost half did not regard spam as a problem.
They opposed this idea of getting someoneâs permission first.
Now that will not be enough either.
Now the operators will also have to clean up content.
That will result in problems for the freedom of personal communication. Security clearance is very much on the increase as our lives become more and more involved in networks and communications.
With broadband we are on line the whole time.
The wireless Internet will be the obvious hunting ground of the troublemaker.
It will be a nuisance for all: private individuals, companies and society.
The problem over security is made worse by the fact that in a complex environment many components and partial systems have to function together.
The human factor is also a risk.
Information security thus affects everyone everywhere.
Information security is a political question, and that is why we have to resolve it.
That is why, moreover, we are in an exceptional hurry here to create this agency for Europe, the European Network and Information Security Agency.
Without security the Lisbon objectives will not be implemented.
Information insecurity would lead us into an age of piracy.
Three types of measure are in progress.
We have enacted laws relating to electronic communications and data protection.
The Commission is drafting principles for judging and sentencing cybercrime and looking at ways of improving information security, and one of these ways is ENISA.
I want to thank my colleagues, the Council and the Commission for their excellent levels of cooperation.
It shows how we have now understood what this situation means.
ENISA will be a centre of excellence that coordinates, analyses and gives advice.
It will work very closely with the public and private sector.
The Agency will promote the development of risk assessment and risk management methods.
International cooperation will be indispensable.
The Agency must be located somewhere where there are already viable top information technology communications systems, including wireless.
The worldâs top operations centres must be located there and we must be able to find Europeâs most highly skilled people there easily.
As rapporteur I have worked in favour of a compromise, which is that the Management Board should have representation from all Member States.
At the same time it will not get involved in day-to-day work, which will be the domain of the Executive Director, the staff, the Advisory Board and the working groups.
There is no doubt that a large Management Board will be a necessary forum of cooperation and a factor in creating direction.
Voting rules are slightly problematic.
We can return to them in a few yearsâ time.
The Agency will work for the benefit of the Member States, where levels of information security vary considerably.
The role of companies in our compromise is a strong one, thanks to MrÂ van Velzen, because they of course possess most of the networks and expertise.
I also wish to thank Mrs Mann, who has also keenly promoted this move.
The compromise package has been adopted by the committee, the Council and the Commission.
I expect that we will recognise our responsibilities and vote in its favour tomorrow.
It will lead to better security, to employment and to greater development.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, it looks as if, on 1Â January 2004, we are going to be given a European Network and Information Security Agency.
I welcome that.
The agency is an important factor in securing the networks and the information society.
We must hope that, on this occasion, the ends justify the means because there are, unfortunately, a number of things to complain about in the outcome.
The fact that Parliament and the Council have reached an agreement in the course of the first reading entails, in this case, losses for both Parliament and the industry.
The agencyâs management board has become too large, with a representative for each Member State, and the industry has had to give way, together with other areas of civil society.
My amendment, which was aimed at bringing about transparency in the application and appointment procedure, will no doubt acquire significance in the longer term.
The Committee on Citizensâ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs was united in supporting it, but it disappeared in the course of discussion through an administrative mistake by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy.
In other words, the Councilâs wheeling and dealingwith authorities that infringe legislation, and vice versa, continues without any democratic scrutiny.
I have a couple of messages for the Commission and the Council prior to the jointdeclarationthat is now to be drawn up.
Guarantee long-term transparency in the application procedure.
Exploit and develop the EUâs cooperation with the United States and other third countries.
Ensure that network security is achieved in accordance with the common guidelines that have already been approved in a Council resolution and that have been signed by ten of the Member States, together with six other countries.
Develop the EU guidelines around what individual Member States are already applying.
Last week, a delegation from Parliament visited Washington and experienced on the spot what should become our future style.
An EU singing from the same hymn sheet should facilitate our foreign relations, especially with the United States.
Through this agency, we can now jointly develop data protection in all its different dimensions, and that is good.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, very many thanks to my fellow MEP MrÂ Paasilinna for his excellent, constructive cooperation.
In fact, we have not seen otherwise, as this has already occurred with a great many dossiers.
I should also like to say to the Italian Presidency that a very peculiar procedure has taken place.
I have never before seen the Council ready when Parliament has yet to make a start.
We have had to do an enormous amount of work together in order to succeed, and, thanks to the tremendous efforts of the Italian Presidency, we have indeed achieved that compromise.
This situation must not be repeated on any account, but we must all learn from it.
The importance of the Agency is clear.
The Commissioner has just pointed it out.
Mr Paasilinna cited some data, and I shall not reiterate it.
I should, however, like to draw attention to the article in last weekâs with the headline: âBlackmail by internet as gangs target sitesâ.
What was it about?
Ordinary extortion demands are made, then you have to pay a certain amount and you will be left alone.
So this is where we have got to.
We are talking about damage to industry running into millions.
Very often, physical infrastructure, too, is targeted.
We always think that it is financial institutions that are involved, but top of the attacks list are the electricity networks.
As an Italian, you know what it means when a light goes out.
A huge number of attacks have been committed on the physical infrastructure.
I am very pleased, therefore, that there is now clarity as regards the location of the Agency.
It is now ultimately a case of helping the Commission and the Member States with a colossal mobilisation of industry.
Fortunately, the Agency has also been given an executive role.
It is obvious that industry, too, must play a part as far as possible.
When all is said and done, Member States do not have ownership of security.
Much has already been said about the Management Board, and also about the voting rights.
Privately, I still cannot explain why two-thirds of votes should be needed.
We still have not solved this mystery surrounding the Council.
I am extremely pleased that prevention has become one of the tasks.
After all, how can you talk about security without mentioning prevention?
On the subject of transparency, I should like to ask the Italian Presidency â and I do expect an answer to this â whether you are now prepared to let the Member States that put themselves forward for the Agency do that out in the open, so that everyone knows which country the Agency wants.
Will you not let that take place behind closed doors in the Council?
I challenge you to provide that transparency.
My conclusion is that this is a first step: no more and no less.
In practice, it will turn out to be inadequate and badly in need of revision.
It is very important, however, that the Agency is put in place, and therefore my group gives its unqualified support to this Agency and to the amendments.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council, I too would like to begin by congratulating MrÂ Paasilinna.
I believe we have achieved a good compromise.
In the many speeches that we have already heard, it has been described as a compromise, but as one that will indeed bring us, in the coming year, a European agency to deal with security issues throughout the Internet and its infrastructure.
I believe that it was on this basis that we then all decided to simply try and reach a compromise that would take us through the first five years, although we were always aware that, after those five years, we would make a real attempt at creating genuine European structures and doing away with the problems that will now be inherent in the Agency.
These have to do with voting rights, but also with the issue raised by the Member States, which will now, in fact, be represented by one person each.
I nonetheless believe that, faced with the challenges in this area, each and every one of us will really try to determine what this agencyâs tasks are.
I have confidence in the promises made by the Italian presidency of the Council, and I think it will remember them even after five years.
I hope that we will then all work towards making an early start on the audit that we have planned for â as early as after three years, if my memory serves me correctly â so that we can then make a start on rethinking the structures and defining the tasks more precisely.
It is with reference to that, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that I would like to put a question to you.
Will you actually be coming back to the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy to discuss these tasks with its members as soon as you know how they are to be catalogued in collaboration with the Member States?
The fact is that I suspect that this is not just about issues of security in the infrastructures â Members have already mentioned data security â but also about many other aspects that are equally affected, and initiating another wide-ranging discussion of these issues could be very interesting.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, and also the rapporteur, who has done an excellent job, I am happy that a compromise has been reached, although the Councilâs position did surprise me.
The Council cut the Commission proposal down to the bone and initially tried everything possible to prevent the efficient functioning of this Agency.
A start has been made, however.
Nothing now stands in the way of the creation of a European agency, and I hope that the Council does not impose another blockade on the issue of finding the right seat for the Agency.
It is important that initiatives developed by Member States and businesses with regard to network security are well coordinated at European level.
After all, it is cross-border problems that are at issue here, and the jurisdiction of the Member States stops at the border.
In addition, I am pleased that a role, if only an advisory role, is being reserved for industry in the composition and functioning of the Agency.
After all, industry is the most important player regarding ownership and operation of networks, and we lay down the rules that determine that industry has to guarantee the functioning of the network.
We must then also fill in the specific details.
It is also important that, with this Agency, a body is established that can negotiate with other international players.
In that way, the Agency can contribute to maintaining a healthy transatlantic relationship, which is essential in the sphere of security in general and network security in particular.
It is incomprehensible to the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party why the Council remains committed to a two-thirds majority of votes as the basis for decisions by the Management Board on, among other things, the work programme and the appointment of the Director.
This does make it very difficult to take proper decisions efficiently.
Efficiency â what efficiency?
In any case, it is good that a compromise has finally been reached, and so the ELDR Group will support the report by MrÂ Paasilinna.
Â Â  Mr President, it is a pleasure to be speaking here tonight with many colleagues who have worked on this report.
I am here on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, which strongly supported Mr Paasilinna in its opinion, and I would like to thank him as rapporteur and my colleague Mrs McCarthy, who was the draftsman for the opinion that I also worked on.
From the perspective of those of us who work in the field of the internal market, it is important to emphasise that this is one of the reasons cited in particular for setting up the Information Security Agency.
It is becoming increasingly apparent that questions about the security of computer networks and confidence in them are very much in the minds of the people we want to encourage to take up electronic commerce and enjoy all the benefits of the broadband infrastructure, whether accessing commercial or public services.
Therefore this new centre of excellence to significantly step up cooperation between Member States in this area is of vital importance.
It is essential for the competitiveness of the European economy and for the development of the information society â something that I know you, Commissioner, are very keen on â that we should start to pool our resources and address these crucial issues.
It is a tribute to my colleagues who have worked with the Italian presidency and with the Commission that we have managed to get an agreement.
Speed is of the essence.
However, we must not allow speed to compromise the search for excellence.
I know you, Commissioner, will be looking for the best possible people and the best possible operating structures to put in place so that this agency really can contribute its expertise as soon as possible.
Because it is a best-practice agency â and this is something we particularly emphasised in our report â it has to adopt the best possible practice in its own security and the way it operates its own systems, to set an example to everybody else.
I am sure that all of us look forward very much to working with the new agency and seeing it contribute to the undoubted success of information society measures that we have supported so consistently in this House.
Â Â  Mr President, I would also like to congratulate my colleague, Mr Paasilinna, on an excellent report.
The Internet, as we have heard, is no longer a new phenomenon.
Today, more than 90% of companies and 44% of households in the EU have an Internet connection and more than two-thirds of Europeans use a mobile phone.
Our everyday systems are controlled by computers and communication networks, from public transport systems to the water that comes out of our taps at home.
It is no surprise, then, that security in this area is a huge concern for our citizens and businesses.
I must admit that I have reservations about creating new agencies willy-nilly.
However, I have to say that I totally support the establishment of this one.
Nevertheless, I wish to make three points, which are also questions to the Commission.
Firstly, the issue of differing security standards.
Given that at present the 15 Member States are all at different stages of combating cybercrime, how does the Commission plan to tackle this obstacle and ensure effective implementation, especially once we become a Union of 25, when the real challenge will be to harmonise security standards across Europe?
Will the Agency have sufficient clout to ensure that Member States take the recommendations and advice of this Agency seriously?
Secondly, on the issue of cross-border cooperation, it is a fact that there is no systematic cross-border cooperation between the current Member States.
We know that security is a difficult and complex task, encompassing all sorts of issues like availability, integrity, authenticity and confidentiality of data and services.
How does the Commission intend to get public and private sectors and businesses and consumers to work together?
How does it intend to promote security in these areas?
Thirdly, security requirements are constantly evolving as networking in the community and computing develop further, electronic communications become more widespread and hackers become more adept at foiling security systems.
We need to ensure that we in Europe have the highest possible level of security.
How will the Commission ensure that this Agency does not fall behind new technologies and that it leaves no stone unturned in the fight against cybercrime?
Finally, I hope the setting up of this Agency will lead to some rationalisation within the Commission, because often when we set up agencies it also means some sort of streamlining within the Commission.
Â Â  . â First, in reply to Mrs Gill's remark on security standards, we have proposed the establishment of the network security agency so that common standards can be found.
Second, the participation of private sector businesses and others will be taken into account.
This is something that Parliament has long been pushing for.
Mr Paasilinna, Mr van Velzen, Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel and Mrs Mann all spoke very convincingly on that issue tonight in the presence of the Italian presidency, and we are very proud of that.
There seems to be a strong body of opinion in favour of what the Commission proposed earlier.
Keeping up with changing technology will always be a challenge for us.
The information society technologies programme, however, is one area where we can help: research programmes are ongoing in that field, and there is also the stakeholders' group.
I hope that the European Network and Information Security Agency will be a kind of 'hub of hubs' in this area, where the best knowledge can be exchanged.
Once again I should like to thank Mr Paasilinna, MrsÂ CederschiÃ¶ld, Mr van Velzen, Mrs Mann, Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, Mr Harbour and Mrs Gill.
I should like you, Mr President, to pass on a message to the Bureau that these people deserve a chance to have a debate on the information society during the daytime.
Since I have been in this House this has never happened before 9.30 p.m. at the earliest.
This gives the impression that 'future' issues are discussed in the evening and 'past' issues during the day.
Could this change, even just once, before the European elections?
I trust that you will pass on this modest wish.
With this team you could run any file in Europe, and they deserve to do this during the day from time to time.
I got a little emotional there but I should now comment on the amendments!
The Commission can accept all the compromise amendments as voted on 17 November 2003 in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy.
None of the other amendments can be accepted.
Â Â  â Your modest request, Commissioner, is not as dangerous as the one that was put forward by a famous author.
I will, therefore, certainly put this to the Conference of Presidents.
Here, Members applaud when they hear certain proposals put forward that are deemed appropriate.
They should not, however, turn to those presiding over the meetings but to the chairmen of their groups, because it is the group chairmen, at the Conference of Presidents meetings, who decide what time issues are debated.
Â Â  Mr President, I have put a very pertinent question to the Italian presidency.
Would you allow the Italian presidency to answer it?
Â Â  â I am quite aware that you put a question to the President-in-Office of the Council.
I was about to ask if he intends to answer or not.
Â Â  As regards the request that was put forward, I can only reply in the affirmative.
Indeed, there is clearly such a real need that we must certainly take on board this request for transparency.
Â Â  â The Members will hold you to that statement, which is very important.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking the European Parliament, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and, in particular, the rapporteur, MrÂ Blokland, for the work they have put into the first reading report.
Our proposal aims to ensure consistency in dealing with shipments of waste.
We need to ensure environmentally sound management in relation to both shipments within the Community and exports from the Community to third countries.
It is focused on implementing the 2001 OECD decision, pursuing international harmonisation, which means respecting the internationally agreed obligations in the Basel Convention, addressing problems encountered in the application of the regulation since its adoption ten years ago and enhancing the structure of the regulation.
In relation to shipments within the Community, I share the concerns expressed about standard dumping in waste for recovery.
The Commission proposal and the Communication on a thematic strategy on the prevention and recycling of waste clearly recognise the problem.
However, our response is a long-term solution at EU level, whose main elements are, firstly, the establishment of standards at EU level through the extension of the IPPC Directive and, secondly, the establishment of guidelines regarding sham or fake recovery and clearer distinctions between the different recovery and disposal operations.
In relation to exports from the Community to third countries, I support the amendments adopted by the Committee on the Environment to further sharpen the regulation by making reference to both EU legislation and certain internationally-agreed guidelines, in particular those on ship recycling.
Let me conclude this introduction by saying that it is important that we do not allow environmental standard dumping, either when we ship waste internally within the Community or when we export it from the Community to third countries.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, 15% of heavy goods vehicles on European roads are transporting waste.
The reason for this is the existence of differing market conditions.
Not all Member States have bans or taxes on the dumping of waste.
As a result, a great deal of waste is being transferred to other countries.
This runs counter to the principles of proximity and self-sufficiency that apply to waste disposal under the Waste Framework Directive.
Shipments of waste can only be refused if the waste cannot be recovered in the importing country.
A lengthy debate has arisen on the subject of when something can be considered to be recovery.
The problem in this whole debate is that waste recovery is not necessarily more sound in environmental terms.
Clear criteria for recovery must therefore be developed.
The European Commission acknowledges this problem by remarking, among other things, that there are few Community environmental requirements for waste recovery operations.
There is no prospect of a solution to this problem, however, unless the Commission makes proposals as part of the Thematic Strategy on Recycling.
It is currently the Court of Justice that determines what constitutes waste recovery, and this is unacceptable.
In addition, the amendment of the Waste Framework Directive has been far too long in coming.
We are not behaving responsibly towards the waste sector if we await the whole, protracted, process of amending the Waste Framework Directive.
Clarity is needed in the shorter term.
Since the problems arise primarily in connection with the shipment of waste, it is an obvious course of action to spell out these additional conditions in this Regulation.
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy is of the opinion that, until the European Commission formulates these conditions, the Member States should have the option of imposing their own conditions on waste recovery.
In addition, it is my view that it must be possible to refuse shipments of waste if a minimum percentage of recovery and a minimum calorific value are not observed.
A misunderstanding persists as to these grounds for refusal.
If there is the possibility of refusing a shipment of waste on environmental grounds, this does not imply that refusal is compulsory.
Some position papers incorrectly state that shipments of waste are banned.
ArticlesÂ 12 andÂ 13 of this Regulation are not talking about a ban, but about the fact that shipments of waste may be undertaken by mutual agreement.
The reuse of silver, even if it is less than one tenth of a per cent, shall thus remain possible.
Exports of waste should only be permitted if they lead to recovery or final disposal in the short term; and not, therefore, exports of waste that are destined for what is termed âinterim recoveryâ or âinterim disposalâ, as far as the Committee on the Environment is concerned.
In practice, a great deal goes wrong during the mixing, sorting and storing involved.
It can no longer be ascertained where the waste has gone and what has happened to it.
Waste that is well sorted and quantifiable, and is really recovered or disposed of in an environmentally sound way, can indeed be exported, therefore.
In line with this, the Committee on the Environment proposes a ban on the export of unsorted household waste.
After all, we do not transport our sewage to other countries.
My final point concerns the implementation of this Regulation.
We must not give in to those Member States that are failing to invest sufficiently in this.
For this reason, I do not support AmendmentsÂ 95 and 98 by the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, which introduce implied permission for the country of import.
Prior mutual written agreement is necessary for the purposes of transparency.
There are Member States that do not have their house in order at the moment.
They themselves admit that they cannot control shipments of waste.
In this regard, the Member States concerned must bring about change instead of complaining about the administrative burden.
In summary, price competition on the European waste market is acceptable, but eco-competition is not.
What the Committee on the Environment does not want is exports of waste that lead to an environmentally less sound alternative.
After all, this Regulation is not intended to facilitate trade in waste, but to enable environmentally sound waste management.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by saying that this is a good proposal from the Commission which furthermore is coherent in general terms.
I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur on this great work, although I do not agree with some of his points of view, because many of the amendments he has presented are aimed at restricting the free movement of waste.
And waste, whether we like it or not, represents goods and must be treated as such, even if we regulate the aspects which may affect the environment.
The transport of waste in itself is not an environmental problem.
The problem is rather the management of this waste, but this is an issue which does not fall within the scope of the present regulation.
The Committee on the Environment has approved the removal of Article 133 as the legal basis for the proposal, and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market is in favour of this change of legal basis.
However, the PPE-DE Group is opposed to the removal of the legal basis relating to commercial policy.
I would like therefore to expressly ask the Commissioner to give a clear opinion on this issue.
It is particularly important to establish clear rules for the transport of waste by ship and, in this regard, MrÂ Blokland has presented Amendment 92, which we support, because it resolves the problem of ships which are exported in order to be scrapped.
However, Amendments 37 and 44 eliminate the principle of Community self-sufficiency established in the framework directive on waste and establish a single principle of national self-sufficiency.
We are not going to support them because they are contrary to the provisions of the framework directive on waste itself.
With regard to the amendments which prohibit provisional recycling operations, we believe that they make no sense, particularly in cross-border regions within the European Union.
We take an identical view of the amendments which establish criteria to define what must be considered recycling.
The definition of these parameters is not the subject of this regulation and, if any of the amendments in this regard are approved, the PPE-DE Group will vote against the report.
We call on the Commission, however, to modify the annexes to the framework directive on waste in order to make it clear, once and for all, what recycling is, since we cannot continue to hide behind the judgment of the Court of Justice in accordance with which the Commission interprets its own Directives.
Judgments are not law, they are specific cases and, for the moment, all they are doing is contributing to a situation in which the agents involved in the management of waste are carrying out their activities in conditions of legal uncertainty.
Â Â  Mr President, I welcome the Commission's proposal and the amendments by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy to that proposal, which seeks to improve the existing regulations on the transport of waste, particularly the transnational transport of waste.
We recently had the problem of ships sailing from the United States to the UK for dismantling and recovery and when some of them arrived, it was discovered, as we had pointed out here in the European Parliament, that there were no facilities in the UK to do the work under European Union law.
They are now lying there during the winter, to be returned to the United States, creating a further risk to the environment.
I welcome the proposals in this report to tighten the definition of waste recovery, to encourage Member States to solve the household waste issue self-sufficiently.
I would draw attention to the fact that we in the Republic of Ireland have introduced a 15 cent surcharge on supermarket plastic bags, which has been enormously successful in dramatically reducing the number of plastic bags being issued by supermarkets.
This has had a significant impact on the amount of waste.
We still have a huge waste problem in Ireland.
There is huge resistance to incineration because of health fears, unreasonable in my view, but the fears are there.
We have to concentrate on reduction and I hope that this new proposal will help to take us in that direction.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate MrÂ Blokland on his sound, clear report.
After 28Â years, environmental dumping is still a major problem.
One reason for this is that environmental standards are not the same everywhere, the main reason for this being that there is great disagreement over what recovery actually entails.
There is a lack of clear criteria.
The European Commission has blundered here.
It should have taken the initiative in providing clarity many years ago.
Sadly, however, the Commission gave in to pressure from the waste industry, which prefers to continue to dump waste.
The Court of Justice of the European Communities in Luxembourg has now made a couple of rulings in this legal void, but these do not provide a definite answer either to the question as to what exactly constitutes recovery and what does not.
Incinerating everything is not recovery, in the opinion of my group.
Sadly, that is now the case â by definition.
Recovery implies a usefulness that is not present in the incineration of newspapers; recycling paper is much more useful.
Obviously, once paper has been recycled five to seven times it can no longer be recycled, and then incineration could indeed be useful.
Even the incineration of sewage sludge is deemed useful â by definition.
It is highly doubtful whether that is advisable, however.
If the sludge has leaked out, that would perhaps be useful, but definitely not if it is soaked in water.
We must now hold this political debate.
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has done so.
Tomorrow we shall also be voting on amendments.
Since the Commission has not provided any clarity, we shall have to do it.
It makes no sense to wait for a thematic strategy before thinking of introducing further legislation.
We would then be five years down the line.
We should try to fill this gap now â for better or worse.
Â Â  Mr President, I should also like to thank Mr Blokland for his report on the proposal before us, which deals with shipments of waste and the various procedures and control regimes they must follow, the requirements of which are to be determined by the type of waste shipped and the type of treatment that would be applied to the waste at its destination.
It deals with different levels of control, depending on the risks posed by the waste and its treatment in terms of recovery or disposal.
Under the proposal, shipments of all waste destined for disposal and shipments of hazardous and semi-hazardous waste destined for recovery will be subject to the requirement of prior written notification and consent.
The tacit consent allowed under the current regulation will be abolished.
Non-hazardous or what is termed 'green list waste for recovery' would remain subject neither to notification nor consent.
In other words, the present requirements would remain for green listed waste.
There is no doubt that a greater administrative burden will fall on waste companies exporting waste across EU borders and on competent authorities of dispatch.
The Commission claims that there should be no major economic cost.
I would like the Commission to tell me specifically whether or not an economic impact analysis was done in relation to this particular proposal, to back-up their claim in relation to the economic costs involved.
Nevertheless, the harmonisation and tightening up of procedures is generally very welcome from an environmental protection perspective.
It is also proposed to clarify the amount and extent of the coverage of the financial guarantee or insurance to be approved by the competent authority of dispatch; all competent authorities are to have access to it and it must also cover possible storage charges.
The latter is particularly welcome.
The amount of guarantee or insurance is currently the subject of some debate.
Perhaps the Commission could comment on that.
It has been generally agreed that a consistent method for calculating this should be developed.
The Commission has presented a draft outline on how this might be achieved.
Ireland is a small island nation, effectively without any recovery or incineration facilities.
We will be dependent on the orderly shipment of waste for the foreseeable future.
I broadly welcome this proposal, but no matter how well-regulated the system is, there will always be risks, culminating in accidents such as the one in April this year, when a German-registered ship, the , ran aground on the tip of Cornwall.
It was carrying 2Â 200 tonnes of shredded car waste from Cork in the south-west of Ireland to LÃŒbeck in Germany.
Mrs Jackson gave me a plastic bag of this waste, recovered by the environmental NGOs when they were cleaning up the beach in Cornwall.
That is one of the risks that will always be with us.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Blokland on his report.
The particular issue I would like to focus on is recovery.
A number of people have referred to the European Court judgment.
It is long overdue for the Commission to clarify exactly what 'recovery' is, because it is an issue that crosses into the packaging directives and a number of other EU directives as well.
It does not take a genius to work out that recovery does not mean incinerating waste.
This is an appalling waste of resources.
We should not allow Member States to move in that direction, particularly those that do not have incineration at the moment.
I am speaking in particular about my own Member State, which would like to have the opportunity to build incinerators.
When one considers the lobbying regarding the Blokland report, a lot of it is from people who operate incinerators and want to ensure that they remain economically viable.
It is quite clear that if incineration is allowed to be classified as recovery, then there is an incentive to burn and dispose in this way and that creates a disincentive for governments to get their act together.
This is a very bad example to set to other Member States joining the European Union.
In my own country in particular, the Irish Government looks for derogations right, left and centre, despite the fact that it has made no effort whatsoever to provide the public in Ireland with the possibility to have effective recycling possibilities or to create recycling industries.
We are throwing away a large amount of jobs by allowing the waste to be burned.
This is not an economical way of dealing with waste in the long-term nor it is good for the environment or public health.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the problem of waste is one of the subjects that interests people most, as it has a tangible effect on them.
Waste management and promoting the recycling and recovery of waste can have a direct impact on peopleâs everyday lives and welfare, as well as their enjoyment of their surroundings.
The explosive growth in the volume of waste in the future will be both an environmental and a health problem for an enlarged European Union and its citizens.
Nevertheless, in many Member States regulations for waste management, the prevention of its build-up, recovery and recycling have not been implemented yet in any serious way, and national laws are often unsatisfactory.
I myself belong to a band of happy citizens who live in a country where the national strategy on waste is sufficiently ambitious and dealt with excellently.
Finlandâs waste problems at national level cannot, however, be shrugged off, because, as with environmental disasters, waste knows no limits either.
The Commission proposal to clarify regulations on shipments of waste and clinch a deal on common rules for the waste markets is sorely needed.
The authorities need clear legislation to improve waste recovery and steer waste management in a more environmentally friendly direction than before.
It is also particularly important that the minimum requirements for environmental standards applied to third countries adhere to the internal legislative logic of the Community and are not based on any merely vague guidelines.
I am also worried about the welfare of vulnerable sea areas and the environmental risks they face.
The protection of Europeâs only internal sea, the Baltic, has long been a priority for the Finnish state.
I regard it as important that the proposal in question should include the EUâs regional waters, which need protection from the threats posed by waste traffic.
It is important to note that ships and other means of transport by water can be classed as waste.
The Basel Convention has not taken separate account of this, and it is therefore important to raise the matter here and now so that any loopholes can be closed.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I am pleased to say that the Commission can accept 26 amendments fully and a further 23 amendments in principle or in part.
Certain amendments to Article 13 on objections to waste for recovery pursue national solutions rather than solutions at Community level, and these amendments are particularly aimed at addressing the issues of so-called standard dumping in relation to waste destined for recovery by allowing a number of further justifications for objecting to shipments destined for recovery.
As we all know, the problem relates to the fact that waste for recovery travels almost freely within the single market and, at the same time, waste treatment that respects higher standards is often more costly than conventional waste treatment.
I agree with the rapporteur that we can allow competition on costs but not on environmental standards.
However, we are legally obliged through the Treaty to safeguard the environment while also respecting the rules of the internal market.
A solution can therefore be best found at Community level and should be based on three main elements.
Firstly, the establishment of standards at EU level through the extension of the IPC Directive; secondly, the establishment of guidelines regarding sham recovery and thirdly, clearer distinctions between the different recovery and disposal operations.
I agree with those who say that it is not easy to see a solution until this long-term solution is found or established, but we in the Commission definitely recognise the problem and the need to discuss a possible solution in the meantime, and this will be part of the process from now on.
Another issue of concern to the Commission is the proposed banning of the interim treatment operations.
Amendments 13, 14, 34 and 41 propose banning shipments of waste for interim treatment operations and define recovery and disposal operations as only covering final treatment and not interim operations.
The Commission believes that an outright ban would both lack environmental justification and would conflict with the Treaty.
Further, the Commission believes that it is essential that the horizontal definitions of recovery and disposal operations as established in the Waste Framework Directive are adhered to within this regulation.
Establishing different definitions would be both inconsistent and unnecessarily complicated.
This issue of consistency with existing legislation also arises in other amendments.
Certain amendments to Article 13 aim to establish criteria to classify a treatment as recovery and address the issue of sham recovery.
In fact, such criteria could be among several deemed relevant for the distinction between recovery and disposal in general, which is a horizontal issue which should be settled in the context of the Waste Framework Directive rather than in the specific context of this regulation.
Even though the Commission might not entirely disagree with the substance of the proposed clarifications, there is a strong argument for consistency in the lists in the annexes and if changes are required they should, as a first step, be introduced at their point of origin.
Another element regarding Annex V, namely that of giving priority to the EU hazardous list above the Basel non-hazardous list in relation to the so-called Basel ban on exports of hazardous waste from OECD to non-OECD countries, can be supported â Amendments 69 and 70.
Let me just make a brief comment on the question of the double legal basis.
As the explanatory memorandum establishes, the primary objective of the regulation is protection of the environment.
That main objective has been maintained in the new proposal and the legal basis is in Article 175 of the EC Treaty: environment.
However, as regards the provisions of Titles IV, V and VI on exports out of, imports into and transit through the Community to and from third countries, it can be argued that these are rules which pursue an overall and general environmental objective, as well as rules on international trade.
Environmental rules, therefore, also apply to the trade regime and are linked to it.
Therefore, the legal basis as regards the specific provisions in these three titles is Article 133 of the EC Treaty.
Amendment 95 proposes to allow tacit consent in relation to shipments of hazardous waste for recovery.
As is also stressed in the explanatory memorandum, this is not acceptable to the Commission.
Firstly, we have to apply the precautionary approach to shipments of hazardous waste within the Community and, secondly, we have to respect the Basel Convention's requirements in this respect.
The Basel Convention is very clear and leaves no room for interpretation.
Written consent for shipments of hazardous waste must be applied.
The Commission supports the amendments which pursue the same goal as the Commission proposal, namely the promotion of EU standards and certain internationally-agreed guidelines in the country of destination outside the Community.
The guidelines added to the list â the ILO guidelines on ship-breaking and the OECD guidelines on personal computers â can also be accepted.
Lastly, with regard to impact assessment, there is none.
However, the system of notification and information is a well-established one.
There is no specific impact assessment.
Â Â  â Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Â Â  â The next item is the report (A5-0354/2003) by MrsÂ GutiÃ©rrez-Cortines, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the Commission communication âTowards a Thematic Strategy for Soil Protectionâ (COM(2002) 179 â C5-0328/2002 â 2002/2172(COS)).
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, following many legislative initiatives, recommendations and studies, the European Commission has promoted a thematic strategy for soil protection.
The first point of reference â which I believe to be fundamental â is that the soil is a limited source of wealth, the basis of agriculture and production, of food and support for the landscape.
However, perhaps because the horizon always seems infinite, society finds it difficult to understand and accept that it is a limited resource and we therefore have to protect it like any other resource.
This document not only deals with the protection of the soil, but also the conservation of the earth and the landscape, it is intended to guarantee the safety and health of citizens and prevent all types of risk.
I therefore congratulate the Commission on its work.
It is a well-produced document, the departure point is coherent and it represents many years of work and I believe that work is continuing in this direction.
Although the text does not have regulatory status â and I would like to stress this â it is a background document which will lead to many actions, directives and recommendations and lays out the key issues which affect the future of the conservation of soils and the landscape.
It is what we might call the Commissionâs invisible lever which it sometimes uses to create thinking and attitudes in relation to problems.
As a thematic strategy it intends to implement a scientific policy and carry out much more firm, consistent and coherent work than has been done until now.
It intends to detect the cause-effect relationship, the impacts.
We also take this approach, we recommend a recognition of the different nature of each soil, of its distinct typology, of the diversity of soils and the application of measures, solutions and methods suited to the site and the characteristics of the location.
As we have said many times, sustainable development requires a made-to-measure approach and all scientific work has to be appropriate for the reality.
This means that we are entering a complex area and that the Commission accepts the difficult challenge of implementing a policy on soils which recognises the diversity of each place, each region and each climate.
What is Parliament contributing?
Parliament insists on the need for referenced and official catalogues and it provides the Commission with several mandates so that, as soon as possible, it may provide a model for catalogues which can be produced in all regions and all countries, which is accessible, geodifferentiated, and always in computerised and compatible form.
These catalogues must include a biography of soils, typologies, structures and other variables as well as the uses, possible risks and historic, landscape or cultural values, highlighting the risks of any nature.
I would urge the Commission to develop the draft INSPIRE Directive for the establishment of an infrastructure for a European area of information, which is essential as an instrument for developing these areas and which, at the time, was approved by three Directorate-Generals.
I would recommend much more precise research in certain fields.
We insist on the need to exchange information and research on the use of agriculture.
There are many forms of agriculture, and most of them are beneficial to the soil, to its conservation, to prevent erosion, to the maintenance of organic material.
I believe the time has come to put an end, scientifically, to the common belief that agriculture is bad for the soil.
There are many good forms of agriculture and we must identify them and support them, especially if we want to introduce this issue into the CAP.
Research programmes are recommended which offer solutions and not just diagnoses and classifications, as has been the case until now.
I would like to focus on two issues, which are innovative: the commitment to studying the desertification and the relationship with the variables which cause it, such as climate change.
I believe that Parliament must continue to insist on relating water to desertification, the problems of the aquifers, the need to provide new resources, the need to look after these climatic spaces and the advance of the desert.
With regard to sealing relating to territorial plans, I would say that although soil sealing and the advance of urbanisation â which in many cases is excessive and uncontrolled â and the loss of soil we are experiencing â which is sometimes dramatic in certain places â is a subsidiary issue, the Commission must, in this case, show new leadership, use these invisible levers which it exercises in certain fields, presenting proposals for good practices.
It must insist that there can be no possible conservation of soil unless we include it in land management.
All good plans and all management plans must include a catalogue of soils and an assessment of them, because that is the only way to prevent floods, to prevent building in storm drains and in Habitat or Natura areas.
And in this regard we will support the Commission.
It is necessary to implement a soil policy which can really deal with the issue of regional support and support from the States.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I thank the European Parliament and, in particular, Mrs GutiÃ©rrez-Cortines, for the preparation of this report.
With this, the consultation process on the first phase of the soil thematic strategy will be concluded.
The Commission welcomes Parliament's broad support for the general approach, main objectives and deliverables presented in the communication.
This includes the development of a communication on major soil degradation issues such as erosion, contamination and organic matter, as well as a proposal for a soil monitoring directive.
The European Parliament recognises the Community dimension for many of the soil degradation processes Europe is faced with.
Parliament underlines that soil degradation processes are progressive and often go unnoticed, sometimes for many decades.
This distinguishes soil from other environmental components and goes some way towards explaining why air and water policies were developed earlier.
The Commission shares the view that any approach to soil protection must take account of the considerable diversity of regional and local conditions that exist across Europe.
The European strategy for soil protection does not mean a standardised, one-size-fits-all approach.
The Commission fully agrees that it is vital to apply an integrated approach to soil, based on sustainable development.
The multifunctional and cross-sectoral approach to soil is of primary importance.
The economic and social implications of soil degradation are therefore an integral part of the soil thematic strategy.
The numerous detailed comments, requests and additional proposals contained in Parliament's resolution will be fully taken into account in the future development of the soil thematic strategy.
In this context the Commission welcomes Parliament's support for the knowledge-based approach.
The Commission will examine the detailed proposals for a soil catalogue, soil mapping and zoning, which should be geared to solving specific soil degradation problems.
We also recognise that it is necessary to gain greater understanding of soil biodiversity, the nutrient and water cycles and the issues related to the use of compost.
The Commission welcomes the important role attributed to agriculture and forestry in revitalising soil â in particular, the call to make cross-compliance compulsory for all payments under the common agricultural policy; the integration of specific measures for soil and water protection into the CAP; the localised diagnosis of the impacts of CAP reform on soil health; and the definition of patterns of agriculture and forestry, in line with soil characteristics.
The Commission welcomes Parliament's request to bring land use into line with soil characteristics, to integrate soil protection objectives into spatial planning strategies, to prevent the indiscriminate sealing of land and to prevent the bisection of ecosystems, waterflows and landscapes by road and urban infrastructures.
The Commission recognises the need to develop more leadership in Europe in the area of spatial planning.
The Commission fully subscribes to the role attributed to soil protection in the context of major processes such as biodiversity decline, climate change, desertification, coastal erosion and forest fires.
The Commission recognises, in particular, the need for additional action to combat desertification in Europe and will consider Parliament's urgent call for an immediate communication and Community action programme on desertification.
In conclusion I would like to underline that I consider Parliament's resolution as an important input to our work.
We can now further direct our work on the development of the next stage on the soil strategy.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we, as human beings, are extremely dependent on water and air, but also on the soil.
We live on it and we live off it, we travel over it, we wonder at its beauty: reason enough to treat the soil with care.
As a Member of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, I should like to discuss a number of aspects of that care.
Firstly, it is good to establish that the soil has a less international nature than air or water, which are always moving.
Although the Member States have similar problems with their soil to a certain extent, the cause varies.
With this in mind, there is reason to fear that a centralised approach will not have the desired result for all the Member States.
A European approach must therefore emphasise the exchange of information, knowledge and best practices.
It is not clear to me from the present text of the communication whether the Commission has actually even chosen this direction.
Secondly, MrsÂ GutiÃ©rrez-Cortines rightly points out the adverse consequences of transport for the soil.
Soil compaction and sealing are major adverse effects that infrastructure has on the soil, with consequences for the viability and condition of that soil.
Those effects must therefore be minimised and the strain on the soil thus reduced.
The promotion of modes of transport that have less or no impact on the soil, such as inland water and coastal water transport, presents an opportunity for doing this, as does the use of less harmful materials in the construction of infrastructure.
Finally, the Community should also assert its influence directly in the construction of infrastructure by incorporating the interests of the soil into projects in which the Community is investing.
We are satisfied with the present text as regards the specific transport aspects.
Unfortunately, a lack of clarity remains regarding the level of the general protection of the soil and the form this should take.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs GutiÃ©rrez-Cortines, for her report.
It has already been pointed out that this is a very important issue: soil is a vital component for our existence.
Regarding coastal erosion, I was rapporteur in this Parliament some time ago on coastal zone management.
The issue of land use was outside the scope of that report. However, in relation to coastal erosion, a number of elements need to be taken into account, particularly in relation to developments that take place along our coasts.
Some coastal erosion is related to nature and is thus outside our control, but quite a lot of coastal erosion is a result of irresponsible planning and development.
Inland erosion and desertification again come down to the use of our land.
The issue of over-grazing in Ireland has caused a major problem in relation to soil erosion in the west of Ireland and also in some other places.
Forestry is an issue which has caused major problems in relation to soil erosion throughout the European Union, particularly in the southern part of Europe.
These are things that can easily be solved by looking at the way we use land.
In relation to farming, we need to look at the long-term consequences of the kinds of chemicals â such as pesticides and herbicides â used in the soil.
As the last speaker said, soil is vital not just in terms of beauty and aesthetic value, but also in terms of our survival, the survival of farming communities, and even the survival of those that to a certain extent have contributed to the major problem in relation to soil.
I would like to congratulate the Commission for focusing on this issue, because like water and other issues, it is extremely important.
Â Â  MrÂ President, this draft directive raises several problems.
Indeed, several European policies as well as several directives, such as the IV water directive or the sixth environmental programme, deal with soil protection.
A similar issue appears in the Forest-Focus programme.
A whole range of projects and directives on environmental responsibility also address this issue.
What is the point, furthermore, of defining soil at European level, of drawing up a scientific soil catalogue by 2007 with harmonisation of scientific data on soil, other than to note their diversity, which is already known?
What is, moreover, the point of making a diagnosis on the impact of CAP reform when it has been adopted?
In our opinion, a simple recommendation would suffice and would avoid once again penalising the farmers that are already severely affected by CAP reform.
Let us simplify and rationalise the current texts, and let us finally align European subsidies with the objective that we have followed, by encouraging techniques that are favourable to soil protection and to preserving the wild fauna, such as non-labour and direct sowing techniques.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Â Â  â The next item is the report (A5-0365/2003) by MrÂ Lisi, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council directive on amending Council Directive 96/82/EC on the control of major-accident hazards involving dangerous substances (PE-CONS 3665/2003 â C5-0435/2003 â 2001/0257(COD)).
Â Â  . MrÂ President, CommissionerÂ WallstrÃ¶m, to begin with, I would like to refer briefly to the legislative history of this measure.
The tragic accidents that have affected the chemical industry in recent years and, above all, the people living near these sites and the surrounding area could only attract the European Unionâs attention.
Areas such as Baia Mare, Aznalcollar and, above all, Toulouse and Enschede, have become synonymous with environmental human tragedies, to which we have to respond clearly.
It is in this sensitive context that the Commission presented to Parliament and the Council its proposal to amend Directive 96/82 of December 1996 on the control of major-accident hazards involving dangerous substances.
This proposal was the product of in-depth scientific work and we are pleased to acknowledge the Commissionâs desire to tackle the shortcomings of the previous directive with a constructive mindset that has enabled us all to send a clear message to both the chemical industry and the people.
We will make every effort to ensure that, in future, adequate control measures are adopted and respected.
At first reading I, together with other Members, explained the reasons why this strong signal is needed from the European Parliament, and, together, we adopted an approach, which we confirm today, of ensuring that the accidents which have occurred to date do not happen again, guaranteeing protection for the citizens and the workers at these plants and providing substantial protection for the surrounding area.
As you are aware, the Council achieved a common position which incorporated the essence of many of Parliamentâs concerns.
It is true that, after this second reading, there are still some grey areas, although I believe they have been clarified by the conciliation that we carried out which is now awaiting Parliamentâs approval.
I will mention briefly the main points on which the Conciliation Committee reached a compromise: the first concerns mining activities.
The compromise that we reached seeks to guarantee complimentarity between the directive in question and the Directive on the management of waste from the extractive industries, which is at its first reading in Parliament.
The scope of the âSeveso directiveâ is thus extended to operational tailings disposal facilities when used in connection with the processing of minerals.
As regards training of staff, in this sector we insisted from the outset on the importance of adequate training of staff in the prevention and management of possible accidents.
This idea was confirmed in the Conciliation Committee and Parliament obtained provision for adequate training to be given not only to staff at establishments in question but also to sub-contracted staff at these establishments.
As regards a third aspect, maps showing risk areas, Parliament has repeatedly called for provision for illustrated maps to inform the public concerned of risk areas and the extent of the risk, as it believes that this is a simple, clear means of informing all those who could be affected of the potential risk in the event of an accident.
An agreement was reached in the Conciliation Committee which provides for these maps or images â equivalent representations â to be included in safety reports and to be made available to the public.
My penultimate point concerns potassium nitrate.
Specifications and new thresholds for potassium nitrate, proposed by Parliament, were adopted by the Council in the Conciliation Committee.
This amendment will prevent farmers using a type of potassium nitrate that is not classified as a fuel from being unduly listed as being subject to the security measures provided for in this directive.
The last point regards the database for land-use planning.
The compromise reached in the Conciliation Committee regarding a database for risk data and risk scenariosÂ âÂ a database which seeks to assess the compatibility of industrial sites with sensitive areasÂ âÂ calls on the Commission to draw up the necessary guidelines for the creation of such a database within three years, whilst, at the same time, preserving the necessary subsidiarity in the face of the diversity of situations.
I will end, MrÂ President, by thanking the Commission and the Members.
I feel that we have reached a satisfactory agreement together which takes into consideration all the demands that were expressed, especially the main objective that I mentioned at the beginning, the need to send our fellow citizens a clear message.
Lastly, a technical note: Mr President, in Annex I (I) in particular points 5 and 6, there are definitions that could give rise to ambiguity.
I would ask you to note that the correct version is the English version.
Â Â  â The situation is rather complicated and so your statement will need to be repeated tomorrow, before the vote.
Â Â  . â Mr President, the Commission welcomes the outcome of the conciliation process and is pleased that the co-legislators decided not only to broaden the scope of the Seveso II Directive in the light of the accidents in Baia Mare, Enschede and Toulouse, but also to strengthen its provisions.
The new directive now covers chemical and thermal processing operations in mining as well as all operational tailings disposal facilities containing dangerous mining waste.
Furthermore, its scope was tightened with regard to explosive and pyrotechnic substances as well as ammonium nitrate.
Taking into account the results of two studies carried out by the Commission, the directive also includes more carcinogenic substances, and the qualifying quantities for substances toxic to the aquatic environment have been significantly decreased.
Moreover, and particularly due to requests by the European Parliament, the directive has now been strengthened in a number of other areas such as information for the public, training for emergencies and the involvement of subcontracted personnel.
Its provisions on land-use planning were reinforced, including a mandate for the Commission to develop a European database to be used for assessing the compatibility between Seveso establishments and sensitive areas.
The new directive now also obliges industrial operators to produce risk maps showing areas that might be affected by a major accidents.
Last, but not least, Member States are required to provide the Commission with minimum data on all Seveso sites on their territory.
I would like to congratulate Mr Lisi, the rapporteur, on his work, as well as all Members who have contributed to ensuring the successful outcome of this legislative process.
Â Â  MrÂ President, first of all I would like to congratulate my colleague MrÂ Lisi for the excellent work that he carried out on this subject, which is so sensitive.
As Member for Toulouse, I can tell you, how much, two years after the event, the tragedy of the explosion at the AZF factory remains extraordinarily present in the town, in the minds and often even in the flesh of the victims of the disaster.
Together with the mayor of Toulouse, MrÂ Douste-Blazy, we had to act quickly and provide local solutions in light of this tragedy.
If we do not want this tragedy to happen again in the future then more needs to be done and legislation is needed.
This is what our institution did in taking up this issue as of 3Â October 2001.
In this regard, I particularly welcome the fact that the constructive collaboration between the Commission, the Council and Parliament enabled a consensus to emerge from the second reading on the issue of ammonium nitrates and that, from then on, in potentially hazardous factories, the thresholds for authorised nitrates were raised to a level so that they would perhaps have been able to avoid the Toulouse explosion.
In several areas, the work carried out at third reading and in conciliation provides for new steps forward with new precautionary measures, and in our legislative action we did of course bear in mind security of employees working in potentially hazardous factories.
Training measures designed for these people are therefore necessary and even essential. As MrÂ Lisi said, however, they should not be limited to workers in potentially hazardous factories; they should be extended to sub-contracted employees.
Extending training for their benefit does not seem to me in any way a pernickety measure thought up by bureaucrats, but on the contrary, a protective measure.
I welcome the outcome that was achieved in the Conciliation Committee on this point.
It is also our duty to respond to the legitimate concern of the people to be better informed on these issues.
The industrialists concerned must, on their own initiative, move towards greater transparency of their actions.
To a certain extent, the European Parliament wanted to contribute to informing the public more by producing a map showing risk areas.
This is a step forward, but still people need to be informed, on the ground, of the existence and accessibility of these security documents.
MrÂ President, of course I am aware, as are the people of Toulouse, of the fact that this report does not give absolute protection against industrial accidents.
Absolute protection cannot exist, by definition, but I am also completely sure that this House, in taking up this issue quickly and in providing greater protection rules, will have proven how much Europe can respond when it has to, to the immediate concerns of our citizens and this is why I would like to thank you.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Â Â  â The next item is the report (A5-0386/2003) by MrÂ Adam, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation on establishing a system for the identification and registration of ovine and caprine animals and amending Regulation (EEC) No 3508/92 (COM(2002) 729 â C5-0027/2003 â 2002/0297(CNS)).
Â Â  . â Mr President, the Commission proposal addresses the acknowledged need for urgent reinforcement of the current rules for identification and registration of sheep and goats, in particular in view of the experience acquired from the 2001 FMD crisis.
In its resolution on foot and mouth disease of December 2002, the European Parliament stated that the Commission should submit, as quickly as possible, a proposal to amend Directive 92/102/EEC so as to improve the identification of pigs, sheep and goats.
According to current legislation sheep and goats must be identified with an ear-tag or a tattoo linked to the holding.
The keepers must keep an up-to-date register on the holding, and the competent authority must keep an up-to-date central register of holdings.
The main new elements of the proposed system are individual identification, double ear-tagging to ensure that identity is retained where one ear-tag is lost, and the introduction of a movement document.
Individual identification is essential for the effective tracing of animals for veterinary purposes, which is of crucial importance for the control of contagious diseases.
The introduction of a reinforced system will have a positive impact in case of outbreaks of major animal diseases, such as foot and mouth disease, allowing for the rapid identification of the source of infection and limiting the further spread of disease.
Furthermore, it will facilitate accurate tracing of animals in the framework of the animal disease eradication programmes financed by the Community.
The technology of electronic identification for sheep and goats has progressed to such a stage that it can now be applied in practice.
This is supported by the results of the Commissionâs large-scale pilot project â the IDEA Project.
However, the implementing measures required for a fully-functioning system of electronic identification on a Community scale have yet to be developed.
The proposal, therefore, provides for further guidelines and procedures to be adopted through the Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health, with entry into force of obligatory electronic tagging foreseen for 1 July 2006.
I am well aware of the diversity of the sheep population and the sheep production systems in the Member States.
The proposal therefore includes options, which would allow Member States to defer the identification of lambs up to the age of 6 months, where sheep are kept under extensive farming conditions in free range, and to apply simplified identification arrangements to young lambs, up to 6 months of age, intended for direct slaughter.
The options decided upon will influence the likely costs to farmers of introducing the new system.
The estimation of the costs of introduction of the reinforced system on a Community-wide basis has to take into account the diversity of the sheep population and the sheep production systems in the Member States.
In the absence of precise information on movements and other parameters, the estimate has to be based on the general structure of the various production systems.
On this basis the overall costs of the reinforced system are estimated to vary between 1 euro (for traditional ear-tags) and 3.7 euro (electronic identification) per sheep per year.
The proposal foresees that the Commission shall, if necessary, submit to the Council a report on the experience gained concerning electronic identification.
This report could be accompanied by proposals amending, if appropriate, the date by which electronic identification should become obligatory.
I recognise that this proposal will require significant efforts by both operators and authorities, but these efforts are both worthwhile and necessary.
Â Â  . Mr President, there is complete agreement among the Council, the Commission and Parliament that we need to improve the traceability of sheep and goats.
This was the clear conclusion of the experience derived from the outbreak of foot and mouth disease.
There is also agreement that the eventual aim should be a cost-effective electronic identification system.
The proposals from the Commission, which are the subject of this report, bridge the gap between present practice and the agreement to introduce electronic methods.
The proposals envisage a complicated control system based on individual identification numbers and the recording of all these numbers when sheep and goats are moved.
The proposals would certainly achieve the objective.
Regrettably, they do not take into account the differing methods of sheep and goat rearing in the Member States: the difference in farming conditions from mountainous regions to lowland pasture or the differing sizes of sheep and goat herds, which can vary from a handful to thousands.
They fail to take into account the differing numbers in the Member States, which can range from a few hundred thousand to millions.
More seriously, the proposals would impose an impossibly costly and labour-intensive recording system where sheep numbers are large.
The proposals are based on the current passport method which is used to trace the movement of cattle but, sadly, ignore the differences between cattle and sheep.
The proposals fail to take into account cultural differences which, in other circumstances, we would be seeking to encourage.
If the proposals were to be implemented they would threaten the future of sheep rearing in Europe as we know it.
I suppose that getting rid of sheep is a sure way of getting rid of disease.
The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development simply asks, in this report, that the differing factors should be taken into account.
Primarily, the committee unanimously wants batch control systems to be allowed as well as individual control, and for the Member States to be able to apply both systems according to circumstances.
Batch systems can work.
They do so now for pigs, though I would not claim that there is no difference between sheep and pigs.
The committee amendments â which the Commissioner managed not to refer to â make detailed and effective rules for both systems of traceability.
Common sense and economics should dictate which is used.
Regrettably, Commissioner Byrne does not seem to have been listening to what has been going on in the Committee on Agriculture.
I would like to end by quoting Commissioner Fischler, the Commissioner responsible for agriculture, who recently said: 'We want farmers to spend the bulk of their working days in the fields and not filling out forms.'
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Adam, for the very good job he has done on this report, and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for bringing forward a very practical report.
That is the key to the whole thing because, as Mr Adam has said, we very much want to be able to trace sheep movements.
However, we have to realise that in the UK alone there are 35 million sheep and there are probably up to 100 million individual movements of sheep.
The idea that every sheep could be recorded with a 14-digit number when it is being moved is completely ridiculous.
Let me take you through a scenario.
A thousand ewes with 1Â 200 lambs are taken to the hillside.
Six months later those sheep return and some of them have lost their tags.
The Commission still insists that they should have the same individual number.
I say to Commissioner Byrne quite clearly â and I am sure he realises this because he is an intelligent man â that the idea that the lamb will have the same tag is absolutely ridiculous.
We have to realise that if you make the law an ass, it will be seen as an ass and we must be very careful to bring in legislation that is practical.
Our committee has voted for batch movements of sheep and it is clear that if those batches are moved you will be able to trace where they have been.
If there is a problem with scrapie in sheep then the whole flock will be slaughtered, so individual numbers are not necessary.
Provided that the holding number is on the tag, that is all that is needed.
As we move forward into electronic systems, we have to be absolutely sure of the cost to the industry of introducing this.
We also need a system that will be practical.
I have seen systems demonstrated in hotel rooms, but they have to be demonstrated on the hillside in pouring rain, to farmers and shepherds who can easily deal with that system.
All of these things have to be practical, because we need the sheep and lamb industry.
I recently visited New Zealand, which has a lot of sheep.
Sheep are necessary to the European Union, and we must be careful not to price ourselves out of that industry.
I would urge the Commission to look at our report practically and wake up to the idea that we have got it right.
Â Â  Mr President, I would firstly like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Adam, for his work.
He has produced a wonderful report and, throughout its production, he has shown great skill in introducing all those aspects which could improve it and make it more flexible.
As has already been said in this debate, the identification and traceability of goats is an essential element in the control of animal health and, also, of course, food safety.
The problems of identification in this type of livestock are very significant; the movement of livestock which can take place within one year, which has an enormous influence on the problems of traceability, or the way in which the lives of this type of livestock are spent, which hinders adequate registration and identification by means of the current systems.
We therefore believe that it is very important to establish a sufficiently long transitional period during which we can adopt flexible measures in order to reach a date, naturally, when the electronic identification becomes obligatory for all the countries of the European Union.
It is very important that we understand that the additional cost of an electronic identification system must not be an additional cost which solely and exclusively falls to breeders, but which must be taken on by society as a whole, since it is society which will benefit from the implementation of such a system of traceability and identification as ambitious as the one being proposed to us.
Â Â  Mr President, the original Commission proposal may just be possible in the context of the small number of sheep or goats kept in an enclosed field, although even here there are concerns in relation to animal welfare.
By contrast, the Adam report recognises the practicalities of hill farming and of managing flocks on a large scale.
It also recognises, as the beef labelling regulation failed to do, that the requirements of traceability for the purposes of disease control are different from those involved in providing information for consumers.
The possibilities of using individual and/or batch identification, the simplification of coding and alternatives to double tagging, as proposed by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, are all very welcome.
Although I would prefer not to have had any date specified for the introduction of electronic tagging, I am glad that the committee has recommended a year's postponement and a real cost-benefit analysis, as well as calling for the EU â not farmers â to bear the financial burden involved.
Trials of the equipment to be used will also be of major importance.
Can the chosen identifier be securely and safely located as far as the animal is concerned?
Will both placing the identifier and using the electronic reader be feasible on difficult terrain and in adverse weather?
Will the reader be robust enough to withstand these conditions?
These are issues on which farmers are rightly looking for reassurance.
I hope it will be afforded to them.
I conclude by congratulating the rapporteur on his report and on the fact that it received the unanimous support of the Agriculture Committee.
I hope for a similar outcome in tomorrow's vote.
I join colleagues in urging the Commission to accede to our views.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Adam, who has worked very hard on this report.
From our initial Committee discussions it was evident that these proposals had been drafted with little, if any, appreciation or understanding of the sheep farming industry.
Many of the Members who have visited sheep farms, or who are indeed farmers themselves, have become increasingly exasperated by the Commission's blind approach in this regard.
I have been visited in Strasbourg this week by a group of farmers from Wales who would be happy, if they were allowed, to bring sheep with ear-tags into the Chamber to give the officials an idea of the impracticality of what is being proposed.
Like me, they want to improve traceability in this sector to avoid any future spread of disease, but this must be achieved in a realistic way.
In Wales, which has the highest concentration of sheep in the EU, you could not realistically at present expect to convince a traditional hill farmer, with an average age of 58 and an average annual income of EURÂ 10Â 000, of the benefits of investing in new and complicated technology, the set-up costs for which have been estimated at EUR 15Â 000.
I urge the Commission to take on board the report's major recommendations, to come back with a comprehensive cost analysis for these proposals and to acknowledge the effectiveness of recording batch movements of sheep until such time as electronic identification becomes a viable and practical proposition.
Â Â  â Someone applauded in the public gallery.
I would remind you once again that visitors in the gallery are always welcome, but they cannot intervene in any way, either to express agreement or to express disagreement.
Â Â  Mr President, since Europe has such large numbers of sheep and goats it is necessary to introduce an efficient system for the identification of animals, which, at the same time, does not impose an administrative burden on producers.
The IDEA project, implemented a few years ago by the European Commission, demonstrated that it is possible to implement an individual electronic identification system in the European Union.
The proof that the system is viable can be found in the fact that Spain, a country which, together with the United Kingdom, has one of the most significant herds in the European Union, has just gone ahead with the purchase of a million devices which are placed in the digestive system of ruminants for the differentiation of the different genotypes of sheep and goats.
Following the foot and mouth crisis, which decimated the United Kingdom's cattle stocks, it is urgent that we implement an individual identification system like the one which is being discussed, in order to try to prevent the recurrence of this type of veterinary epidemic.
As a former chairperson of the Temporary Committee on Foot and Mouth Disease, I would like to congratulate the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the European Parliament because we have been able to achieve compromise positions in the report approved in the Committee on Agriculture.
I would like to point out that, at the end of the work carried out by the Temporary Committee on Foot and Mouth Disease, the European Parliament expressed its support for individual identification, a position which was taken up by the European Commission.
The report we will vote on tomorrow contains two compromise amendments adopted by the Committee on Agriculture, which respect the interests of the European Union's producers.
One of them relates to the age from which the identification of animals must be carried out.
According to the compromise achieved, this is six months for intensive breeding and nine in the case of extensive breeding.
The second compromise amendment, presented by the rapporteur, sets the date of July 2007 for the introduction of electronic identification, which sends a clear message to both breeders and the industry manufacturing the devices necessary for the electronic system.
I therefore hope that the results achieved in the Committee on Agriculture are fully adopted in plenary.
However, I would like to express my support for the technical modifications introduced by our shadow rapporteur, in the only amendment which has been presented in plenary, relating to the document on the transport of animals.
I would also like to end by congratulating the rapporteur, who has made the effort to achieve compromise and to work in favour of identification and therefore in favour of cattle breeding.
Congratulations, Mr Adam.
Â Â  Mr President, yesterday I had the great honour of sharing a platform with the President of Parliament, Mr Cox, when we both addressed the CBI national conference in the United Kingdom.
Mr Cox referred to the real concerns that exist in the UK, by saying that Parliament, the Commission and the Council are now committed to the concepts of developing subsidiarity and no disproportionate regulation.
If that were so, we would have to look at these proposals within that context.
Nobody challenges the need for better identification, but the truth of the matter is that the UK Government itself has calculated that the cost of introducing this system in the UK will be just short of GBP 100 million, a cost of between GBP 13 000 and GBP 16 000 per farmer.
We heard from Commissioner Byrne that the EU has made its own estimate.
I have more faith in the calculation of the UK Government than I have in the calculation of the EU authorities.
The fact of the matter is that the committee has been unanimous in its view.
The speeches that we will hear this evening will be unanimous in their view.
They will be in favour of better identification but also of proceeding by way of practicality, flexibility, looking at operating different methods within Member States, and of having identification â certainly within the United Kingdom â on the basis of batch control numbers.
I say to the Commissioner that there is unanimity across this Parliament, from MrÂ Wyn, my political opponent in Wales, to Mrs Attwooll, who is from another party in the United Kingdom and Mr Adam, from the Labour Party.
We are all unanimous in this view.
It is a view that the Commission should take on board.
So far, I have not been terribly encouraged by the stance adopted by the Commission.
Mr Adam has done a great deal to achieve unanimity, and I congratulate him on that, as other speakers have done.
We have the facility of trying to persuade Mr Adam, if there is no movement on the part of the Commission, to consider having this report referred back to committee.
I hope the Commissioner will be in a position to respond positively to the amendments that have been proposed by the committee.
However, if the Commission simply closes the door on us, then I for one will be among those who seek to persuade Mr Adam tomorrow to ask for this report to be referred back to committee so that we can stress to the Commission that it must be a listening Commission â not just when people appear before the CBI in the United Kingdom but also with regard to the daily work we do at Parliament.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to take this opportunity to congratulate the rapporteur on an exceptionally good job.
I have known Mr Adam for over 14 years and he did not deserve this â he deserved better.
He has done a tremendous job on what was a terrible proposal in the first instance.
The truth is that this will not work at ground level.
I am totally in favour of what has been said about batch or flock identification.
That will work, can work and is controllable.
Anything other than that is totally irrelevant at this stage.
I will be totally in favour of electronic tagging, when we have the technology and when it is cheap enough.
However, it has to be clearly assumed that that is something for the future.
The Commissioner has to take on board one other very important point: the question of who pays, because sheep farmers cannot afford this.
They have been battered for far too long.
They are surviving in atrocious conditions to provide lamb for consumption in the European Union.
To put this burden on them is totally unacceptable and for the producer it is unworkable.
I have a lot of respect for the Commissioner, but I have to say to him that it would be extremely helpful if his officials could put forward proposals after getting out of their glass ivory towers in Brussels and going to see the conditions people actually have to work and live in.
Do you know what it is like at lambing time?
Has anyone got a clue what it is like to lamb a flock of sheep day and night?
Many farmers do not even sleep for days.
This does nothing for the industry.
We are over-regulating the industry; we are strangling agriculture by our regulations.
At the same time, I am told that in the United Kingdom, if you buy a chicken sandwich, 85% of the chicken comes from Brazil or Thailand.
Where is it traceable to?
How can there be traceability there?
The agricultural industry cannot take any more of this.
I urge the Commissioner to reflect on what has been said here tonight.
This is sincere and from the heart.
This is the people talking.
I urge you to reflect and agree with the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and give us more time to get a proper identification system that will work.
Â Â  Mr President, the foot and mouth disease crisis of 2001 graphically and horrifically underlined the inadequacy of Council Directive 92/102/EEC on the identification and registration of animals, including sheep and goats.
Therefore I broadly welcome proposals for a regulation reinforcing the provisions of that directive.
I would like to sincerely thank the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteur, Neil Parish, for the excellent and cooperative work they have done to bring us to this point.
I fully support the position adopted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the proposals before us.
In theory all Member States favour an individual identification system, but there are two camps.
Firstly those countries generally in favour of the proposals which, apart from France, tend to be the states with lower sheep numbers, including Ireland, and secondly those which maintain it would be completely impractical and too costly to implement an individual system in advance of electronic identification.
This latter group includes Spain, Portugal, Greece and very definitely the UK, where there are huge numbers of sheep and geographical factors amplify the considerable concerns of the sheep industry.
The Council presidency has now presented a compromise on the original proposals, which would drop all recording of individual sheep numbers until such a time as an electronic recording system is in place, and secondly would introduce compulsory electronic identification for sheep and goats from 1 January 2008, subject to a Commission report on implementation by June 2006.
Thirdly, it would allow a derogation from compulsory electronic identification for Member States with flocks of less than five hundred thousand.
The official Irish position, ironically, is that we are in favour of individual identification on a manual basis because we introduced such a system in June 2001.
We are normally the ones making justified complaints, and now I fully support my UK and Spanish colleagues and the case they are making on their particular circumstances.
However, in Ireland we are not in favour of the double tagging proposed, because this would result in a higher workload for flock owners and significantly increase the associated costs, such as tag replacement, without adding any value to our current system.
At the moment in Ireland, a permanent sheep tag costs 30 cents.
Two such tags would be 60 cents, before taking labour costs into account, plus the replacement rate, which by definition is very high in sheep because of their grazing habits.
We have already been through the pain barrier and currently have an individual identification system in place.
That gives us full traceability of sheep on an individual basis from the farm of origin to carcass.
This system was introduced to ensure that Ireland operates to the highest standards of disease monitoring and control and is at the forefront in terms of consumer assurance and food safety.
Most importantly for us in Ireland, it gives us a considerable advantage in relation to the export market.
We do not want to go backwards and replace our current system â that is the official line, speak to the farmers if you want to hear what they have to say â with what amounts to no more than a flock identification system that will not give full traceability.
The compromise system would not allow the movements of an individual sheep to be traced.
It would not provide any basis for scrapie control or genotyping, which has to be based on individual identification.
At this stage, Ireland is seeking an accommodation within the proposal to retain certain aspects of its current individual identification system pending the introduction of a compulsory electronic system.
As colleagues have said, let us harmonise the objective but not necessarily the methodology.
The long-term objective should be a cost-effective electronic identification system.
In the meantime, there should be batch numbers for those countries who want them and individual tag numbers for other countries, like Ireland, depending on the scale of operations and the geographical factors involved.
Â Â  â This has been the most impassioned debate of the evening.
Commissioner, did you close the door in someoneâs face?
I think that everyone is awaiting your reply.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I have taken careful note of the various arguments made and I appreciate the efforts put into this, especially by MrÂ Adam, to contribute to the overall goal of reinforcing the system of identification and registration of sheep and goats in the Community.
I have sympathy with the farmers' situation, but I should like to remind the House â as Mrs Doyle did â of the 2001 foot and mouth disease outbreak, which proved that individual identification was necessary.
Mention has been made of the costs involved in this.
Advice I have received regarding the estimates given by one Member State points out that these costs are not accurate.
The costs we have put forward are much closer to the likely outcome of the situation.
The Commission can agree to Amendment 3 with regard to the stage of development of electronic identification, but the Commission cannot agree to Amendment 3 with regard to the introduction of electronic identification on a voluntary basis.
The Commission can agree to Amendments 17, 18 and 23 with regard to the postponement of the entry into force of the reinforced system until 1 July 2005.
In view of the evolution of the discussion in Council, the Commission could agree to Amendment 17, with regard to deferring the age of tagging in general until 6 months.
The Commission can agree to Amendments 6 and 27, on the submission of a report on the experience gained with regard to the implementation of electronic identification.
However, the Commission cannot agree to submit a new legislative proposal with a view to the general introduction of electronic identification on 1 July 2007.
Neither can the Commission undertake field trials as foreseen by Amendment 21.
The Commission can agree to Amendments 4 and 7 concerning the role of the Joint Research Centre.
However, the Commission cannot agree to Amendments 1 or 2, as reliable registration cannot be achieved through electronic identification only.
The Commission can agree to the linguistic Amendment 12.
However, the Commission cannot agree to Amendment 28, as this issue is covered by general rules.
The Commission can agree to Amendment 14, as the responsibilities of the transporter shall include the assurance that animals are properly identified and registered.
The Commission can also agree to Amendments 20 and 32, as regards the provisions of the mark, but the Commission cannot agree to Amendments 19, 31, 32 or 33, as animals shall keep the same identification code when means of identification are replaced so as to ensure traceability.
The Commission cannot agree to Amendments 30 and 32, by which animals shall be identified by an eartag or a tattoo in one ear only.
The double tagging is essential to ensure that identity is retained where one eartag is lost.
The second eartag can be replaced by an electronic identifier.
The Commission can agree to Amendment 34, accepting that eartags may be made of metal or plastic and may consist of one or two parts, taking into account approval by the competent authority.
The Commission can agree to Amendments 8, 9, 10, 11, 15, 16, 25, 26, 39 and 40.
However, the Commission cannot agree to Amendments 22 or 24, as the competent authority shall establish the database including the procedures for submission of data.
The Commission cannot agree to Amendments 35, 36, 38 or 41 with regard to batch-recording as the general system.
Individual identification is essential for the effective tracing of animals for veterinary purposes, which is of crucial importance for the control of contagious diseases.
Therefore, a general system based on batch-recording is not acceptable.
Batch-recording does not achieve the results that are required by this proposal, bearing in mind that the batch may well be broken up again and again, in which case traceability becomes quite impossible.
This is something that many people in the House will remember when we recollect the difficulties that were presented to the authorities in a number of Member States, including, in particular, the UK, in seeking to achieve good traceability at the outbreak of the foot and mouth disease crisis, where three weeks passed before there was effective identification in some cases.
That was in a context, as far as I am aware, where 19 farms were infected by the disease from the time of the announcement of the movement order restriction to the implementation of that movement order restriction: only a matter of hours, not weeks.
The Commission cannot agree to Amendments, 5, 13 or 29, as Community financing is not foreseen.
I recognise that this proposal will require significant efforts by both operators and authorities, but I shall stress that these efforts are both worthwhile and necessary.
For full clarity and transparency I will circulate a succinct table of the Commission's position in respect of each of these amendments to facilitate matters for you in the vote tomorrow(1).
Â Â  . Mr President, it is unacceptable that the Commission has two opportunities to speak and the rapporteur only one.
However, it must be said that despite all the rigmarole of what the Commission would or would not agree to, the fact emerges that the Commission is not prepared to budge at all on the question of batch control.
I take it that is the Commission's position.
As far as the fundamentals of this report are concerned, the Commission has not moved an inch.
That is what we will have to consider when we vote tomorrow.
Â Â  â Each group and each Member will, of course, consider how to act in the vote carefully.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.(2)
Â Â  . â General electronic tagging of sheep and goats is a modern system which will basically consist of permanently identifying each small animal so that they can be recognised, wherever they are, and their health can be monitored without any doubts.
However, this sort of marking, without Community funding, will place a great financial burden on sheep and goat farmers.
Especially in Greece, where sheep and goat farming employs the farmer's whole family, day and night, 365 days a year, with no Christmas or Easter break and with an unacceptably low financial result in relation to the effort made and the capital invested, such an unreasonable and unfair financial burden would force numerous farmers to abandon their work and the countryside and would tragically reduce the animal stock.
At the same time, handicrafts which only make cheese from ewe's and goat's milk would close, with the result that unemployed cheese-makers would join the unemployed farmers, reducing the production of unique Greek cheeses based on ewe's and goat's milk such as feta.
Bold Community funding is more than needed in order to avoid all this.
At the same time, however, the general introduction of electronic tagging of sheep and goats by 1 July 2006 is considered very rushed for Greece, where there are more sheep and goats than in the other fourteen Member States together, which is why this deadline should be extended by at least a year.
The Commission can accept the following amendments: 4, 7, 8, 10, 12, 20, 25, 26, 34 and 40.
The Commission can accept the following amendments as part of the compromise package: 3(1), 6, 9, 11, 15, 16, 17, 18, 23, 32(2), 37 and 39.
The Commission cannot accept the following amendments: 1, 2, 3(2), 5, 13, 14, 19, 21, 22, 24, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32(1), 33, 35, 36, 38 or 41.
Â Â  Mr President, I have learned from Guatemala that Ricardo de LeÃ³n Regil, the candidate for the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity, was brutally murdered on 16th of the month.
Ricardo de LeÃ³n Regil was a doctor whose work was widely recognised and valued.
He was a victim of the violent situation which developed in Guatemala in the past and which is becoming more acute now that the election process is under way.
The people of Guatemala, like other peoples in Latin America, have been tragically tried by foreign intervention and exploitation by the local oligarchy.
The people of Guatemala have been forced to follow the path of armed struggle in order to defend their fundamental rights.
Their hard fight led to the peace process and the government which emerged promised to promote certain reforms.
Six years later, not only have these reforms not been promoted, but poverty rules, while the leaders of the people are being murdered by paramilitaries who go unpunished.
Together with my condemnation, I should like to ask you to approach the Guatemalan authorities so that this heinous crime is fully investigated.
Â Â  I am certainly pleased to do that on behalf of the House, Mr Alyssandrakis.
Â Â  Mr President, I have taken the floor to speak about the internal organisation of Parliament.
I asked for access to these buildings for a , a person who is working with me on a voluntary basis, and the request was refused.
The reason I was given was that only accredited assistants are allowed access to the Strasbourg buildings outside part-sessions.
I feel this is a particularly absurd decision, Mr President.
The fact that we have two places of work is already absurd; for the Strasbourg site then to be completely closed to any possibility of work outside part-sessions for people who are not necessarily European Union employees, people officially registered as assistants, seems to me to be excessively bureaucratic.
I would ask you, Mr President, to do something about this kind of rule which has been established and get it changed.
Â Â  Mr Cappato, it is probably too early in the morning to start me on the subject of the two places of work, but concerning the specific request you make, I will ask the services today to make contact with you to try to examine the details of the case.
In consultation with you, we will endeavour to come to an appropriate solution that complies with the Rules of Procedure.(1)
Â Â  The next item is the Council and Commission statements â progress report on the Intergovernmental Conference including budgetary aspects.
I should like to inform colleagues in the House that over the past several weeks I have been making intensive political visits to a number of the capital cities of the countries whose Finance Ministers, at Ecofin, had sought to enter through the back door and remove from Parliament the delicate balance we had negotiated through the Convention.
This is an area where we, as an institution, need â to borrow a phrase â to 'put down some red lines'.
This is important for this Parliament, not for corporate reasons.
It goes to the very heart of the role of parliamentary democracy, of representative democracy and of public accountability.
The power of the purse has been a key defining issue in the history of parliamentarianism as it has evolved and we cannot countenance in this Parliament any institution by going backwards in the name of European progress for tomorrow.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to return to this House for an exchange of views on the developments that have taken place in the context of the Intergovernmental Conference since my last hearing on 5 November, directly following the IGC Ministerial Meeting of 18 November and just a few days before the Naples Conclave.
I feel I must begin by reiterating that the overall approach of the Italian Presidency remains that which my government has expressed many times in this House and in the context of the IGC itself.
We remain convinced that an ambitious agreement which meets the needs and expectations of an enlarged Europe can only be achieved by a text which strays as little as possible from the Convention's draft.
Periodic meetings with Parliament and with representatives of the national parliaments, as well as requests arriving from various European civil society structures, are confirmation of this conviction.
Some Member States within the Intergovernmental Conference seem, at times, to want to take a different direction and to be seeking to reopen the debate on many aspects of the Conventionâs draft.
I would, however, like to express a tentatively positive view in this regard.
For the legitimate purposes of negotiation tactics, some countries are maintaining reserved positions and insist on requesting changes âÂ some of them substantial âÂ to the balance achieved by the Convention.
Nevertheless, no Member State has called into question the objective âÂ which is also an imperative political need âÂ of bringing the Intergovernmental Conference to a successful conclusion within the timeframe suggested at Thessaloniki and confirmed at Brussels in October by our Heads of State and Government.
The very way the IGC is progressing is confirmation, moreover, of the intrinsic value of the Conventionâs draft: we have observed, on almost all the points discussed thus far, that a revisionist approach seeking to amend the Conventionâs draft text does not lead to consensus on alternative solutions but just widens the gaps between opposing positions.
It is my opinion, therefore, that, as we enter the final straits of the negotiations, each country will recognise the common benefits of an ambitious constitutionalisation of the integration process, despite the minor, specific sacrifices that some provisions may involve.
During yesterday's meeting, we debated, in particular, the role of the Union Foreign Minister and the issue of the revision of the Constitutional Treaty, taking note as well of a number of recommendations from the Danish government concerning the protocol relating to the opt-out clauses by which that country benefits with regard to Justice and Home Affairs.
The first point had already been addressed in previous meetings of the IGC.
The Presidency decided, therefore, to present a number of specific proposals based on the following principles: preserving the âdouble-hatâ formula devised by the Convention, with the clarification that the independence of the Commission Vice-President/Foreign Minister concerns the aspects associated with their Commission responsibilities and does not concern Council activities (for example, implementation of the common foreign and security policy and the Presidency of the General Affairs and External Relations Council); specifying the implications for the Foreign Minister in the event that the European Parliament were to adopt a motion of censure against the Commission; laying down explicitly that the President of the Commission cannot call for the resignation of the Vice-President/Foreign Minister without the agreement of the European Council; strengthening the provision giving the Vice-President/Foreign Minister the responsibility of ensuring consistency between the CFSP and the Union's external relations.
The presentationof these points âÂ fully in keeping with the approach defined by the Convention âÂ was welcomed by many Member States.
Of significance is the fact that the Presidency's proposals are headed in the right direction, including for those delegations hostile to the Conventionâs text.
Clearly, a definitive agreement on the duties of the future Foreign Minister cannot be taken out of the context of the agreement on the overall future institutional framework of the Union.
This is a matter to which we will return in the context of the Ministerial Conclave of 28-29 November and, subsequently, in the concluding session of the IGC at the level of Heads of State and Government.
The solution envisaged by the Convention for future revision of the Constitutional Treaty is based on two fundamental principles: the need for unanimous adoption and ratification for the formal revision of all the constitutional provisions, and the existence of , both general and specific, that, in clearly defined sectors, allow voting rules to be changed, to make the transition from unanimous to qualified majority voting, or the legislative procedure to be changed, moving from special to ordinary, which ensures absolute parity between the Council and the European Parliament, subject to the common agreement of all Member States in the European Council, consultation of the European Parliament and prior notification of the national parliaments.
The Presidency has proposed some adjustments to these mechanisms defined by the Convention, in order both to increase the involvement of the national parliaments in the process of activating the escalator clauses and to confirm the option of making the procedure for revising the Constitutional text less unwieldy with regard to a limited number of specific sections of the third part of the Constitutional Treaty.
Indeed, as Parliament has rightly pointed out, the procedure laid down by the Convention seems excessively rigid and is in danger of making the enlarged Union incapable of updating its own constitutional regulations even where minor provisions are concerned.
Yesterday's exchange of views confirmed that positions remain divergent on this point.
Nevertheless, we must persevere in our efforts to find common ground for an agreement which, taking the Convention as a starting point, reconciles the need for timely, effective involvement of the parliaments, essential for democratic legitimacy in a Union of States and citizens governed by the rule of the law, with the need to prevent rigidity in revision procedures that could impede the future development of a Union which now has a large number of Members.
In the course of yesterday's meeting, the Danish Foreign Minister drew the Conference's attention to the question of the Protocol governing the participation of Denmark in the Union's Justice and Home Affairs activities.
Indeed, the new structure of the Constitutional Treaty âÂ which leaves behind the dysfunctional, outdated pillar structure âÂ requires the revision of this Protocol, which was drawn up when judicial cooperation in criminal and police matters was still subject to intergovernmental procedures.
On the basis of the recommendations of the Danish government, in the next few days, we will draft an updated version of the Protocol that will have to fulfil a number of key requirements: adequate adaptation of the present âopt-outâ system to the legal framework that emerges from the Constitutional Treaty; the option for the Danish government to adopt an âopt-inâ formula in future on the basis of its own constitutional rules; compatibility of the Protocol with the pursuit of effective Union action in the field of justice and home affairs, to which the Convention text rightly attributed central importance.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are on the eve of the decisive phase of the negotiations underway in the Intergovernmental Conference.
In the forthcoming Naples Conclave, the Presidency will be presenting the text of the draft Constitutional Treaty reviewed by the group led by the Councilâs Legal Service with the input of all the Member States, the European Parliament and the Commission.
This impressive legal fine-tuning operation has produced an excellent result, improving the overall editorial quality of the Constitutional text as compared with the content approved by the Convention.
Again in Naples, the Presidency will submit a comprehensive proposal on the points which are still causing dispute in the constitutional negotiations in an effort to bring the positions of the Member States closer together.
The basis for this action will, in any case, remain adherence to the Conventionâs draft, which may be adapted, supplemented, clarified and elucidated, where necessary, but which can on no account be rewritten.
I would like to stress here, on behalf of my government, our determination to avoid watered-down compromises and to seek high-minded, noble solutions which are worthy of the democratic, open and transparent dialogue which took place in the Convention.
We are aware that the task we will have to carry out between now and the deadline of 12-13 December is sensitive and complex.
However, we have faith in the ability of Member Statesâ governments to meet the European citizensâ expectations of a more cohesive, authoritative and inclusive Europe: the expectations that Parliament has succeeded in interpreting so effectively, first in the Convention and then in the context of the Intergovernmental Conference, in which it has been fully involved.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission views the progress of the work of the Intergovernmental Conference with a feeling of growing concern and disquiet.
It is, of course, normal for the shape of a genuine compromise not to emerge until fairly late on in an intergovernmental conference, but what is not normal is for us to have an Intergovernmental Conference at which every meeting throws up more questions than it answers.
The Commission totally shares the view often heard in public debate that the very success of the Intergovernmental Conference is now at stake.
I support the observations of the Italian Presidency.
The IGC is now moving into a crucial phase, and one thing is quite clear: we need to prevent the overall compromise worked out by the Convention from being damaged in a tug of war between the interests of individual Member States, and we need to protect the institutional balance arrived at over 16 months of debate.
Let me remind you that there was a good reason why this draft Constitutional Treaty was worked out by a Convention, and not, as is usually the way, by a conference of diplomats and officials.
It was the result of the shock caused by the Nice process.
We need to be fully aware that we cannot steer a course towards a summit at which the Heads of State and Government once again sit together night after night nitpicking over the figures, only to achieve a result that they themselves find shocking.
We accepted the Treaty of Nice â and both Parliament and the Commission had reservations about it â because we needed it.
We needed that treaty in order to bring the massive historical project of enlargement to a conclusion on time.
I believe, however, that no one in this Chamber believes that the Treaty of Nice would be adequate to really make a European Union of 25 or 27 Member States genuinely viable.
We all know that we need a better treaty, and that time is pressing.
That is why the Commission is anxious for the work to be brought to a conclusion on time.
The enlargement process will be completed by 1Â May 2004, and by then we need to have reached political agreement on how we are to work together.
As regards the work now ahead of us, as the Commission sees it the main issue is to maintain and defend the considerable progress represented by the draft Constitutional Treaty.
In our view, the key progress made relates to the double majority, the introduction of the 50/60 rule, the extension of the use of majority voting, and giving the European Parliament a stronger role in the legislative process.
Given that overall the Constitutional Treaty represents a very carefully balanced compromise, each of the various sections in it must also be seen as striking a balance with its own internal logic, the details of which cannot be put at risk.
With reference to the discussion at yesterday's meeting of Foreign Ministers and to the statement we have just heard from the Italian Presidency, I would like to make the dual role of the future EU Foreign Minister very clear.
If we want to guarantee that the Union's foreign policy actions and its internal policies are coherent, it is essential for the EU Foreign Minister not only to have a mandate from the Council, but also, as Vice-President of the Commission, to be an integral part of the Commission, with full voting rights.
A Foreign Minister with, as it were, guest status within the Commission cannot play the required role here.
Any sort of special status for the Foreign Minister within the Commission would not sit well alongside his double legitimacy.
The finely balanced outcome of the Convention is also reflected in the three components of the Union's finances: own resources, multiannual financial framework, and the annual budget process.
Anyone concerned about a successful outcome from the Intergovernmental Conference should be careful not to unpick these agreements again.
In this area the Commission totally supports the idea that the Convention's draft also needs to be protected against the interests of those who see their national responsibilities as being pre-eminent, to put it very delicately.
