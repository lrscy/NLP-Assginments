This leads to the achievement of a new consistency between R&D, innovation policy, the internal market and the nuts and bolts of the Union, coupling a knowledge-based economy - which will be implicated here in the long term - with high employment and prosperity in our regions.
I also gladly subscribe to the transparency initiative put forward by Mrs HÃŒbner.
The people must know how relevant to them this policy is.
(ES) Madam President, I wish to begin my speech by thanking Mrs Kallenbach and Mr Guellec in particular for their work on these reports leading to a majority agreement within the context of the Committee on Regional Development.
European cohesion policy has been an example of a successful EU policy, which has abided by the principles on which it is based, and which has helped to remove inequalities.
Countries such as Spain have achieved indisputable results in terms of convergence thanks to the cohesion policy.
We would therefore reaffirm its role in enhancing the potential of Member States for development and job creation through progress in training human capital.
Nevertheless, we must also admit that territorial inequalities still exist, and therefore we must give a firm response if we are to move forward with a policy that has to tackle new challenges such as ageing or depopulation processes in certain areas, especially rural areas.
We must deal with the remaining challenges in order to reduce regional and interregional disparities and secure economic and technological growth, and this means that our focus on compliance with the Lisbon Strategy must be a priority issue, while not neglecting other matters such as demographic change.
If EU regional policy is to secure balanced sustainable development, it must be carried out in close cooperation with regional players and in coordination with other policies.
We are likewise aware of the need to push forward specific measures in order to reduce disparities between accessible regions and those with structural disadvantages: mountainous areas, islands, or sparsely populated areas.
With a view to the future, therefore, it is absolutely essential to reinforce cohesion policy with major economic resources to cope with all the challenges involved.
Yesterday we adopted the Lisbon Treaty in Parliament by a large majority, and today we must drive forward a new component of the Treaty, setting out territorial cohesion as a basic EU objective to make progress towards a more prosperous future for Europe.
(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to say, Commissioner, that as I listened to your reply to the two reports by our colleagues Mr Guellec and Mrs Kallenbach, I felt there would be no need for me to say anything at all, since it was so obvious you were showing you had fully understood us.
This is an initial stage, and I am extremely pleased and wish to congratulate the House since these close-knit reports between you, your associates, our committee and our Parliament have produced such a level of cohesion between our points of view.
Now, however, beyond this cohesion, we must move forward with implementation, for it is all well and good to achieve cohesion among ourselves, but this must produce some specific results.
I feel this is possible by means of the Green Paper you are drawing up for the autumn, and here I would like to mention two items dear to my heart, which in my view are essential to implement the entire cohesion policy and the Leipzig Charter we desire so much.
The two items are: firstly, the necessity, which you have already mentioned and which I wish to reiterate in the strongest terms, of showing how different EU policies must be made coherent at the level of urban and periurban areas.
Yesterday evening we were discussing population.
Yesterday afternoon we were discussing transport.
Before that we were discussing social issues.
All the Commission's DGs are involved, all the various EP Committees are involved ...
All this must be made coherent within the microterritory of a town and its surrounding area.
I expect a position to emerge from the Green Paper.
Second item.
How could we, Parliament and the Commission, if we agree on all this, succeed if we do not have European citizens and governments on board?
I have already told you, Commissioner, we must make a huge effort, and I know you are endeavouring to do so, in terms of communication, so that all our speeches, all our comments, all our hopes with regard to cohesion, emerge in words and phrases that will encourage governments to act and persuade and motivate our fellow citizens.
These are the two main points, Commissioner, that I expect to see in the Green Paper.
After listening to us, I trust you will help us find specific applications.
(PL) Madam President, Commissioner, one of the fundamental aims of the European Union is to even out differences in the development and income of individual countries and regions.
These differences have become more marked in recent years, because significantly less developed countries have joined the Union in the latest enlargements.
It is estimated that these countries are more than 15 years behind the others.
Swift development is the only way to level out the differences.
This represents a considerable challenge, especially taking into account the cuts in financial resources and the limited opportunities the countries striving to move forward have to make use of them.
It is unlikely that the success achieved in Spain, Portugal, Greece and Ireland will be repeated, certainly not quickly.
It is also unlikely that we will catch up with the United States and Japan in the near future.
We should remember, however, that the start is always the most difficult stage, and look to the Czech Republic for a positive example of how much can be achieved.
Our citizens' outlook on life has changed and is continuing to do so, which bodes well for the future.
In addition, the Lisbon Strategy lays down clear guidelines for our actions.
As I conclude, I should like to thank our rapporteurs most sincerely for their statements.
I see Mr MartÃ­nez is no longer in the Chamber, but I must add that I totally disagree with his intervention.
Madam President, it is nice to see the Commissioner here in Parliament.
We look forward to seeing her in Scotland again soon and to continuing our very fruitful cooperation on this policy.
Before I make my brief points, I would echo Mr Guerreiro's points about support for the fisheries sector within cohesion policy.
We will be supporting his amendments, and I do think this sector is of particular strategic importance in our geography.
I would pick up on the rapporteur's call for better statistics, particularly for the targeting and monitoring of the efficiency of funding programmes.
It seems pretty clear, as things develop, that targeting at NUTS I, NUTS II or even NUTS III level is pretty broad and pretty scatter-gun.
I welcome moves in the future funding streams towards more thematic activity, be it the Lisbon Agenda, the promotion of a knowledge economy, the promotion of R&D, cross-border cooperation or, indeed, support for the fisheries sector under the Lisbon Agenda.
That is, I believe, the future for a really vibrant cohesion policy for the European Union, which is very much the jewel in the EU's crown.
It has brought the EU closer to our citizens and it has made us one Union where the Member States would keep us a series of different states.
We have a great potential to make this policy even more relevant and we look forward to hearing about the Green Paper in the Commissioner's speech.
(GA) Mr President, the two reports given today show the necessity of the cohesion policy and how that policy should be implemented.
Balanced regional development is very important.
The focus of Mr Guellec's report was on ensuring that regional funds are sufficient and that they will focus on promoting the needs of the citizens and the needs of the regions effectively.
The only way to deal with a cohesion policy is as an implementation tool for the Lisbon Strategy.
I would like to thank the Rapporteur.
Ireland has benefited a great deal from cohesion money and in order for other countries to benefit in the same way we must ensure that increased resources are directed at promoting regional development and tackling social exclusion.
Not only must the gap between Member States be decreased but we must also decrease these gaps within Member States as well as the gaps between regions.
Mr Guellec reports on Ireland, Spain, Portugal and Greece's impressive growth rates between 2000 and 2006.
He has highlighted, however, that in spite of this growth, there are great inequalities between regions within those countries.
I would like to thank Mrs Kallenbach as well for her report and I especially welcome the emphasis placed on strengthening the role of local urban authorities in order to make access to public services available to every citizen.
There is a need for local empowerment, respect for the environment and a high standard of public services to be universally available so that the urban environment is an attractive place to live and work in.
Sustainable development is a huge challenge within urban areas in the 21st Century and the framework presented to us today by Mrs Kallenbach can help us to face this challenge.
Madam President, these reports comment on the disparity between the rural and urban economies, between rich and poor, especially in eastern Europe, and between the disadvantaged and the rest of society.
The answer, apparently, is to offer a vast catalogue of cultural, economic, technical developments and social engineering provision.
It notes the success of such programmes in Ireland, Spain, Portugal and Greece to relieve these inequalities and encourages similar strategies, frameworks and action programmes to generate progress in affected areas, especially in eastern Europe.
Above all it mentions cohesion funds.
We get to the nub.
EUR 65 billion on such programmes in needy western countries in the last few years, but eastern Europe is much poorer than those countries ever were.
So these subsidies - for that is what they are - will be taken from those countries still receiving them and from an ever smaller pot as the chill economic winds from the USA reach us.
Unfortunately for all its citizens - the well off and the poor alike - these subsidies are self-defeating for they strip away initiative from people and produce a culture of dependency.
If you really want to help, listen to Professor Buchanan of the London School of Economics.
His paper states clearly that 'to help a poor country, trade is worth six times more than aid'.
Will you ever learn that?
Or, to put it another way, if, in a poor country, you give a starving man a fish, you feed him for a day.
Teach him how to fish and you feed him for life.
(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the fact that the Fourth Report on Economic and Social Cohesion is of major political significance certainly does not need to be repeatedly underlined here.
I agree with the rapporteur on all the basic issues and congratulate him on his good work.
He rightly emphasises that the anticipated new challenges can be dealt with only if cohesion policy remains a Community policy, which is anyway in accordance with the Treaty.
His report clearly rejects, therefore, all attempts to renationalise this policy.
The prerequisite, however, is a balanced cohesion budget for the EU.
Yes, adequate resources must be available in order to safeguard the harmonious development of all regions in the EU and deal with the new challenges.
A different view exists, however, regarding the choice of wording in the report on the demand for financial resources for cohesion policy post-2013.
Like many of my colleagues, I do not feel it is right that at this early stage, in 2008, the report should contain anticipatory demands for more financial resources for the future, not least in view of the fact that we are quite rightly facing criticism that we do not always draw down, on time, all the funding which is already available.
The Committee has therefore found good compromise wording which, however, only applies to the text of the resolution and not to the recitals.
So we should not include any conflicting statements in the recitals, but should remain consistent with the wording 'adequate resources for a balanced cohesion policy'.
Ultimately, this is about credibility: in the past, cohesion policy has been able to achieve sustainable successes and can do so in future too if it is adequately resourced, without our calling for more financial resources at this stage.
Commissioner, you referred in your introductory statement to adequate financial resources to deal with future challenges.
That is a good formula.
(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is hands that build the town, and men that build the city.
Jean-Jacques Rousseau must certainly have favoured the integrated approach.
It is a method that falls directly within the scope of this approach of building cities and not fragmented towns, as set out in the Leipzig Charter and the Territorial Agenda.
I therefore wish to thank all those responsible, especially Mrs Kallenbach, for their excellent cooperation on this task.
I welcome the scope of the proposals in relation to social and economic aspects, the environment, spatial development and territorial cohesion, and likewise the close attention paid to proposals intended to improve the report submitted by our Socialist Group.
Paying closer attention to the territorial and urban dimensions of EU policies, especially through integrated development plans and better cooperation between urban and periurban areas, will draw all the benefits out of this integrated approach.
Cooperation, however, must not end there.
Provision must also be made for a relationship or some kind of connection between rural areas, urban and periurban areas.
Here I must stress the importance of stimulating the attractiveness and competitiveness of rural areas as a tool to combat the mass exodus from the countryside.
If the main points in this report had to be specified, my first mention would be the urgent need to create integrated multimodal transport networks supported by Europe to improve infrastructures, especially environment-friendly transport such as bicycles and walking.
Identifying the signs of decline in certain areas and stepping up work to implement a social integration policy constitute a framework for a public policy to reduce inequality in an efficient manner and prevent social exclusion.
Positioning human beings at the very centre of the construction of infrastructure policies by reconciling urban concerns with human concerns, and all the more so within the current context of a housing crisis, in a society where not everyone has a roof over their head, and placing more emphasis on decent affordable housing, are still essential, and constitute a crucial factor of social integration and standards of living in cities, within a context of sustainable urban development.
It is for this reason that I call on all my colleagues to vote en masse in favour of this report, which demonstrates the EP's wish to support the sturdiest form of territorial cohesion and a comprehensive integrated approach that will finally allow us to build the city.
Mr President, it is difficult to single out any one thing from these two excellent reports, but I wish to express particular thanks to Mr Guellec for the extent to which his report addresses the issue of disparities within regions.
For, even in those that can be classified as relatively prosperous overall, there may still be certain groups that are disadvantaged or excluded.
This may be a matter of their territorial location.
Inhabitants of islands and mountainous and scarcely-populated border and peripheral areas can be cases in point.
So, too, can fisheries-dependent communities, particularly when they are to be found in areas of the kind just mentioned.
Which is why I, too, very much hope that Parliament will approve Amendments 19 and 20, which seek to reinforce their position.
But disadvantage and exclusion may be at a more distinctly social level.
I am thinking of a project back home in Aberdeenshire called Can-Do.
It has provided occupation for people with learning difficulties, in sorting cans and bottles for recycling.
It lost eligibility for European support when funding for the current period was relocated to parts of the country where deprivation is more widespread.
But the people concerned remain just as much at risk of social exclusion as before.
Both examples show that, if we are to target funding at those most in need, we need to develop a more sophisticated approach to quantifying that need.
I ask the Commission to pay particular attention to the call in the report for improved statistical tools to allow more accurate measurement of the extent of cohesion and better assessment of the contributions of local actions aimed at achieving it.
Such tools would also allow us to pinpoint actual cases of disadvantage and decide how they can best be addressed.
(PL) Mr President, cohesion policy makes a crucial contribution to the integration of societies within the Union, as is emphasised in the report.
Nonetheless, administrative and procedural obstacles preventing regions with weaker infrastructures from attaining the level of developed ones continue to multiply.
Who is such a complicated procedure for mobilising Union resources supposed to help?
After all, in the case of road infrastructure, funds could be transferred directly to the relevant local authority departments that are under the control of institutions in the Member States.
It would not then be necessary to wait several years for construction or repair work to take place.
Clearly, other principles must apply regarding individuals, law firms and associations.
If we really want to achieve something in the less developed regions, we should transfer targeted aid to local authority budgets, even without input from their own resources, because sometimes they cannot afford even a small contribution as they are so poor.
(PL) Mr President, Commissioner, the report by Mr Guellec presents the European Parliament's position on the Fourth Report on Economic and Social Cohesion.
The latter contains information and analysis regarding the effectiveness of cohesion policy.
In effect, pursuant to the procedure adopted, it represents the first stage in the debate on cohesion policy in the new programming period.
Mr Guellec's report therefore presents proposals as well as opinions on the analysis.
The debate on the future of cohesion policy must take account of the new conditions and challenges.
Ongoing implementation of the Lisbon Strategy, climate change, changes in energy policy and appreciation of the implications of migratory processes mean that the European Union is facing new challenges.
All this also means that action must be taken to reduce new disparities in development.
Obviously the question arises as to which actions should be financed from common funds and which should be undertaken as Union policy.
In the debate on the future of cohesion policy we refer to the debate on the future of the European Union.
We often speak of a so-called Union of action or Union of results and of a Union such that it is appreciated and accepted by its citizens.
At the same time, we are aware that so-called reformers are promoting new solutions, such as, for example, renationalising cohesion policy.
In essence, that would amount to negating the policy of solidarity.
We must bear in mind that the Member States are implementing their own internal policies to narrow disparities and that they are doing so independently of European funding, drawing on their own resources.
The richer countries are therefore proving most successful.
In effect, renationalisation will amount to restricting cohesion policy and we must oppose that.
Accordingly, if we want to create a so-called Union of results or Union of action, we must strengthen cohesion policy.
Mr President, the fourth cohesion report provides evidence of the positive effects of EU cohesion policy, so the EU must continue to assist EU regions to achieve economic and social prosperity and convergence.
We are now addressing new challenges, and have agreed that our efforts must be directed towards dealing with these.
However, I would like to emphasise a problem we addressed in July 2007 in the form of the resolution adopted on the poorest regions in the EU.
Unfortunately, no further attention was given to that important issue.
Just as the outermost regions have had a special strategy, we now need priority treatment and a strategic approach for the least prosperous regions, in order to overcome their specific difficulties, which are a combination of socioeconomic problems and territorial and spatial characteristics.
I hope the Commissioner will address that issue in her Green Paper.
Therefore, I strongly support the future implementation of cohesion policy in its three dimensions - economic, social and territorial - which could stand as a successful example of the European Union's solidarity principle.
Mr President, first of all I would like to congratulate both rapporteurs.
Mr Guellec's report highlights the fact that, while there is economic convergence occurring between Member States, there is also a widening of regional and local disparities.
That situation goes to the very heart of cohesion policy and clearly indicates the need to include a significant territorial dimension in all policies, but particularly in the Lisbon Strategy.
I have seen this situation occurring in my own country, Ireland, where convergence with the EU average has been achieved - indeed surpassed - but where the economic gap between different regions is widening.
It is extremely important that this gap does not continue to widen, and one of the ways of ensuring this is to increase investment in innovation, research and development in those regions that are lagging behind.
I want to thank Mr Guellec for including my suggestion on the importance of social capital in boosting regional economic growth.
We are all aware of the role played by physical capital, natural capital and human capital as the basis for economic growth and development.
However, social capital, which is the latent resource residing within and among cooperating groups, provides the added value.
Data from the UN Handbook, which relates to a very significant number of countries, indicates that the contribution of social capital to economic growth is in the order of 5% of GDP.
Finally, in response to the comment by Mr Clark, who suggests we should have 'trade not aid', I would say that in the EU we manage both - trade via the single market and targeted aid where needed.
That is the best of both worlds.
(PL) Mr President, Commissioner, the scope of this report is so broad that I shall limit myself to commenting on a couple of issues.
One of the main challenges facing the development of the Union is the swift spread of built up areas, together with energy consumption, transport and demographic changes, such as the depopulation of certain parts of the Union and the widening disparity between richer areas and less affluent ones.
An integrated development policy focusing mainly on modernising infrastructure, improving energy efficiency and introducing cheap environmentally-friendly transport will help to ensure continuity in this sector.
Another aim of the strategy in question ought to be focusing on the development of rural areas so as to make them more competitive, and thus slow down the depopulation of those areas, which is so significant for the new Member States.
I would also like to draw attention to the importance of cooperation between urban and rural areas in order to promote the development of the territory as a whole.
Access to information and communication technology should play a vital part in creating territorial cohesion and developing individual areas, and that is where our greatest problem currently lies.
(DE) Mr President, first of all, as regards Mrs Kallenbach's report and the Leipzig Charter, yes, we must consider spatial planning in a European context to a greater extent.
But does this require new European powers in respect of housing policy and spatial planning?
There is a very big question mark here, to my mind.
As regards Mr Guellec's report and specifically the prospects for future structural policy, the regional challenges posed by globalisation, demography, climate change, migration and so forth are all accurately described.
The same applies to the political outlook.
We should stick to the tried and tested objectives of structural policy, and we should supplement them with these new components.
I welcome the integrated approach advocated by the rapporteur, also as regards the challenges arising in relation to rural development.
However, we should be focusing, as a general principle, on the European value-added of these programmes to a greater extent.
Whether in relation to cohesion, innovation or transnational funding, Europe should only be providing support where we can genuinely make a sustainable European contribution.
To achieve success in the future, we must also be looking more critically at the instruments hitherto deployed.
The one-off operational subsidy does not create any European value-added, whereas long-term expansion of research, education and infrastructure certainly does!
We can only enhance the efficiency of structural policy through greater transparency in the deployment of funding and through leverage effects, for example by funding loans and with more public-private partnerships.
Although we certainly have not exploited all our options here, I cannot support the rapporteur's blanket call for more money from 2014.
We need to evaluate the current period first of all, and we need to gear our instruments more efficiently towards challenges such as climate change and demography.
Then we can start demanding a budgetary contribution.
The blank cheque for the future currently being demanded in the report really cannot be taken seriously.
I therefore ask you to support our amendment in the vote.
(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, I must firstly congratulate the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteur of my Group, Mr Guellec and Mrs GarcÃ­a, on the quality of the report and their openness to dialogue on cohesion.
The report rightly recognises the enormous efforts made (particularly in Portugal, Spain, Greece and Ireland) in terms of growth and convergence.
However, these efforts must be continued and expanded, not just in those countries which are most lacking solidarity and cohesion, but also in certain regions of those countries as the wealth assessment process cannot solely depend on GDP but must be extended to other criteria.
In this respect, I made contributions aimed at clearly recognising insularity and remoteness as factors restraining development.
In particular, in accordance with Article 299(2) of the EC Treaty and as stated by Commissioner HÃŒbner, accessibility problems form one of the main obstacles to development.
This is why it is essential to adapt the Community policies to take account of this constraint resulting from insularity and remoteness.
(FI) Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to bring the northern viewpoint to this debate.
It is important that the permanent problems of the north - the long distances, the cold climate and the sparse population - are taken account of in the future as factors that need support just as much as the problems of the mountain regions and islands do.
It is also worth remembering that the northern regions produce added value in areas such as mining, wood processing and tourism.
Research in the north and new technology applications in cooperation with universities, businesses, the public sector and consumers continually produce fresh and important innovations, from which the whole of Europe benefits.
I would also like to remind everyone of the opportunities afforded by combining the Baltic Strategy with the Northern Dimension in, for example, the utilisation of energy resources in the Barents region.
Finally, I want to congratulate the rapporteurs on their excellent reports and thank Commissioner HÃŒbner for her interest in the northernmost corner of the Union.
- (EL) Mr President, Commissioner, I should also like to congratulate the two rapporteurs on their very important reports.
Cohesion policy is important because it has helped in the economic and social development of many regions.
It has reduced the gaps between regions, brought regions closer to the norm and reduced disparities within them.
There is still much to be done.
Uniform development has not been attained.
There are divergences, which are acute in many cases.
Any thought of a renationalising cohesion policy ought to be rejected.
New Member States have joined, with regions that are very far removed from the norm.
The term 'territorial cohesion' described in the Lisbon Treaty needs to be worked on and further analysed.
Finally, particular attention ought to be paid to isolated regions and islands, as in the case of Greece, where cohesion policies will significantly help the local population to stay put, find employment, have access to new technology and professional opportunities, and to comply to the Community norm.
For these reasons, the terms in the cohesion policy report are correct: funding will need to be secured and increased, even for the period after 2013.
The challenges are significant and the cohesion policy ought not to fall short or be delayed because of financial inadequacy when all parties recognise its usefulness.
In closing, I also welcome today's statements by Commissioner HÃŒbner and the Commission's determination to progress with the cohesion policy.
We await with interest the Green Paper and the conclusions that it will contain.
(PL) Mr President, Commissioner, reducing the social and economic disparities between European regions is a fundamental aim of the European Union.
We are aiming to create a Europe where all regions are equal.
Following the latest enlargements, it has become increasingly necessary to strengthen the cohesion aim.
This is because, according to certain estimates, at the present rate of economic growth, countries such as Poland, Bulgaria and Romania will take more than 15 years to reach a level of GDP equal to 75% of the average for the Union.
Full use of structural funds pursuant to Community legislation is a sine qua non for reducing social and economic disparities between European regions.
This applies especially to the new Member States.
The latter are experiencing many problems.
For example, Polish local authorities have recently had to cope with difficulties caused by the continuous fall in the value of the euro in relation to the Polish currency, thus reducing the actual value of Union funds allocated to the implementation of regional projects that had already been confirmed.
In addition, the cost of labour and production in Europe is constantly rising, which leads to an increase in the cost of investments funded from Union resources and to a reduction in the value of those funds in real terms.
Consequently, implementation of many Union projects is threatened.
(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I must firstly highlight the excellent work carried out by Mr Guellec and the intelligent and determined manner in which he emphasised and defended the optimisation and reinforcement after 2013 of a policy of solidarity towards the European regions.
In truth, with this report, more than with the assessment of the cohesion policy's impact in 2000-2006, we have opened the debate on what type of cohesion policy we want for post-2013.
Accordingly, I must make one comment on the present and three on the future.
My first comment is that, as shown by the Fourth Report, the cohesion policy continues to be essential for reducing disparities between the levels of development of the various regions and for encouraging the least-favoured regions that are lagging behind or, in other words, for creating a European Union that is more harmonious and viable and has a greater sense of solidarity.
However, we should not forget that, in addition to this essential objective, the cohesion policy has made a decisive contribution to the construction and expansion of the internal market, to the success of the successive enlargements, to the creation and consolidation of the single currency and to the increasing identification of citizens with the European Union.
My second comment is that the cohesion policy must now revamp its role, boosted and reinforced by the new territorial dimension to cohesion enshrined in the Treaty of Lisbon, by taking advantage of the diversity and complementarity of the territories and by firmly targeting the polycentric development of the European Union.
The report by Mrs Kallenbach, who I also congratulate, offers us some good guidelines in this respect.
My third comment is that the cohesion policy must increasingly encompass and respond to the current challenges such as those represented by globalisation, migration, population ageing, climate change, energy diversification, research and technological development.
In order to be coherent, we must therefore consider increased resources for a reinforced regional policy.
Finally, a new perspective for the most remote regions will be necessary to guarantee that these can continue feeling comfortable within the European area.
It will be vital to find new answers to the serious problems, such as isolation, lack of accessibility and competitive disadvantages, that these regions face.
(HU) Thank you very much, Mr President.
Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate Mrs Kallenbach and Mr Guellec on their excellent reports, both of which are milestones in the debate on cohesion policy.
There are significant differences in the development of our regions, but if we look into it more deeply there are even greater chasms between individual areas within the regions.
We have not managed to deal appropriately with liquidating rural poverty and bringing into line those areas that have fallen behind, within the framework of agricultural policy.
There is a need for much greater effort in this area, within the framework of a renewed, integrated cohesion policy that is capable of turning round the negative processes in the areas that are growing poor.
The synergy between cohesion and the reinforcement of competitiveness must be strengthened, because they cannot be subordinated to each other.
New challenges have emerged, such as ageing or even the matter of energy efficiency and climate change, which we must also deal with.
For this very reason it is vital to reinforce cohesion policy, and we must reject its being put at national level.
If we put solidarity and cohesion at the heart of the European project, the Union will truly be strong and competitive.
Thank you for your attention.
(SK) Ladies and gentlemen, the well-planned and responsible development of urban areas is becoming extremely important, in particular in the face of challenges such as congestion of urban transport networks, environmental damage and land development.
This is why I very much appreciate the adoption of the Territorial Agenda and the Leipzig Charter.
Cities have a unique responsibility for climate protection: this protection should be a priority at all political levels.
Cities could help solve a bad traffic situation and lower global emissions causing the greenhouse effect by, for example, interconnecting different modes of transport and developing an infrastructure for cyclists and pedestrians.
I would also suggest that cities prioritise energy-efficient buildings and use already existing buildings for new purposes, instead of developing new sites.
I would like to stress that not only metropolitan regions but also suburban areas and rural areas are successful in meeting cohesion goals.
This is why I appeal to the Commission to monitor such successful projects and to prepare, on their basis, a development model for smaller and medium-sized towns outside metropolitan areas.
One of the characteristics of Europe, in spite of its relatively small size, is her geographical diversity.
This is why it is necessary to be mindful of unique regional features and resulting differences, and to give people in different regions the chance to make use of the unique opportunities and potential offered by the areas in which they live.
To me it is also very important to include, among our policy goals, the need to solve territorial issues relating to islands and mountain areas, border regions and sparsely populated regions, so that the quality of life of people who live there is also enhanced.
To conclude I would like to stress that urban development must follow an integrated and well-coordinated strategy, supported at all levels by both the government and the private sector.
(SK) Thank you, Mr President.
We are debating the Fourth Report on Economic and Social Cohesion and the reports by Mrs Kallenbach and Mr Guellec at a time when the first subjects for the 2014-2020 budget plan are beginning to emerge.
I would like to link the two and to emphasise the importance of such a link.
I do not fear that cohesion policy funding will disappear from the budget plan but I would not like to see the extent of this fund during the life of the next budget in any way reduced.
In addition to that, as the rapporteurs rightly point out, major regional disparities still exist, including structural problems, and since this situation has worsened due to enlargement, it is necessary to contemplate giving more weight to this chapter of the budget.
As the reports correctly point out, the situation is so complex that we cannot solve it at Commission level.
Although governments of the Member States play an important role in this matter, it is becoming more and more clear that it will not be possible to solve the problem without the participation of regional and local authorities.
Their role lies not only in the possible synergy between them and the government in the process of making decisions on the issues of development in their territories but also in the responsibility for this development and, last but not least, in providing feedback about how development and cohesion are progressing.
Who can provide more information about the real development in a region, if not the people who live in it?
Therefore I appeal to the Commission not only to include in its monitoring process the macro-economic indicators but to be creative and to draw on such information...
(The President cut off the speaker)
Mr President, first of all I would like to give my congratulations to the rapporteurs for their excellent reports.
I would also like to say that I understand the passion of Members from the new Member States.
I know that it is far from easy to satisfy your constituents back in your own Member State, but you are now part of the European Union and, as such, like the rest of us, you will at times not get everything that you would like or want.
I have to say to those who are merely playing on words that the difference between increased resources and sufficient resources is very small indeed.
I certainly will be supporting the wording of 'sufficient resources'.
Sometimes it is wise to recognise what you have achieved and bank it.
I personally support the use at this time of the word 'sufficient', especially when many of the funds in those areas have not been spent.
I only wish that my own region was half as lucky - we never were - in achieving such help.
We are now even as far behind as some of the countries were that we are talking about.
(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, I should also like to congratulate the rapporteurs on their excellent work on these two reports.
Once again, the European Parliament is confirming its very clear position on the importance and role of the cohesion policy, which brings Europe closer to its citizens.
This is a policy with very clear added value for the whole of the EU.
In future, this policy should not just be maintained; it should be strengthened with the requisite resources.
Both reports point to this approach.
I should like to highlight the importance of:
the partnership and participation of local authorities in particular, at all levels,
synergies between Community policies, particularly the cohesion policy, and the rural development policy,
planning policies and actions that promote the polycentric development of EU territories, with special emphasis on the countryside,
the important potential role of small and medium-sized towns, and finally,
combating intra-regional inequalities, youth unemployment and the high levels of poverty to be found in many regions of the EU.
(BG) Regardless of the existing difference of viewpoints, let us recall the raison d'etre of the cohesion policy and its objectives, i.e. it embodies the hopes for more prosperity and better all-European future.
All Europeans strive for better life and the cohesion policy is the instrument to support them in these efforts.
Let us remember that there are a lot of differences within the European Union and, at the same time, financial resources tend to dwindle.
Therefore I believe that the cohesion policy must be reinforced and strengthened.
I also believe that it is worthwhile to ensure its optimal implementation.
Some procedures and rules are still too complex and, probably for this reason, inefficient.
A procedure like an overall review of the cohesion policy could contribute to its general improvement to the benefit of all Europeans.
Finally, I would like to reiterate the important role of the cohesion policy for the least developed regions.
The citizens who live there believe in the EU support.
We must not let them down.
(PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the cohesion policy, which is a Community policy par excellence, has a vital role to play in achieving a Europe which offers solidarity, which is close to the people and which is by everyone and for everyone.
It is a clear manifestation of the importance of the Union to the everyday lives of every European citizen.
The enlargement to 27 brought about changes in the nature of Europe.
The goals now being set are different from those which existed at its genesis.
The challenges to which we must now respond, such as globalisation, population falls, desertification of certain regions or climate change, combined with the increased frequency and scale of natural disasters, are much more demanding and require a greater effort on our part.
Innovation is also giving this policy new goals but, despite facing greater challenges and a larger Union, its budget has not increased in proportion.
However, it has been adapted, in the name of solidarity, which has led, for example, to regions which were previously in Objective 1 now being regarded as wealthy regions not eligible due to the statistical effect.
It is therefore imperative that the disparities are reduced through access to an adequate budget, without having to abandon certain regions in this vast Union to their fate.
The adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon reinforced this need and firmly enshrined in law the territorial cohesion which is the most important aspect of the cohesion policy.
It is essential that this policy tackles not only economic and social cohesion, but also solidarity between regions ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
Mr President, I welcome the opportunity to speak briefly on the future of cohesion policy, which is of crucial importance to old and new Member States alike.
I work closely with Scottish local government bodies on their concerns, and was delighted that the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (COSLA) recently welcomed the draft EU Treaty as far as local government is concerned.
The Treaty recognises the principle of local self-government, as well as that of territorial cohesion.
It was no surprise to me that regional policy was among the five key areas recently raised with me by the COSLA.
In the context of reduced EU structural monies and funds, regional development monies must be better targeted - as many speakers have said - at local areas and local authorities, which must be the key deliverers of those funds.
The Guellec report reinforces the role of local authorities in delivering Structural Funds - after all, we forget at our peril that all politics are local.
(RO) Mr. President, Madam Commissioner, the reports we debate and for which I congratulate both rapporteurs raise a few extremely important questions, in my opinion: that of the partnerships between the urban and the rural areas for the balanced and sustainable development of the overall territory, the issue of the chaotic extension of urban settlements that generate fragmentation of the landscape, as well as the continuous loss of land.
All these things, together with climate changes, and depopulation of rural areas, are challenges we are forced to take into consideration, both at a European level and at the level of local administrations managing these policies.
As a Romanian Member of the Parliament, I strongly support the idea that not only the metropolitan areas have potential for innovation and I ask the Commission to work more intensively towards drawing up a development for small and medium-sized towns in rural areas.
(PL) Thank you, Mr President.
The Fourth Report on Economic and Social Cohesion is more detailed than its predecessors.
It is based on many indicators and provides useful comparative data, referring also to countries such as the United States, Japan, China and India.
From its inception, cohesion policy has played an important role in strengthening the ability of all the Member States to promote harmonious development and create new and permanent jobs.
It is rather too early to assess the results of cohesion policy in the new Member States of the Union, but there is cause for concern regarding the obvious delays in use of current structural funding in those countries.
Convergence between countries often masks deepening differences between regions and within them.
Regional and local disparities are arising in many areas, affecting employment and also productivity, income, level of education and potential for innovation.
Social integration and the policy of equal opportunities must be taken into account at every stage of the implementation of projects undertaken in the area of cohesion.
I trust that the forthcoming review of the financial framework will result in the budgetary resources needed to rise to the ambitious challenges of the new cohesion policy for the enlarged Union being made available, thus ensuring that all citizens ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
Mr President, I commend both reports, but would at the same time like to draw attention to a contrasting view, linking industrial relocation inside the EU and structural and cohesion fund policy.
Structural Funds can be seen as an overall subsidy provided by the EU to the less developed areas.
Should we understand that this regional cohesion policy is questioned by leading politicians in leading EU Member States?
What should happen?
Should areas in the less developed Member States of the EU stop the development of infrastructure for fear of being accused of unfair competition?
I refer to a Financial Times article published the Monday before last, to the effect that a market economy should not be a jungle.
Public policies do have a role to play, and not only for social reasons.
However, we should keep our poise because there is no infallible local or national economy in this world, and however much we believe in social justice, not all citizens can always be winners at the same time, in the same place and all the time.
(HU) Thank you very much for the floor, Mr President, Madam Commissioner.
There can be no doubt about the importance and success of cohesion policy.
I feel that this is supported by the report, on which I would like to congratulate the rapporteur.
Its aim is to create real alignment, but it is vital that the sums set aside for this are used effectively.
I am convinced that a project waiting to be implemented is not rendered valuable by the very fact of how large a material sum we set aside for it, but that its value lies in how effective it is.
Effectiveness can be measured in two ways: by how it serves alignment and by how well the given sums of money are used for similar things in individual countries.
After all, a given project in a Member State cannot receive many more times the amount of another one.
I would like to draw your attention to this measurement and, in future, to the fact that effectiveness is the basis for strengthening cohesion policy.
Thank you very much.
(DE) Mr President, when does the citizen need Europe's solidarity?
When does a Member State need Europe's solidarity?
Surely, in the first instance, during a disaster.
That is why I find it incomprehensible that a decision adopted by Parliament in 2006 to adapt the Solidarity Fund - as set out in paragraph 45 of the Cohesion Report - has still not been implemented.
So I ask everyone - Parliament and the Commission - to bring pressure to bear on the Council to resolve this issue very quickly, for the next disaster will come, that I can guarantee.
(SK) If cohesion policy is to be implemented successfully, there must be local players capable of action who are able to concentrate their efforts and make maximum use of European funds.
This is why the Member States should decentralise administration, increase administrative capacities at a regional level and cut down on excessive bureaucracy in cohesion policy management.
Although the process of dividing sectors into clusters and innovation poles, which brings clear benefits to larger sectors and their neighbours, may lead to the discovery of several integration zones, there is an absence of effective, simple and spatial support for smaller sectors.
In Slovakia a number of communities that have less than 2 000 inhabitants and are in geographically disadvantaged regions will lose their places in several operational programmes and in cohesion policy.
I appeal to the Member States to provide a non-discriminatory system for all their regions so that everyone can actively participate in the application of cohesion policy.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, I am the rapporteur for urban mobility.
In our deliberations, the issue of the relationship between the urban centres and the municipalities on the periphery plays an especially important role.
We are also aware of the fact that the new Member States have particularly serious problems here in organising their infrastructure in such a way that we can maintain more environmentally-friendly transport options and do not move towards private vehicles again.
In this context, may I voice a specific request: that within the framework of its regional policy options, the Commission helps us to seek and identify solutions to the issue of transport in the urban periphery and to social cohesion in the new Member States.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to take this opportunity at the end of the debate to thank Members for all their contributions.
There are many points to which I cannot respond now, owing to the lack of time, but which I will take with me.
These include the concerns expressed with regard to small and medium-sized towns, as well as the issue raised about urban transport development.
There is a clear link between the past and the future in your reports.
You are in fact building a bridge, which is why I would like to say a few words on the stage reached in the public consultations on the future of European cohesion policy.
We launched those consultations at the end of September 2007, and to date more than 100 well-elaborated statements and opinions have been submitted, not only by national, regional and local governments, but also by a number of European spatial planning associations, as well as economic and social partners, academics, research institutions and private citizens.
At the request of one of the governments, we have extended the consultations until mid-February, because there are still opinions being prepared.
A preliminary assessment of those opinions clearly shows there is overwhelming and impressive support for the policy.
The direct impact on growth and development is pointed to, as is the fact that this is a policy that triggers new ways of thinking and also performs a very effective leverage role by attracting additional financial resources.
There is strong interest in the delivery mechanism and broad support for all the principles we have jointly developed with the European Parliament in recent years.
There is also strong support for the need for this policy to respond to the challenges that you have been discussing today, and which are linked not only to globalisation, but also to demography, climate and energy, and restructuring in general, with strong support for the integrated approach.
One of the issues of importance you have raised today is how we will proceed with the Green Paper, which will be adopted by the Commission in September.
We will then have a broad period - probably of four months - for discussion in all formats, not only on the web.
In the mean time, our services are organising a meeting with the key stakeholders for mid-April.
This will help us to take into account further views.
I would be prepared, if there is such a need, to organise a hearing with Parliament's Committee on Regional Development and with any other institution interested in sharing with us its views on the Green Paper, ahead of its adoption by the Commission.
Another issue raised, which is also a concern for the Commission, was that of statistics and indicators.
Through our analytical institution, ESPON, which we have strengthened very substantially, including financially, for the years to come, and which now has a significantly higher budget, we will endeavour to measure some of the new dimensions and some of the existing dimensions of territorial cohesion.
That work is ongoing, and we hope to have the results soon.
I can assure you that the Commission will also continue to look into appropriate indicators to complement both the GDP and employment indicators, and will in the Fifth Cohesion Report propose a new composite type of indicator.
Thank you very much for all your comments.
I would especially like to thank the rapporteurs for their contributing to the debate - not just in the past, but also in the future.
rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, I will be brief.
First of all, in relation to the observations made on the amendments submitted by the Committee on Fisheries, I must say immediately that fishing is an issue dear to my heart as a coastal MEP, but unfortunately we did not manage to add the committee's amendments to the text that is about to be put to the vote.
We regret this, but I feel it does not mean any less attention ought to be paid to a sector so important to certain EU regions.
I would also like to say that cohesion is a major European policy.
I also think it was portrayed as a major theme in the House this morning.
This is an important point, particularly in relation to future tasks.
The Commissioner said earlier that we are dealing with a report, but obviously it is the future that interests us.
She realises expectations are running high with regard to territorial cohesion, and what this represents once it is taken up in the Lisbon Treaty.
We might say that the ball is now in the Commission's court with, of course, our assistance and support, Commissioner.
The job must be done, and it must be done well, on a joint basis.
I wish to add that the fact that regional policy as a whole will now be a matter for codecision by the Council and Parliament will help us move forward together, to make this clearer for our fellow citizens, also a point I feel was solidly made this morning, and also to implement genuine solidarity to the benefit of regions which need it most. Both these concerns were pointed out most firmly this morning.
A huge task therefore awaits us.
We welcome a policy that is essential to the European Union.
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, I would also like to voice my thanks for the valuable contributions and support of many of my fellow Members.
I think it has been shown that on the one hand, we must maintain solidarity as a key European asset, and that on the other hand, we must target and deploy our instruments - in this case, cohesion policy - far more efficiently towards genuinely sustainable development, and thirdly, that we must genuinely communicate with citizens from the outset.
I would particularly like to thank Commissioner HÃŒbner.
Commissioner, you have made it clear that, together with this House, you are interested in the practical steps: the integrated approach, indicators which produce measurable outcomes, the definition of the territorial dimension, the Green Paper.
I think we will particularly need your help in ensuring that the Council is on board.
Again, I think it is regrettable that no one from the Council is present at this important debate.
The conclusions drawn in these two reports must lead to an amendment of the Lisbon Strategy and must genuinely underpin the new Community objective, the territorial dimension, in practical terms; otherwise, they will be nothing but empty words.
Let me make one final appeal to my fellow Members before the vote: let us be practical.
Let's not only review and analyse again; let's make it a condition that we demand the integrated approach for the provision of funding from the Structural Funds, and let us establish clear commitments for the reduction of greenhouse gases as well.
Climate protection must be implemented in the cities; otherwise, all our pledges at European and national level have no value at all.
The debate is closed.
The reports will be put to the vote, which will begin in a few minutes.
Written Statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - (PL) The economic and social cohesion policy is the foundation of European solidarity.
This feature of European policy is the envy of regional integration initiatives in other parts of the world.
The unique nature of the European project is largely due precisely to the notion of cohesion.
In the case of regional initiatives in Africa and South America there are no funds for even a token cohesion policy.
Plans for enlargement of the Union are often assessed in terms of the potential to conduct effective action in order to increase cohesion.
It may be stated quite unequivocally that cohesion policy is a great success for the Union and for all its Member States.
There is no doubt that the Union's own citizens assess it in terms of whether, in their view, cohesion policy is being implemented and is attaining its stated aims.
In many Member States, especially in those that have acceded to the EU only recently, there are very high hopes of cohesion policy.
It is hoped that solidarity will not prove merely a fine term, but will translate into a specific commitment to those who fate has treated less kindly.
Cohesion is also an instrument for creating equal opportunities and a splendid advertisement for the Union.
It is for that very reason that we should not consider limiting the financial resources allocated to increasing economic and social cohesion.
On the contrary, we should contemplate allocating more financial resources to cohesion, if only because of the many new challenges arising.
Thank you.
in writing. - (PL) Mr President, cohesion policy is not one of the key policies that have been present in the European Union since it was first established.
It was no accident that cohesion policy was devised when relatively less developed countries acceded to the European Union as these countries did not cohere well with the six original Member States.
From that time on, cohesion has gained importance, becoming a pillar of European integration and central to treaties and budgets.
The allocation of more than EUR 308 billion to cohesion in the framework of the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective is evidence of this.
A tendency to question this fundamental Union policy has arisen of late.
Curiously, the tendency has coincided with the expansion of the European Union to include the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.
The latter have the most ground to make up, for historical reasons.
That is why it is not proposed to do away with cohesion policy outright, but to radically refocus it, due to alleged waste of Structural Funds and abuses in the area.
That is the greatest mistake we could make!
Irregularities must be detected and eliminated, but it is precisely regional policy that makes the Union's presence felt in all 27 Member States.
Cohesion means creating equal opportunities and a sense of fellowship and must not be subsumed into other policies.
The latter, competitiveness and combating global warming for example, ought to have their own budget lines.
Assessment of what should be financed within the framework of cohesion should remain within the competence of countries and regions.
They have a far better understanding of their own needs than the Brussels authorities.
in writing. - (RO) The Commission's Report refers to the depopulation of rural areas, against the background of the absence of workplaces except for agriculture or due to poor living conditions.
The Rural Development Fund contributes, together with the other funds, to the economic and social cohesion.
The efficient use of the rural development funds represents a timely solution to these problems.
Nevertheless, the condition for the efficient use of these funds is better knowledge of the potential beneficiaries of the financing opportunities offered.
The access to information is even more important in the new Member States, which are not yet familiar with using the Community financing instruments.
I would like to offer an example from Romania, the country I represent: according to a study, half of the rural environment inhabitants know nothing about the existence of the funds designed for them and only one citizen in ten knows which institution he/she should address in order to access the funds.
It is regrettable that the Government of Romania has not made enough efforts to inform the citizens and, at the same time, it is obvious that nobody can replace the Romanian Government's work.
Nevertheless, I consider that ensuring adequate access to information and preparing the future beneficiaries should represent an important subject on the Commission's agenda, as a premise for the efficient use of the instruments designed for cohesion.
in writing. - (DE) The EU's enlargement on 1 May 2004 has increased the economic and social disparities within the EU.
In January this year, a new programming period for cohesion policy began.
This will focus on new priorities and objectives: environmental protection, competitiveness, and the creation of more and better jobs.
The EU's cohesion policy is intended, through its four separate programmes, to help make Europe and its regions more competitive, for example through innovation, the development of the knowledge society, and strengthening economic competitiveness.
It is also intended to increase the attractiveness of the regions for investors and residents through sustainable regional development.
Better and above all more jobs are to be created, and the regions developed further in order to promote opportunities and reduce disparities.
With its further enlargement, EU funding now has to be divided among 27 Member States.
The money must therefore be used better, more efficiently and transparently.
As regards the financial framework, the European Council has made EUR 307.6 billion available for the period 2007-2013.
This is a great deal of money.
It is important that regions with development problems in the wealthy Member States such as Austria also have a fair share of the funds.
Mountain regions in particular require further support.
in writing. - (HU) Whilst reviewing the last three years of the alignment policy, and seeing the good things, but also the mistakes that need to be corrected, the European Parliament is not only looking back but also looking forward.
In order to speed up the development of the underdeveloped regions, we must change two things.
We must pay much more attention to the effectiveness of the programmes, including increasing the amount of value created on the scene.
(There is a need for further theoretical work in connection with this, so that the results can be assessed more accurately.)
However, we cannot keep quiet about the fact that we must guarantee more resources than at present for programmes that use aid effectively and that are free of corruption and political influence in the period after 2013.
Aligning the underdeveloped regions more quickly is in the interests not only of those who live there but also of citizens living in more developed areas that guarantee the necessary resources.
I therefore ask my fellow members to follow the advice of the rapporteur in this respect too, and not to amend the text laid before them.

Situation in Gaza (vote)
- Before the vote
(ES) - Mr President, following consultation with the political groups signing the joint resolution, we wish to request a change in the structure of paragraph 3.
This is not an oral amendment, for we do not wish to add or remove any words.
We merely wish to maintain the text as it is, dividing it up into three separate paragraphs.
To remove any doubt, Mr President, it would read as follows:
'3.
Reiterates its call for an immediate end to all acts of violence;'
'4.
Calls on Israel to cease military actions killing and endangering civilians, and extrajudicial targeted killings;'
'5.
Calls on Hamas, following the illegal takeover of the Gaza Strip, to prevent the firing of rockets by Palestinian militias from the Gaza Strip into Israeli territory;'.
Thus there is no change in the wording, Mr President.
We are not asking for any words to be added or removed: only that this paragraph be divided into those three sections.

I wish to remove the word 'fragmentation' in the first sentence, and then in the second sentence replace the word 'assurer' (ensure) with 'renforcer' (reinforce).
Likewise, in the English version I wish to point out for Mr Bushill-Matthews, that 'prÃ©caritÃ©' translates as 'non secure'.

Oral explanations of vote
(CS) Madam President, in the debate on the CE marking yesterday I drew the attention of the Commission yet again to the fact that registration of the CE marking has still not been initiated, although it has been enshrined in European legislation for 16 years now and I asked for it in parliamentary interpellation three months ago.
I welcome the promise the Commissioner for Enterprise made again yesterday as regards speeding the matter up, but I am not sure if he is aware of the importance of having the marking registered in foreign markets.
Until this happens, it will be impossible to sue for damages in cases of manufacturers and importers who misuse the European conformity mark symbolising the safety of the product to gain unfair advantage and deceive customers both in Europe and abroad.
It would surely help to free the market of unfair competition.
(HU) Thank you very much.
It was a shocking experience to enter the Gaza Strip and come face to face with the everyday consequences of the occupation and blockade.
80% of the population is unemployed, the Israelis cut off the electricity and water supplies from time to time, many people only get to eat once a day, and the vast majority of the population have not been able to leave an area smaller than Budapest for years.
As an Israeli professor said, Gaza is a prison, and its residents are prisoners from whom it is difficult to expect rational behaviour.
At the same time, it is also embittering that some Palestinian groups are using rockets from the Gaza territories to threaten the lives of innocent Israeli civilians.
The crisis goes too far back for it to be solved in the traditional way.
By now, both sides have become the prisoners of their own extremists and are unable to make real concessions because of them.
The international community, and above all the European Union, must force Israel and the Palestinians to reach an amicable settlement.
I have voted for the recommendation, in the hope that the Member States will take more resolute steps.
(CS) I also feel very deeply for the people of the Gaza Strip, who have become hostages in the hands of Hamas.
However, I could not support today's European Parliament resolution because the article calling for negotiations between the Palestinian Authority and Hamas has not been removed from it.
We all know there is no negotiation possible with the terrorists who have occupied Gaza.
Such an appeal is an act of hypocrisy, which aims to put Hamas in the role of a partner to the Palestinian Authority.
I do not wish to be part to legitimising this terrorist organisation.
I am afraid that the situation will soon demand intervention, which should, however, be authorised by the United Nations.
And this is where Europe should play a very active part.
- (NL) Madam President, in contrast to what is claimed by this Parliament, the UN Council of Human Rights does not in fact play such an important role in the promotion of human rights in the world.
How could it possibly be any different?
Only 25 of its 47 members are free democracies, nine of them are not free and three, China, Cuba and Saudi Arabia, are among the greatest human rights offenders in the world.
These countries trample the UN Declaration of Human Rights underfoot and defend themselves and other regimes against any criticism.
In some cases the Council has simply undermined the overseeing of human rights.
The Council has still not pronounced the slightest condemnation of the world's current largest human rights crisis, Darfur.
Rather than shouting for joy about such a creature, this Parliament would do better to include such matters in its resolution.
- (NL) Madam President, I want not only to agree with what my colleague Mr Dillen has just said, but also to point out that the resolution insults the religions that have been adopted by the Council.
This resolution literally states, and I quote, that people 'with responsibility must speak out, and that the freedom to express one's opinion may be limited in matters relating to public health and morality'.
This resolution concerns, of course, the prohibition of all criticism of Islam.
The UN Council of Human Rights is hereby rightly going against its own official objectives, the protection of the right to free expression of opinion and thus also the protection of human rights itself.
(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure to take the floor to argue on behalf of the entire Group of the European People's Party and European Democrats, as well as on my own behalf, for a favourable vote on the final version of this report.
The report tackles the hard fact that there are many more elderly than young people, because both medical care and lifestyles enable all of us to live longer on average - not all of us, unfortunately, but on average.
Therefore there are many more elderly people, also because the birth rate has declined, which is why in the document we call for measures to stimulate the birth rate.
I would point out that the European People's Party, along with the UEN and other groups, requested the deletion of paragraph 24.
We voted in favour of deletion but regrettably the majority in this House was not in favour.
I believe my speaking time is now at an end.
- (NL) Madam President, the merit of the Castex report is undoubtedly that it indicates the enormous demographic challenges with which Europe is faced.
Admittedly, a lot of good questions, trains of thought and solutions are enumerated.
More and better relief for children must indeed be urgently provided, older workers must indeed also be provided with continuing opportunities within the employment markets, and health services must indeed urgently prepare themselves to face the challenge of the accelerated aging demographic.
On the other hand, this Parliament is straying off course in considering immigration as an instrument with which to secure the demographic and economic future of Europe.
Just recently, one of the British Prime Minister's most important advisers, Lord Turner, described the axiom that immigrants are necessary to make up for the shortage of workers as, and I quote, 'economically illiterate and completely incorrect'.
Europe already has a million unemployed immigrants, coupled with all the problems which go along with that.
As more immigrants enter, these existing problems can only get worse.
Madam President, when voting on the Guellec report on cohesion policy, I could not support compromise amendment 4, which calls for 'increased financial resources for cohesion policy' in the future.
Automatically increasing EU subsidies is not, perhaps, the most responsible approach when we have the practical problem of making a meaningful and efficient use of them.
Instead, I am in favour of using the term 'sufficient financial resources'.
Written explanations of vote
in writing. - (PT) In a European Union flooded with a wide variety of directives on detailed issues that would be better tackled at Member State level, given their specific nature and level of development, it cannot fail to be interesting to see how the European Commission will act in terms of monitoring the application of Community law.
One of the conclusions that can be drawn is that each Directorate-General has its own very different way of working, but it is not clear whether the Member States also work in different ways, although experience tells us that the small and medium-sized countries generally act more rigorously than the European powers.
This is what has happened with the Stability Pact.
This latest report introduces a new element which the Committee on Petitions of the European Parliament applauds.
In the Annual Report and its related annexes, the European Commission has included, for the first time, particulars of the specific and detailed treatment of infringements relating to petitions.
in writing. (PL) Mrs Frassoni has prepared a good report.
I support the proposal to simplify the application of Community law and the introduction of package meetings for that purpose.
I am also in favour of workshops devoted to transposition of Community legal acts.
In addition, I endorse the idea of improving the efficiency of application of Community law through closer cooperation between the European Parliament and national parliaments.
These actions will help to improve the effectiveness of European Union policies regarding for example European Fund actions and harmonisation of standards for products on the Community market.
As regards the report relating to the Commission's Annual report on monitoring the application of Community law, I am of the opinion that one of its major themes is the Commission's intention of improving working methods in cases of reported breaches of Community law in the Member States.
Under the framework of the proposed new working method, citizens' queries and complaints should be handed back directly to the Member States in question.
As the rapporteur, Mrs Frassoni, rightly pointed out, this new working method of the Commission, in other words the handing back of the complaint, carries an inherent risk of the Commission renouncing its fundamental responsibility for the application of Community law.
In this connection I would also like to point out another fact, which has already been subject to criticism in the European Parliament: it is the lobby groups, which always manage to access the Commission's notifications directed at Member States in cases of suspected breaches of Community law, while citizens do not.
Yet it is precisely the citizens, whose submissions provide an irreplaceable source of information and alert us to breaches or non-application of Community law, not some interest groups with their own agenda.
in writing. (PL) I voted in favour of the report by Mrs Frassoni on monitoring the application of Community law (2005).
Mrs Frassoni has presented a very good report.
In particular, the individual issues contained in the motion for a resolution call for cohesion in the area of joint action by EU institutions, national parliaments and the citizens themselves.
The main points concern the ideas for better monitoring and the proposals for simplifying implementation of the provisions of Community law and improving its effectiveness.
Their implementation is essential to improving the effectiveness of European Union policy on, for instance, European Fund actions and harmonisation of standards for products goods on the Community market.
Furthermore, the appeal to national parliaments contained in the motion for a resolution is very important.
National parliaments are urged to go beyond a purely formal transposition of Community legislation and avoid fragmentation when incorporating it into national legislation.
in writing. - I welcome AndrÃ© Brie's proposal for regulation on the accreditation and market surveillance of products in the European Community.
The proposal will improve the amount of protection given to consumers and will improve product safety.
To ensure greater protection it is necessary that accreditation and market surveillance be carried out by a public body.
The report attends to these points and I voted in favour of its recommendations.
in writing. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, at a time when the European market seems totally incapable of defending itself against dumping from outside of Europe, I note with great satisfaction the first 'institutional' step towards new legislation and harmonisation of the EU market.
The European Parliament in Strasbourg has proposed a new way of regulating products placed on the Community market.
These products will have to comply with the rules in force and, following a careful appraisal, will be able to bear the CE mark.
Over and above the introduction of joint liability on the part of importers and foreign manufacturers for damage caused by non-compliant products, the report proposes the development of a complex system of monitoring which lays down penalties proportionate to the seriousness of the offence so as to constitute an effective deterrent against improper use.
Consumers and businesses can therefore look to the future with renewed optimism.
The removal of barriers, the cornerstone of EU free-trade policy since the very outset, and the creation of a business-friendly economic climate will reflect a high level of protection both for consumers, through the observance of high standards on health and product safety, and for businesses, which will benefit at last from a rigorous system of checks and balances to protect goods made in Europe.
For this reason I am voting in favour of the report.
in writing. - (PT) This European Parliament report introduces certain elements which may be positive, although somewhat contradictory.
For example, all those involved in placing a product on the market would bear the same responsibility, from the manufacturer to the distributor and importer, but it is not properly indicated how this would work.
The report also allows national markings to be maintained which, under the European Commission's proposal, would disappear, with only the CE marking being recognised.
The compromise replaces the reference to 'national markings' with 'other markings'.
The report also maintains that this is a non-binding framework, but that anyone adopting it will have to abide by it.
In addition, it inserts a reference to SMEs requiring their specific needs to be taken into account.
However, the objective of the European Commission's proposal, which the report does not question, is to facilitate the functioning of the single market by removing the remaining obstacles, but without this applying to certain sectors of activity, in particular foodstuffs, animal feed, health and wellbeing of animals, tobacco products, veterinary medicinal products, medicinal products for human use, human blood and human tissues and cells, for which harmonised legislation already exists.
in writing. (PL) Mrs Schaldemose rightly points out that the decision in question, aimed at creating a broader and more rigorous system of Community control of the marketing of products, may have a significant impact on the conduct of international trade.
This calls for a separate analysis.
I agree that the proposal for importers to be jointly liable for the harm caused by unsafe products and products failing to comply with the accreditation system aims to improve the effectiveness of the system and protect the Community's public interest.
It also aims to guarantee the citizens' fundamental right to protection against unfair and unsafe practices.
in writing. - Mrs Schaldemose's report calling for a common framework for the marketing of products is one that I welcome and have voted in favour of.
The recommendations made in the report will bolster the EU's efforts to protect consumers.
The CE mark tends to be misunderstood as a safety mark, when in fact it is simply a statement of the product's conformity with EU legislation.
It is essential that we make sure that the mark is not abused and inform consumers of what the CE mark guarantees.
in writing. - (SK) As rapporteur on behalf of the PPE-DE Group for the draft report by Mrs Schaldemose on the common framework for the marketing of products, I would like to express my satisfaction with the results of the vote: the compromise achieved has already made it possible to finalise the legislative process at first reading.
The agreed compromise includes the transfer of some of the articles dealing with the CE mark to the report by Mr Brie on market surveillance, so that they can be put into practice more quickly.
Our decision to do so was based on clear information proving that products made in developing countries and wrongfully CE marked, that is bearing the CE logo that indicates that a product is in conformity with European legislation, keep turning up more and more often in the European database of dangerous consumer products (RAPEX).
Trusting or not trusting the CE mark cannot be based on the CE mark alone, out of context.
There must be trust in the entire system of accreditation, notification and market surveillance.
I see no reason for introducing additional marking on products, not even if these were quality marks.
Such new marking could be confusing for the end consumer and furthermore the extra cost could be reflected in the price of the goods.
This is why I will curiously await the results of the impact study assessing the usage of national markings alongside the CE marking that the Commission should prepare, as requested by the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection.
in writing. - (PT) The European Commission's argument for proposing this Regulation is that 'the "principle of mutual recognitionâ ... is hampered by several problems' (in other words, products marketed in one Member State may be prevented from being marketed in another).
It believes that the possibility of national technical rules creating unlawful obstacles to the free movement of goods between Member States should be minimised.
It therefore lays down requirements which authorities must meet when implementing a national technical rule and imposes on them the burden of proof.
In other words, it is imposing conditions with the clear aim of restricting the possibility of each State applying its own rules.
For its part, the European Parliament report actually adds further obstacles to the action that each State may take, for example: 'The aim of this Regulation is to strengthen the functioning of the internal market, with free and undistorted competition, by improving the free movement of products whilst ensuring a high level of consumer protection and product safety'.
In practice, the Member States will be prohibited from restricting the sale in their territory of products where these are manufactured and marketed in another Member State, even though they may not fully comply with the rules of the Member State of destination.
in writing. - I agree with the recommendations contained within Mr Stubb's report.
The document aims to clarify and define the role of national authorities and economic operators in the implementation of the mutual recognition principle.
While I am in favour of increasing the efficiency with which the mutual recognition principle is implemented, it must not affect the single market's base of further harmonisation.
Furthermore, safety aspects must form part of the principle's implementation.
I am confident that the report sufficiently deals with these issues and therefore voted in favour of it.
in writing. - We do not agree with the mutual recognition principle as a guarantor for advanced consumer, social or environmental rights.
The principle says that if the product is accepted somewhere in Europe, it cannot be denied access to another Member State unless the authorities can provide evidence that the application of a national technical rule is justified.
However, the criteria for exceptions to the principle are already established by EU court rulings.
And these apply to all Member States, regardless of whether or not we adopt the goods package.
In addition to that, consumer rights at EU level are strengthened with the goods package.
Furthermore, we are against any measures taken in the goods package that may give political support to a future harmonisation of criminal law at EU level.
Having taking all this into consideration, we have decided to vote in favour of the reports.
in writing. - (DE) I am in favour of the Internal Market for Goods Package, because it is essential to have a common framework for the marketing of products abroad.
In an internal market which is based on the principles of technical harmonisation of rules governing the sale of products in the European market and the mutual recognition principle, we cannot have a situation in which the marketing of products which can already be put on sale in one Member State is substantially delayed or, in a worst-case scenario, actually obstructed due to excessive bureaucracy in another.
I therefore welcome the reports by our fellow Members, Mrs Schaldemose and Mr Brie, who advocate a reduction in red tape and a common legal framework for future sectoral provisions so that in future, as much coherence as is politically and technically feasible is guaranteed.
Finally, however, I would point out that both proposals require further refinement so that key definitions and especially the scope of the legal framework are properly clarified.
If these proposals themselves lack clear terminology, achieving the desired harmonisation will be impossible.
in writing. - (DE) The package on the marketing of products in Europe, to be voted on today, undoubtedly brings improvements for consumers.
The problems with imported children's toys last year demonstrated that there is a clear need for action here and that it must be possible to hold importers liable to a greater extent for product safety.
What is important is what Parliament has achieved, namely that the New Approach will be implemented to a lesser extent and its application must be assessed on a case-by-case basis.
We cannot be satisfied with the treatment of the CE mark to date.
It is certainly not a quality mark denoting a product produced in Europe, which is what it implies to many consumers in its current form, and it is therefore very misleading.
in writing. - (NL) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I have voted with conviction for the three-party agreement regarding this legislation package to make the common market truly free.
I am also convinced that we can round off this matter in one reading, and even within a year of launching the proposals.
This legislation is so necessary that I have honestly wondered to myself why consumers and SMEs have had to wait so long.
The principle of mutual recognition was formulated by the Court of Justice almost 30 years ago and is now enshrined in legislation.
Nevertheless, the Member States do not apply it systematically.
I am convinced that the reversal of the burden of proof which we are now carrying out is the best way to respect this principle and to allow the internal market for non-harmonised products to work.
Furthermore, we are genuinely ensuring much better consumer protection with much better market supervision.
Nothing less would be acceptable in a Europe which boasts of its high standards.
Finally, we are taking care to get rid of a number of bad, protectionist tendencies.
The new accreditation scheme for organisations whose products are certified as conforming to harmonised standards will entail administrative costs but will lead to a better result, a working internal market and more equal conditions of competition.
The costs that we will save with this package will ultimately produce more jobs and economic growth.
Better consumer protection is one very good reason to approve this package with enthusiasm.
in writing. - I will be voting in favour of this resolution.
The humanitarian and political crisis in the Gaza Strip must be viewed with deep concern.
We must ask Hamas to stop attacks against Israel from the territory it controls, and Israel to cease military actions killing civilians and extrajudicial targeted killings.
The policy of isolation of the Gaza Strip has totally failed at a political and human level.
The blockade must end, with the re-opening of crossings in and out of Gaza.
I welcome the EU's financial contributions to the Palestinians over the previous years which - with the appropriate controls and monitoring - should continue.
in writing. - (SV) Unfortunately, once again the EU is using a humanitarian disaster to advance its position in the field of foreign policy.
The June List expresses its sympathy with the civilian population affected by the conflict, but it is only through the UN that this conflict can be resolved, with broad international support, and not through the EU.
in writing. - (PT) While it is true that we share many of the concerns expressed in the resolution, it is also true that these fall well short of the necessary denunciation and condemnation of Israel's colonialist policy with regard to Palestine and its people.
Among other aspects:
Once again, the resolution places the aggressor and aggressed, occupier and occupied on the same level, thereby ignoring the terrorism of the Israeli State;
The resolution does not condemn the criminal embargo imposed by Israel on the Gaza Strip and its population nor does it denounce the connivance or silence of the United States of America or the European Union in this respect;
The resolution says nothing about the deplorable statements made by Commissioner Frattini who is responsible for justice and home affairs and who stated that the EU would be prepared to 'take on board Israeli concerns and interests in a way that was not on our agenda in the first years of intifada'.
It is at the very least abominable that someone who talks so much about terrorism not only ignores Israel's terrorism but is prepared to cooperate with it.
For our part, we continue to condemn Israel's policy of apartheid against Palestine and to defend full compliance with the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, enshrined in numerous UN resolutions.
in writing. - I voted in favour of the joint motion for a resolution on Gaza and am pleased that Parliament has taken such a strong stance on lifting the blockade.
This is a humanitarian disaster in the making.
There are insufficient drugs available in hospitals to provide basic care; food assistance to part of the population only fulfils about two-thirds of daily requirements; the fishing industry (which employed about 10 000 people) is under severe stress, as boats are only allowed to operate close to the coast.
There is an ecological disaster under way, threatening the coastlines of the region, as the Beit Lahia plant sewage plant is not operating properly and repairs cannot be carried out, as supplies are blocked.
Businesses cannot survive and the unemployed have to find work with the smugglers and extremists.
The rocket attacks continue and the few involved in this threaten the peace and the future of the many - both Israeli and Palestinian.
Hamas must stop the perpetrators.
Only the extremists on all sides are benefiting, as I heard time and again on my recent visit to Gaza.
The EU must do everything possible to break the blockade, and Israel must recognise that it is not giving them long-term security.
in writing. - (DE) Let's be absolutely clear from the outset: the embargo by Israel is clearly a violation of international law and is completely unacceptable.
As a result of the embargo and the denial of access to drinking water and food, Israel is artificially creating a situation for the people in the Gaza Strip which is without parallel in terms of its inhumanity and lack of concern for human dignity.
It is thanks to the Egyptian Government and the cool head of the border police that a major disaster has so far been averted and people who are themselves not participants in the conflict have been given access to basic goods for their essential needs.
What is irresponsible, on the other hand, is shifting the responsibility onto Egypt, which is completely blameless in terms of the escalation of the current situation.
It is unacceptable, in the 21st century, for a civilian population to be treated as the scapegoat for terrorist acts by Hamas.
The infrastructure must therefore be restored immediately and supplies to the local population guaranteed.
The Palestinian side, for its part, should do its utmost to de-escalate the situation in order to facilitate the conclusion of an agreement by the end of 2008.
In the present situation, however, prospects of achieving this noble aspiration would appear to be remote.
in writing. - While every effort must be made to find a solution to the situation in Gaza, this resolution at best will contribute nothing and at worst will have a negative impact.
If Parliament wants to be an honest broker for peace in the Middle East it should stop producing unbalanced resolutions.
It is difficult for any member not to vote for a resolution addressing humanitarian concerns but by linking those concerns to an unfair portrayal of Israel its value falls.
A parliamentary resolution should not call for Hamas to release a captive as a mere "act of goodwillâ.
Hamas is not a benevolent medieval king; it is a terrorist organisation largely responsible for the situation in Gaza.
In demanding that Israel fulfils its obligations, this House should note that Israeli workers continue to risk their own lives to supply electricity to Gaza despite the manipulation of that electricity supply by Hamas.
In addressing the needs of those who are suffering, we must include the people of southern Israel on whom some days an average of a rocket an hour has been fired and where 75% of children are reported to be suffering from anxiety and post-traumatic stress.
in writing. - (EL) The Israeli authorities are perpetrating ever more criminal acts against the Palestinians.
They have been cracking down on the movement of people, goods and food for many months and barring access to drinking water, electricity and other basic utilities, while the Israeli army continues to attack and murder civilians.
The sympathy expressed in the resolution as regards the disasters endured by the Palestinian population is a sham because the EU and the United States are part of the problem.
Imperialist interests back Israel in its criminal policies.
The imperialists want to retain control of a region that is important for its position and for geostrategic activity; they wish to keep their right to intervene, even militarily.
The Quartet's plans have demonstrated the failure of yet another imperialist attempt, and the Annapolis agreements will have the same result.
The proposal for their revival is an attempt to pull the wool over the eyes of the people; it essentially equates victims with persecutors.
The imperialists cannot provide a solution to the Palestinian problem.
It must emerge from the struggles of the peoples of Palestine and Israel themselves, and from international solidarity with their struggle for peaceful coexistence via the creation of an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital.
in writing. - (FR) If, despite a certain amount of reluctance due to a totally unbalanced text, I eventually voted for it, this was because an oral amendment tabled by the Group of the European People's Party restored the truth to a certain extent as to the current situation in Gaza.
Whoever is responsible, it is totally unacceptable, utterly and totally unacceptable, that initially paragraph 3 of the text set Israel and Hamas on an equal footing.
Does Israel's concern with protecting its people from acts of violence perpetrated on a daily basis by Hamas and Palestinian militias have anything to do with the indiscriminate attacks, most recently in Dimona, or the streams of Qassam rockets raining down on Sderot every day, targeting chiefly schools, and therefore children, the lifeblood of Israeli society?
Of course we may have different views on the conflict, but the honest MEPs in this House will refuse to make Israel, a democratic country and government, and Hamas, a terrorist movement listed as such by the EU (this is true, just like the repeated refusal to meet the conditions of the Quartet, which this resolution moreover oddly conceals), equal partners in the midst of terrible violence.
in writing. - The tone, and much of the content, of the Gaza Resolution, is skewed in an anti-Israeli fashion.
It is certainly the case that the Palestinians in Gaza live in a perpetual state of privation, and this is inhumane.
But the blame for this rests only partly with Israel, and primarily with Palestinian terrorists and extremists such as Hamas, and the failure of Arab states to assist the rehabilitation of the population, and regeneration of the area.
Gaza has been allowed to remain a running sore.
I regret that there was no call for those currently in authority in Gaza to take the necessary steps for a peaceful accommodation with Israel.
I welcome the call for the release of Corporal Shalit.
I therefore abstained in the vote.
in writing. - (SV) The June List supports the UN Human Rights Council and the important work carried out by that body.
However, we oppose the provision laid down in paragraph 34 which states that each EU member must express the EU position on these matters.
Each EU Member State is an autonomous member of the UN and therefore has the right to express its own opinion.
We have therefore chosen to vote against the resolution.
in writing. - (PT) Not forgetting its previous positions on the definition of this UN body's operation, in which the attempts to guarantee its monitoring and organisation were obvious - we recall the EU's criticisms and pressure in relation to, for example, the way in which certain countries were elected to this body (regretting the 'clean slate' principle and defending the introduction of eligibility criteria), the 'Special Procedure' mechanism, the reinforcement of country mandates and the possibility of creating new mandates by simple majority, or even the terms of the 'Universal Periodic Review' - the European Parliament has adopted a resolution which, although heading along the same lines, is more moderate in the explanation of its true objectives.
Among other aspects, we would highlight its unacceptable pressure for each Member State to make its proposals in this UN body dependent on the positions which may be adopted by the EU, thereby subordinating their sovereignty on foreign policy.
We would also highlight the political opinion withdrawn from the countries mentioned - and also from some not mentioned - showing once again the application of 'double standards', in other words the orchestration of human rights according to the EU's interests.
in writing. - (SV) We Swedish Social Democrats have voted in favour of the report on the demographic future of Europe.
However, we believe that the report is too far-reaching and addresses aspects that go beyond matters relevant to demographic change.
We also oppose various proposals for tax breaks for companies that organise crÃšches and for people being able to work at home.
However, we have chosen to vote in favour of the report as it also addresses important aspects of the challenge Europe is facing.
in writing. - (PT) We regret that not all the amendments we tabled have been adopted.
These were intended to improve the report, question certain grounds and include measures which we feel are essential in order to defend the rights of women, families and children.
For example, we know how low wages and precarious employment worsen social instability and, as a result, drastically reduce the stable prospects of those opting to have children.
That is why improving job stability, increasing wages, extending social security and occupational health and safety, reducing overall working time without any loss of wages and ensuring a fairer distribution of income and full employment constitute fundamental issues for the management of demographic change.
It is also important to create new and better educational and social infrastructures, for both young people and the elderly, including more lifelong learning, child-care, nursing care and elderly care structures.
This requires more and better public services, with a guarantee of equal access for all.
By not fully promoting these aspects, this report does not effectively respond to these problems, despite containing positive proposals which we applaud but which are not sufficient to allow us to vote in favour of the report.
in writing. - (SV) Large parts of Europe are facing demographic challenges.
However, these should be resolved by national measures, not by catch-all EU proposals which perhaps suit certain countries, but may be unsuitable in other Member States.
Many EU countries, including Sweden, have also largely coped with the low birth rate and the demographic problems, partly through a well-developed welfare policy and through immigration.
The Member States that so wish may do well to study Sweden and other Scandinavian countries and copy the measures that they have taken.
in writing. (PL) I fully support the report on the demographic future of Europe.
It is a fact that the constant fall in natural growth in recent years, accompanied by an increase in average life expectancy, is likely to lead to significant changes in the population structure of the European Union by 2050.
The changes will include general ageing of the population and a reduction in the number of persons working.
This will result in a significant increase in the burden on Member States' budgets.
The process will be a painful one not only for the individual Member States but also for the Union as a whole.
The latter may be faced with losing its competitive edge and with a fall in economic growth compared to the situation in other parts of the world characterised by swift demographic growth.
It is clear too that this demographic imbalance will have negative consequences for the financing of social care and the sustainability of pension schemes.
I therefore support the remedial measures proposed in the report aimed at demographic renewal, lengthening the period of professional activity, guaranteeing high-quality social care and promoting solidarity between the generations.
These actions are vital to maintaining the competitiveness of the Union's economy whilst simultaneously guaranteeing the functioning of the European social model in the long term.
in writing. - (FR) Europeans are a disappearing species.
With an average birth rate of less than 1.5, by the year 2050 EU-27 will have lost some 20 million people and those over 65 years old will account for 30% of the population.
The measures proposed by Mrs Castex to rectify the European birth rate are laughable because, like all Europeanists in power, our fellow Member does not want to renew the European population, but to replace it with immigrants from Africa and Asia.
That is why she uses 15 articles in her report to call for facilities to reunite families, civil rights for immigrants, and increased efforts to integrate them ...
This policy, advocated in France by Mr Attali and implemented by Mr Sarkozy, will bring a further 80 million immigrants to Europe by the year 2050, and will eventually lead to the disappearance of our peoples.
To guarantee the survival of the European peoples, migratory flows must actually be reversed and a large-scale birth promotions policy implemented based on the family and the embracing of life.
This means that our nations must seek their sovereignty and identity within a new Europe, the Europe of nations.
in writing. - (DE) I am in favour of a cohesion policy for the European Union's demographic development, as the structural shift in European society's age pyramid points to a worrying future.
I draw attention to the fact that all Europe's industrialised countries face the same major social policy problems which constitute a serious risk to the European social welfare model that is essential for our current prosperity.
In this context, I would particularly like to stress the rise in the European average old-age dependency ratio to 53% in 2050, which is due to the current abnormally low average birth rate in the EU of 1.5, and which not only leads to intergenerational conflicts and can thus be regarded as an obstacle to social cohesion, but could also weaken Europe's competitiveness in the world economy.
The demographic change which is taking place thus requires a general adaptation of the individual social systems and rapid and efficient implementation.
in writing. - (FR) The Castex report on the demographic future of Europe is appallingly trite, featuring all the clichÃ©s one might expect to find in surveys on the subject.
Mrs Castex forgets, among other aspects, to mention contraceptive methods which have been largely responsible for reducing the birth rate in Europe, where it stands at only 1.5 per woman, a far cry from renewal of the future generations.
A population-friendly environment depends on the possibility of women being willing to bring up their children over a relatively long period of time.
This is a priority investment for society, and would substantially reduce school dropout rates and juvenile delinquency.
As for immigration to offset empty cradles, this is a dangerous idea which would not only destabilise our western societies, but could be a genuine time bomb with all the consequences we can well imagine.
Justifying immigration by a lack of manpower, qualified or unqualified, when Europe has over twenty million unemployed, is penalising European workers, who will certainly appreciate the proposals of the Commission or the European Parliament.
For these reasons we intend to vote against the Castex report.
in writing. (PL) Mrs Castex rightly points out that in view of the fact that the European average old-age dependency ratio (the number of persons aged 65 or over divided by the number aged between 14 and 65) will rise from 25% in 2004 to 53% in 2050, the European Union risks losing its competitive edge and suffering a fall in economic growth.
I agree with the proposals to develop five main directions for action aimed at demographic renewal, namely high quality active life, a more efficient Europe, better integration of immigrants, guaranteeing social care and solidarity between the generations.
in writing. - We voted against this report because the solutions it proposes as regards the demographic crisis are counter-productive.
In contrast to what the report says, only traditional families and social respect for motherhood provide the remedy we need.
The social experiments proposed in the report (so-called 'alternative family structures') bring nothing but risks for our societies.
in writing. - (FR) Rarely have I taken such pleasure in voting on a resolution, since it clearly shows that women and elderly people have a major role to play in the challenge of our demographic future.
Women are expected to be willing to bring more children into the world while carrying out a professional activity over a longer period of time.
In that case, a facility must be created to motivate them.
Women cannot be expected to feel they are in the wrong, or to expose themselves to poverty, every time they bring a child into the world.
The more they procreate, the more they are discriminated against in terms of welfare cover, especially if they are full-time family carers, the less they earn, and the shorter their retirement will be.
The most wonderful resolutions, therefore, will serve no purpose if there is no political courage to implement them.
This, unfortunately, was the case with the 1995 resolution on the distribution of pension entitlements in the event of divorce and the resolution on the situation of spouses helping with SMEs, aimed at rectifying the many discriminations still suffered by women, and the terrible plight of far too many men in relation to paternity leave.
in writing. - I welcome FranÃ§oise Castex's recommendations regarding Europe's demographic future.
The overall message of encouraging economic competitiveness while preserving the European social model is one that I feel is both logical and just.
I agree with the report's focus on the role of areas such as education, childcare and financial mechanisms in securing this goal.
There also exists a necessity for the promotion of professional equality between men and women along with a well and calmly thought-out immigration policy that incorporates the goal of successful integration.
The report deals with these issues and I voted in favour of its recommendations.
in writing. - (DE) Mass immigration and ageing are putting the stock of indigenous population at risk.
The first is heralded as a miracle cure for the second, but merely leads to ethnomorphosis - in other words, to Umvolkung: the forced change of the population's ethnic composition.
Unless the EU establishment finally starts to lobby for a pro-birth policy for the indigenous Europeans, promotes the traditional family with many children, finally takes action against attempts - such as gay marriage - to destroy the traditional family, and reintroduces zero tolerance to immigration, also in relation to family reunion, in fifty years' time we will be sitting here palavering about the Kosovisation of Europe, just as we are doing now with the Kosovo issue itself.
In the report before us, an attempt is made yet again to sell immigration to us as a panacea, with Europe's hereditary population soon having to adapt to the migrants.
That is why I have rejected today's report.
in writing. - (SK) The EU must respond to serious demographic changes if it wants to preserve its demographic and territorial balance.
On the one hand it is necessary to deal with population ageing.
The situation is alarming.
Each year after the year 2010 the number of people at work will decrease by 1 million and that will threaten intergenerational solidarity.
On the other hand there are the problems caused by the decreasing birth rate; these problems have already existed for several years.
Postponing childbirth until later in life may be the reason for an increase in infertility of couples.
Protection of mother and family must be the focus of all EU policies.
Pension systems must not punish women for being mothers.
In recent years the differences between the Member States have been reducing but at the same time the differences inside the individual Member States have become much deeper.
Disadvantaged regions in particular are less developed and on top of that they are also the ones most affected by demographic changes, namely by population ageing and migration.
Since there are not enough well-paid jobs, qualified workers leave for the big cities.
Heavy concentration of economic activities in capital cities erodes the demographic, economic, social and environmental balance and leads to a population decrease in rural areas that often lack the basic infrastructure needed for development.
I voted in favour of the report by Mrs Castex on the demographic future; this is one of the important reports.
We have to realise that demographic development is a fundamental component of all policies, whether they are medium- or long-term.
in writing. - (PT) The renewal of the European population is a crucial factor in ensuring a balance between the youngest and oldest and in increasing the working-age population.
The consequences of the current falling birth rate and increased life expectancy will be an increase in the old-age dependency ratio and a decline in the working-age population.
It is therefore essential to take steps to promote demographic renewal which will ensure a more productive and advanced Europe with a high degree of social protection and solidarity between the generations.
We must develop policies that encourage the continual renewal of the European population and which ensure continued economic competitiveness, at the same time as preserving the European social model.
We cannot ignore one other aspect of this issue which is linked to Europe being a point of destination for significant migration flows, given that these populations invariably help to increase birth rates.
The combination of the demographic issue with the migration issue poses potential risks and we cannot simply count on these populations for demographic renewal.
I therefore want to stress the measures aimed at stimulating the birth rate, accompanied by appropriate policies on education and training and on solidarity between the generations, intended to halt the demographic decline of Europe.
in writing. - (SV) The demographic challenge faced by Europe is enormous.
This is a perfectly relevant subject for discussion at European level - I addressed it myself as the author of an opinion on flexicurity.
However, an essential condition is that the starting point for the discussion is that most of the measures proposed, such as a later retirement age, a prudent family policy, good conditions for parental leave etc., come under the subsidiarity principle.
A number of proposals in the wide range of solutions, to say the least, that the report mentions are practised and have worked well in Sweden.
However, that does not mean that they would turn out equally well in other parts of Europe.
The fundamental problem with Mrs Castex's report is not therefore the intention, but that most of what is discussed relates to policies that should be conducted by the Member States - sometimes at municipal level.
I therefore voted in favour of amendments which stressed the subsidiarity principle and abstained in the final vote.
in writing. (PL) We have adopted an important report on the demographic future of Europe.
Enabling citizens to live longer certainly represents an achievement for the Member States of the Union.
It also leads, however, to the gradual ageing of the population.
In the long term, this situation can only upset the balance between the productive population and those who are past that stage.
It is a threat to solidarity between the generations, because a smaller number of professionally active people than at present will have to bear the ever-increasing cost of benefits, allowances, pensions, care and health services for those who are not in work.
Action to lengthen the period of professional activity and increase the birth rate is called for in order to counter such a situation.
Programmes for the full integration of immigrants are also required.
Technical modernisation and the introduction of information technology into the workplace will ensure that work is more effective and productive.
This will make a significant contribution to improving the situation.
Consideration should also be given to the migratory flows from rural to urban areas, and to the hidden human capital in rural areas, notably in the less developed countries.
Demography is one of the key challenges for the European Union, especially in the context of significant overpopulation in other parts of the world.
in writing. (PL) In view of the serious nature of the demographic problem facing Europe, it is entirely appropriate for Parliament and the Commission to have devoted time to it.
Unfortunately, I found it necessary to vote against the report on the subject by Mrs Castex because so many key amendments were rejected.
In particular, Parliament's acceptance of the provision indicating full acceptance of the definition of family in the legislation of an emigrant's country of origin in the event of conflict with the legislation of the host country, together with the consequent financial obligations in the case of polygamy, cannot be condoned.
This intrudes upon the internal provisions of Member States, thus infringing the principle of subsidiarity.
in writing. - (GA) I do not agree with everything that is written in Mr Guellec's Report, but nevertheless, I welcome the report and I voted in its favour.
I welcome the emphasis Mr Guellec has placed on balanced regional development.
Not only must the gap between Member States be decreased but we must also reduce the gaps within Member States as well as the gaps between regions.
We must ensure that increased resources are aimed at promoting regional development and tackling social exclusion.
The only way to deal with a cohesion policy is as a tool for the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy.
in writing. - (PT) Although this report contains certain aspects which, despite being moderate, we regard as positive, it does not effectively tackle the major funding issues.
An example of this compromise is the approach taken with regard to the Community financial resources needed for an effective cohesion policy.
The report recognises, in the recitals, that 'increased financial resources for cohesion policy must be guaranteed in the future in order to deal with the anticipated new challenges' (whether or not this actually relates to cohesion is a separate issue which has yet to be clarified).
However, in the articles, or in other words in the actual proposal, the report merely alludes to an ambiguous need to reinforce the cohesion policy, to which 'sufficient' financial resources should be allocated.
Regrettably, the amendments that we tabled were rejected.
These amendments aimed, for example, to recognise that there are countries and regions which are at odds with the EU, to prevent use of the cohesion policy for other purposes, particularly to finance objectives included within the Lisbon Strategy which would be contrary to cohesion, to recognise the need to increase Community financial resources for cohesion, to impose conditions on Community aid for enterprises so that relocations are discouraged, to highlight the need to adopt permanent measures with adequate funding for the most remote regions and to recognise the role of fishing in cohesion.
in writing. - I welcome Ambroise Guellec's report on the Commission's fourth report on economic and social cohesion.
The findings point towards definite progress in improving economic and social cohesion across the EU.
However, the findings that disparities have increased in a number of Member States, especially between capitals and rural areas, demonstrate the need to continue in this policy's goal to try and reduce the differences within and among the EU's multiple regions.
in writing. - (SK) Cohesion policy helps solve problems such as demographic changes, migration from rural to urban areas, segregation or climate changes.
These challenges can be confronted only if cohesion policy remains a Community policy.
This is why I definitely give my support to the report.
We can see how beneficial this policy is when we look at the countries that received support from the Cohesion Fund in the past.
Greece, Spain, Portugal and Ireland have recorded strong growth.
Similar help must be available for the new Member States.
Like everyone else who grew up and lives in a more remote region, I know that there are pronounced disparities between regions, and even inside individual regions.
Sometimes these disparities are even greater than disparities between individual countries: disparities in living standards, in the number of jobs available, in income and in education opportunities.
This is why I emphasise that there is a real need to reduce the disparity between territorially accessible regions and regions facing structural disadvantages.
I see the way forward as prioritising such policies that would decrease the pressure on capital cities and support the development of second-tier cities.
It is necessary to support the development of rural areas; this is where small and medium-sized towns play an important role.
It is also necessary to direct the funds towards projects intended to make each region attractive in its own right.
I support this report because I know that cohesion policy is the right answer to many demographic changes.
in writing. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, cohesion has been one of the mainstays of Community policy in the past, the expression of a principle of solidarity which marked out and accompanied economic growth in the European Union.
It has been an economic success story for many European countries and regions; there has even been talk of a miracle in some cases and, thanks to the proper implementation of cohesion policies, the quality of life has improved for many of our citizens.
Cohesion plays an even more important role in the Europe of 27, with its pronounced economic and social disparities.
The first effects of EU economic aid are beginning to be seen in some of the regions where development is lagging behind, even though it will only be possible to assess economic convergence on a longer-term basis owing to a very low initial GDP per capita.
Comparative circumstances will be different in the near future, but perhaps even today.
Therefore the cohesion policy will have to confront other, new challenges having a strong territorial impact, such as demographic change, urbanisation and new urban planning, migratory movements, energy supply and climate change.
While voting in favour of the report, I would call upon the Commission and national governments to devise a joint approach for tackling these issues in an appropriately dynamic and cooperative manner.
in writing. - (EL) The aim of economic and social cohesion is to create a delusion among workers so that the gap in social and regional disparities can be narrowed, and the living standards of workers in countries and regions that diverge from the Community average can be raised.
The law of unequal growth within capitalism is, however, inflexible.
These disparities are ever on the increase; the poor become poorer and the rich become richer.
That is what workers have to put up with every day.
In the face of the charge made by capitalist restructurings and the frontal attack on employment rights, however, even verbal use of this term is tending to disappear, and with it the paltry provision of the Community budget.
In the third phase of implementation of the Lisbon Treaty, all the policies have to be replaced with imperialism's magic word, 'competition'.
This will lead to competition between states, regions and workers, where the law of the jungle holds sway.
The resolution is limited to flowery declarations and mere wishes that do not touch upon the essence of the problem.
Only the struggles of the workers, disobedience and insubordination to the EU's anti-worker and unpopular policies can reverse the worsening trend in the living conditions of the working classes.
This trend is now becoming more marked even in the more developed countries.
in writing. - (PT) The cohesion policy is one of the distinctive trade marks of the European Union, one of its major successes and also one of the main attractions of our community.
The idea that it is right and necessary to ensure an identical level of development across all the Member States is a concept that we must not abandon and whose positive result we must celebrate.
However, not everything has been successful in this area.
Firstly, it is essential that the cohesion funds are increasingly integrated with other funding programmes in order to guarantee that the benefits of these funds are not lost in the absence of a concomitant investment in policies directly aimed at more advanced stages of development.
Sometimes it is necessary to take bigger steps, otherwise we will always be lagging behind.
Secondly, it is worrying that we are seeing a constant process of retraction in the Portuguese State in terms of guaranteeing equal access to basic services throughout its territory.
What point is there in calling for Community-level cohesion when this is absent from national policies, with citizens in less developed regions being abandoned in the name of, not a development idea, but a merely accounting-based view of the allocation of resources?
None whatsoever.
in writing. - (GA) I don't agree with everything written in Gisela Kallenbach's Report, but despite that, I welcome it and voted for it.
I especially welcome the emphasis Mrs Kallenbach places on strengthening the role of the local urban authorities.
Sustainable development of urban areas is extremely challenging in the twenty first century and the Framework presented by Mrs Kallenbach today can help us to face this challenge.
in writing. - (PT) This report on the follow-up of the Territorial Agenda and the Leipzig Charter contains aspects which we consider important.
However, it must be stressed that the actual content of the territorial dimension of the cohesion policy is yet to be defined, with the adoption of a green paper on this issue being planned for next September.
Although many of the objectives mentioned so far are to be welcomed and all make sense - for example, establishment of a polycentric, balanced urban system and creation of a new urban-rural relationship ensuring parity of access to infrastructures, conservation of the natural and cultural heritage, preservation of high-quality public spaces and upgrading of housing stock and street furniture, strengthening the local economy and local labour market policy and ensuring proactive education and training policies for children and young people - we would stress that:
Land management and planning must be the responsibility of each Member State;
The new priorities must receive new financial resources;
The territorial dimension must not contradict or dilute economic and social cohesion, in other words the reduction of disparities between the levels of development of the various regions and the encouragement of the least-favoured regions that are lagging behind.
in writing. - Gisela Kallenbach's report 'Follow-up of the Territorial Agenda and the Leipzig Charter' is a report that I voted in favour of.
We need to be more sensitive to the territorial and urban dimension of EU policies.
In improving cooperation between urban and rural areas and implementing efficient strategies that aim at sustainable spatial development we can successfully achieve this.

East Timor
The next item is the debate on six motions for a resolution concerning East Timor.
author. (PL) Mr President, we are witnessing yet another crisis in East Timor.
This crisis cannot be resolved without the involvement and cooperation of the East Timorese authorities.
The latter must bring about the dissolution of all paramilitary groups and disarm civilians.
Armed criminal groups must also be disbanded.
Those responsible for attacks on the most important people in the country must be taken to court.
All the political forces, both those in power and those in opposition must refrain from the illegal use of force.
Recent events indicate a strong likelihood that East Timor will become yet another country whose key institutions no longer function.
It may well be deemed a failed state.
We are all aware of the threat posed by such states.
I am sure I do not need to quote examples, but let me just mention Somalia.
In view of the role it played in setting up the state of East Timor and its continued involvement in it, the international community cannot allow such a bleak prospect to become a reality.
The European Union's commitment to supporting democratic forces and institutions remains essential.
On its mission, Parliament should assess the effectiveness of that support.
author. - (PT) As underlined in our Group's motion for a resolution, it is currently vital to express our solidarity with the East Timorese people and to condemn the attacks on the President of the Republic and the Prime Minister of East Timor.
We would stress that such attacks can only increase the instability of the East Timorese political situation, created by the events of 2006 and 2007 and maintained by the political process resulting from the recent legislative elections in that country.
We call for a thorough investigation, within the constitutional and legal framework of East Timor, to identify and try the main perpetrators of these attacks.
We must be alert to any manoeuvres which, in light of these events, may aim to justify further outside interference and which may threaten the independence and sovereignty of East Timor.
We therefore reject the joint resolution of the European Parliament which, among other aspects, seeks to ignore all the outside interference which has tried to condition and mould the free choices of the East Timorese people.
Also, by trying to lump everyone together, it seeks to exempt from responsibility the main perpetrators and mentors of the violence and destabilisation of the situation in East Timor.
It also seeks to ignore the fact that, in order to understand the current situation in East Timor, it is vital not to forget that its people were victims of colonialism, brutal repression and the destruction of their country and that its people heroically won their independence and sovereignty, in particular over their natural resources, in a fairly recent past, even after having been abandoned, at fundamental points in their struggle, by the international community.
Despite referring to respect for the sovereignty of the people of East Timor, this resolution forms a basis for interference in the internal affairs of that country.
In fact, it adopts a stance which seeks to present East Timor as a failed state.
Finally, this resolution ignores the fact that the solution is political and lies solely in the hands of the people of East Timor.
In the past, the East Timorese people have more than adequately proven their dignity and courage and we express our confidence in their ability, by their own hands, to declare East Timor a sovereign and independent state.
author. - (PT) On behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, I want to express our solidarity with the people of East Timor and our strong condemnation of the barbarous attacks against the democratically elected institutions of the President and Prime-Minister of East Timor.
I also want to call for an independent investigation, as requested in the motion for a resolution before us which we support, to find out who carried out the attacks, what they represented and what has failed in the security system of East Timor, both within East Timor and, in particular, internationally.
I believe that this episode indicates that the international community must make further efforts to reinforce the state institutions of East Timor and, in particular, to reform the security system which was also called into question in the 2006 crisis.
In addition, the issues relating to justice, compliance with justice and law and order must be considered.
In this context, I must say that the attempts at national reconciliation with the rebel groups may have given a negative and counterproductive signal of impunity which has led the rebels to carry out this miserable attack.
East Timor is not a failed state and bears no similarities to Somalia with which Mr Onyszkiewicz has tried to associate it.
East Timor gained its independence heroically, despite the international community's silence, and the East Timorese people have already demonstrated on several occasions that they are committed to democracy.
They once again demonstrated this in an exemplary manner in the presidential and legislative elections that took place last year during which I had the honour of heading up this Parliament's mission.
The international community now has a responsibility to show its support for East Timor, to coordinate this support which it clearly failed to do in relation to the security system, and to resolve the basic issues of the structure of the East Timorese state.
In terms of the signals given by the East Timorese people, there is no doubt that they want democracy and the rule of law.
author. (PL) Mr President, East Timor recently won its independence fighting for its Catholic identity.
The war of independence was bloody and involved heavy loss of life.
The President of East Timor has been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
This is an additional reason for the international community to assist in restoring order to the country.
I fully agree with Mrs Gomes that this country was developing appropriately and meeting all the standards required to function correctly.
The war is now destroying those standards and the internal order.
I believe it is worth returning to the proposals made some time ago by Mr KaczyÅski, the President of Poland, and reiterated lately by President Sarkozy.
They involve establishing a European military force capable of intervening when necessary.
Unless we have the capacity to intervene, we shall go on forever meeting here for debates on Thursdays and not achieving anything.
author. - (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is a poem by Ruy Cinatti which I have committed to memory and which reads: 'Perhaps we will be defeated or embattled, but only united'.
Unfortunately, on 11 February, crisis returned to East Timor, once again at the hands of the same people who were responsible for the crisis two years ago.
This prompts us to ask questions about the return of those who would harm the stability of this country and the gravity of an attack which seriously injured, and could even have fatally injured, the President of the Republic, JosÃ© Ramos-Horta, and which also, fortunately without any personal consequences, affected the Prime Minister, Xanana GusmÃ£o.
The violence and the disruption of the normal functioning of the institutions have once again laid bare the failures of a country with the history and circumstances of East Timor, which courageously fought and is fighting for independence, democracy and progress.
Anyone having supported East Timor from the beginning cannot fail to feel renewed sadness at this incident which we vehemently condemn.
We hope that President Ramos-Horta will fully recover and we call for a thorough investigation into what happened and into the necessary response to this.
Unfortunately, the international forces were slow to act, with the exception of the Portuguese GNR (National Republican Guard).
There are also clear failings in the rule of law in East Timor which is not functioning fully and which has in fact never functioned fully.
East Timor needs to rebuild the very core of its security system in order to ensure law and order.
The international community must assist the East Timorese people in these steps.
This is not a failed state; it is a state with failings that we must support.
However, the main responsibility obviously lies with the East Timorese people who must try to achieve a cross-party compromise for lasting peace and respect for the rule of law and judicial decisions, without hesitation, without prevarication and without complacency.
They have already managed to reach agreement on what we would call a national consensus with regard to the very core of the state's operation.
It is this consensus that Ruy Cinatti referred to in his poem which is the most pressing need of East Timor.
As a result, dear friends, we must help the people of East Timor to help themselves and make their country stronger.
author. - (ES) Mr President, I think East Timor is an example of where self-determination processes can be carried out, and carried out well.
It would, in fact, be a good idea if some of our friends, Spain included, for instance, took a leaf out of the Portuguese book and assumed their responsibilities in terms of legacies from former colonies, as is the case in Western Sahara.
It is, however, obvious that all these cases are no simple matter, nor do they produce immediate results.
Mention must be made of the difficulties experienced by East Timor where, following peaceful elections a few months ago, there are still many disturbances, including an attempt on the life of President Ramos Horta.
Here I wish to add my best wishes to those already sent by the House for a speedy recovery, and also to Prime Minister Xanana GusmÃ£o.
No one, I feel, will dispute the willingness to reach agreement, as demonstrated by President Ramos Horta, among many others, and I am sure that even after this attack President Ramos Horta will lead any work that is required to find a political agreement between the opposing factions to settle differences in a democratic, non-violent manner.
For this, however, the international community must be fully committed, and the UN mandate renewed, as some countries have suggested.
It must be renewed in any case until 2012 and at all times in response to the needs and requests of the Timorese Government and democratic forces.
The UN presence on the ground also ought to be in line with the needs of the country and should be reviewed not only in terms of reconstruction and dealing with basic necessities, but also in terms of the ability to act in a preventive fashion and react to disturbances.
Lastly, the EU must set up a delegation in Dili as soon as possible and Parliament must also make arrangements for a delegation of observers to support the democratic forces in the country and to assess the focus and effectiveness of EU assistance at the present time.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, East Timor is certainly not a failed state.
However, the fact that on 11 February 2008 both the democratically elected President and the Prime Minister became victims of armed attempts on their lives is proof of how fragile a young democracy can be.
I should like to make three points.
First, we are really worried about the lack of timely and efficient reaction by UNPOL and other international forces to these attacks.
Second, the EU has a responsibility to assist the democratic institutions of East Timor and to consolidate the rule-of-law system there.
The motion for a resolution rightly emphasises the urgent need to reach a national agreement on core issues of democracy.
Third, the EU, in full cooperation with the UN, has to contribute to the reform of the security sector in East Timor.
East Timor, after all, is not as far from us as it may seem, and Ms Gomes is good proof of this.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I wish to add my voice to the expressions of solidarity with the badly injured President of East Timor, but also to the expressions of solidarity with the people of East Timor who had to struggle for a very long time for independence and their rights.
The European Parliament condemns the attempted murder of President Ramos-Horta in the strongest terms.
The attacks were carried out after the President had attempted to achieve a negotiated solution with the rebels.
As the precise sequence of events is still unclear, we call for a thorough and rigorous investigation into the attempt on his life and an inquiry into the failure of the security system.
We welcome the joint investigation by the United Nations and the East Timorese police which has already been launched.
We call for a ban on all paramilitary groups and armed gangs and for more financial resources to be provided to support the security sector reforms that East Timor needs.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) The EP motion for a resolution on East Timor is entirely appropriate.
It explains the tragic situation of the people of that country and the powerlessness of national authorities, international institutions and the peacekeeping forces.
The internal conflict is still continuing, despite many efforts and substantial international aid.
People are losing their lives, livelihoods are being destroyed and cultural heritage damaged.
There is widespread poverty affecting almost 80% of the population, unemployment, disenchantment and illiteracy.
All this is having a negative effect on the people, leading to despair and inciting revolt.
The people of East Timor want to live in peace and harmony.
They want to work, learn and develop their country's economy.
For this to happen, the democratic authorities in the country must be strengthened, and aid from international institutions increased.
The authors of this resolution therefore rightly call for East Timor to be assured political, technical and financial support.
They also recall that both the European Union and the United Nations have made public commitments to supporting independence, democracy and rule-of-law governments.
The Union for Europe of the Nations Group will support this resolution.
- (NL) Mr President, some of my colleagues have already touched on the fact that it is no exaggeration to state that following the attacks on President Ramos Horta, East Timor is once again entering a critical phase.
I will say it again, because who does not recall the pictures from last year, following the appointment of GusmÃ£o, of hundreds of houses and some government buildings in flames?
Indeed, an international force is probably necessary in order to deal with the current crisis.
However, it certainly must not create the impression by so doing that the government needs foreign soldiers to protect itself against its own people.
A foreign force can maintain stability by manu militari in the short term, but in the long term the people of East Timor themselves must ensure their own future.
In order to guarantee political stability, democracy and respect for human rights in the long term, in the first place they need an independent and reliable media, they need a reformed police force and they need a sound judicial system.
(PL) Mr President, East Timor is widely considered to be the most successful example of a transformation process in the history of the United Nations.
East Timor does, however, seem to have forgotten the sacrifices it made during its war of independence to put an end to its brutal occupation by Indonesia lasting 24 years, and the joy with which it celebrated its own independence.
Less than six years after regaining its independence, however, East Timor now stands on the brink of chaos.
