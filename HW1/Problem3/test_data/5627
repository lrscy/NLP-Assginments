I have voted in favour of the report by the rapporteur, Mr Coelho, on the proposal for a Council decision on the application of the Schengen acquis in respect of the Schengen Information System of the newly acceded Member States.
I believe that the new Member States will meet all the essential requirements for securing the external Schengen border as recommended by the EP rapporteur.
Even though it has not proved possible to launch the new SIS II according to plan, the provisional integration of the new Member States into the current system, SISone4ALL, will provide adequate time to accomplish the SIS II.
I am convinced that meeting the Schengen area enlargement deadline will contribute to the greater confidence of citizens in the European project as a whole.
I have chosen to abstain in the final vote on Mr Coelho's report today.
The fundamental criticism of the Schengen system continues to be highly valid when it comes, for example, to personal privacy and the ability of refugees to claim asylum.
The continued construction of 'Fortress Europe' must cease as soon as possible.
I do, on the other hand, of course recognise the right of individual Member States to join the system if the countries in question are anxious so to do.
in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the report by my esteemed colleague, Mr BÃ¶ge of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats on the mobilisation of the EU Solidarity Fund, with a sum of around EUR 24 million being granted to our Hungarian and Greek friends, following the floods suffered by these Member States and their populations in March and April 2006.
Even though we must deplore the delays, many of which were due to the Member States themselves, we should be pleased about the usefulness of this fund, which is endowed with a maximum annual sum of EUR 1 billion.
Given the deadlock in the Council on reviewing the Solidarity Fund, the mobilisation of the Fund to help the victims of natural disasters in Greece and Hungary in 2006 is an opportunity to reiterate the need to ensure that regional disasters remain eligible for the Fund, and to adapt it so that it corresponds most effectively to what the victims of this type of disaster need.
It is also an opportunity to reaffirm our opposition to the ideas of extending the scope of the Fund without raising its financial ceiling and of lowering the threshold to mobilise the Fund, in such a way that the EU Member States with the highest GDP stand to gain the most from it.
We should also like to highlight our proposals, adopted by Parliament, aimed at acknowledging the specific nature of disasters in the Mediterranean region - and adapting the Solidarity Fund to timeframes and eligible actions, and to the specific nature of natural disasters such as drought and fire - and at looking into the possibility of setting up a farming disaster fund.
The purpose of Draft amending budget No 2/2007 is to mobilise the Solidarity Fund, with a view to granting financial assistance to Hungary and Greece to help repair the damage caused by the floods of March and April 2006 in those countries.
Apart from the delay in activating this EU financial assistance, the cause of which must be investigated, one of the most striking points is the paltry amount in relation to the estimated losses directly sustained.
The overall amount of Community financial aid for these disasters is some EUR 24.4 million to a loss totalling almost EUR 900 - EUR 520 million in the case of Hungary and EUR 372 in the case of Greece.
This is another example, in other words, of the discrepancy between the volume of losses and the amount offered by the Community.
This calls into question the idea of effective solidarity with the people living in the affected regions.
The current Solidarity Fund therefore needs to be reassessed in order to adapt eligibility criteria so that the Fund corresponds better to the needs of disaster victims.
(SK) Yes, Mr President, I have voted in favour of the European Parliament Regulation on the addition of vitamins and minerals and certain other substances to foods, which lays down the procedures for exercising the executive powers transferred to the Commission, and I support the Council decision of 17 July 2006 in the matter of commitology, which can be summarised as 'regulatory procedure with scrutiny'.
The European Parliament has adopted a text enabling the transfer to the Commission of the power to take quasi-legislative measures where necessary, the measures in question being those provided for in Article 2 of Decision No. 468/1999, as amended by Decision No. 512/2006, which lays down the procedures for exercising the executive powers that have been transferred to the Commission.
In this case the decision is a step in the right direction.
In general, however, it still applies that the European Parliament should leave to its Members the power to decide democratically on legislative procedures.
I voted in favour of the Scheele report because I feel that the excessive ingestion of vitamins and minerals can be harmful to health and because it is crucial that information is easily understood by all consumers.
The difficulties raised by various national laws are now reduced by this proposal via harmonisation of the Member States' legal, regulatory and administrative provisions on the addition of vitamins, minerals and other substances.
I voted in favour of the Bortone report on the proposal for a regulation on nutrition and health claims made on food.
It is based on greater information and protection for the consumer, and seeks to ban misleading nutrition and health claims, thus minimising their harmful effects and delivering greater consumer protection.
Food is the very foundation of health.
The concept of health is not solely confined to the absence of disease; it also encompasses the person's physical and emotional well-being.
It is therefore essential, in my view, that health claims be scientifically proven following assessment by the European Food Safety Authority.
in writing. - (EL) Following the vote in favour of the PrÃŒm Treaty, the follow-up version of the Schengen Treaty, the SIS II information system and the decision on the uncontrolled and unimpeded collection and exchange of personal data, including on political, ideological, philosophical and religious beliefs, the European Parliament has now approved the Visa Information System (VIS).
This system, which legalises the collection, processing and exchange of personal and biometric data on any foreigner applying for a visa for any country of the EU, to which the prosecuting authorities and secret services of each Member State have access, adds yet another link to the chain which the EU is using to throttle individual rights.
The EU aims for the VIS to be the biggest biometric database in the world.
These measures increase repression and the mechanisms used to impose it to gigantic proportions and institutionalise the potential to keep records on every inhabitant of the planet.
The ÎU is gradually turning into a barrack/fortress for its peoples and the citizens of third countries.
However, as capital extends measures to repress and throttle the rights of the workers in order to consolidate and safeguard its sovereignty, so too will the waves of resistance and disobedience and the inevitable fight to overturn the power of the monopolies and their reactionary Union.
in writing. (SV) When it comes to the opportunities under this proposal for foreign authorities to get access to data in Swedish registers, we would make it a precondition that such access be preceded by a request to the Swedish authorities and subsequent approval.
In the light of this, we are opposed to what is known as a 'hit-no hit' system.
in writing. Whilst Conservatives support co-operation between police forces, we cannot support bringing the provisions in the PrÃŒm Treaty into the EU framework.
We have grave concerns, as does the European Data Protection Supervisor, with regard to the requirements on the collection of data on individual citizens who are neither suspected nor who have committed a crime.
In addition, the issue of "hot pursuit" without authorisation by other Member States police forces is a source of great concern.
Conservatives believe that intergovernmental co-operation in the field of counter-terrorism and serious criminal cases is essential but feel that there should be an "opt-in" clause to allow Member States the freedom to maintain their traditional systems of justice.
I voted in favour, because the report is aimed at the approximation of the laws and regulations of the Member States, which will lead to closer cross-border cooperation between police forces through exchanges of information and research on criminal offences.
One of the EU's objectives consists of giving the citizens greater levels of protection, freedom, security and justice.
Effective international cooperation by means of exchanging data, while guaranteeing the right to privacy and the protection of personal data, will help meet this objective.
The PrÃŒm Treaty was signed, outside the EU's legal framework, on 27 May 2005, by seven Member States, with the aim, as they put it, of 'cross-border cooperation, particularly in combating terrorism and cross-border crime'.
Since then, nine more Member States, including Portugal, have stated their intention to ratify it.
This Treaty forms part of the securitarianism that has been brought in under the cloak of the so-called 'fight against terrorism', entailing serious risks to the citizens' rights, freedoms and guarantees.
What is at stake is the establishment of a framework for police cooperation - joint operations, mutual assistance and even the possibility of the police force of one Member State taking action on the territory of another.
The latter appears to have caused controversy in the Council.
The exchange of a wealth of information contained in personal data has proved similarly controversial.
It is particularly significant that the majority in Parliament rejected our group's proposal, whereby 'it will be forbidden to process personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, membership of a political party or a union or relating to health or sex life.'
Hence our vote against.
in writing. - (FR) On the subject of the fight against terrorism, it is most unusual that it should still be so difficult, today, for the national police forces and the anti-terrorism authorities of the various EU Member States to cooperate together and to exchange information.
However, what we now know for certain is that the attacks of 11 September and those of 11 March in Madrid were planned, at least in part, on EU soil.
These attacks demonstrated the ineffectiveness of Europe's instruments and policies for combating terrorism.
Terrorism knows no bounds; the fight against terrorism must know no bounds either, and intergovernmental cooperation in this area must be stepped up as a matter of urgency.
The same goes for the controls at the Member States' borders: they must be reintroduced as quickly as possible, because they are the bare minimum when it comes to combating terrorism effectively and efficiently.
As a final point, I should like to emphasise a reality: that of the Islamic nature of terrorism in its new guise.
A new political and religious ideology is gaining ground in Europe and in the Muslim world.
It represents a fearsome breeding ground for terrorism.
in writing. I voted against amendment 43 relating to so-called 'measures in the event of imminent danger' in the abovementioned report as I believe that measures put forward do not represent an effective means of combating cross-border crime.
in writing. - (EL) The European Parliament today gave the go-ahead for the integration of the most basic provisions of the PrÃŒm Treaty, known as Schengen III, into the so-called acquis communautaire and into the national legislation of the Member States under a simplified procedure, in other words without the signing and ratification procedures required under international treaties.
These provisions oblige the Member States to create DNA files and permit the collection, processing and automated exchange of DNA data, fingerprints and other records and information by the repressive mechanisms, including on persons who they suspect will commit a criminal offence or jeopardise public order and security.
It expressly provides that the purpose of exchanging such information is to safeguard public order at international demonstrations, especially in the run-up to EU summits.
That is why it grants the right for joint operations and full powers, including the use of firearms, to foreign police forces.
The Greek Communist Party has condemned the further criminalisation of civil and trade union action, preventive personal records and the stepping-up of the preventive repression of grassroots movements promoted by the provisions of the Treaty.
The peoples must condemn this Treaty, which is dangerous to individual rights and democratic freedoms and step up their fight against the stepping-up of autocratic measures and the anti-democratic and anti-grassroots policy of the EU in general.
The German Presidency is seeking to transfer some parts of the PrÃŒm Treaty to the third pillar.
The objectives of this text, which is aimed at combating terrorist threats and protecting the public, are of the highest importance.
Consequently, I must highlight the fact that the course of action chosen by the Council - namely demanding an emergency opinion from Parliament - has hampered the normal functioning of interinstitutional relations.
Parliament has always held a clear, responsible position on terrorism and cross-border crime.
It has supported the creation of conditions for cross-border cooperation and the exchange of information between bodies responsible for prevention and investigation into criminal offences.
This is the only way that we can hope to prevent terrorist threats effectively.
The establishment of procedures enabling the exchange of information to be prompt and effective is clearly of the highest importance.
I therefore support the report.
It is both urgent and vitally important that this framework decision on data protection be adopted.
A new global legal framework on data protection under the third pillar comparable to the rules in force in Community law is a vital factor in guaranteeing the same level of protection.
I therefore welcome the fact that a political agreement has finally been reached, and I wish to pay tribute to the rapporteur Mrs Roure for her outstanding contribution to achieving this outcome.
Improving data protection under the third pillar presupposes that this framework decision should apply to the entire pillar, including Europol, Eurojust and the Customs Information System, which already come under the third pillar.
As such, I welcome this extension and the amendments tabled by the rapporteur, in particular the insertion of an assessment and revision clause so that the Commission can submit proposals for improving the framework decision after three years.
I also endorse the 15 general principles presented by Mr Frattini, which reflect the thrust of the acquis in the area of personal data protection processed in the framework of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters.
in writing. - (EL) The Greek Communist Party voted against the report because, despite the individual improvements that it proposes to the new version of the Council's framework-decision, it fundamentally adopts in its entirety its basic philosophy, which is the unrestricted and - in practice - uncontrollable facility for the repressive mechanisms of the EU and the prosecuting authorities both in its Member States and in third countries (such as the USA) and even private individuals to collect, process and exchange between each other all the personal data of every citizen of the EU, including data relating to their political and trade union action and ideological, philosophical and religious beliefs.
The sights of the repressive mechanisms are now set on every citizen of the EU, given that the collection and transmission of everyone's personal data is permitted, even if they are hardly even suspected of any act, purely and simply for reasons of public order and security.
The addition of 15 guidelines for the protection of personal data is nothing more than a wish-list and exposÃ© of ideas, without any possibility of imposing compliance with them in practice by the repressive mechanisms.
In reality, there is absolutely no protection, in that the exceptions from this protection are becoming the rule, with the simple and uncontrolled citing of reasons of public security, while data protection is the exception, which it is almost impossible for anyone to impose.
In the era of terrorist threats, the balance between privacy and protecting the citizens is becoming a constant challenge that we can only overcome with clear, responsible measures.
The rules on data protection used for judicial and police cooperation must be drawn up in such a way as to strengthen the principle of mutual trust between the authorities involved, enabling more effective European cooperation and the highest possible protection for the citizens when it comes to the use of this data.
The measures to be taken should therefore be accurate and complete.
They should protect fundamental rights and comply with the articles in the Charter of Fundamental Rights covering privacy and the protection of personal data.
I therefore welcome the political agreement reached with the Council, which will lead to the rapid adoption of this proposal for a framework decision.
Creating the conditions for recovering fish stocks, in this case cod, is vital not only in terms of protecting marine biology resources but also keeping fisheries activity alive.
The objective should be to fish less when according to scientific research and to fishermen themselves, stocks are in need of recovery if fishing is to take place - perhaps on a bigger scale - in the future.
We must bear in mind, however, that these recovery plans, whereby fishing is restricted, have a serious economic and social impact that must be weighed up and taken into account.
Against this backdrop, we support the proposals in this regard contained in the report.
What is needed is for the sector to be compensated for the economic and social consequences of this break in fishing, and there should be a Community compensation fund specifically for this purpose.
In other words the common fisheries policy must take on its responsibilities.
Our vote against Amendments 20, 21 and 22 was based on our view that decisions on total allowable catches and quotas should not be automatically linked to the opinions of the Council for the Exploration of the Sea.
Other factors, economic and social factors for example, should be taken into account, as evidenced by representation in the Regional Advisory Councils.
in writing. (PL) Despite the restrictions on fishing quotas introduced in recent years, some Baltic cod stocks are now below acceptable biological limits.
The report wisely proposes an 8% reduction of the number of days at sea using fishing gear, more rigorous inspections, and in particular raising to 300 kg the limit above which fishing vessels must obtain permission from the competent bodies at the point of unloading.
In addition, it proposes increasing the minimum size of cod fished in the Baltic to 40 cm.
The rapporteur also rightly refers to the issue of dividing the Baltic into an eastern and a western area, as these are two quite distinct ecosystems.
Different fishing quotas should therefore be laid down for each of these areas of the Baltic.
Priority should be given to the east as stocks there are now below acceptable biological limits.
The plan to prepare a report on the social and economic impact of implementation of the proposed regulation on the sector deserves our support too.
The report should focus in particular on the employment structure and the financial situation of fishermen, ship owners and enterprises involved in cod fishing and processing.
Mr President, I just wish to say that the Irish delegation and my colleagues in the PPE-DE Group voted in favour of this report.
We are happy with its emphasis on the role of producer groups and crisis management.
However, we have a problem with two amendments, 11 and 111, which were voted through together.
These two amendments will pose particular problems for potato growers in Ireland who are currently losing significant entitlements to the single farm payment to the national reserve because the land they use for growing potatoes is not eligible for the single farm payment as things stand.
We welcome the Commission's proposal to remove this exclusion and to change this anomaly, and we hope that the Commission's proposal is ratified by the Council, not the one as amended here this morning.
(CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted against the Salinas GarcÃ­a report on market reforms in the fruit and vegetable sector.
The Commission believes that reform in the sector is needed, and this is a view I share.
What the Commission is proposing, though, is not reform.
What is needed is to end the unnecessary regulation of the entire sector, to remove export subsidies and to abolish quotas completely.
This, however, is not what the Commission is proposing.
Instead, it is proposing minor, cosmetic changes that retain the regulatory nature of the whole policy.
Neither I nor the other MEPs from the Czech Civil Democratic Party (ODS) support this approach and we have accordingly voted against the report.
in writing. - (FR) I voted for the bulk of the report by my fellow Member, Mrs Salinas GarcÃ­a, on the proposal for a Council regulation laying down specific rules as regards the fruit and vegetable sector.
This important sector, which represents around 17% of the Union's agricultural production, is, in reality, very varied, fragile and confronted with structural problems, at the same time as being exposed to growing external pressure.
It deserves to be supported, not only for producers but also for public health reasons - the health of European consumers - and for our food processing industry.
The European Commission proposals are an initial basis for work that will have to be adjusted and improved in many areas.
Nevertheless, I welcome the specific attention paid by the Union to this important sector.
Following the reform of the CAP, which introduced the principle of single payment and which paved the way for the decoupling of production aid, the Commission now feels it is the turn of fruit and vegetables.
Using the old arguments of competitiveness, market forces, the WTO and so on, the Commission has put forward proposals that will, if the governments of the Member States agree to them, lead to more abandonment of production and more unemployment in the future, and will link aid to 'historical' payments and to the single payment scheme, and we are opposed to this.
In Portugal, the industrial tomato sector is under threat.
It is a sector in which there has been a great deal of investment, one that has developed, that has produced quantity and quality, and one in which the overwhelming majority of production provides work for many small and medium-sized farmers, family farming and many workers linked directly or indirectly to the agri-food industry.
If the Commission's proposal were to go through, thousands of jobs in agriculture and industry would be put in jeopardy, even if in the short term there is still a payment to farmers and a transitional period.
Although the report introduced several measures that we welcome, it does not substantially change the Commission's proposal and as such we could not vote in favour.
in writing. (SV) The proposed addition to the Commission's proposal put forward by Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is beneath contempt.
We firmly reject the proposals to subsidise growers of cherries and berries, mushrooms and fruit, to introduce area payments for garlic, to investigate the possible introduction of an EU quality label, to introduce an EU quality control agency for fruit and vegetables from third countries and to introduce a security fund for the said sector of cultivation and wordings relating to export refunds and the like for processed tomatoes, et cetera.
The June List observes, once again, that, in this situation, it is fortunate that the European Parliament does not have powers of codecision in respect of the EU's agricultural policy.
Otherwise, the EU would fall into the trap of protectionism and of heavy subsidies to all the various groups within the agricultural industry.
We have therefore voted against this report.
in writing. - (EL) The purpose of the proposed review of the regulation on fruit and vegetables is to adjust to the new CAP, the EU financial perspective and the WTO.
Decoupling subsidies from production, substantially reducing Community support and abolishing the remaining traces of export subsidies will result in increased imports and a reduction in exports, will shrink the manufacturing industry and turn certain factories into packaging units for imported raw materials and will result in drastic cutbacks or the abandonment of certain crops, the subsidies for which make a significant contribution to farmers' incomes.
In Greece, the worst victims are mainly growers of juicing oranges, industrial tomatoes and sultanas, which are our country's main products.
The result will be the concentration of the production of fruit and vegetables in few hands, the mass destruction of small and medium-sized farms, using decoupled subsidies as bait, and an increase in the profitability of commercial industrialists, with guaranteed cheap raw materials, both domestic and imported.
As far as producer organisations are concerned, their role is being upgraded, even using anti-democratic changes, so that even those who do not want to are forced to join.
However, the unwillingness of farmers to join producer organisations derives from their role as mediation bodies between farmers and commercial industrialists, for the benefit of the interests of the commercial industrialists.
We MEPs of the Greek Communist Party have voiced our opposition and voted against the report, because the proposed changes are yet another blow to small and medium-sized farms.
in writing. (SV) This report sets right, to a certain extent, the market in fruit and vegetables, which is brim-full of excessively detailed regulation, and phases out export refunds for this sector.
I am not, therefore, voting against the report, but the improvements to it are not great enough for me to vote in favour of it, so I am abstaining.
I voted to abstain and against the amendments proposed by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
These amendments moved away from the principle and practice of reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP).
I abstained where there was no clear implication for UK interests, but where there were clear concerns for continental Member States - 'hot pursuit' being that particular vote.
I also voted against eight amendments, which, when taken in combination, actually increased funds to fruit and vegetable sectors, which is against the UK Labour Party's view that support spending should be reduced and contradicts CAP reform.
(PL) Mr President, Montesquieu remarked that democracies are based on law, monarchies on honour and dictatorships on fear.
As we are a democratic institution, I should like to say that I do not agree with legal acts referring to other legal acts that are not binding.
I share the view expressed by Mrs Bonde on the subject.
In that connection, I should like to point out that I voted against Amendment 25 to the report by Mr Crespo and Mr Brok.
If by some mistake it appears that I voted in its favour, please note that my intention had been to vote against.
(PL) Mr President, I have today voted against the report calling for work on the new Union treaty, the new Constitution for Europe, to begin as soon as possible with a view to adoption of the draft document.
The League of Polish Families to which I belong is opposed to the creation of a new European super state and to all measures aimed at depriving nation states of their sovereignty.
We trust that the attempt to draft a new treaty based on the draft Constitution for Europe, which has been pushed through so forcibly by certain Members of this House, will end in failure.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, contrary to the previous speaker, the Pensioners' Party is highly in favour of the existence of a Europe that is also political and that heralds benefits for citizens, in particular for citizens who want a future, because they are working now, and for citizens who want a present, because they are now retired and have the right to a better life than that experienced by the elderly and retired in the past.
Thus they look to Europe for security, because all too often, if not always, States ignore the real everyday issues that matter to citizens, such as how to survive in a global society that focuses purely on the 'god of money' and not on human beings at all stages of life, from the cradle to the grave.
We therefore hope that the European Constitution will be adopted as soon as possible.
in writing. (SV) We Swedish Social Democrats voted in favour of this report, which is basically a sound one.
We wish, however, to offer a number of clarifications.
We voted in favour of what is stated in paragraph 8 as we are in favour of strengthening the common foreign and security policy.
It is important to point out, however, that we are not in favour of common defence.
Point 12 highlights issues such as Social Europe and the struggle against climate change that are important to Europeans.
However, we are opposed to incorporating the Copenhagen criteria into the Constitution.
We believe that the Copenhagen criteria are important, but we do not want them to be written into the Constitution as this would make it harder to continue enlargement.
For the same reason, we are also opposed to other obstacles being placed in the path of the candidate countries.
We furthermore reject the preferential position proposed under paragraph 18 for religious communities in comparison with the rest of civil society.
in writing. The Constitutional Treaty is a landmark document which provides a blueprint for a more dynamic and effective European Union, strengthens the democratic character of an enlarged Union and enhances our decision-making capacity and ability to act on the world stage.
We are committed to preserving to the greatest extent possible the substance of the Constitution.
We support this report.
We reject the concept of a two-tier Europe.
However, we have voted against paragraph 11 regarding the diminution of the protection of the rights of citizens because of its vagueness.
How is this decided and who decides that the protection of rights of citizens has been diminished?
We have also voted against paragraph 20, which demands that all Member States coordinate their ratification procedures in order to allow for simultaneous ratification.
How can we coordinate between different systems of Member States particularly when some require ratification by referenda and others by Parliament?
We need to respect the ratification system of each Member State.
Saying this, we encourage governments to come together and decide on as short a timeframe as possible for agreement and ratification of a Treaty according to their national requirements.
We voted in favour of CA28 as the language is more reflective of the reality than that of the PSE amendment regarding ratification in France and the Netherlands.
(Abbreviated in accordance with Rule 163(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
in writing. - (FR) I abstained during the final vote on the BarÃ³n-Brok report on the roadmap for the Union's constitutional process.
Indeed, the rejection of the European Constitutional Treaty by two Member States in fact nullifies the proposal submitted for ratification by the Member States in 2005.
This established fact must therefore be taken into account by the Heads of State or Government who cannot keep the initial text even 'in a different format'.
Equally, the process of drafting a new treaty must not take place at the expense of European democracy by means of a mere intergovernmental conference.
in writing. The Socialist group has approved this resolution by an overwhelming majority.
I should add on behalf of the Labour MEPs that the EPLP fully supports the main conclusion of this report, namely "a commitment to calling an Intergovernmental Conference and the definition of a roadmap containing a procedure, a clear mandate and a clear objective of reaching an agreement before the end of this year".
However, we thought that it was inappropriate to single out some - but not other - elements contained in the Constitutional Treaty as being essential, as the new treaty will only see the light of day if it is acceptable to all 27 member states.
I voted in favour because I feel it is crucial and increasingly urgent that we find solutions whereby we can overcome the problems and challenges facing the EU, both internally and externally.
This report is well-balanced and represents an important contribution to resolving the institutional deadlock in which the Union finds itself at the earliest opportunity.
The Union must be given adequate resources to meet the citizens' concerns regarding the challenges of globalisation and climate change, thereby contributing towards strengthening the democratic control over its decision-making processes.
The new Treaty, regardless of the name and the structure it is eventually given, must retain the thrust of the text already ratified by a number of Member States and at the same time incorporate the amendments needed to obtain the consensus it cannot do without.
With the right legislative and budgetary procedures for giving the EU the maximum amount of decision-making ability and for making its policies as effective as possible, the new Treaty may help resolve some of the serious problems that Europe is facing.
The adoption of this report is definitive proof of the flagrant disregard for the sovereign decision made by the people of France and the Netherlands, demonstrating once again that Parliament's concept of democracy does not extend as far as respect for the sovereign decisions of people expressed via referendums.
This decision taken by the majority in Parliament demonstrates that the 'period of reflection' was nothing more than a means of overlooking the negative result of the two referendums and of preventing others, in which there could be further rejections of the so-called European Constitution, from being held.
Two years on, more pressure is being exerted to step up the capitalist penetration of the EU, the neoliberal policies, the ever-faster militarisation and the centralisation of power into the hands of supranational institutions, which are becoming increasingly distant from the citizens and dominated by the major powers.
It is unacceptable for Parliament to confer on itself a legitimacy it does not have, which is precisely what it is doing in its attempts to interfere with the timetable and content of the process, that is to say, in the sovereign decision of different countries, and to coordinate ratification processes.
We are in favour of a more democratic, fairer Europe that is characterised by solidarity, a Europe that promotes peace and cooperation with people from all parts of the world, a Europe that complies with the principle of sovereign States with equal rights.
in writing. (SV) The federalist majority in the European Parliament are not ideologically representative of their electorates as far as matters pertaining to the EU Constitution are concerned.
At present, everything possible is being done to avoid asking the voters for their opinions on Europe's future via referendums.
We are in favour of arranging referendums on such matters, but we do not believe that the European Parliament is the proper body to push through referendums in the Member States.
The federalist majority would now like to secure as much as possible of the supranationalism from the old draft Constitutional Treaty by means of simply changing the title of the draft EU Constitution.
We have therefore voted against the report submitted by Parliament's Committee on Constitutional Affairs.
The Union needs a treaty that builds on the self-determination of the Member States and through which, together, we regulate how cross-border issues are to be managed.
One only has to read point 6 to justify rejecting the Resolution.
According to Point 6, the Resolution 'reaffirms its commitment to achieving a settlement of the ongoing constitutional process of the European Union that is based on the content of the Constitutional Treaty, possibly under a different presentation ...'
These few words lay bare the true intention of the current (cosy) negotiations taking place in the Council - in other words, between the governments run by the Portuguese Socialists, the German Christian Democrat/Social Democrat coalition, and so on - which are purely and simply an attempt to (re)impose the thrust of the Treaty rejected by France and the Netherlands.
This is indicative of deep disdain for the democratic sovereign will expressed by the people of these two countries in national referendums.
During the debate, did anyone actually ask whether they 'take people for fools'?
Yet it is precisely because they do not 'take people for fools' that the political forces of the right and the social democrats, in cahoots with one another, negotiate 'behind closed doors' and keep their cards close to their chests so as to preclude the risk of failure.
The German Presidency moves full steam ahead, claiming it has a 'mandate' to 'preserve' the content and 'substance' of the so-called 'European Constitution' in the 'new' draft Treaty to be presented by December 2007 (!) and ratified by 2009.
In a word, unacceptable.
in writing. (DA) The Danish Social Democratic delegation in the European Parliament has voted in favour of the own-initiative report on the roadmap for the Union's Constitutional Process.
We should like to emphasise in this connection that the issue of how and when the individual Member State chooses to ratify a new Treaty should continue to be a matter for itself as a sovereign nation.
We think it sensible, however, so to coordinate the ratification process that, irrespective of the forms it might take in individual Member States, it is conducted in such a way that it will be possible formally to complete it in all the countries simultaneously, as indicated in paragraph 20 of the report.
in writing. - (FR) I believe that the majority of the European Parliament has not sought to respond to the message sent out by the EU populations that rejected the Constitutional Treaty.
By rejecting Amendment 1, Parliament has refused to allow the people to be consulted by referendum on any new treaty.
The fact is, this element is crucial because the opportunity for them to impose social policies or policies matching their aspirations depends on it.
This is a major shortcoming of the European Union.
That is why I shall vote against this report.
in writing. I voted against paragraph 20 (original text) in the above-mentioned report as I believe that the proposal to hold a ratification process simultaneously across all EU Member States is impractical.
in writing. - (EL) The report endeavours to resuscitate the European Constitution.
The European Parliament is insultingly ignoring the rejection and condemnation of the 'European Constitution', through referenda, by the French and Dutch people and by the other peoples whose governments have deprived them of the right to express themselves.
The familiar coalition of the political spokesmen of capital (conservatives, socialists and liberals) and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance is calling on the governments of the Member States to come to an agreement before the end of 2007, to adopt and enforce the 'European Constitution' before the European elections in 2009, with the same reactionary content, perhaps packaged differently, in order to deceive the peoples.
There can be no progressive 'European Constitution' of the imperialist EU of capital.
Any 'Constitutional' Treaty will be a treaty which safeguards and promotes the interests and ambitions of big, Euro-unifying business, just like the current treaties of the EU and, previously, of the EEC.
The European plutocracy, the imperialists and their servants need a European Constitution, in order to shield their power, in order to safeguard the capitalist system, in order to strike at the rights of the working class and the peoples of Europe, in order to repress the grassroots movements and in order to step up their aggressive policy of intervention and war.
It is in the interests of the people to bury the 'Constitutional Treaty' and the EU itself once and for all.
in writing. (SK) Critics frequently describe the EU as a strong organisation which meddles in too many areas.
As an MEP for Slovakia, a new Member State which has only recently acceded to the Union, I feel that we should have a stronger Europe capable of greater action.
For this reason I believe it is essential to adopt a revised constitutional document, that is, to have clear rules of the game.
The Union needs to reform the founding treaties in a way which would enjoy broad public support.
I appreciate the efforts by Chancellor Angela Merkel to lead the Union out of its constitutional crisis by introducing a road map offering appropriate solutions for the problems that the European Union is facing both internally and externally, as well as the problems associated with the expansion and deepening of the EU's political dimension.
An enlarged EU needs tools and means to operate efficiently, to strengthen its role in the world, and to address the concerns of its citizens against the background of challenges brought about inter alia by globalisation, climate change, the need to ensure energy supply and an ageing population.
Many of the issues which provoked some of the greatest concern among the European public, such as the directive on services in the internal market and the financial framework, have since been resolved.
As reiterated in the Berlin Declaration on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Rome, we must build the EU on a renewed joint foundation and we must do so before the 2009 elections for the European Parliament.
This is why I have voted in favour of the report by the rapporteurs Enrique BarÃ³n Crespo and Elmar Brok.
Had a referendum on the Constitutional Treaty taken place in Portugal, in the wording and circumstances of two years ago, I would have voted 'yes'.
Among other things, the institutional stability that would have arisen would have been beneficial to the EU.
As events turned out, precisely as stipulated, two countries exercised their right to a veto, which represents a considerable change in circumstances.
We must now respond to reality, not in spite of it.
I still believe that the institutional architecture needs to be adjusted to accommodate the reality of 'Europe' enlarged to 27 and as such I feel that the best solution is the maximalist solution to overcoming the difficulties arising from this new set of circumstances - if only to ensure that the solution reached is a stable one - but a minimalist solution to introducing amendments that, no matter how much the authors of the proposed Treaty would like, were rejected.
Realism is no less virtuous than idealism.
Lastly, I feel that as regards the referendum, and the possibility of holding one in Portugal, the further away the solution is from the Constitutional Treaty, the less the need for a referendum; and vice-versa, of course.
in writing. (SV) I abstained in the vote on the roadmap for the draft Constitutional Treaty in respect of an amendment stating that all countries 'shall' hold referendums.
I am in favour of referendums, but this is something that each Member State must decide for itself.
The German constitution, for example, does not recognise the instrument of referendums.
in writing. I, along with my EPLP colleagues, voted to abstain on critical issues of this report, which, even as an own-initiative endeavour, is inappropriate on certain levels.
Paragraph 5 is an ambiguous reference to the Member States that have not put the text to ratification yet.
There are also issues where inappropriate demands are made on a list of issues or concern idle threats to reject Council negotiations.
Alongside this is a request to hold simultaneous ratification, which could present serious problems in many Member States.
However, there were other serious issues which could be supported and where I could support them, I did.
in writing. (PL) This is a very significant report, which will enable the European Parliament to make its views on the action plan regarding the European Union's constitutional process heard at the forthcoming June European Council.
Every effort should be made to preserve the content of the treaty, whilst at the same time including in the text provisions on the new challenges facing Europe.
I could mention climate change, social Europe, the war on terror, inter-cultural dialogue and economic management.
It is also important to point out that the so-called mini-treaty does not seem to provide a solution to this difficult situation.
The European Council should convene an intergovernmental conference as soon as possible and reach a compromise before the end of 2007, so that decisions on the ratification process can be taken by the end of 2008.
This would allow the incoming Parliament elected in 2009 to operate within the framework of the new Constitutional Treaty.
The debate on the definition of the functions of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) comes through clearly in Parliament's resolution, and in the conclusions of the Council.
It is abundantly clear that attempts are being made to control and manipulate the UNHCR.
It is in this context that one must understand the criticism and pressure from the EU, regarding, firstly, the manner in which some countries have been elected to the body - the EU opposes the so-called 'clean slate' principle and favours the introduction of eligibility criteria; secondly, the 'special procedure' for increasing the mandates per country and the possibility of creating new mandates by simple majority - and the absence of a 'code of conduct' for this mechanism; and thirdly, the modalities of the 'Universal Periodic Review'.
In other words, what is needed is, on the one hand, to continue to monitor the development of the UNHCR, especially given the USA and its allies are known to manipulate it, and on the other hand, to support our proposals to promote fundamental freedoms, rights and guarantees, social progress, peace and solidarity, the rejection of the use of human rights to disguise a policy of interventionism and aggression towards sovereign peoples and States.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as a representative of the Pensioners' Party I voted in favour of the report by Mrs Gibault on artists' working conditions and pensions.
There are artists who become very famous and certainly do not need the European Parliament to facilitate their movement and pension conditions, but there are also excellent artists who unfortunately do not have great success; such artists, and there are many of them, are nonetheless human beings - workers and pensioners who deserve the same respect as all other citizens.
There are artists who live a life of work and poverty, unprotected by regulation and without being shown respect.
This is all the more serious when the person to whom a lack of respect is shown has a sensitive soul, as artists have.
That is why I voted in favour, and I hope that Europe will do more for artists all over Europe and throughout the world.
(FI) Mr President, I voted in favour of Claire Gibault's report on the social status of artists.
I want to support her commendable work in this area, as she, an artist herself, cares about European artists' livelihoods.
We of course know that many artists today depend for their livelihood on very short-term contracts in different countries in Europe.
It is therefore very relevant to ensure that artists in Europe also enjoy proper social status and receive social security, and thus in time a pension, because it is a fact that we in Europe want to promote education and culture.
We want to promote the European cultural arena because we know that it is the most important area in decision-making in Europe.
If that is healthy, we can then also build both a single market and a foreign and security policy upon it.
I actually voted in favour of this report as a European, as a Finn and as a member of the Finnish Centre Party, Keskusta, which also represents the Finnish cultural movement.
I voted in favour of this report because I feel it is important that European artists can benefit from an appropriate level of integration in their professional activities.
European standards must be applied with a view to having a dynamic and innovative European cultural policy in all branches of the arts, enabling us to offer artists the social guarantees enjoyed by all other European workers.
We know that this report addresses issues that need to be treated with special care.
Yet there are two points that must be made.
First and foremost, it is necessary to confer on artists labour and social rights, in view of the specific nature of their activities and in compliance with the freedom of expression and creation.
We therefore feel it is crucial to take account of the activities of those working in creative arts and to improve their social status.
We are critical, however, of some of the proposals in this report on which Parliament has voted.
We know that cultural democratisation can only take place under the right conditions and that these times in which we live, characterised as they are by ever deepening neoliberalism, are not conducive to improving the working conditions and the creativity of most artists.
In Portugal, the situation in this area is complicated too, with attacks on the rights gained and cuts in cultural and artistic activities, in which everybody - the artists and the population as a whole - loses out.
We hope, however, that something can be done to give more visibility to these issues.
in writing. (SV) The ability of artists to make a living is an important issue, but it is one that the Member States have responsibility for resolving politically in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity.
We have therefore voted against this report.
in writing. (PL) Mrs Gibault's report aimed at improving employment conditions for artists deserves strong support.
Most of the difficulties encountered by artists working in Community countries other than their country of origin are not due to cultural issues.
They relate for example to mobility, visa policy, health policy, social security, unemployment and pensions.
The report urges the Commission and the Member States to introduce a European Professional Register for artists. This would contain information on the status of each artist, the nature and duration of contracts, together with information on employers.
The register would make it possible to transfer pension entitlements and social benefits acquired by artists in third countries when they returned to their country of origin.
It would also allow experience gained whilst working in a Member State to be taken into account.
The challenge facing European cultural policy is the creation of a dynamic cultural environment that is creative and innovative with respect to all types of art. By supporting this report we are committing ourselves to providing artists with the social guarantees enjoyed by all other European workers.
in writing. (CS) I shall be voting in favour of the adoption of the report on the social status of artists.
I feel that this will be a step towards resolving this problem, albeit one that merely scratches the surface and that will require further work.
I feel that the report implicitly places the emphasis on performing artists and rather overlooks literature, which is a highly creative and important branch of the arts.
As far as the report is concerned, writers are mere amateurs whose work is rarely classified as 'professional artistic activity'.
As for the conditions that exist in, say, the Czech Republic, I know of only one solitary author who is 'allowed' to be a professional artist.
Furthermore, there is clear and convincing evidence that the Unie ÄeskÃœch spisovatelÅ¯ (Czech Writers' Union) - a left-leaning Czech writers' organisation - has for years been silenced and segregated by the Czech Culture Ministry.
This only goes to show the sorry state of support for the art of writing.
The report also fails to define what is meant by the term 'European artist' even though it uses the term on a number of occasions.
Do writers come into this category?
If so, I feel that they cannot be measured in the same way as so-called performing artists.
Mr President, I voted in favour of this report but with a cautionary note in terms of the proposed increase in spending on information, as it would relate to a proposal to bring local journalists here to Brussels.
We would need to be very clear about what we are going to do with the local journalists and ensure that we make information that is available here relevant to the people who read and listen to local media.
I do not think we have done that particularly well in the past, so we need more details on this issue.
(LT) Mr President, today Parliament adopted a resolution concerning the United Nations Human Rights Council and its fifth session.
As one of the authors of this resolution, I am very pleased that all political groups have agreed on an assessment of the first year of operation of the United Nations Human Rights Council, and which shortcomings it needs to attend to.
They have also authorised a European Parliament ad hoc delegation, which will participate next week in the fifth Human Rights Council plenary session - a session, which is particularly important for the future of this organisation.
As one of the authors of this resolution and a member of the delegation, I would like to thank Parliament and my colleagues for supporting the resolution.
With regard to Parliament's estimates of revenue and expenditure for 2008, we wish to highlight just two of the many aspects worthy of consideration.
The first concerns the plan to earmark EUR 10 300 000 in 2008 for 'an awareness campaign in view of the 2009 European elections' and EUR 900 000 for implementation of the Parliamentary Television Channel.
This is a matter of particular concern given that no detailed information or justifications have been given regarding the use of these financial resources.
For example, how will they be used, and by whom?
What are the actions to be funded?
Who is to decide how they are to be used, and according to what criteria?
Might it be that this 'awareness campaign' is being used, rather like the referendums on the lapsed Constitutional Treaty, as a covert way of using Community money, scandalously, to fund propaganda campaigns to promote the content of the Treaty?
The second is the effective guarantee and exercise of multilingualism in the European institutions and, in this case, Parliament.
We wish to highlight the fact that the increasing outsourcing of language and translation services, and other types of unstable contract, inevitably affects the quality of the service and undermines the rights of those providing this service.
in writing. (SV) In the first amendment, Mr Lundgren points out that the travelling circus moving between the three different places of work results in absurdly high costs.
With that much I agree. The problem lies with the accusation, which finds its way into the third amendment, that the EU would be going in for questionable property speculation.
The opposite is, of course, true: the European Parliament saves money by owning its buildings.
Because there were parts of the proposal I agreed with, I abstained from voting in the first case and voted against in the second.
In the second amendment, Mr Lundgren expresses the view that the EU should refrain from conducting centralised campaigns.
In this matter too, I am in agreement: it is unlikely that Europeans would have a more positive attitude towards the EU as a result of the Commission's communications strategies.
I would have difficulty, however, objecting to the EU choosing to invest resources in providing information about its activities in the run-up to a European Parliament election.
It is by working constructively, notably in our own countries between elections, that we are best at providing information at local level.
It is when we engage in constructive politics that we are best at communicating policy.

Order of business
The final draft of the agenda for this part-session, as laid down by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday, 14 June 2007 pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure, has been distributed.
It has been requested that this draft be amended as follows.
The Socialist Group in the European Parliament has requested a statement by the President of Parliament on the situation in Palestine, followed by short speeches by the chairmen of the groups.
I suggest this statement be made at 9 a.m. tomorrow, as the first item on the agenda.
Are there any objections to this?
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, this is not an objection, but just a suggestion: perhaps representatives of the Commission and Council could make a brief statement on this very precarious situation.
After all, these two bodies have an overview of the situation.
Since this is an exceptional situation, it should be possible for the Council, too, to make a statement.
Is that the case?
We can request it, although I am doubtful whether there will be anyone from the institutions you mention available tomorrow at 9 a.m.
We shall try, however.
Parliament adopted the motion.
I have not received any amendments for today - Monday.
Tuesday:
I should like to pass on a message from the Council: it cannot be present tomorrow afternoon for the statements on the conclusions of the G8 Summit.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I think that that is very regrettable, to put it mildly.
The Council was asked as long as a month or so ago to be present without fail at this debate, and we were even promised that it would be.
I do not understand why there is no minister or other representative of the government of the country holding the Council Presidency who is able to be present.
In my opinion, you should make it quite clear that we are very disappointed about the situation.
Mr Swoboda, I, too, have only just found this out.
We shall make our message suitably clear.
Wednesday:
No amendments have been received.
Thursday:
The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe has requested postponing the vote on the motions for resolutions on the Middle East until the July part-session.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you.
Given the recent developments in the Palestinian regions, it is more important, as we see it, that we indeed hold a brief debate tomorrow morning to discuss the situation, the new developments, the challenges being faced and then follow this up possibly with a resolution in July where we can take all new developments into consideration, rather than the other way round.
My group fully supports the proposal of having a debate tomorrow, as you suggested, Mr President, and of taking the time to propose a more well-founded and, above all, a more up-to-date resolution by the next part-session.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, this has the full support of our group.
The situation is so confusing, and the things we say today may no longer apply as soon as tomorrow or the day after.
Therefore, it undoubtedly makes sense to take account of the situation now, and then adopt such a resolution in July.
(Parliament adopted the motion)
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Conference of Presidents decided unanimously last week to hold a major debate on Cuba in autumn, as there is no current occasion for a debate on Cuba.
Yet the General Affairs Council has been discussing Cuba today and yesterday and has issued conclusions showing the Council's position in a slightly different light.
For example, the Council invites a Cuban delegation to Brussels for exploratory talks, and declares its willingness to conduct comprehensive, open dialogue with the Cuban Government on all issues of mutual interest.
This constitutes a current occasion, and so we should be much obliged if, despite last week's discussion by the Conference of Presidents, the subject could now be placed on the agenda after all.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I, too, attended this Conference of Presidents, and the proposal to hold a comprehensive debate on policy on Latin America, in which Cuba is to play a special role, in autumn was my motion on behalf of my group.
Mr Nassauer is an extremely honourable, proper MEP, and what I am about to say does not apply to him, as he joined us in voting in favour of the proposal for an autumn debate at this Conference of Presidents.
Nevertheless, as we know, some members of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats took the view - not in response to today's decisions by the General Affairs Council but as early as last Thursday, immediately after the Conference of Presidents - that that was not on; that Cuba was at all events to be discussed immediately under urgent procedure.
We also know who this was: it was chiefly the Spanish delegation in the PPE-DE Group.
We have been wondering for some time whether 'PPE' stands for 'Partido Popular EspaÃ±ol'.
One thing is completely clear: it is these people in the PPE-DE Group who are responsible for the fact that every opportunity is taken in this House for domestic Spanish idealogisation.
I repeat, therefore: there is absolutely no point in debating Cuba under urgent procedure on Thursday afternoon.
The debate would attract maybe 15 people.
The European Council's decision today to invite a Cuban delegation is a confirmation that it makes perfect sense to await this dialogue before we hold a debate here in autumn, for which we shall then be properly prepared: this is respectable politics.
What we are seeing here now is domestic Spanish manoeuvring; that is what this is.

(Applause)
(Parliament approved the motion by electronic vote.)
(Uproar in the Chamber)
Ladies and gentlemen, that is the result of your vote.
(DE) Mr President, I think that was a technical error - I am truly sorry.
During the vote, the lights went out on a large number of machines, for example those of Mr Karas and Mr Nassauer, who then wished to complain to you, albeit unaware of the actual result - which I can understand.
I therefore formally request that you repeat the vote.
(Applause)
Ladies and gentlemen, please, let us not quarrel over such an issue; there is enough discord in Europe.
It was a very close result, and it is true that some machines did not work, including those of Mr Nassauer, Mr Swoboda and others.
Therefore, I request your consent to repeat the vote.
(DE) Mr President, I would refer to the standard procedure, whereby anyone whose voting machine has failed to work can place his or her position on the record without the need to repeat the vote.
Ladies and gentlemen, in view of the close outcome of the vote and the fact that some machines did not work, I recommend that the vote be repeated.
(ES) Mr President, the vote has been carried out properly and on time and, as far as I can remember, Mr President, I have never known a vote to be repeated in this House as a result of a machine failing.
I have never seen that.
Ladies and gentlemen, a consensus was required for the vote to be repeated, and I recommended doing so, but regrettably we have been unable to reach agreement.
Unfortunately, it has not been possible to obtain your consent.
According to the legal situation, then, the vote has taken place.
Nevertheless, I give you the floor, Mrs Scheele.
(DE) Mr President, the light was on when we voted, and suddenly all the lights disappeared.
This is different from when machines are not working and we have to inform the technicians.
The question is whether majorities have to be obtained in this devious way in such an important matter.
We could carry on discussing this for hours.
I shall now read out what has been written down for me:
The technical people tell us that there was a technical problem.
In fact they closed the vote a bit earlier than I announced it was closed.
If the technicians say they closed the vote before the President announced it was closed, I have to declare it invalid.
We shall therefore repeat the vote.
(Parliament adopted the motion)
(The agenda was therefore adopted)
Definition, description, presentation and labelling of spirit drinks (debate)
The next item is the report by Horst Schnellhardt, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the definition, description, presentation and labelling of spirit drinks C6-0440/2005
Mr President, honourable Members, I am speaking on behalf of my colleague, Commissioner Fischer Boel, who wishes to thank the rapporteur, Mr Schnellhardt, and the members of the various committees involved in drawing up this excellent report.
She also wishes to express her appreciation for the good cooperation between all involved in Parliament and the Council, and to thank the Council for its work.
As a result of this cooperation, the work has moved smoothly and steadily towards achieving the result of which we are all aware.
On 15 December 2005, the Commission submitted a proposal for a new regulation on the definition, description, presentation and labelling of spirit drinks.
Since then, a whole series of discussions have taken place: a public hearing took place in Parliament on 20 July 2006; there were reports from the Committee responsible, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety; there were opinions from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection.
This process has been very intensive and constructive under the codecision procedure.
A series of informal trialogues took place which led to the Council's general approach, which not only accommodates most of the Member States' concerns, but also reflects the European Parliament's powers of codecision by taking the vast majority of its proposals on board.
One proposal in particular that has been taken on board is the abolition of the initial proposal for the categorisation of spirit drinks; secondly, the introduction of a strong quality policy for spirit drinks; thirdly, the withdrawal of the proposal to allow flavours to be added to eau de vie; and fourthly, the strengthening of the powers of the European Parliament by introducing the regulatory committee with scrutiny procedures in most of the cases for which provision is made for comitology.
Those are just a few of the essential amendments which were introduced on the initiative of the European Parliament.
During this whole procedure, my colleague, Commissioner Fischer Boel, has played a constructive and pragmatic role with a view to finding a result that we hope the European Parliament will be able to endorse.
In line with the international obligations deriving from the TBT Agreement and following the Council's request of 23 April 2007, the Commission sent the file to the WTO, setting a two-month period for comments.
This notification was formally made on 1 June 2007.
As regards vodka, the Commission still has some reservations at this stage, which are primarily of a legal nature.
The Commission has always taken a clear stance that it must ensure that a definition of vodka is compatible with EU law and fits the WTO context.
The definition of the raw-material bases for this popular product - which is enjoying considerable market buoyancy worldwide - has been subject to considerable debate in the last month.
The general approach of the Council distinguishes the labelling of vodka between one group based on potatoes and cereals, and those products which are derived from other raw materials which shall bear the indication 'produced from' and list the products that go into it.
The Commission's legal service has expressed concern about the compatibility of this solution both with EU law and with WTO obligations.
Any restriction of the present legislation needs to be duly justified and proportionate; the least intrusive way has to be found to serve this goal.
So my colleague would like to conclude with these words: 'For the time being, let me congratulate the Council Presidency and Parliament for their very successful collaboration, which I hope will be endorsed as a first-reading agreement by Parliament in view of a final adoption once the WTO notification procedure has been brought to an end in two months' time'.
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, you all heard what the Commissioner said, which, I can honestly say, expressed my feelings exactly.
All of us in this room heard it, and we shall take it into account during tomorrow's vote, too.
What was the starting point?
When we held the hearing on 26 June of last year, we soon found that there were very great differences in the implementation of the Regulation.
The Council was divided, Parliament was divided, and we really wondered how all this was to be overcome.
I regard the fact that we have before us today a compromise involving the Council, the Commission and sections of Parliament - after first reading, mark you - as rather sensational, considering the starting situation.
It is a result for all those involved, and so I should like to thank the Commission, the Council and those fellow Members who have helped to work on it: Mrs McAvan, Mr Schlyter, and Mr Maaten of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, to name but a few.
Their cooperation was excellent, and indeed this is the only way of achieving a positive result.
Not only did this come together at the drawing board, it was also the result of a clear vote in committee: 58 votes in favour to only 2 against, with 2 abstentions - that was a result we could build on.
As the Commissioner said, many of Parliament's proposals have been implemented.
We already agreed back then that the quality of the Regulation had to be improved, it had to include more consumer information, and it had to be brought into line with the internal market.
This Regulation was necessary.
There had been two regulations and many Acts of Accession, but they could not achieve all this.
How wonderful - there is no system of categories.
We are not classifying spirit drinks according to quality - that would have been a very bad thing - but in the field of quality we do have a ban on flavouring spirits.
This means that it is forbidden to add flavourings to spirits.
I once said, exaggerating somewhat, that I wanted to see spirit drinks falling under the Regulation on spirit drinks, not containing so many chemicals that they ended up under the Regulation on chemicals.
What is important, however, is the protection of producers who use proper methods, and we cannot allow - to exaggerate - the production of spirit drinks to become the preparation of toxic cocktails.
The issue of sweetening is another that was pushed through by Parliament.
I should like to say to the Commission now that, when we discuss sweetening under the extended comitology procedure, we shall take great care that the addition of sugar is kept within reasonable bounds.
Figures have been mentioned: 20 grams per litre, which corresponds to five teaspoons.
I have to say that tea with five teaspoons of sugar added starts to lose its appeal!
We shall keep an eye on this.
The methanol content of 50 grams per hectolitre in the old Regulation has been reduced to 10 grams per hectolitre.
This had been a health problem.
The hydrocyanic acid content of stone-fruit marc spirit has been reduced by 3 grams to 7 grams per hectolitre of pure alcohol.
These are achievements that cannot be praised enough.
The new proposal also reflects traditional methods.
We have been at pains to ensure, in particular, that traditionally produced products can continue to be produced.
That is a very important point.
Moving on, now, to vodka: a very contentious issue.
I could have lived with the Commission proposal that the raw-material basis of vodka always be included on the label; but the traditional producing countries, for example Poland and Finland, objected.
I took account of these objections, which related to traditions, and said: in that case, we shall exempt potatoes and cereals from the labelling requirement, and only the other agricultural raw materials used to produce vodka must be stated.
That was the right solution as, when I look at the amendments that have been tabled and hear what the Commissioner has to say, I can already tell that all the amendments stating otherwise will fail to gain any support from within the Council, the Commission or the WTO.
We are right to exempt these two products from the labelling requirement, in order to take account of traditions in Poland and Finland.
We must not be tempted to introduce legislative amendments banning the manufacture of products when there is no basis for this in either health considerations or internal-market rules or consumer-protection rules.
That would be taking things too far.
We have always done things that way in previous legislation, too.
Therefore, I would appeal to you to support the compromise tomorrow.
There is no alternative compromise.
Failure to adopt the present proposal will render all the other parts of the compromise invalid.
The Commission will then try again to enforce its ideas, which were strongly contested, the Council will start quarrelling again, and we shall have no regulation for the coming years.
I should like to point that out so that no one tries to say later on that they would have voted differently if I had only told them that.
That is the reason for my request.
I look forward to the discussion.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection. - Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mr Schnellhardt on his patience above all else.
The spirit industry is extremely important to us, creating jobs, status, export and tax revenue.
Therefore it has been important to update the 1989-1990 regulations, to bring greater clarity and greater legal certainty to improve the definition of the main spirit drinks and to resolve any problems with spirits with a quasi-geographical indication status.
What we now have is a proper registration system for geographical indication, which is important, and I am glad we have got rid of the three categories of spirits.
We have now ended up with something that is compatible with the WTO and TRIPS, which ensures smooth running in the internal market, prevents fraud and counterfeiting, protects the consumer and does not underplay and undermine solid, long-established industries, such as the second biggest vodka producer in Europe - the United Kingdom - where in Scotland vodka is such an important industry.
That is why we must support these proposals.
I think the Commission proposal was better than the compromise, but it is important to move forward with the compromise on vodka, bearing in mind geographical indications will protect forever Polish vodka, Finnish vodka, Swedish vodka, Lithuanian vodka, and so on.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (NL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if we have to take decisions about food legislation and end up encroaching on territory which people and Member States believe to form part of their own individuality and tradition, then it has never been easy to reach sound agreements.
The fact that Mr Schnellhardt has managed to do exactly that for this regulation on spirit drinks deserves the respect of us all.
We need a fresh regulation, because the present one is no longer up to date, technologically speaking and because it requires clarification in the area of the WTO rules and also further to the recent enlargement.
Mr Schnellhardt has achieved a widely supported agreement in this House and with the Council, which will bring us better consumer protection, allow our European products to occupy a clearly defined position on the global market within the WTO framework and also promote the smooth running of the internal market.
Moreover - and this is not insignificant - it recognises, by means of labelling and the system of geographical designations among other things, the specificity of each product, although there are still doubts among some, not least in our group, about the vodka provisions.
Here too, though, the rapporteur has done a sterling job by requiring that, if vodka is made from raw materials other than grain or potatoes, this raw material should be indicated on the label next to the product name.
In doing so, we are using techniques that have been used before with great success.
Years ago, in relation to beer and chocolate, we held a similar discussion on traditions, values, interests of suppliers of raw materials and of large and small producers; when those discussions were over, we reached a compromise much like Mr Schnellhardt's present compromise with the Council.
This is why I would urge all those doubting Thomases among you to revisit the compromise and to give it your backing if possible.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, the Socialist Group will be supporting the trialogue compromise and all its elements, as outlined by the rapporteur, Mr Schnellhardt.
I should like to thank him for all his hard work and, like Mr Titley, his patience, because this has become a very complex dossier and one on which emotions have started to run high.
We are supporting this compromise because we want the European drinks industry to have high-quality products for consumers and we want to protect our industry on the world markets.
What we do not want to do with this legislation is to give one country's type of production an advantage over another country's type of production.
That is not the aim of the legislation.
There is room for all European producers, as long as they meet high quality standards.
That brings me to the vodka compromise.
I think it is a good compromise.
Why?
Because, as Mr Schnellhardt has said, for the first time it recognises that there is a special place for traditional manufacturers using cereals and potatoes.
But, at the same time, it allows other long-standing producers of vodka to continue to market their products on the European market - and they will be labelled.
We cannot have a situation as proposed by some of the amendments which seek to take certain European producers off the market.
That would never get a majority in this House and would never get a majority in the Council.
Everybody has to work in a spirit of compromise and what we have got on the table has something for everybody.
We have also got to work with facts.
It is simply not true that the compromise on vodka would allow you to make vodka, for example, from animal waste, as has been circulated again in this House today.
That is not true.
It is made from very high-quality agricultural products.
I want to say something to the British Conservatives about vodka.
I understand from their press release last week they are not supporting the compromise now and they have accused Labour of selling the British vodka industry down the river.
I have to say that this is vital for European jobs, it is vital for the drinks industry, which employs 60 000 people, and has the support of British industry as well as European vodka producers and other drinks manufacturers.
I can see surprise from some Members.
I hope we will have this clarified because I have the press release here.
Finally, it is not just about vodka, it is about high-quality drinks.
Many colleagues from different countries have come to Mr Schnellhardt, myself and other colleagues and asked for certain changes because of their traditional production.
All those things have been met.
The Council and the Commission have been very helpful and I very much hope that tomorrow, after, as Mr Titley has said, 18 years have passed since we started trying to get this legislation on the statute book, we just go ahead and do it and protect European jobs.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) Mr President, the discussion on the Schnellhardt report is being hijacked by the discussion on vodka, which is unfortunate, because it is a report that says so much more in many areas that are so crucial to Europe and to this industry in Europe.
This is why I should like to single out a number of those other points.
The directive's first concern is, of course, the quality of the European drinks industry.
It also says something about Europe, because wherever you go in the world, we see European drinks, distilled in Europe, available in all shapes and sizes, and with a recognition of the quality which we produce in Europe.
This is important in a situation in which not everything that is said about Europe is always positive, because this is something in which Europe excels.
What the rapporteur has done is to reinforce this very element, more so, it has to be said, in his original report than in the compromise which was eventually struck with the Council.
It is, to my mind, a fantastic achievement and something we should hold onto.
Distillation is a craft, a truly traditional craft.
Anyone who visits distilleries - and I recently visited some gin distilleries in my own country - can see for themselves that it is a craft.
It is an art to make these products well and in a way that the quality is retained at all times.
This is without a doubt the most important element in this report.
Rather than adding sugar or flavourings at random, we have clear definitions for these drinks, even very strict definitions, not least at the industry's request.
This is how consumers receive sound information about the product.
They know what they buy, and can rely on the fact that what they are getting is quality.
This directive also allows the European drinks industry, thanks to this quality, to remain a strong contender in the competition.
It also says something about Europe, namely about the regional origin of many of these drinks.
In this respect, this directive is almost like a microcosm of the European Union, as it demonstrates the diversity of the European Union and how we together, in this very diversity, can all still be European.
This too is very important to my mind.
I will now briefly turn to the subject of vodka, on which the rapporteur has tried to reach a compromise which received my wholehearted support during the discussion.
He has, as I see it, made a valiant attempt at trying to strike a sound compromise between the old vodka industries in the European Union, which existed at the time the definition was drafted - even before Sweden, Finland, Poland and all the other countries joined the Union - and these more recent Member States, and has done a reasonable job of it.
Despite this, most of my group are in favour of a much stricter definition of vodka, and I have to say that their arguments are valid.
This is why it is good that this issue is on the table, so that it can be thrashed out.
Firstly, as regards consumer information, my group takes the view that every consumer must be able to rely on the fact that vodka is made from potatoes or cereals - these are of the essence - and sugar beet perhaps.
As the majority in my group see it, consumers should be able to take this as read.
It goes further than this though. This is not just about the product.
There is also a discussion about the individuality and identity of the countries where it is produced.
After all, what would our reaction have been if this discussion with these countries had been held before?
Would we have said: for the sake of consumer information, it is also possible to introduce onto the market cognac made from potatoes or whiskey made from grapes?
No, of course we would never have done this, and my group wants us to be consistent in the case of vodka too.
They have a point, of course.
I would like to see us reach agreement at first reading.
I welcome the fact that this argument is on the table, and in this respect, I support my group's amendment.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, objections have been raised concerning the proposal for a regulation on spirit drinks for a number of reasons.
First of all, broadening the definition of vodka to include spirit drinks based on raw ingredients other than those traditionally used infringes the law and is damaging to the economic interests of current vodka producers and consumers.
Secondly, as a result of the proposed changes, the new Member States will yet again lose out.
Poland, one of the main vodka producers in the European Union and the world, will be particularly affected.
Thirdly, this move will be yet another blow for farmers who grow cereal crops, potatoes and beet.
They will not have the slightest chance of compensating for their losses with other crops.
Fourthly, the name 'vodka' is a trade name, linked with a specific product that is manufactured according to a specific recipe and using specific ingredients, namely grain, potatoes and beet molasses.
Any product made from other raw ingredients will be a different product. Therefore, it cannot be labelled as 'vodka'.
It has to have its own, distinct name.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (SV) Mr President, I wish, above all, to thank Mr Schnellhardt for the piece of work that we now have and that demanded so much patience.
What patience we have all shown towards the lobbyists of the spirits industry!
It will be a great relief to be rid of them.
This package is really all about we politicians regulating sales advantages through origin marking and similar measures.
That being said, I nonetheless think that even when it comes to spirits - which are not in themselves useful products that politicians should encourage - origin marking and similar measures may have a large role to play in defending local patterns of production against unfair competition.
What I think we have so far forgotten to talk about in the debate is the work we have done to reduce the sugar content of spirits and the use of synthetic flavourings and colorants.
That is also an important aim of the compromise: to produce a smaller quantity of synthetic spirits.
We now move on to vodka.
Incidentally, I have tabled an amendment, number 149, designed to stop all traditionally unsweetened types of spirit from being sweetened.
Let us return to vodka, however.
The compromise arrived at states that grain and potatoes are the basis for vodka and that the product should be labelled accordingly if it is made of anything else.
If producers begin to cheat where labelling is concerned and try to evade the issue and sell non-traditional vodka as ordinary vodka, we shall have to come back to this issue, as it is not intended that they should do that.
If vodka is made of anything other than grain or potatoes, this must be stated on the bottle.
Sugar beet has been added in the amendments designed to afford still more protection to vodka.
It is not traditional in my country to make vodka from sugar beet.
Why should I support amendments that add sugar beet and put it on a par with grain and potatoes?
I am therefore voting against those amendments.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to thank Mr Schnellhardt for his sterling efforts in drawing up this report.
I feel that he was able, despite initial difficulties, to strike a balance, and reach a compromise in terms both of technology and of the various national interests.
I should like to highlight two points, the first of which is the definition of vodka.
In our proceedings in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety I have already said that we should not succumb to the pressure that has been brought to bear by the so-called traditional producers.
It is my firm belief that the argument so often put forward that we should have the same precise definition of what raw materials vodka can be made from as we do for whiskey and rum, is not entirely valid.
After all, the technology of vodka-making is completely different.
I therefore feel that the current definition of vodka is workable and sufficient.
With regard to the current situation and to the opinions of the traditional producers, I feel that the compromise definition in point 145 of the report could be a solution, and as shadow rapporteur I recommend that at least some MEPs from my group should support it.
I cannot finish without mentioning the definition of slivovice, a specific issue for the Czech Republic.
Mr Schnellhardt knows that there was a technical oversight, and that the Committee on the Environment...
(The President cut off the speaker)
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mr Schnellhardt on the compromise that is before us.
It has been some time coming, but with this result, there is a good chance of an agreement at first reading.
I am delighted that the point that I have mentioned during the debate in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has been accepted.
It concerns the ambiguous clause of creating the impression that there is mention of a certain age on the label.
I am pleased that this clause has now been scrapped, because in this way, the Dutch young gin and old gin remain safeguarded.
Indeed, this indication of gin refers to the preparation method of the gin and not the age.
I should like to finish off with a brief comment about vodka.
Whilst I, as a Dutchman, am not used to drinking much vodka, I do sympathise with my Eastern European colleagues.
This is why I have decided to back the vodka definition in which only potatoes, cereals and sugar beet can be used as raw materials.
Further to the rapporteur's appeal, I will give this matter some more thought.
on behalf of the ITS Group. - (DE) Mr President, I welcome the fact that our discussion here and now on labelling, designations of origin and the production of spirit drinks is based on a workable compromise that is clearly suitable for preserving tradition and the typical national means of producing spirit drinks across Europe.
However, I should like to make a few observations on a related problem.
The age at which people are starting not only to smoke but also to drink alcohol has fallen.
In the case of the former, the EU has already brought itself to undertake common action and also campaigns to strengthen young people's self-confidence.
It is time we did the same in the case of the latter, in my opinion.
What a drink is called is probably of secondary importance as far as young consumers are concerned, and will probably not make any difference to the problem.
For example, the introduction of a special tax on alcopops only led people to switch to beer and to wine-based pre-mixed drinks, which explains why the number of young people drinking themselves into a coma has not gone down.
Young people are probably not drinking any more than before; the reasons for alcohol consumption have not changed.
What are significant, however, are the break-up of social structures such as the traditional family, the increasing isolation of young people in front of the television or computer screen, and often the lack of alternatives.
High-quality production of spirit drinks across Europe is an important matter. On the other hand, however, there is no doubt that the protection of young people from related problems is just as important.
(SK) First of all, let me express my thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Schnellhardt, for his work on this topic.
I would also like to praise the work of several Polish Members in connection with the drafting of amendments aimed at protecting the vodka tradition, which has long been a speciality of Eastern European countries.
These amendments were also aimed at protecting customary, time-honoured methods of production which date back to the 15th century, and which should be employed in accordance with the traditions of the countries that were the first to produce such beverages.
The biggest 'apple of discord' in this report is the definition of vodka, namely what ingredients the beverage must contain in order to be designated as vodka.
Throughout the centuries, vodka has been defined in Eastern European countries as a spirit made from grain, potatoes or sugar-beet molasses.
To reiterate the point, since vodka is a speciality of the countries of Eastern, rather than Western, Europe, I would ask my colleagues from other countries to respect the definition and not to expand it to include citrus-flavoured spirits, etc. These and different spirits, which are the specialities of other countries, need another designation, primarily to prevent attempts at misleading customers.
(SK) Member States rightfully take pride in the fact that long-established methods of production and processing raw materials are respected, recognised and protected when applied to traditional designations, such as cognac, champagne, Scottish whiskey, rum, port wine, etc. These are conventional terms, and it is natural that manufacturers have clear definitions of the technological processes used in production and, similarly, of the primary raw materials.
It is only natural that manufacturers from traditional countries of origin jealously and carefully guard these definitions.
For that reason, Slovak producers, for example, had to replace the word 'rum' with a different designation, because the Slovak beverage was not made from sugar cane using the original method.
In other words, manufacturers from the new Member States paid their harmonisation dues long ago.
Now we are facing a situation where it is mostly the EU 15 Member States that must show that they can behave in a fair and proper manner and consistently comply with the same requirements that in the past were imposed on us.
The matter at hand is vodka, as has been discussed here.
All of a sudden we are witnessing a requirement to designate as vodka second- and third-rate spirits made of bananas and other fruits.
Consumers will then be misled into believing that they are drinking vodka and will stop buying the genuine product.
This will harm the bona fide producers that follow the tradition and make vodka exclusively from the appropriate raw materials.
Ladies and gentlemen, in Finland, Poland, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and all other Scandinavian countries, the designation vodka may traditionally be granted only and exclusively to a product made from either grain or potatoes.
Therefore, I ask you to take this into account and to subscribe to these arguments during the vote.
(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, when we discuss the report on the labelling of alcohol, we should take into account not only the technical aspects and the need to ensure the transparency of the European market, but also the fact that the production and drinking of alcohol is often linked to local traditions and customs.
European legislation should therefore not in any way restrict these traditions and customs and certainly not prohibit them.
In my country, the Czech Republic, slivovice is one of the traditional drinks.
Maintaining traditional methods of producing slivovice is guaranteed under the country's treaties of accession to the EU and should therefore not be undermined, certainly not by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.
I should therefore like to call on you, ladies and gentlemen, to support Amendment 144 tomorrow in the vote, and to rectify the mistake that has crept into the report.
Please lend your support to this tradition, which is not just a Czech and Moravian drink, but also a wonderful European one.
(SV) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are two reasons why it is important to preserve the traditional definition of vodka: the historically significant regional aspect and the consumer aspect.
In the Nordic countries and in many of the EU's new Member States, we have a long, Slavic-inspired history and tradition of vodka production, in which alcohol is manufactured from potatoes and grain.
Champagne and cognac are strictly defined.
It must be possible for the same rule to apply to vodka - the spirit produced from grain or potatoes.
If no one knows what vodka is, we cannot make informed choices.
Consumers are entitled to expect vodka to be based on certain ingredients, just as we all expect wine to be produced from grapes, and gin from juniper berries.
If we agree that any old alcohol produced from, for example, bananas or grapes may be called vodka, the consumer knows that ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
(PL) Mr President, today, after many months of work and lively debate involving representatives of alcohol and raw ingredients producers, as well as distributors and consumers, we are discussing Mr Schnellhardt's report.
Unfortunately, the solutions put forward in this report have been universally criticised, and satisfy no one.
Products have been artificially divided into three categories, where the vodka category contains no vodkas.
Instead, this group includes brandy, whisky, rum, aquavit, and could easily also include our bootleg or moonshine vodka.
Splitting alcohols up according to specific names gives the impression that we are involved in subliminal advertising rather than trying to find a solution to this problem.
There is no logic in how this matter is being dealt with.
As a result, and in spite of my sincere wishes and best intentions, I have to agree with the dissenting voices in this House and vote against this report.
Mr President, as a Scots MEP I have an obvious interest in any regulation that relates to whisky.
However, we also have other national drinks, including a very significant economic interest in vodka and gin distillation and bottling.
The debates in which I have taken part in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection have been interesting, at times heated, and I have argued strongly for a flexible definition of 'vodka'.
Some say that spirits should be treated the same, but vodka and whisky are not the same, and this proposal simply has to recognise that fact.
Vodka has traditionally been made from different ingredients in different areas; Scotch whisky is a product of centuries of traditional practice, by contrast.
The first reference to Scotch whisky in Scotland was in Exchequer records in 1494/95.
The first taxes were imposed in 1644.
Some spirits have traditionally been rounded off using sugar.
Scotch whisky has not, and this regulation must not allow that to happen.
Protecting the term 'Scotch whisky', as well as the methods of production under geographic definition, is extremely important for Scotland for obvious reasons.
Some details still have to be underlined in the technical files, and I look forward to that.
However, this first-reading compromise - the product of lengthy and very heated exchanges - is something that, in the spirit of that compromise, I am now prepared to accept, and I hope that the House will accept it tomorrow.
(SV) We are now to adopt a definition of vodka.
My question is: why?
As a member of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, I wish to devote all my time and energy not to defining varieties of spirit but to working for a better environment and better public health.
Public health is genuinely threatened.
Europe is far and away the continent on which more alcohol is consumed than anywhere else in the world.
In my own country, Sweden, consumption has increased by more than 30% since we became Members of the EU.
All that a definition sanctioned by the EU will do is paint a picture of vodka as something desirable.
It is not desirable.
Vodka is a form of alcohol, which is dangerous in unduly high quantities.
If there is to be a definition of vodka, cannot the industry itself come up with it?
With all due respect to the rapporteur, Mr Schnellhardt, the business of coming up with a definition of vodka should be referred back to the place where most of it is produced and where the manufacturers can sit and produce as many definitions as they like.
We politicians have other things to do.
Mr President, I would like to put aside my prepared text and respond to some of my colleagues who spoke earlier in the debate.
Mrs McAvan tells us that this measure is designed to protect jobs, yet to the extent that it either bans or qualifies the use of the word 'vodka' for existing brands and existing manufacturers, it seems likely to have exactly the reverse effect.
Mr Maaten asks if we have not been to see a distillery which is a craft industry.
Well, Mr Maaten, yes I have.
I worked in the industry for several years and I can tell you that a malt whisky distillery is indeed a craft industry, but a vodka or grain whisky distillery is an industrial process and the process for producing vodka produces pure alcohol whether you make it from sugar or from potatoes or from anything else.
All this talk about consumer protection is nonsense.
The product is identical and the reason we should not compare vodka with whisky - or brandy, as has been rightly pointed out by my colleague on the other side of the Chamber - is because in those products, the ingredients significantly affect the flavour.
Whisky is only whisky if it is made in the proper way, but vodka is based on pure alcohol.
If I may make a general point, we should not be seeking to change the established meanings of words by legislation.
However, in this case the compromise proposed by the rapporteur seems to be the best outcome on offer so I suppose that we must reluctantly support it.
As happens so often in the European Union, we have to make the best of a bad job.
Mr President, as Mr Helmer has pointed out, and just to clarify for the House, the UK Conservatives are indeed supporting Mr Schnellhardt's amendment on vodka.
The issue which our Scandinavian and Polish colleagues appear to be banking on now is the old equality-with-whisky argument.
I have heard people in the House this evening saying that that we could possibly have a situation where whisky is going to be made out of grapes.
Well I have to say that these arguments are completely bogus.
We are trying to define these products for the benefit of consumers to ensure that what is in the bottle conforms to their expectations of what a whisky or a vodka should be.
As distillers will tell you, if you distil at a lower alcoholic strength, more taste comes over the still.
Spirits like whisky are distilled at a low strength and derive their taste from the raw materials.
Other spirits like vodka are distilled at a high strength and may then even be filtered through charcoal to remove the taste of the raw materials.
Our Nordic colleagues and their allies are trying to have it both ways.
They are asking us to define a product not by reference to its characteristics or by reference to what the consumers expect, but by reference to the raw materials that their producers currently use.
It is interesting that they have not sought to include sulphite waste, which was the predominant raw material in Sweden in the 1920s, nor apples, nor coal and yellow turnips, which have all been used in Poland in the past.
Parliament should not be in the business of defining products so as to exclude producers and distort competition.
We should be protecting the consumer, and it is for that reason that we support the approach being taken by Dr Schnellhardt, which avoids artificial restrictions on production while ensuring that consumers are adequately informed.
(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate Mr Schnellhardt on his outstanding report and to commend all those who helped improve on the Commission's proposal to update the law on spirit drinks, with a view to making the text clearer, simpler and easier to implement for companies and consumers needing more and better information in order to make informed choices.
The two regulations currently applicable must be brought under one regulation, in order to simplify the law and to adopt a clear policy on spirit drinks.
Regulations must be adapted to the new WTO requirements, and criteria for the recognition of the new geographical indications must be defined.
Lastly, I should like to say that the new regulation, with the contributions from Parliament, which I hope will be adopted, will help extend international knowledge of drinks that help reinforce the identity of many European regions.
In particular - if I may say so - the regulation will enhance the quality and value of European rum from overseas territories and Madeira, allowing promoters ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
(PL) Mr President, would the French agree to Champagne made from plums?
Would the British be pleased if they were permitted to make apricot gin and peach whisky?
Of course they would not.
That would be tantamount to heresy.
Therefore, I am not surprised that the Poles, Lithuanians, Latvians, Estonians, Swedes, Finns and Danes do not want to recognise as vodka some waste products from the manufacture of wine, whisky or gin.
Let us call a spade a spade.
Is the European Parliament to be held hostage by powerful lobby groups representing alcohol manufacturers from southern Europe or the United Kingdom?
Do we want public opinion in our countries to decide that our Parliament serves as a 'transmission belt' for economic lobby groups from various countries and sectors?
If we do not want this to happen, let us not agree to this ridiculous, broad definition of vodka.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to start by thanking Mr Schnellhardt for his excellent work.
I think he has really produced a workable compromise that we should all support tomorrow.
We should bear in mind that this discussion is not about old versus new Member States.
Nor is it about good versus bad alcohol, or about capital versus labour.
It is about our producing a new version of the Regulation on spirit drinks to adapt it to the current state of affairs.
This means we want our consumers to be offered good, correctly labelled products.
If the discussion is now reduced to the vodka issue, we must ask ourselves, firstly, if this is justified and, secondly, what is behind this.
It is very presumptuous, however, to assert that, if alcohol is distilled so much that it loses all taste, the starting point of the raw materials is crucial to the product's designation.
Therefore, we would do well to simply adapt to the state of affairs prevailing in Europe - that vodka is already being produced everywhere, even if it may have had its origins in Poland - rather than throwing out the baby with the bath water.
We should bear in mind that we have achieved a great deal.
We have improved consumer protection, and we have also, for example, made it possible for traditional products to be labelled more appropriately.
That is why I am convinced that this is a really good compromise.
My thanks once more to Mr Schnellhardt!
We should all support this tomorrow.
(DE) Mr President, I, too, wish to congratulate the rapporteur.
The compromise ensures that spirit drinks will be less synthetic in future, which means that we shall see higher quality in the various spirit drinks.
The compromise also takes account of national interests: as an Austrian, 'Jagatee' is of course a particular concern of mine.
No one in this House can escape the discussion on the definition of vodka.
I have yet to grasp why many speakers have been acting as though there had been no definition of vodka up to now, and the term 'vodka' were now too broad.
The opposite is the case.
The European Union does already have a definition of vodka, and Parliament's compromise, for which the rapporteur is primarily responsible, is accommodating towards traditional vodka producers - if just a few countries were concerned, which, as we have heard today, is not the case.
The House should bear that in mind when it comes to tomorrow's vote.
(LT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, since 1989, when the definition and labelling of alcoholic beverages was introduced, there have been many changes.
Some traditional spirit-producing countries have become members of the European Union.
First there was Sweden and Finland, and now the countries of the second-to-the-last round of expansion - the Baltic countries and Poland.
It is from the North that the name vodka derives from, and the traditional methods for manufacturing this spirit.
Traditionally, vodka has always been manufactured from grain.
In some places it is also made from potatoes and sugar beets.
Now that traditional vodka-producing countries have become EU members, we would like to see that namely alcoholic spirit beverages made from grain, potatoes and sugar beets be called vodka and be labelled as such.
A consumer needs to know what whisky is, and what it is made from.
A consumer has the right to buy a product made according to the original and traditional recipes and from traditional ingredients.
If this is applicable to whisky, then why can it not be applied to vodka?
I urge my colleagues to vote for a fair compromise: vodka - only from grain, potatoes and sugar beets.
(CS) Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as part of the debate on the labelling of alcohol I should like to inform the House of a problem that is overshadowed by the debate over vodka, but that has particular significance for the citizens of the Czech Republic in economic, political and cultural terms.
I refer to slivovice a traditional Moravian alcoholic drink made from fruit, most commonly from plums.
This drink came under threat when the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Feed Safety most unfortunately meddled in its definition, which is enshrined in the Accession Treaty of the Czech Republic.
I feel that this was done by mistake rather than deliberately, but it is an unfortunate example of politicians' meddling.
Because mistakes must be rectified, I would call on you, ladies and gentlemen, to support the amendment on slivovice, on which I worked with Mr Horst Schnellhardt and which almost all groups have said they will support.
I should like to thank Mr Schnellhardt for his willingness to reach solutions that would return the definition of slivovice to a model that corresponds to its traditions.
In the same way that Scandinavians closely follow the development of vodka, it is a priority for Czech people that slivovice should continue to take the form of a pure fruit spirit so that the characteristic flavour is not distorted by the addition of various ingredients.
Last but not least, there is a political dimension to all of this which should not be overlooked and which arises from the fact that the definition of slivovice became part of the accession negotiations and was enshrined in the Accession Treaty.
The violation of an Accession Treaty would undoubtedly lead to a breakdown of trust between the EU institutions and the Member State concerned, not to mention the fact that a dangerous precedent would be set, which, in some cases, might affect other Member States.
Given that our citizens take a lively interest in the fate of slivovice, our lawmakers should show a similar interest.
Let us therefore take a much-needed step towards protecting slivovice by adopting the amendment in question.
(PL) Mr President, although the report on the labelling of spirit drinks deals with over 30 different kinds of beverages, I would like to focus on the most controversial issue, namely that of the definition of vodka.
The currently binding definition of vodka was drawn up many years before the main vodka producers joined the European Union.
Thanks to them, the European Union is the third largest vodka producer in the world.
Parliament should therefore adopt a definition of vodka that would secure the reputation and leading market position of this spirit drink.
Maintaining the current definition of vodka and allowing it to be produced from waste material will lower its quality and have a negative impact on its reputation.
The trade name 'vodka' should be reserved only for vodka that is produced from traditional ingredients, namely grain, potatoes and beet molasses.
This was the definition adopted by the European Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
Vodka made from ingredients other than the ones traditionally used should be given a specific market name, such as 'non-traditional vodka', 'vodka-style spirit drink' or 'non-standard vodka', with the name of the raw ingredients used in its production clearly stated on the label.
If this is not done, we will be cheating both ourselves and the consumers.
Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to invite you all to today's food and wine tasting event to promote Polish organic foods, including cold meats, juices and vodka made from grain and potatoes.
(FR) Mr President, since a lot has been said about whisky and vodka, I shall say something about rum, which is produced in only two places within the European Union, those being the French overseas dÃ©partements and Madeira.
Since a great deal of it is drunk throughout Europe, it is imported from numerous third countries, primarily from ACP countries which enjoy special treatment under the 2000 Cotonou Agreement.
Rum is one of the overseas dÃ©partements' main export products, and the sugar cane rum industry alone accounts for over 40% of the value of exports from Guadeloupe, Martinique and RÃ©union, and for 40 000 jobs created there.
Where the Community's definition of rum is concerned, then, a great deal is at stake; rum from the French overseas territories needs to be defined in a way that makes it possible for it to be better distinguished from its third-country competitors, specifically by describing it as 'agricultural rum' derived exclusively from sugar cane juice, something that consumers recognise as a sign of quality.
It is no less important, in the eyes of the ACP countries, that this definition be consistent with the EU's overall approach to their rum industry if their growth is to be sustained and if the progress made to date by the Caribbean producers is not to be jeopardised.
It was with this in mind that the professional bodies representing producers in the French overseas dÃ©partements and in the Caribbean countries agreed, in October 2006, at La Barbade, on a common position on the Community definition of rum, taking as the basis for it a generic definition and going on to draw progressive distinctions between traditional rum, agricultural rum and rum refined from sugar.
I would like to thank Mr Schnellhardt for taking on board my request for an adequate definition of agricultural rum and for finally deciding to include in his report the definition of it already to be found in the Council's compromise text.
It has been a considerable amount of work, over a long period of time, on the part of the whole industry that has made it possible to promote the production of agricultural rum, so that the denomination, today, is one of the principal guarantors of this French overseas product's entry onto commercial markets, and it is this that makes it possible to hope that the compromise submitted today for this House's approval will be adopted at first reading.
(SV) We Swedish Social Democrats support the compromise on the definition of vodka, and for the same reasons that the Swedish centre-right government does so in the Council of Ministers.
We do so because it is the best solution available to Swedish consumers and producers in that it accords an exceptional status to vodka produced in the manner in which we Swedes expect it to be produced, namely from potatoes or grain.
If the compromise disintegrates, there will be no special status accorded to vodka made from potatoes or grain, and consumers will still be unclear as to what they are getting when they buy vodka.
People may be wondering why the EU has to decide on how vodka should be marketed.
We do, of course, have a common internal market in the EU, and we therefore also have common rules governing what may be sold in this market and in which ways.
Democracy should set limits on the market, including on the ways in which different products may be marketed.
However, I deeply regret the fact that not even a majority of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety could support my amendments with regard to putting warning labels on alcohol.
I intend to return to that issue.
Mr President, I have two points and one surprise.
The vodka belt has three arguments.
The first is culture and tradition: we have made vodka out of potatoes and grain for over 500 years.
The second is equal treatment: when we joined the Union in 1995, we were told that vodka would have a tight definition, just like rum, whisky or grappa, or in line with some of the more traditional geographic definitions, for instance, of champagne and cognac.
We therefore want equal treatment for vodka.
We do not want it to be some kind of alcoholic waste basket.
The third is consumption and production: we know what we are talking about - seven countries produce 70% of the vodka and consume 70% of the vodka.
To Mr Stevenson, who told me that we are just driving the industry in our own country, I would point out that Mr Helmer is defending the same position as the Labour Party, so, Mr Stevenson, do not tell me that you are not driving some kind of grape-vodka industry here!
Tomorrow, as a defender of vodka, I will vote for Mr Schnellhardt's overall compromise, but against his compromise on vodka, and for my own amendment on a tighter definition, or indeed for the Liberal ones.
I hope that all traditionalists will do the same.
Now we come to my surprise.
I must admit that I am not a big fan of Poland's KaczyÅski brothers.
However, they have done a wonderful job in this vodka debate. They have defended vodka heroically and I hope that this little token of appreciation I am going to send them - a bottle of vodka - will make them soften their position on the Constitution!
Thank you very much. You have added another element to this multi-faceted, at times technical, and impassioned debate.
I do not feel that I am the most appropriate recipient of this gift, but I thank you nevertheless.
(HU) The production and consumption of alcohol are probably as old as humanity itself.
Hieroglyphics 4-5 000 years old in Egypt and clay tablets in Mesopotamia prove how active the ancients were in this area too.
Following on from the Greek god Dionysus and the Roman god Bacchus, the tradition of spirit production was given a new boost during the Middle Ages by Christianity.
The technologies used have improved, while the concepts and labelling have become more precise.
In my country, Hungary, pÃ¡linka, a 100% fruit brandy, was already established as part of our gastronomy at the time of the Renaissance.
In fact, those technologies and products, the unchanged combination of which we can still enjoy today, were already established across Europe roughly 2-300 years ago.
However, over the last 50 years, business, advertising and, later on, consumer society itself have completely muddied the clear picture we had up until then.
The chemical and distilling industries nowadays are continually creating new tastes and aromas, offering an amazing selection of drinks.
At present, you can basically make everything from anything.
This has also been accompanied, of course, by traditions being watered down.
There are already fewer and fewer people who know what it is worth drinking, why and when.
Ladies and gentlemen! I am conservative when it comes to my political views and gastronomic habits too.
I like things to be exactly what they are, and not what adverts want you to believe they are.
This is why I am in favour of a strict definition for every drink, including vodka as well.
PÃ¡linka is made from fruit and vodka from grain, potatoes or sugar beet.
It is all perfectly clear like this.
If we blur the defining lines, we are not just affecting quality, development and our traditions, but we are clouding further the already murky picture.
In that case, we can easily take the approach George Orwell's hero did in '1984', when he cannot say what he is actually drinking.
Like everyone else in the book, he too calls that horrible-tasting, foul-smelling dishwater gin.
(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission proposal aimed to bring about simplification, to combine the two previous regulations into one: and it has done so.
The second aspect - adapting the regulations to new technical requirements and to the requirements of the WTO and of TRIPS - will also be a success.
The third objective - the continued validity of existing geographical indications, which can continue to be supplemented in future by additional designations - will also be achieved.
With some give and take on the part of the individual Member States, that, too, will provide clarity in future.
I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Schnellhardt, for the effort he has put into the many difficult negotiations.
In the dispute over 'JÃ€gertee' or 'Jagertee', Germany has compromised and accepted the term 'HÃŒttentee' as the German designation.
All parties must be prepared to take a step closer to one other.
A great deal of tradition is involved, but mutual tolerance is required.
By way of explanation, the term 'Champagne' refers to the designation of origin - that is, the regional origin - and has less to do with the ingredients.
In Germany, we order a 'Klarer'. By this we mean a spirit made from agricultural produce: fruit, grain or potatoes.
We have taken steps towards ensuring the clear nature of this product, and towards maintaining the economic base of the traditional, often small, distilleries.
I believe that this, too, will succeed.
The addition of sweeteners must be regulated, and must be clearly visible on the label.
For centuries, our distilleries have been producing top-quality spirits without adding flavourings or sugar.
Labelling constitutes consumer information and ensures a level competitive playing field.
This also goes for the raw material.
We made very heavy weather of the definition of 'vodka'.
The solution - labelling everything that is not produced from potatoes or grain - is a workable compromise and provides clear information, and I ask you to support this compromise.
(PL) Madam President, first of all, perhaps I can provide you with some information which has not been presented to the House.
Last week, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats rejected the compromise proposed by the rapporteur.
Why was the proposal rejected?
The reason was that the group did not agree, by a small majority but a majority nevertheless, with the proposed definition of vodka contained in this proposal.
By the same token, there was majority support for acknowledging that vodka is traditionally produced from grain, potatoes or beet molasses.
This was the amendment that I tabled together with my colleague Mr Stubb, and I appeal to you to support it.
Why this talk of tradition?
I would like remind you that countries, or representatives of countries, which have nothing to do with the tradition of vodka production, cannot behave like the conquistadors who came to South America and stole Mayan gold.
This is our tradition, the tradition of the vodka-producing countries, and it should be acknowledged in the regulation.
We should be aware that the Council has also put unprecedented pressure on the European Parliament.
A high-ranking official sent a letter to the representatives of 24 Member States and not only referred to the position of the influential lobby group the European Vodka Alliance, but also failed to send this letter to the representatives of two of the countries most involved in this dispute, namely Poland and Lithuania.
The opinions of the European Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the Economic and Social Committee were not taken into account.
COPA - COGECA, the European Union farmers' organisations, and the European Union farmers themselves, all support the traditional definition of vodka.
Why is this the case?
The reason is that European potatoes and grain, as well as five hundred years of tradition, should define the value of this product.
It should not be changed simply due to pressure from lobby groups.
We demand equal treatment.
Traditionally produced vodka cannot be compared to other similar spirits.
That would be contrary to the basic operating principles of the European Union.
Madam President, first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report.
I consider it to be an excellent piece of work. This report and this debate have, to say the least, provoked a considerable disagreement between many Members, between groups and within groups.
I believe that we should support the compromise that has been reached.
There are other proposals, but they cover what one specific viewpoint holds to the detriment of the other.
The bottom line should be the quality and the standard of the product.
Additives are and must be controlled, but you cannot ban products that have been used for a long time.
We have to be aware of the needs of the spirit industry, as well as of consumer protection.
As some have said, this has turned out to be a complex report, with some very strong and different points of view, but we must have an acceptable agreement.
Compromise agreements sometimes dilute the original intention of the directive, but on this occasion I believe that this is the best we can achieve at the present time.
This is a very important and serious subject and we must get it right.
The debate on what vodka is has removed some of the importance of this directive and that is unfortunate, but that sometimes occurs in politics.
I listened to the different contributions and to my two colleagues from Scotland who protested that they have the longest-standing whisky.
Where I come from in Northern Ireland we have a little product called Bushmills and we would probably have a good debate as to who actually owned the oldest whiskey on the island of Ireland!
I shall conclude on that note.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. - (DA) Madam President, Commissioner, I am draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which has been the advisory committee for this proposal.
We were almost unanimous in adopting a clear definition to the effect that vodka should be produced from potatoes and grain.
It was also the intention that there should be extended cooperation on this matter between the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
Unfortunately, I have to say that this is not something we have seen much of in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
Vodka is a quality product with a very long history, and this is something we should safeguard.
We should safeguard vodka production in exactly the same way as we safeguard the production of whisky, cognac and all other spirits in Europe.
What I fail to detect in this Parliament is any respect for those people and countries possessing a culture that includes vodka production.
It must also be on the basis of short-term interest that vodka is manufactured as an undefined product and as a dumping ground for surplus ingredients.
The notion, current in recent years, that consumers are indifferent to the ingredients from which vodka is produced is misconceived.
Consumers want information, more information and yet more information.
I should like to close, Madam President, by thanking once more the rapporteur, who has had a difficult job to do but who has managed to put before us a compromise which - if I rightly understand all that has been said in the course of this debate - is capable of being widely accepted.
Let me come back to one of the issues raised, although I agree that this has somewhat overshadowed the very important elements in this piece of legislation.
As expected, the compromise text on vodka was mentioned several times.
At the beginning, I said that the Commission had reservations.
Those concern the legal basis and not the content of the compromise text.
From a technical point of view, the Commission fully endorses the compromise because, in our opinion, it strikes the right balance between the traditional vodka producers and those that produce vodka from other raw materials.
It is a fact that many producers have produced vodka legally for many years from raw materials other than potatoes and cereals, and the Commission cannot ignore the legitimate rights and expectations of those producers, as you will understand.
On the other hand, we have also listened carefully to the arguments highlighting tradition and quality.
The Commission is not deaf to those arguments.
I think that the compromise found strikes the right balance and, apart from some legal aspects, therefore has the Commission's full support.
Having said that, the Commission will continue to contribute constructively to the final adoption of this proposal, as soon as the underlying conditions are met.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Tuesday 19 June 2007.
Written statement (Rule 142)
in writing. - (FI) The debate on the Regulation on spirits has culminated in an issue which the Commission pooh-poohed in its proposal: the equal treatment of vodka alongside other strong drinks.
It would be more accurate to say, however, this is about the equal treatment of European cultures.
Apart from the fact that the debate on now reminds us of the existence of a European multiculture, it also at the same time shows that there is still much work to be done in the name of unity which respects differences.
The definition of vodka we are wrangling with is in fact a technical amendment to something we already knew about and found to be good: for centuries vodka has been manufactured almost entirely from grain and potatoes.
In the EU 90% of all vodka has also been produced from these raw materials.
When it comes to defining the ingredients, it is therefore not just a question of the interests of manufacturers and artificial market barriers, but of tradition.
The vodka-producing countries, in which 70% of vodka is produced and consumed, do actually know what they are talking about.
The compromise by the rapporteur, Mr Schnellhardt, which in practice would permit the manufacture of vodka from any agricultural product, as long as there is a small mention of it on the label at the back, is inadequate.
If we have to end up with a compromise, it should give greater support to the traditional manufacturing method.
The EU's common identity and the legislation that supports that notion must be built on mutual respect, where historical facts are recognised.
Our current legislation on spirits is from a time when the vodka-producing countries were not members of the EU, and so it needs to be updated.
During the accession negotiations which Finland, Sweden, and countries which joined the Union later on, such as Poland, were involved in, the definition of vodka was passed over and promises were made to put that right in the near future.
Now is that time.
Competition Policy 2005 (debate)
The next item is the report by Mrs E. Ferreira, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on Competition Policy 2005.
I have been informed that the rapporteur has had problems with transport and will be arriving late.
I propose, therefore, that we start with the Commission and then continue with the other speakers.
As soon as the rapporteur arrives, she will be given the floor.
Madam President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Ferreira, and the committee for this excellent report.
Once again, this annual report proves the added value Parliament brings to competition policy development, and I am grateful for that.
As you rightly point out in the report, an effective competition policy plays a key role in achieving the Lisbon Strategy goals.
To remain effective, competition policy needs to keep up with the evolving world around it.
I am very pleased that Parliament supports the Commission's efforts to modernise competition policy, and in particular the work we did in 2005 to pursue a more refined economic approach.
I agree with the report on very many issues, so I shall just mention three points where your comments really struck me.
First, as you note, state aid control is essential to maintain a level playing field in the internal market.
Through our ongoing reform, we are redesigning our rules to make them more simple, more transparent, more user-friendly, more coherent and more predictable.
Our rules focus on the areas where limited amounts of aid can have most added value - competitiveness, the environment, training, regional cohesion, research, development and innovation.
We have made good progress with the reform, but Member States must also do their share, as you say, particularly when it comes to recovering illegal state aid quickly and effectively.
The second point that struck me was that 2005 was the year we launched two major sector inquiries.
I agree with you about the value of these tools for a forward-looking policy.
In the energy sector, you are right to be concerned that the facts show serious barriers to competition.
The Commission will continue to pursue individual competition cases, working in cooperation with our colleagues in the national competition authorities.
Regulation in this sector needs to be improved, with the requirement of ownership unbundling a priority.
Third, you are right that, in today's globalised world, competition authorities need to cooperate more than ever before.
Europe has a key role to play in encouraging strong competition cultures elsewhere in the world.
At the same time, Europe needs to be able to respond to unfair foreign subsidies.
The common commercial policy - rather than matching aid - is the proper tool to address this.
Subsidy competition would undermine Europe's cohesion, create damaging subsidy races within our internal market, and bring serious risk of WTO litigation.
I am looking forward to the debate.
Madam President, Commissioner, as you know, this meeting between the European Parliament and the Commission is an important event in terms of competition policy, for it is the time when we evaluate one of the most important policies in the Commission's hands, whilst defining only the general outline for the others, on the basis of which you will take this or that decision.
While the report that we are putting forward this year is a balanced one, it does need to be completed by an answer to the question as to what is meant by 'fair and undistorted competition', as the Treaty itself puts it.
In fact, the situation in the business world, in which there is an increasing and underhand trend towards a way of working in which, no doubt for the sake of flexibility, trainees' contracts are renewed month after month and, for the sake of providing the trainees with access to professional training, the difference between them and those subject to labour law is accentuated, is a real issue in terms of competition, and one that you need to consider closely.
We in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs are also concerned about the conclusions that are going to be drawn from the sectoral surveys that you have been carrying out, and specifically in connection with the potential impact on the structure of this or that segment of the market.
I am thinking, for example, of the situation of local banks, or of mutual banks in relation to the retail banking sector, but we would also like you to consider other sectors, which may well be more difficult to tackle.
Three sectors about which we are particularly concerned are investment banks, rating agencies and auditors' firms.
We think that, if competition is to be required to be free and undistorted, one must also be bold enough to take a look at these sectors in the same way as the Commission has sometimes done with actors of equally considerable weight.
If this takes place, you can count on our support, although you must never forget that competition policy can never be an end in itself, but is in the service of a strategy of the European Union which is, today, defined not only by the Lisbon Strategy, but also by the objectives set out on 8 March 2007, those being the fight against the effects of climate change and the will to endow the European Union with the capacity for shaping its own independent energy policy.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) Madam President, first of all, I should like to pay tribute to the absent rapporteur who has, as I see it, compiled an excellent document which meets with broad support in our committee.
I should also like to give Mrs Kroes credit for what she has done, because, as Mrs BerÃšs said a moment ago with very good reason, competition policy is not an end in itself, and I think that the European Commission, precisely under the guidance of Mrs Kroes, has launched a new pragmatic approach, something which we greatly appreciate.
Sometimes, people overlook the fact that competition rules are not there to bully businesses or thwart national governments.
Competition rules are designed to ensure that the same rules and equal opportunities apply to everyone who operates in the internal market.
These competition rules are therefore there to ensure that Europe can adopt a strong position in the world, in the face of global competition.
As such, we should not compete with each other, but instead ensure that we create an internal market that functions well.
I too am a staunch supporter of the sector inquiries, and where energy policy is concerned, you can count on this Parliament's support.
I should nevertheless like to make one observation.
At the moment, everyone in the Member States is busy preparing for the summit that is coming up this weekend, where once again, energy policy will feature as one of the new key areas on the agenda.
One of the few positive points in the whole discussion.
At the same time, I have noticed that, whilst the leaders of the national governments are saying that we should have a common energy policy, they are not prepared to stop protecting their national favourites.
Perhaps they should practise what they preach.
With regard to state aid, as rapporteur for state aid for public services and for innovation, I can say that we have discussed this subject before.
Actually, I cannot wait to see if there is a first assessment of the impact of these exemption regulations and if, more generally, an assessment is being made of whether state aid is suitable or not.
Finally, as for the matching clause, this too has been the subject of previous discussions.
It is, of course, a problem if generous levels of state aid are made available outside of the European Union.
At the same time, I would prefer to reinforce Europe's competitiveness by other means.
It is highly improper, to my mind, to start giving out generous levels of state aid and subsidies, whilst we have not yet sorted out other measures, including patents, making the labour market more flexible, opening up the market for services and many other measures of this kind; mistakes like this cannot be put right with state aid.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Madam President, it has always been my contention that, far from encouraging competition, the EU in its drive for the mythical 'level playing field' wants to stamp it out altogether.
This report does little to change that perception.
Paragraph 13 supports a common consolidated corporate tax base, which is another step towards a compulsory EU-wide corporation tax, which is fundamentally anti-competitive.
This idea is enthusiastically supported by France and Germany, two countries with higher corporate tax rates, which must be salivating at the idea of getting everybody else's rates up to their level.
One of the most stupid pieces of EU jargon that I have ever heard is 'unfair tax competition', which is what this clause is all about.
There is nothing unfair about some Member States having more business-friendly taxation regimes than others.
This encourages competition.
State aid gets a bashing in this report, as you would expect, but the report makes the false assumption that all state aid is bad.
In Britain, because of EU state aid restrictions, we are rapidly losing the Royal Mail postal service, to the detriment of consumers, particularly in remote areas.
Member of the Commission.
Madam President, I am as impressed with the report as everyone who has already spoken.
I greatly appreciate the report itself, but I appreciate even more the annual debates, particularly with the honourable Members present at this sitting.
The report itself makes a vital contribution to the further development of this policy.
I would like to assure you that I am not only listening to you, but am taking many of your remarks - which make a lot of sense - into account.
Indeed, if competition policy is to really deliver in creating growth and jobs in Europe, we need to continue working together.
That means involving all the stakeholders - Parliament as well as the outside world - and taking into account the point touched upon by Sophia in 't Veld.
It is not a matter of making fun of anyone but rather to set a level playing field in which everyone, both the consumer and the business world, may finally share the advantages.
I would like to respond to a few specific issues raised in our debate this evening.
Mrs BerÃšs had some interesting ideas for new sector inquiries and I will indeed consider the subjects she touched upon: rating agencies, auditing firms and large investment banks.
We have not yet made up our minds and are still discussing the matter, so I will put this on the list.
It is more a matter of resources than a lack of sectors in which it might make sense to start a sector inquiry.
At present the Commission has no grounds for a wide-ranging review of competition in these particular sectors, but this does not mean that we cannot take a couple of thoughts out of it.
I would welcome further discussion with Parliament on these issues.
Of course, the Commission is always ready to look carefully at any evidence of anti-competitive behaviour which is brought to our attention in individual situations.
Mrs BerÃšs also spoke about competition on non-traditional grounds, for example salaries.
The report also mentions tax.
I note that many of you are concerned by so-called tax competition among the Member States.
It is correct that the Commission has powers to assess tax measures affecting competition.
However, and I would like to make this quite clear, that is the case only when these measures are considered to be state aid and essentially when they are selective in nature, meaning that they do not constitute general measures.
I now come to the point that Sophia in 't Veld touched upon.
For the last 10 years the Commission has been reviewing potentially harmful tax schemes.
We have challenged a series of national measures targeting, amongst others, offshore intragroup activities.
