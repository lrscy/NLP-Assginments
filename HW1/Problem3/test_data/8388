We do not have that much time.
Yes, it is a good thing that the Council has agreed on a Euro-vignette, but we know that the amount levied will not be enough to fund, for example, the tunnel through the Brenner Pass between Austria and Italy.
On the basis of the tolls that Austria collects, it would take 300 years for Austria to be able to fund its share of the Brenner tunnel.
That is why we need priorities; what we need is the sort of transport projects that will unite Europe.
This has prompted us to start an initiative transcending party and national boundaries.
We want absolute priority to be given to the joining-up of the European rail links between Berlin, Warsaw, Tallinn, Riga and Vilnius, and we want a rail link between Vienna and Venice to Ljubljana, Bratislava, Prague and Budapest.
If we complete these two projects, we will have reached all eight capitals of the new Member States, and Europe will then be able to grow together.
In any case, we would rather see these two projects fully realised by 2010 than have 30, 50 or 48 projects half-finished in 2020.
European integration is dependent on our setting priorities in this area.
Â Â  . Mr President, I am the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Transport and Tourism on the general rules for the granting of financial aid in the field of the trans-European transport networks and energy.
In this capacity I can clearly state that under no circumstances should the EURÂ 20.3Â billion currently being proposed by the draft regulation be reduced.
It is imperative that this level of funding be viewed as an absolute minimum.
The Commission needs to give an assurance that this proposed level of funding will meet the needs created by the higher levels of Community cofinancing, which can be as high as 50%.
We need to be realistic in order to meet the objective of advancing these projects, particularly when the number of priority projects has increased from 14 to 30.
Undoubtedly there is a high level of expectation on the ground for clearer rules on the granting of aid to TEN-T projects.
I strongly believe that cofinancing is essential.
Member States need to stand up and take responsibility for their respective infrastructures.
European funding alone cannot achieve this for them.
Much of the funding will be directed towards major cross-border projects, but I do not believe that this can be effective without all countries concerned signing binding bilateral agreements.
Where proper parallel funding has not been made available by a Member State, the Commissionâs inspection role and its ability to recover funds need to be strengthened.
The Commission, after all, is the custodian of the Community budget.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, Commissioner, if I may, I should like to start by thanking MrÂ Cramer for his fine words of solidarity.
As I understand it, three things are needed before the trans-European transport network can be established, namely money, money and more money.
In my opinion, however, money is not all that is needed.
Once upon a time all roads led to Rome, the centre of the civilised world, because that was how the Romans built them.
Where do the roads of the ever more united Europe now lead?
It is not my intention to answer that question just now.
Instead, I should like to address another question that lies behind it.
Does the transport system of the enlarged EU, which in future will enlarge even further, really form one system, and can the European network be viewed as a whole?
In my opinion, the answer to this must be no.
Sixteen new priority projects have been added to what was until recently 14, in order to take account of the accession of the new EU Member States.
The action we take in future will undoubtedly also follow this pattern, or in other words we will continue adding on extra projects in a piecemeal fashion whenever new countries join, as though we were extending a house or making a patchwork quilt.
I should therefore like to ask the Commission whether it is not finally time to take a birdâs eye view of Europe, and whether it would not be worth drawing up a comprehensive study of the trans-European transport network.
This study should cover not only the Balkan states, but also Moldova, Ukraine, Belarus, Georgia, and probably also Russia.
In my opinion, it is high time that a comprehensive and methodical study of this kind be drawn up in order to gain a birdâs eye view of Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, I too would like to thank Commissioner Barrot for his courage and the Presidency-in-Office of the Council for the good will it has demonstrated, but more than good will, it must show rigour in demanding greater funding, or sufficient funding at least, for the trans-European networks.
Parliament has always supported the trans-European networks and their sufficient funding and, in fact, it views the proposed 20Â 300 million for the financial perspectives as a minimum and condemns the delays and obstacles, because they are delays and obstacles to promoting growth and employment and social, economic and territorial cohesion.
I am pleased that special attention is being paid to cross-border routes and I would like to ask the Commission whether it has examined whether the sum â of 20Â 300 million â will be sufficient in the ideal event that, for at least half of the cross-border projects, the possible 50% is invested up until 2013.
Will that sum also be sufficient to ensure the operation of the guarantee instruments which are being established jointly by Commissioner Barrot and Commissioner Almunia?
I would want assurance that the Commission and the Council intend to concentrate on the 30 projects already adopted, guaranteeing their stability and providing them with the necessary impetus, and not to be diverted by other interests which, in the form of alternative projects, are appearing as a result of the prospect of fresh money.
I would like to end by mentioning the necessary flexibility and provision of additionalities at the different levels of funding, both at Community level and at national and regional level, both public and private, including the possible synergies between transport networks and energy networks.
Â Â  Â Â Â The limited amount of funding set aside for transport policy made it necessary to draw up a list of priority trans-European transport network projects.
It is, however, abundantly clear that this list still contains too many projects in relation to the EUâs financial resources.
In view of the recent enlargement and the massive delays being experienced by the new Member States with regard to infrastructure development, I therefore believe that projects aimed at unifying Europeâs transport network should be the focus of particular attention.
With regard to the Commissionâs proposals for levels of funding under the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective, it should be noted that there is no justification whatsoever for citing EU enlargement as the reason for increased expenditure in this area.
The new Member States are involved in only 10 of the 30 approved projects, and they receive only 10% of funding.
Furthermore, the 10Â new Member States regard this as an unattractive funding option because of the unusually low rate of cofinancing from the EU.
In spite of these shortcomings, however, I believe that we should do everything in our power to ensure that expenditure on the trans-European transport network remains at the level proposed by the Commission.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, I should first like to thank all those who have spoken and who have clearly demonstrated that the implementation and creation of the trans-European transport network projects is a significant priority for your Parliament.
I must perhaps offset the pessimism and negative analysis expressed in certain quarters, since if it is true that progress in the achievement of these projects has up to now, since the Maastricht Treaty, been insufficient, a number of them have nevertheless been carried out or are on course to be carried out since the 1994 European Council in Essen, if my memory serves me well.
A first step in completing the projects has thus been achieved or is on course to be.
There is no doubt that the Council shares the concerns of your Parliament when you state that the trans-European networks are an essential element from an economic point of view, or from the point of view of territorial cohesion as the speakers have said, and as Mr Vice-President has noted.
Certainly, as someone pointed out, money provides the backbone for this effort.
We must therefore ensure that our political priorities can also be translated into budgetary priorities.
It is in this respect that the financial perspectives are indeed a major issue.
As President-in-Office of the Council, I can but state that until June, the Luxembourg Presidency attaches great importance to this section of the financial perspectives and would not wish it to be reduced, because that would mean that the political priority would be decreased or further delayed.
It is a commitment that the Presidency alone cannot, however, make.
It is, in actual fact, the responsibility of the Member States first and foremost and of your Parliament to decide upon them, since the financial perspectives are not only decided upon in the Council.
The financial perspectives are decided upon jointly by the Council and by your Parliament.
I believe that if you attach great political importance to the trans-European networks, you should let it be known.
You have done that today, the lesson has been learnt, and the message will be conveyed during the coming weeks, whilst discussions on the financial perspectives will certainly intensify.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, I should first like to follow MrÂ Schmit in thanking all of the Members and speakers who have demonstrated their great interest in this matter by being here today.
I should next like to point out that we have a practically complete outline for 27 current and future Member States, and that the proportion of cofinancing will be the same for all Member States.
Broadly speaking, we will finance 50% of the studies â as we are doing at present.
With regard to the projects, we will increase from a rate of 10% for the ânormalâ projects to possibly 30% if they are priority projects.
The cross-border projects, which until now have benefited from a maximum rate of 20%, could possibly benefit from a rate of 50% if we join you in treating them as a major priority.
I should, moreover, like to return to the issue of neighbourhood and the links you hope to foster with the entire European continent.
You are aware that I confided my thoughts on extending the trans-European network to neighbouring countries â the Balkans, the Caucasus, Russia, the Ukraine, Moldavia, the Eastern and Southern Mediterranean â to Loyola de Palacio.
I am expecting great things of this work, which will enable us to reflect on the future of relations across the European continent and that will also contribute to our thoughts on the neighbourhood policy.
I should also like to point out that we will have to be very attentive, because we will still have to make sure that the nation states and the Member States can undertake the projects in earnest.
Overall, we will provide a seventh of the effort, a contribution that will have a fundamental lever effect.
I will not go over all of the speeches that have been made, particularly by members of the Committee on Transport and Tourism.
That said, you are right that it is a matter of great urgency, particularly if we hope to avoid, as certain among you fear, the creation of a kind of patchwork made up of small sections that could be managed well, but that would not be linked to the entire network.
It is for that reason, MrÂ President â and I take the liberty of insisting on this point this morning â that I have taken the decision to propose the appointment of coordinators to the Council and Parliament. These coordinators will be made responsible precisely for ensuring that every effort is made along the whole length of the corridor â they are essentially rail corridors and also river corridors â to guarantee the cohesion of the corridor, within the time allowed.
I believe, MrÂ President, that Parliament must promptly issue its opinion on the proposals.
As Commissioner, I would like to take this opportunity to repeat that I look forward to Parliamentâs opinion?
I will then be able to communicate to the Council this proposal on the strategy â if I can use the term â of coordinators, to which, Minister, it has moreover given its consent.
Armed with the opinion of Parliament and that of the Council, I would then have to present the nomination of these coordinators that I sincerely hope for to the College of the Commission.
The coordinators would in fact have both technical skills and, I believe, the necessary political and moral authority to truly get everybody moving and, if need be, to make sure that two neighbouring States can commit to the project of extending the network by means of bilateral relations.
I would like once again to thank Parliament and the Presidency, which has pointed out that everything has of course been put on hold due to the financial negotiations.
That said, I believe that it is also the responsibility of Members to point out to their leaders and to the leaders of their Member States that, if we want a fully competitive Europe that achieves territorial cohesion, they too must play their part in implementing these large-scale projects that can prove a real opportunity for the future of Europe.
My thanks also go to MrÂ Costa who, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, took the initiative for this debate that I too have found very useful.
Â Â  Â The debate is closed.
Â Â  Â The next item is the report by MrsÂ Hennis-Plasschaert on enhancing port security (COM(2004)0393 â C6-0072/2004 â 2004/0031(COD)).
Â Â  . MrÂ President, my first word is a word of thanks to your rapporteur, who has carried out some truly excellent work.
The recent wave of terrorist attacks has demonstrated that no country or business sector is immune to such threats.
Whatever their motives may be, these terrorist acts can occur in any place, at any time.
The maritime world and port environment do not escape such threats, and we cannot wait for an attack before we take what are essentially preventative measures within the transport policy framework.
The fundamental objective of this proposal for a directive is to complete, at port level, the measures adopted in 2004 exclusively on port terminals, within the context of the regulations regarding the security of ships and port facilities.
You will recall that this regulation transposes, at Community level, the security measures adopted by the International Maritime Organisation in December 2002, particularly the ISPS code on the security of ships and port facilities.
At that time, the Commission had chosen to extend the security measures to the entire port area only at a later stage and by means of a directive.
Our final objective is to emerge from this near artificial separation between the port, on the one hand, and the port facilities that make up the port, on the other, and to implement a coherent security plan that takes into account the geography and the topography of different ports, as well as the various areas of which it is composed, on a case-by-case basis, according to the Member Statesâ transposition.
We believe that this approach is viable in terms of efficiency and cost.
I would like to stress that our proposal is largely based on the results of a piece of work carried out jointly by the International Labour Organisation and the International Maritime Organisation, which has led to the publication of a code of conduct on port security.
This code of conduct is not, however, legally binding.
That is why the Commissionâs proposal requires the same structures and security measures as the regulation already in force, in order to create a security regime that applies to maritime transport as a whole, starting with ships and extending as far as the port area.
This approach enables procedures and synergies to be simplified where security is concerned.
The proposed directive calls on Member States to define the confines of their ports and to ensure that port security assessments and port security plans are drafted in an appropriate manner, and in accordance with minimum requirements.
The proposal submitted before you also makes provision for a port security authority to be designated for each individual port or group of ports, a port security officer to be appointed, and focal points to be set up in Member States in order to ensure that the necessary communication takes place with other Member States and, of course, with the Commission.
Finally, the proposal makes provision for a Community-wide system of inspections of the implementation of port security measures.
I shall conclude my speech, MrÂ President, by stressing in particular that some of our major trade partners have already carried out an extensive implementation of the International Maritime Organisationâs ISPS-code.
These third countries enforce the security measures in all of their ports and naturally expect the same commitment from us.
They are all set to come and check that that is the case if we do not move more quickly in this direction.
I believe that the European Union cannot be outdone in this area, both for reasons of trade but also for the protection, naturally, of our fellow European citizens and of such vital infrastructures as our ports.
I would add that, when I travelled to the United States last month, I was able to visit MrÂ Jackson, who is responsible for national security.
To be perfectly frank, we have really initiated a form of cooperation based on trust.
That also implies, however, that Europeans are truly willing to consent to the efforts required to ensure this large-scale security effort across all port facilities.
I therefore once again thank your rapporteur and all those who have examined this text.
I thank you, in particular, for conferring on this document the full importance that it deserves and, MrÂ President, Minister, I hope for your speedy agreement on this matter.
Â Â  . Mr President, as we know and indeed, as Commissioner Barrot stated a moment ago, the terrorist attacks in the US and Spain, as well as the general increase in crime, have led to all kinds of safety measures being taken in Europe.
After the airports, it is now, of course, the turn of the seaports; after all, European ports are essential links within the transport chain which connect trade and passenger flows by sea and across the land.
In many cases, they are also the nerve centres for the transhipment of dangerous freight for important chemical and petrochemical production centres and are located near cities.
It follows that terrorist attacks in ports can lead to serious disruptions of transport systems, have a domino effect and cause damage to people in the ports and to those living in the vicinity.
It was, quite simply, vital that action be taken.
I should add that it is better to sort this matter out ourselves than to be on the receiving end of unsolicited help from American inspection teams, to name but one example.
As Commissioner Barrot indicated a moment ago, first of all, Regulation 725 transposed the Code on international ship and port facility security â the ISPS Code â into rules that are binding upon the EU.
This Regulation is not all-embracing, though.
Since it is only concerned with the security of the wet section of the port, an additional directive on the regulation of the security of the entire port area came out in 2004.
That is the directive that is before us this morning and on which we will be voting later on today.
I would like to focus on two core issues to which I was committed as the rapporteur.
Commissioner Barrot has already discussed a number of other issues at great length.
The two issues I should like to discuss are related to guaranteeing a level playing field in the European Union.
First of all, there is the proposalâs financial underpinning.
Who is actually paying for what?
The differences between some Member States and others are considerable, and I see this as completely undesirable if there is to be a level playing field.
In the final agreement, the Commission is therefore urged to present â as soon as possible and by no later than 30 June 2006 â a study about the distribution of the costs between government bodies, port authorities and industry.
The additional security measures should on no account lead to distortion of competition.
Secondly, I was determined that the interpretation of the rules in all Member States should be unambiguous and that their implementation should be harmonised.
It is, of course, unacceptable that one Member State should settle for one extra lock, so to speak, while five guards and six cameras should be made compulsory in the others.
Of course, I am exaggerating, but still.
I have therefore argued in favour of the Commission âmetamonitoringâ to some degree.
This proved to be a tricky point during the negotiations, particularly for the Council, which surprises me, because it is the Member States that complain bitterly about the lack of a level playing field, but all is well that ends well.
We have found a phrase with which all those involved can identify and by means of which the Commission is given sufficient means in order to carry out the necessary metamonitoring.
As rapporteur, I have also tried my level best to avoid creating an additional bureaucratic institution, and proposals to that end have consequently been repealed.
I am, of course, delighted to inform you that I reached agreement with the shadow rapporteurs, the Council and the Commission very recently.
This compromise is made up of Amendments 13 to 75, inclusive, which the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and my own group can support, as can also the Council and the Commission.
If we actually adopt this compromise later on today, the directive can be finalised at first reading.
Although you may be inclined to be sympathetic to Amendments 10, 11 and 12, tabled by the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, I would nevertheless advise you to vote against them.
They failed to pass muster at an earlier stage in the Committee on Transport and Tourism; and their substance has already been covered elsewhere or would lead to an unnecessary Christmas tree effect.
The agreement that has now been reached is a very workable compromise for all parties involved in the implementation of the measures, and so a speedy conclusion at first reading is very much to be desired.
There is nothing left to say but to thank the shadow rapporteurs, the Commission and the Luxembourg Presidency warmly for their commitment and their cooperation, which I have greatly appreciated.
Â Â  . Madam President, I rise to speak on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy.
First of all I would like to express our broad support for this proposal and in particular welcome the flexibility contained therein, so far as Member States and their implementation is concerned.
Security and counter-terrorism measures are very much a feature of the age in which we live and are very important issues, so it is all the more welcome that the Commissioner has taken an initiative in this matter.
However, my committee had some concerns about the lack of a proper cost benefit analysis, or an adequate impact assessment of the costs arising from this directive.
We also had concern about the absence in the proposal of any specific reference to funding or financing measures.
It is all very well for us to come forward with proposals, but we should have regard as to how such proposals are to be financed.
Therefore, we tabled an amendment, which draws attention to these aspects of the proposal and calls for them to be borne in mind by the Member States when they draw up the guidelines for action.
We would not wish all the burden of the cost of this measure to fall on operators or shippers in the private sector, but would seek a fair and equitable sharing of the burdens and costs involved.
Â Â  .
MadamÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank the rapporteurs who have gone before me and I can of course confirm that the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs endorses the measure.
I nonetheless think it necessary to add some points: the ease and confidence with which the terrorists were able to strike in September 2001 and in other circumstances have created the need to extend security checks not only at airports and border points but also at ports, which record a significant flow of goods and passengers on a daily basis.
With regard to the proposal of the Council and Parliament to additionally subject cargo ferries to checks, I, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties, take the liberty of pointing out that a greater number of checks at ports would also make it possible to stem the trade in counterfeit goods, drugs trafficking and a long list of activities carried out by criminal organisations.
My proposal, presented as an amendment in the Committee on Civil Liberties, was not accepted, in the same way that other amendments calling for the extension of checks to people, in addition to goods and vehicles, were not accepted.
I truly believe this rejection to be incomprehensible, given that the objective was exclusively that of further safeguarding the safety of our citizens.
Fortunately, subsequent discussions between the Council and Parliament confirmed the legitimacy of my argument and took note of it.
The content of my amendments was added to the text, so that they have, in essence, been accepted.
I believe that the directive can also act as a legitimate tool in the fight against illegal immigration, by restricting the entry of people who, arriving without jobs or any papers, and counting on straightforward social integration, very often are compelled to commit crimes in order to survive, sometimes even despite themselves.
Â Â  . Madam President, I wish to begin by congratulating Mrs Hennis-Plasschaert on doing a very fine job in drafting this report.
The fact that we are, I hope, bringing this matter to a speedy conclusion is testimony to her hard work.
We all know the threat from terrorism over the last few years has increased considerably.
The House has rightly debated these issues many times recently.
My original concerns were that the Commissionâs proposals were too vague, would go too far and that the considerable costs of implementing and enforcing this directive could be pushed down the supply chain, leading to increased costs to industry and the consumer.
I agree very much with Mr Chichesterâs comments on the cost-benefit analysis.
Through the hard work of the rapporteur, such vague phrases as âunlawful actsâ â which could mean anything, such as dropping litter in a port area which poses no real threat to security â have been amended to read âsecurity incidentsâ. This tightens the meaning of the phrasing and ensures that the directive can be better targeted at real threats.
Port areas have been better defined to limit the costs imposed on the supply chain outside the geographic area of the port.
Importantly, the principle of subsidiarity has been promoted in terms of defining the port-related areas to which the directive will apply.
However, security is not just about money and, indeed, cannot have a price put upon it.
The hard work of the rapporteur has meant that the potentially unnecessary bureaucracy has been addressed.
I am pleased to say that we have a report that I fully support and I would ask the House to give it its full backing in the vote later today.
Â Â  .
MadamÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, with this directive we are combining the security of transport with the safeguarding of goods and maritime traffic between Europe and the rest of the world.
Indeed, since 2002 and with the specific provisions of 2004, the issue has no longer been seen merely in terms of protecting human life at sea and environmental impact, but also of preventing terrorist attacks.
An improvement in the situation is, however, necessary, given that vessels are often not allowed to load and unload at US ports, and â particularly as regards container ships â the ports have to reach an agreement with the US customs agency under penalty of exclusion from transport routes.
That does not aid our competitiveness.
The security rules that already apply, as cited by MrÂ Barrot, moreover, are fragmented, they are not legally binding and they lack an overall picture.
It would therefore seem fundamental to approve this regulatory framework, in order to prevent distortion of competition and to recognise ports as nodal points in the logistical chain.
The contribution made by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament to the drafting of the overall proposals was aimed in the following two directions: defining ports in the transport sector â not only at the ship/port interface, but acknowledging their functional link with the common transport policy â and asserting the need for inspections by the Commission to guarantee a uniform framework, while respecting the Member Statesâ authority.
In view of the considerable disparity between the positions of the Council and the Commission at the outset, and whilst we are making do with a less ambitious outcome than we would have hoped for, we consider the compromise reached to be satisfactory and we vote in favour.
I sincerely thank the rapporteur for her fine ability to listen and synthesise.
Â Â  .Â Â Â MadamÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I for my part am opposed to bureaucracy, and the same is probably true of every Member of this House.
A burgeoning number of documents that deal with problems relating to port security could well result in a proliferation of bureaucratic structures, and EU regulation of this issue will mean that two overlapping sets of legislation and legal systems will be in force.
Subsidiarity is one of the Communityâs founding principles.
We must not deprive the Member States of yet more powers by declaring that the directive will also apply to areas outside ports.
We must not impose constraints on the Member Statesâ judicial systems by dictating what is to be considered an offence and what is to be considered unlawful.
I am all for enhancing port security, but wherever possible it should be the Member States and the ports themselves that decide how this goal is to be achieved, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity.
The effect of this directive must not be that ports have to undergo never-ending inspections, carried out by countless different bodies.
As I said at the beginning of my speech, we must avoid over-bureaucratisation of the regulations, directives and laws that apply in the EU concerning this matter.
Â Â  Madam President, a directive on the security of EU ports is no luxury.
The attacks in New York, Washington and Madrid have shown that no mode of transport is yet safe from terrorism, and it is therefore logical that seaport security should be stepped up.
Commissioner Barrot pointed out a moment ago that by doing so, we are simply discharging a number of international obligations.
In fact, this is not just about the threat of terrorism, but also about the fight against illegal immigration, organised crime and the trade in drugs and fake goods.
We hope in any event that the initiative will not remain stuck in good intentions, but that each of these security concerns will be acted upon properly.
Finally, I should like to express my approval about the amendments tabled by the Committee on Transport and Tourism.
It is indeed necessary that the funding of the proposed measures should not result in distortion of competition and that clear guidelines are prescribed for covering the costs incurred by the governments on the one hand and operators on the other.
Â Â  Madam President, I am glad that you, a lover of the coastline, are in charge of this sitting, and you know that.
I would like to thank the rapporteur for the work she has done in tandem with the shadow rapporteurs.
I think we have here a sensible compromise ready for tomorrowâs vote, one that all the groups can support, and that will bring this matter to a close.
The world is not, alas, the way we would like it to be.
There have been terrorist attacks, which endanger the transport of persons and goods.
Something must be done about them, and that is what this directive attempts to do; the upshot is that we have to take preventive action.
One point that has to be made in this context, though, is that responsibility for security cannot, ultimately, be passed on to the ports alone; this is, on the contrary, a task for all those involved in transport, and that is something we must not forget.
Security begins with the person loading on the goods, and it must, ultimately, involve both road and rail, or else we will end up with distortions of competition and with something else that we do not want, in the shape of more traffic on the roads rather than on water.
This, I think, has to be taken into account.
Unless I am mistaken, the Commission has already started giving consideration as to how this aspect may be included.
Â Â  Madam President, the security of vulnerable locations such as ports is essential to society.
This applies to both the ship-quay relationship and to the other port sections.
Since ports are not identical in terms of size, location, character and method or organisation, Member States are given scope to decide how best to implement these rules, rightly so.
I applaud the fact that the Member States can implement those rules in the most appropriate manner.
After all, a uniform regulation for all ports prejudices the diversity to which I referred and will push up costs.
A second important point is the enforcement of those rules.
Experience elsewhere has taught us that enforcement is easier in theory than in practice.
Limited manpower is no ingredient for quality inspection, and so I welcome the fact that the Commission closely monitors the implementation of this directive.
Finally, I should like to express my appreciation for the rapporteur who managed to bring this dossier to a good end in a succinct manner by holding on to the core principles in consultation with the Council.
Â Â  Â Â Â I very much welcome the fact that a debate is being held on this issue, as this proves that we are endeavouring to act wisely before any harm is done.
It also proves that we really do regard ports as multimodal hubs within transport chains.
Finally, this debate will boost consumer confidence.
The advantage of the proposed directive is that it provides us with clear goals, and allows us to be flexible in implementing and achieving these goals.
There was some controversy within my group over issues such as funding for institutions with competences in the field, and inspections and whether or not they disrupt port operations.
I believe the compromise we reached is a good one, and that it deserves our support.
In conclusion, I should like to add that I asked port authorities in my constituency of Szczeczin and ÅwinoujÅcie for their opinion on these proposals.
Their responses were positive in every instance.
Â Â  â Madam President, there is no doubt that we need to defend and guarantee the security of ports as well as airports.
Terrorism is, of course, something we live with and fear.
As a journalist, I experienced at first hand the major case of piracy on board the cruise ship outside Piraeus, when I saw arms and legs amputated and floating in the water.
Terrorism is a terrible thing.
However, equally terrible is the fear of terror, which various governments use as a pretext for committing crimes against civil liberties.
Citizens fear for their lives from terrorism and are afraid for their freedom from cameras watching their every move in streets, ports, airports, hotels, everywhere.
Î€he ESÎ¡S is tapping telephone calls.
Citizens are monitored from credit cards, they are monitored from everywhere.
We have terrorism and fear of terror.
So let us protect our citizens.
All the money which we are spending on terrorism â we spent a billion euros for the Olympic Games â could have been spent differently, repelling fanaticism and the extremism which leads straight to terrorism.
Â Â  â Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as we know, terrorist action over recent years has targeted public transport â trains, buses, aeroplanes, ships and the areas in which they operate.
Memories of terrorist attacks, such as the attack in Madrid, remain fresh in our memory.
We urgently need to take more â and more effective â measures.
The proposal for a directive aims to serve that purpose.
Most of the measures introduced by the directive are satisfactory.
We need to take measures at Community level, so that there are commonly accepted security rules and, at the same time, equal conditions of competition between Community ports.
The successful example of the Olympic Games in Athens, where innovative security measures were applied, should be taken into account by the Member States, who need to acquaint themselves with these measures.
Coming from a country with hundreds of islands and ports in a sensitive area on the geographical edge of Europe, I think that the European Union should give priority to programmes to meet major requirements and complete infrastructures on these islands, which are often a point of illegal entry for people and goods.
Â Â  MadamÂ President, I shall be very brief, but I should first of all like to reassure both the rapporteur and, particularly, MrÂ Chichester.
We are well aware that there is a cost issue and, as regards the costs liable to be generated by these measures, we in fact plan to undertake the commitment to prepare a communication on the security of different transport methods, including the issue of their financing, in our 2005 work programme.
The concerns of your Parliament will be taken into consideration in this way.
This reference to financing is, moreover, included in a preamble.
I should also like to point out to those who fear that we are not taking specific national situations into consideration that this is a directive and not a regulation. This enables us to take into consideration, by way of subsidiarity, a number of practical considerations that will make the fight for security more effective, when the directive is transposed by Member States.
Finally, I should like to say to Mr Piecyk that he is absolutely right and that we must also be concerned about safety throughout the transport chain.
I now return to you, Mrs Hennis-Plasschaert, to express my deepest thanks as, thanks to you, I believe that we will be in a position to gain time in the context of implementing these security rules.
I also thank your committee, the Committee on Transport and Tourism.
You have embraced this rather technical proposal and you have adopted a pragmatic and constructive approach in your handling of the dossier.
I am pleased to observe that there are a great many points on which Parliament, the Commission and the Council fundamentally agree, with regard to the measures to be taken.
The Commission can therefore subscribe to the compromise reached by Parliament in the context of negotiations with the Council and which is expressed, MadamÂ President, in Amendments 13-75.
We can therefore endorse Amendments 13-75, but unfortunately not Amendments 1-12.
To conclude, I would like to express my wish for a decision to be taken in order that this directive can be speedily adopted.
As I said, the European Union cannot economise on preventative measures for the protection of its ports either with regard to its people and sectors of port activity or with regard to its international partners.
All of the above has, moreover, been extremely well put by a number of you.
MadamÂ President, MrsÂ Hennis-Plasschaert, ladies and gentlemen, my services will pass on to you the detailed position of the Commission on each proposed amendment.
I thank you most heartily for your attention and for your altogether decisive contribution to the outcome of this project.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner.
Thank you also for your brevity.
That concludes the debate.
The vote will take place at noon today.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report (A6-0105/2005) by Mr Cercas, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2003/88/EC concerning certain aspects of the organisation of working time (COM (2004) 0607 C6-0122/2004 2004/0209(COD)).
Â Â  . Madam President, honourable Members, I should like to start by thanking both the rapporteur and the House as a whole for their first-rate work, which has been carried out in an extremely short space of time, given the complex and sensitive nature of this issue.
Our aim in revising the directive is quite clear, namely to ensure continued high standards of health and safety at work.
It is well known that a link exists between work-related accidents and excessive working hours.
At the same time, we are all aware that the future will belong to flexible businesses that introduce innovative working methods, in so doing motivating their workers to be more productive and also offering them high-quality jobs.
In the interests of our fellow citizens, we must respond to these new challenges to the best of our ability.
We must flesh out the European social model, one of the founding principles of which is quality as a determinant of competitiveness, and in fact the need to do so has also emerged from public consultations on the Constitutional Treaty.
The Commissionâs aim has always been to ensure that the revised directive maintains the current level of protection for workers at the same time as contributing to a more flexible organisation of working time.
This was the intention behind the original proposal, and I believe that the same goal is pursued by those of Parliamentâs amendments that the Commission will be able to accept.
I will comment in more detail on the Commissionâs position on the amendments that have been tabled after listening to your debate.
Â Â  .
Madam President, thank you very much, Commissioner, for your kind words, not just about my report, but also about the joint work carried out by all members of this Parliamentâs Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
Ladies and gentlemen, by chance, our debate on the Directive on working time has coincided with the European anniversaries of 9 May.
The words of our President, Mr Borrell, yesterday in this house on the relationship between our duty to remember and our duty to build a Europe in which euro-scepticism and anti-europeanism have been defeated are still ringing in my ears.
Our debate today and tomorrowâs vote are very much related to our responsibilities.
They are very much related because millions of Europeans are awaiting the result of certain debates in which they have placed very great hopes, since this Directive is at the heart of social Europe and will be a clear signal of our will and our conviction that the European social model has a future, otherwise we will be at the mercy of a future dictated not from the other side of the Atlantic, but from the Pacific.
Our debates also coincide with an important moment in European integration and the ratification of the Constitutional Treaty by the various parliaments and peoples of Europe.
And at the heart of the concerns of the citizens currently facing the question of whether or not to take the constitutional route is always the same question: what is Europe doing to improve our living conditions?
We all know that this is the key point and that the question of whether or not our agenda is in line with the agenda and concerns of the citizens will depend precisely upon our reaffirming the European social model.
And the key point, as the Commissioner has said, is the opt-out Parliament wishes to put an end to this clause.
European social laws must apply to all countries without exception.
It is not sufficient, Commissioner, to eliminate the abuse and fraud committed in the past under the previous legislation.
We must put an end to its legal basis in all of the Member States, as Parliament says, after 36 months or whatever is decided in a subsequent negotiation with the Council.
Why?
Because the opt-out blatantly contradicts the objectives of the Directive, the health and safety of workers and the fundamental principles of the Treaty.
Because it contradicts that which we have learnt from 10 years of experience during which, in the countries in which it has been applied, the health, safety and reconciliation of the family and professional lives of millions of European men and women have suffered seriously.
Because it contravenes the Charter of Fundamental Rights and our Constitutional Treaty, Article 91 of which lays down the obligation for a high quality of life in work and a restriction of working days.
Because, Commissioner, European workers, their organisations, women's organisations and also, in private, many employers who want a typically European model for industrial relations, are asking us for it.
What about flexibility though?
This Parliament knows that we also need to deal with the issue of flexibility, because in Europe we do not just need higher quality work, but also more work.
We are therefore in agreement and we will allow flexibility and we will vote for the annualisation, but, I must insist, this is a , we shall not vote for annualisation unless there is a vote in favour of putting an end to the opt-out clause.
We believe that the opt-out would be proper in a Europe without rules, but we are nevertheless in favour of making European rules flexible.
Greater flexibility is not incompatible with a higher level of social protection for workers, provided that we ensure that there is a minimum level of regulations and guarantees, as the Wim Kok report stated.
We also want to respond, Commissioner, to the principles to be taken into account when defining on-call times; we want the to be respected; we want the decision of the Court of Justice to be respected.
On-call time is working time, because workers cannot use their time freely and they have to be in the places dictated by the employer.
We are also sensitive to the needs of the European health systems, which are facing serious difficulties recruiting professionals to cover this on-call time.
We have therefore sought a solution which creates a synthesis between flexibility and safety.
Commissioner, the Members in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs believe that these two things are compatible.
Those who believe they are not compatible are the people who are seeking to perpetuate the opt-out or those who are seeking to define on-call time as non-working time.
We can make an effort, we have demonstrated this, there is a consensus in Parliament.
I would ask the Commission and the Council not to destroy the enthusiasm created by this agreement, because it is the old agreement that led to the European social model.
We therefore fervently hope that we can count on your help, your dialogue and that we can work together constructively over the coming months.
Â Â  Madam President, in George Orwellâs âAnimal Farmâ, there is a scene that is repeated in which, as soon as a debate is to take place, the sheep begin to call out âfour legs good, two legs badâ.
That is what we see now.
Whenever anyone objects to our transferring power from the Member States to the EU institutions, we are told that not to do so would be tantamount to re-playing the Second World War, complete with holocaust and everything else.
We cannot therefore even debate the existence or otherwise of the Working Time Directive without being subject to accusations of that kind.
The principle of subsidiarity is fundamental, with tribute paid to it on solemn occasions of every conceivable kind.
When we get down to the details, precisely the opposite is the case.
It is actually impossible for anything to remain with the Member States.
The Working Time Directive is in itself a breach of the principle of subsidiarity.
Each of the Member States is different.
Each has its own economic structure.
Some countries make their living from manufacturing, others from the processing industry.
We have different arrangements in the public sector, with different rules governing such matters.
There is no good reason for trying to regulate working time for the whole of the EU in this way.
Indeed, it would be extremely inappropriate.
Those who now argue in favour of doing so say that the alternative is social dumping.
That is a hugely serious accusation to make against those countries that we have accepted as members of the EU and which all fulfil the Copenhagen criteria and are constitutional states entitled to organise themselves as they see fit.
The notion that we could obtain some form of slave labour from these countries is a grotesque accusation which definitely must be rejected.
Parliament has now attempted in this House further to exacerbate the Working Time Directive already in place.
That is something we must reject, for it is an attempt to give a yet further increased presence to the EU institutions.
The proposal should therefore definitely be rejected with reference to the principle of subsidiarity.
Â Â  . â Ladies and gentlemen, political decisions are sometimes the result of compromises that are intended to keep both sides happy.
Problems resulting from the fact that anything that benefits employers places employees at a disadvantage, and vice versa, have beset the proposal for a directive concerning certain aspects of the organisation of working time at every turn, and we should not pretend otherwise.
The vote in the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality, of which I am a member, has demonstrated that Members of all political persuasions wish to tackle inequalities between employees and employers, and to ensure that there is a gradual move towards equal treatment for men and women on the labour market.
The modern humanist approach to employment relations did not come out of the blue, however.
It is the culmination of a long struggle for the recognition of human rights, and hence of the right to fair working conditions, which right is enshrined, , in the Lisbon Strategy, and emerges quite clearly from the Cercas report.
Yet a few legislative loopholes and seemingly innocent compromises could undo centuries of progress.
It is an unfortunate fact that altruism by employers towards their employees has not to date been a founding principle of our civilisation.
We adhered to the principle of work-life balance when voting on the proposal in committee, and we would insist that the following proposals are adopted, in order to ensure that this principle becomes more than an empty phrase to salve our conscience.
Firstly, the maximum working week should not exceed 48Â hours, including overtime.
Derogations to this principle may only be decided on by means of collective agreements, which would rule out the use of individual opt-outs.
Secondly, on-call time, including what is termed âinactive on-call timeâ, should be regarded as working time.
Quite apart from anything else, this principle has been confirmed in rulings by the Court of Justice.
Thirdly, the reference period for calculating the average working week should continue to be four months.
There is a further priority I should like to highlight, namely that achieving equal opportunities does not only involve creating a level playing field for men and women with regard to wages and access to jobs and education.
It also involves granting equal rights to men as far as opportunities to participate fully in family life are concerned.
Â Â  . â Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal before us is a good one, based as it is on balance and common sense.
It is in tune with the Lisbon Strategy, it protects small and medium-sized enterprises, and it contains a number of points providing for greater flexibility in the labour market.
There are some controversial elements, however, the first of which is the opt-out.
The possibility of keeping the opt-out would mean that the Union would be adopting a directive on delicate aspects of minimum standards to be met in the area of health and safety at work, and yet would be also saying in the same directive that compliance with those standards is entirely optional.
Continuing this practice cannot therefore be seen as a form of flexibility.
What it would mean is deregulation in an area as sensitive as health and safety at work.
The European economy needs greater flexibility in the labour market, but not at the expense of an absence of rules.
There are other, more effective, ways of bringing flexibility into the labour market, such as extending the reference period, which is covered in this proposal.
This is, moreover, guided by the subsidiarity principle, in that it gives the Member States the freedom to choose to set the reference period anywhere between 4 and 12 months, depending on the situation in the country, without the EU unilaterally imposing a set period.
Lastly, as regards working time and rest time, there is no reason for Parliament not to abide by the rulings made by the Court of Justice.
Once again, this proposal fails to uphold the subsidiarity principle, which would accord the Member States the right to set out methods for calculation as they see fit for the purposes of salaries and counting working time.
Let me state very clearly that, in the proposal that has been tabled, there are no other possible outcomes than those I have mentioned.
Â Â  . Madam President, I congratulate the rapporteur and all who have helped him in this work.
There are two crucial points in the report: they are the twin proposals to phase out the opt-out, while opening a way to the annual calculation of working time.
In that way we will maintain workers' safety while continuing to allow businesses the flexibility they need to thrive in the modern marketplace.
An opt-out from a piece of health and safety legislation is wrong in principle.
It needs to end and we need to bring about a proper balance between working and family life.
Our leaders pledged to make the European Union the most dynamic, knowledge-based economy in the world, with more and better quality jobs and greater social cohesion.
We will not achieve that by opening the door to a universal opt-out.
That would be the path to a long-hours, low-pay economy, which is the exact opposite to what we are trying to achieve.
If we do not end the opt-out, we should simply repeal the legislation and stop pretending that we want to put in place any sensible minimum standards at all on working time.
I would stress this: people have told me that this has nothing to do with work/life/family balance.
It has.
In 1996 the European Court of Justice ruled that this is a health and safety directive and that health and safety is about the total social, psychological and physical wellbeing of individuals.
Family and working life balance has to do with the social and psychological wellbeing of all workers within the European Union.
So let us nail that particular argument.
Â Â  . MadamÂ President, Commissioner, this text, naturally, does not aim to standardise working conditions in the Union, which would today neither be desirable nor possible, but it seeks rather to implement common foundations for the protection of employees.
The more beneficial social systems, like the French labour law, are therefore not challenged and will remain enforceable.
This point is essential, you suspect, in the context of the debate on the Constitution in France and in view of concerns raised by the drafting of European rules in the social field.
The stakes are nonetheless important.
For us, ladies and gentlemen, it is a question of sending a clear signal as regards the social system that we hope to promote at European level.
The ambitious objectives of the Lisbon Strategy make it necessary to adapt the European economy to new challenges.
It is obvious that businesses should benefit from a dose of flexibility in the management of working time, but we sincerely believe that greater flexibility is not contradictory with a high level of workersâ health and safety.
The balance between flexibility in the management of time and the safety of workers enforces the definition of minimum regulations and safeguards as well as suitable controls.
The debate surrounding the opt-out is thus of particular importance in this context.
The option for an employer to contravene the legal limit of a 48-hour working week with the individual agreement of workers is, for us, clearly at odds with the spirit of the directive.
I should like to point out that Parliament, during its examination of the 2004 report, was against keeping the individual opt-out agreement.
Whilst we have hoped for the progressive abolition of the individual opt-out in a text that does not lean towards standardisation, however, we have given our support to keeping an opt-out option that would be managed by negotiation and collective conventions, in accordance with national customs.
With regard to the reference periods, we agree with the rapporteur and the Commission on allowing an extension of not more than 12 months. This corresponds to the requirement for flexibility from the business community, which must naturally be able to deal with fluctuations in demand.
Finally, we remain convinced that all instances of on-call time must be considered working time.
The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs nevertheless proposes that Member States may authorise the calculation of the inactive parts of on-call time in a specific manner in order to comply with the maximum weekly working time.
We endorse this provision that once again takes account of national customs in this field.
Â Â  . Madam President, we too would like to thank the rapporteur and others for the work that has been done on this revision of the working time directive.
For our Group, this is an extremely important piece of legislation.
The limitation of working time has been an historic struggle for the labour movement and we should not be giving that away in the 21st century.
But according to a recent report from the Work Foundation, based in the UK, the pattern of working in excess of 60 hours a week is prevalent now throughout the European Union, particularly in certain sectors.
I think this is something that we should not be welcoming but should actually be very worried about.
For the Verts/ALEGroup,the control of working time is also about who controls your life, and this working time directive applies to employees.
It is very important that people realise that.
This is not just about having flexibility as a one-way street, but of bringing in the rights of employees.
It is a health and safety issue.
Tired workers are dangerous workers, whether they are operating on you or driving home.
It is also a social health issue, in terms of a work/life balance, if we want our citizens to be active citizens involved in a whole set of other things. You cannot do that if you are working the entire time.
But the opt-out is a big issue for us.
We will be told that this is about workers having a choice.
A lot of the evidence shows that it is not a choice.
It is something that is put in front of workers who are asked to sign away their rights to avoid employers having to negotiate or do paper work.
Indeed, we find that in the UK two thirds of workers do not even know there is a limit to their working time.
For us the issue of on-call time as working time is also important, whether you are working in a burger bar or a hospital, and the compensatory rest element is also crucial, given that stress is one of the biggest causes of time off work and that is linked to working time.
Â Â  . â Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my political group as a whole is absolutely opposed to the European Commission's proposal.
At the same time, it is highly critical of the report approved by a majority in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs because, unfortunately, on most issues it goes along with the Commission proposal.
We reject the Commission proposal because it perpetuates opting out and strengthens social dumping.
It feeds the unilateral power of the employer even more, on the pretext of corporate flexibility.
It weakens the existing levels of protection of tens of millions of workers and the equilibrium within their families.
It relaxes the current rules regulating working time introduced in the 1993 directive out of existence.
To be specific, the Commission proposal will allow the maximum working time to be as much as 65 hours a week, while the current directive and the International Labour Organisation Convention introduced a maximum permissible working week of 48 hours as long ago as 1919.
We are turning the clock back 85 years.
In addition, the reference period for flexible working time has been extended from four to twelve months, while the necessary precondition of prior collective negotiation and agreement on the subject has been abolished.
This will allow employers, in both the private and public sectors, to unilaterally and abusively manage the working time of workers, in the absence of the workers themselves, under the law or regulations.
Similarly, the clear case law of the Court of Justice of the European Communities has been circumvented with the misleading device of dividing on-call time into active and inactive on-call time.
Thus, the Member States or employers acting alone can say that eight inactive working hours implies 0.8 hours active time.
It is a mockery.
Similarly, the Court of Justice of the European Communities has imposed a rest period immediately after on-call time.
How does the Commission interpret the word 'immediately'?
One day, three days, three weeks?
I greatly fear that the Commission's proposal is nothing other than a knife in the back of tens of millions of workers, especially in the health and service sectors.
At the same time, however, it represents a danger to the health and safety of us all.
Commissioner, would you want to be operated on by a surgeon who had been on call for 30 hours?
Would you want to come across a lorry driver on the road who has been driving for 30 hours without a break?
Â Â  . Madam President, the working time directive is to provide a better deal for workers and improve family life; but will it?
The best deal a worker can get is to have a job, and this directive will not improve employment or social life.
I understand that the central objective of the EU is for each Member State to bring to the table its experience and skills, its best practice and ideas, share with the rest and strengthen all.
So, allow this UK representative to bring to the table today some UK experience and practice: that less regulation equals more employment.
Even MrÂ Å pidla agreed with me on that to some degree a short while ago.
Denmark and Sweden apart, the United Kingdom has the lowest unemployment rate in the whole EU, way below the average EU rate.
These countries have not taken the euro and the UK has not indulged in the more restrictive employment practices.
The 48-hour week, rigidly enforced, will cause small firms to close or drive people into the black economy, where they are outside of all protection and where they will become avoiders of income tax and VAT.
Flexibility can be provided by the opt-outs from the working week, which are due to be phased out in spite of a vote in this House on 24Â February.
Organisations like the United Kingdom Government, the chambers of commerce, EuroCommerce and Sky TV all want the opt outs to continue, but these bodies do not work in the pseudo-EU world of fancy plans and dead-hand regulation â they work in the real world of profit margins and of full employment as produced by the 48-hour opt out.
Â Â  Madam President, this proposed change to the Working Time Directive is just as absurd a piece of EU regulation as the directive it is designed to amend.
It amounts to misplaced interference in the conditions of the labour market, and it is not surprising that the two sides of industry have rejected the directive.
The conditions to which the directive relates differ widely across the 25 Member States and, no matter what positive things are inserted in the directive about the protection of employees and private life, it is and remains an expression of the EUâs obsession with regulation.
The European Parliament clearly wants to see low growth.
In my country, which without doubt has the EUâs highest standard of worker protection, these conditions are agreed between the two sides of industry.
This has produced good results.
Firstly, we have a larger proportion of the population of working age in the labour market than any other EU country.
We do not have the strikes we see again and again in Belgium and France.
We have a level of unemployment only half that of the eurozone, and we have the EUâs second highest gross national product per inhabitant.
It is incredible that we should have to put up with a situation in which the EU, which has not been able to solve these problems nearly so well as ourselves, is to tell us what to do.
People would do better to come to Denmark, see the way to do things and then go home and work out, on a national basis, what they might do in terms of their own circumstances.
It is quite impossible to assess how hard a nation works by looking at the length of its working time.
What are crucial are methods of organisation, the training of the labour force and degrees of efficiency.
In Denmark, people work efficiently, so the country can manage with shorter working hours.
Foreigners should not interfere in these conditions, and I recommend voting against this directive.
Â Â  Â Â Â MadamÂ President, MrÂ Cercas, working time is an extremely sensitive issue.
The reasons for this include the scourge of unemployment and the economic problems faced by employers, particularly in the new Member States.
A few days ago I was astonished to find that people in Poland were able to go shopping in Ikea until 8Â p.m. on 1Â May, which was not only Labour Day, but also a Sunday.
Supermarkets frequently stay open until 10Â p.m. on weekdays, and sometimes even round the clock.
The threat of job losses and the shaky state of our economies make it hard to know whether one should support employer or employee groups, the positions of which are inherently opposed.
It is for this reason that I regard MrÂ Cercasâ report and the amendments by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs as a sensible compromise, and one aimed at improving peopleâs overall wellbeing.
On-call time in the workplace should be regarded as working time, and employees should be paid a flat rate for on-call time outside the workplace.
There are certain issues that need to be regulated jointly in the EU, and working time is one of them.
Â Â  Madam President, by saying, today, at first reading, that minimum rules for work are very important for health and safety in the workplace and also for the reconciliation of professional and family life, we are in fact underpinning the 1993 legislation.
I note that some of those who engage in social dialogue have let pass the opportunity to deal with this subject themselves, or else we would not have needed to do it in this House.
Thirdly, I note that there are many myths surrounding this topic, which have culminated in a polemic, even â and I do not wish to conceal this â in my own group.
I would like to explode those myths, one by one.
Firstly, with regard to flexibility, it is claimed that Lisbon and flexibility are no longer compatible with this legislation, but that is not the case, for the reference period for measuring 48 hours has been extended from 4 to 12 months.
Secondly, given that I hear employers talk about the administrative burden, I would question the reason for changing this legislation.
We are only changing in terms of flexibility and also in order to act upon a Court ruling.
Thirdly, as for subsidiarity, at the moment, we are leaving it up to the Member States to decide whether stand-by or rest time during on-call duty must be paid and, if so, how much, and whether allowance is made for them, and, if so, to what extent.
We are leaving this up to the social partners and the Member States to decide, for I think this is up to them.
Finally, I would like to thank MrÂ Cercas and Mr Silva Peneda, who have tried to incorporate respect for the principle of subsidiarity into this document.
Â Â  Madam President, Commissioner, I wish to begin by thanking the rapporteur for the very good job he has done.
In the short time I have, I shall concentrate on one aspect, namely the opt-out.
MrsÂ DeÂ Vits said that this is contrary to the principle of subsidiarity, but that is not the case.
Denmark, Sweden and France, for example, are at liberty to have standards higher than those in this minimum directive.
This is a minimum directive.
Can we do without a minimum directive?
No, we cannot, for a directive of this kind also affects indirectly what may be some countriesâ very significantly higher standards.
If we were to have a situation in which countries began to compete with each other in terms of long working hours, then that would affect the situation in Denmark, Sweden and France.
Because we have free movement of capital, these matters are not unrelated to the principle of subsidiarity.
That is the first thing.
The second concerns our responsibility as legislators.
Does our responsibility stop at our national borders?
Are we only to think about the free movement of companies or are we also to assume some responsibility for employeesâ health?
I believe that we must also assume some responsibility for employeesâ health, and we therefore need a minimum directive.
Thirdly, we often talk about the need to reconcile family life and working life, but what is to become of this if we permit long working periods?
It would lead to a situation in which it were men who worked and did not assume responsibility for their families, and then we should not obtain an equal society.
That is why we need this proposal by the rapporteur.
Â Â  Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I congratulate the rapporteur on the work he has carried out and on the conclusions reached in the vote of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
My congratulations are not just a formality, as from the very first words of the debate in which we participated, it was made clear to us how difficult it is to manage such a delicate subject.
I will only make reference to a few fundamental issues in my speech: protecting health and safety in the workplace is not merely the legal basis, but the reference that warrants this proposal for a directive.
I fail to see how people can assert that this is a threat to the principle of subsidiarity and to the safeguarding of our various national experiences.
We must bear in mind that the principle of health and safety protection beyond certain limits on working hours constitutes a general safeguard value that demands a foundation of common rules and references for the very definition of the social and economic employment model and the principles from which the European Union must take its inspiration.
Every opportunity for flexible and specific regulation in this area must be defended and it is precisely because of that that I, like other Members, would prefer the fundamental principle to be that of referring back to the solutions adopted by means of collective bargaining in the various countries.
That is, of course, in so far as collective bargaining exists, is effective and guarantees a regulatory foundation that can combine the requirements of flexibility and the specific organisation of working hours by sector with those of health and safety, which must be protected at all costs.
We will wait and see if it will be possible to make progress on this point, also in connection with the Council position.
For the time being, I believe that the solutions adopted in the vote in committee guarantee such conditions, in the same way that they guarantee margins of flexibility thanks to the prospect of extending the reference period to 12 months.
I hope that, on the basis of this work, the positions that may develop in relation to the Councilâs common position will guarantee ever more adequate solutions in the future.
Â Â  Madam President, I would like to remind the House that we really do have to take responsibility for Europeâs social dimension, quite simply because many believe that the accession of the 10Â new Member States will make it a utopia.
A social Europe requires minimum standards, and so we reject the Commissionâs amendments to the Working Time Directive, which suspend these standards and turn the directive into nothing but an arbitrary abstraction.
These amendments involve, among other things, the new-found idea of dividing on-call time into active and inactive working time, with parts of it no longer recognised as working time.
As we see it, time spent on stand-by must continue to be regarded as working time.
Worker protection and the safety of the public must continue to be given priority over economic considerations.
Health workers working shifts of 30 hours or more put patients at risk; I do not think that there is any room for compromise here, and the ruling of the ECJ backs me up in this.
Although I wish to thank the rapporteur for including this crucial sentence in the report, we cannot support the compromises that follow it.
We see here a need for improvements, for we believe that on-call time must continue to be regarded as working time.
Â Â  â This proposal for a directive on working time is one of the most dangerous facets of the attack on workersâ rights.
It jeopardises gains made in the course of a struggle that has lasted more than a hundred years and affects millions of workers and their families.
It is therefore crucial that this Commission proposal be removed and another drawn up that completely scraps the opt-out, rejects the classification of inactive time, abides by the rulings made by the Court of Justice, helps people to reconcile working life and family life and protects workersâ health and safety.
We also wish to stress the need to reduce the working week to 42 hours and not to increase it from 48 to 65 or more.
What Europe needs to do is to set an example when it comes to protecting rights, and not to veer towards Asian standards in the name of flexibility and competition.
Â Â  Madam President, the revised Lisbon strategy aims at growth and employment.
Granted, we need to become more flexible and more competitive, but that is precisely what we find in the Cercas report on the Working Time Directive, and in the compromises on which my colleague Mr Silva Peneda and others from our group have worked.
We do not want to put the whole of the EU in a straitjacket; rather, we want a reasonable framework for action that leaves room for national regulations, for example to extend the reference period from four months to one year, provided that the social partners agree to this.
Decisions on possible extensions of the 48-hour week, too, are a matter for them and for collective agreements.
This is a practical expression of what subsidiarity and flexibility are about, but the basis for all this must continue to be the ruling in which the Court of Justice defined on-call time as working time.
I regard the Commission proposal, which draws a distinction between paid active and unpaid inactive working time, as unrealistic.
I can tell Commissioner Å pidla that I, on one occasion, joined the staff of the biggest accident and emergency unit in Hessen for their night shift.
The junior doctors, nurses and ambulance drivers were on call, and extremely actively so.
The short breaks between callouts were not long enough to allow the staff to recharge their batteries.
It is not only in hospitals that workers are entitled to job security and job satisfaction; there is a need for derogations from the directive for fire brigades, including those on airports, for rescue workers and for security workers in environmentally sensitive enterprises.
I have talked to all of them.
Familiar though I am with the hospitalsâ financial worries, they must do what has been done in other sectors and find intelligent ways of reducing costs, improving the coordination of their staffâs callouts and making better use of technical facilities.
Let us not forget the other costs that result when staff are, day in and day out, so stressed out that they run the risk of permanent damage to their health, not to mention the risk of exhausted staff making the wrong diagnosis or giving the wrong treatment.
It is not acceptable that patients should be exposed to such risks.
Â Â  â Madam President, I shall be concentrating on on-call time.
I do so because many Members are wondering why it is that this appears to be a particular problem in Germany, where the owners of hospitals are up in arms against the change proposed by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, just as they once were against the rulings by the ECJ.
So, for the sake of clarification, let me explain that the ECJâs ruling has been implemented in Germany, too, since 2004, when German law began to treat the whole of on-call time as working time, in precisely the same way that Mr Cercasâ report demands.
Secondly, in practice, too, this can be done without too much difficulty, as is demonstrated by a study to which even the German Minister for Health has referred.
I might add that, in Germany, there has been funding available since 2003 for the introduction of much-needed innovative models of working time and for the recruitment of some new doctors.
Even then, there can be problems, but it is for that very reason that our Committee wants the opening clause, which would state that alternative arrangements could be made by collective agreement â and only in an emergency by law â to make allowance for the inactive periods.
The problem is not the European Working Time Directive; the problem is German hospitalsâ aversion to reform.
For example, one German region, while being much smaller than Sweden, has far more hospitals and hospital beds.
The issue with on-call time is the safety of the patients.
Even though staying awake for a period of 24Â hours is equivalent, in terms of its adverse effects, to having a blood-alcohol level of 1 per thousand, doctors often work over 30 hours at a stretch, and that is what must be changed.
Â Â  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, while discussing some aspects of the organisation of working hours, first of all we have to talk about those cases where hired employees support their families from their jobs, and who comprise the majority of the labour market.
A high level of unemployment, in particular in some new Member States, the slow development of new workplaces, reduction of old workplaces in some sectors, for example, in the textile industry, and the fear of people, particularly in the provinces, that they will lose their jobs, enable employers to misuse the possibility of eliminating workplaces, or threatening dismissal if an employee refuses to work overtime.
Work exceeding 48 hours per week can worsen the conditions of employees in all sectors even more, in particular those working in the service sector, creating not only physical, but also moral discomfort, and causing undesirable effects for families and the education of children.
If the necessity for prolongation of the workweek is argued from the point of view of the fear that businesses in the European Union will move to China or other countries, then we should ask ourselves whether one of the essential motives of the establishment of the European Union â the welfare of its citizens â becomes just a catchword, and whether we should seek other means for economic development and competitive abilities.
On the other hand, the proposal of the European Parliament, in respect to employees having several work contracts and to summing up their working time according to each contract, deprives the citizens of those states where salaries are low, in such sectors as the health sector, which employs duty time, of the possibility of ensuring themselves an appropriate standard of living.
Therefore, when adopting the amending directive, I suggest refraining from the âopt-outâ introduction into all sectors and not to sum up the working time in respect to people voluntarily working according to several work contracts, and leave such decisions to the national level.
Â Â  Madam President, if we want to win the European public over to the European project, the EU must not become a self-service store where social and labour law are concerned.
It is because an welfare state is not an option that the opt-out clause must be done away with; this currently permits derogations from the maximum working week, and has already, in the United Kingdom, resulted in 700Â 000 employment contracts that disregard the 48-hour working week.
This is a good compromise, not least because, through the social partnership, it enables the trade unions to intervene.
Let me end by appealing to our friends in the Confederal Group of the European United Left.
In the last Parliament, we voted on the Tobin tax, and would have won the vote if you had voted alongside us.
Watch out, or else your votes this Wednesday might enable the hardline conservatives to get what they want!
Â Â  MadamÂ President, I was expecting to find in this directive what is missing from the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the draft European Constitution: the upwards harmonisation of social rights.
There is no mention of it.
The opposite is true, in fact.
Only employeesâ flexibility has been increased therein.
Whilst the hanged men of Chicago died in 1886 for an eight-hour working day and a 40-hour working week, here we have, at the beginning of the 21st century, the great social innovation of the European Union, which should seek to raise the ceiling on the maximum weekly working time from 48 hours to 65 hours, or indeed above that in the event of individual or collective agreements, with the reference period for calculating the maximum weekly working time increased from four to 12 months.
Generously, periods of compensatory rest at the end of 72 hoursâ work are guaranteed.
One can only acknowledge the social audacity of this text that will most likely make European employers tremble!
To cap it all, the concept of an inactive period of on-call time is being introduced, which is to be excluded from working time, and which completely contradicts the case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Communities.
There is no need for further explanation.
The zealous servants of European employers have toiled well and although they know, like those who will choose to vote in favour of this text âŠ
Â Â  Madam President, I will confine my remarks purely to the issue of the opt-out.
The rapporteur said that the opt-out violates the fundamental principles of the Treaty.
That is simply not true.
The Commission is the guardian of the Treaties; the Commission proposed 10 years ago that the opt-out should exist.
In the review now, 10 years on, the Commission is still proposing that the opt-out should continue to exist.
Mr Hughes said that the issue is about work/life balance.
The rapporteur asserts that people are asking how Europe improves their living conditions.
I do not believe that people are asking that.
People are asking themselves how they can improve their living conditions for themselves.
At the moment, the decision of many millions of them is to use the opt-out.
The issue before us today is: who decides?
Should it be a small group of out-of-touch politicians dictating what makes a better quality of life for the people, or should it be the millions of workers themselves, who currently enjoy the right to choose and who want to continue to decide for themselves?
Many of the new Member States want to make use of the opt-out.
All the social partners except the ETUC want to keep the opt-out.
Small business organisations across the EU have contacted me, pleading that the opt-out be kept.
My good friend MrÂ Silva Peneda says that this report proposes more flexibility and is good for SMEs.
SMEs themselves fundamentally disagree, and they should know.
The issue is: who should decide?
I believe that it should not be for us in this Parliament to decide and to dictate excessive and rigid restrictions on how people choose to spend their lives.
People want more freedom and more flexibility.
We should give that to them and vote against this report.
Â Â  MadamÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I congratulate the rapporteur on his fine work.
We have an important task to complete: building in earnest, alongside an economic Europe, a social Europe.
It is impossible to imagine the economic growth and development of Europe without the crucial contribution of the workers, the safeguarding of their quality of work and the protection of their health in the workplace.
The working time directive is an essential element of a social Europe.
We have to be fully aware that it will be impossible to reach these growth and development objectives, if we choose the âlow roadâ to competitiveness: that based on cost cutting and increased demands on the workforce.
The high road is based on quality and innovation: in that context, human capital is vital and its qualitative contribution must be our objective.
The Cercas report offers a legitimate response to this objective.
The report in question seeks to preserve the fundamental principles of the working time directive, as they are laid down in the European Constitution, on the issue of the reference period, on the opt-out and as regards the Court of Justice ruling relating to the periods of time spent on duty.
The report contains strong support for the introduction of provisions aiming at helping employees to strike a balance between work and family life, and we therefore fully endorse the Cercas report.
Â Â  Madam President, for many Liberal Democrats the opt-out represents an important principle of subsidiarity.
We support measures that protect individuals from exploitation at work.
We are not convinced that it is for the European Union to be the body that imposes unwanted restrictions, that have nothing to do with health and safety, on individuals in every Member State.
We strongly disagree with MrÂ Hughes, of the British Labour Party, that the European Union should lay down the law with regard to the work/life/family balance of people everywhere.
It is not surprising that we have to counter so much Euro-scepticism in Britain when senior Members of this Parliament call for the EU to be allowed to interfere in the lives of individuals to such an extent.
We have a European single market, but that does not overrule the fact that Member States compete against one another.
If the people of one country want greater social protection at the risk of damaging their competitive position, then they should vote for a government that will do that.
In many cases the Liberal Democrats will support them.
But blanket controls imposed on every country by Brussels will limit the freedom of Member States to decide the approach most appropriate for them.
It is excessive and wrong.
It is also condescending for this Parliament to seek to impose restrictions on others, while excluding executives, MEPs and Commissioners.
Speaking for myself, I have never worked less than a 48-hour week and I do not intend to start doing so.
Applying these restrictions rigidly to workers in the tourist industry and the agricultural sector, with their extreme seasonal fluctuations, will simply drive people into the black economy.
That is no way to promote the Lisbon Agenda.
For practical reasons and for reasons of principle, the right to opt out should remain.
Â Â  Madam President, it is good that we have now been given the opportunity to revise the Working Time Directive.
My main focus in the course of this work is to ensure that it is made easier for the Member States to create new jobs.
It is therefore important that flexible solutions be provided and that there is a reduction in detailed regulation and central control by the EU.
Issues relating to working time should, in the first place, be the responsibility of the Member States, each of which should therefore have broad scope for finding its own solution.
Industries too operate differently, and as individuals we also have different needs and desires regarding our working hours.
Issues of working time are an area in which national practice should apply and not matters that should be decided on by the EU.
Unfortunately, there are powerful forces in this Parliament which wish to move in the opposite direction.
They want to curtail the Member Statesâ ability to adjust things to their own traditions and needs.
A single model has to apply for the whole of Europe, meaning that they want to introduce supranationalism where issues of working time are concerned.
They do not want to allow the Member States to be different from one another and are content for all Europeans to want exactly the same things in terms of organising their working time.
Unlike those people, I believe that what is most important in Europe today is to lay sound foundations for creating new jobs.
Unlike them, I have faith that people themselves have a better idea than politicians of what best suits them.
As with so many other issues, it is not the case that one solution is best for everyone.
We are different, and therein lie the charm and the strength of the EU.
We consist of different states with different cultures and traditions.
I want to give each European country the opportunity to retain its distinctive features and to give the Member States the power to decide about the issue of working time.
It is not an issue to be regulated in detail at EU level.
Â Â  MadamÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, no to the 60-hour week, the opt-out must disappear.
It is without any hesitation whatsoever that I endorse the text presented by Mr Cercas.
I will support it first of all by referring to the good sense that demands that we work to live and not the reverse.
Good sense alone will tell us that, with the exception of jobs clearly demanded by those who carry them out, the reality of working 60 hours per week - or worse still, 63 hours with the authorisation granted in 1993 â as is the case in certain countries in the European Union, will pose problems in terms of adapting to oneâs personal, family and social environment in the long run.
In the social field, as in that of politics, progress gives way to compromise.
The desire to extend the practice of 60 or 65 hours of working time is at odds with social progress.
In this regard, the opt-out must disappear.
Â Â  As Members of the European Parliament, it is for us to assume the responsibility for ensuring that the people of Europe have the chance of a good future.
This also involves our protecting their rights as employees and their rights in the workplace.
For this, there must be rules; yes, indeed, but what rules?
How many and how detailed must they be?
The fundamental task must surely be â or so I have heard in this House over and over again in the course of the past year â that we give priority to enabling them to keep their jobs or to enabling them to have jobs in the first place.
We have now been presented with a Working Time Directive that committees of this House have considered â and made worse, not least in terms of the criteria of the Lisbon strategy.
The whole thing boils down to us making more regulations.
Rather than reducing regulation and becoming more flexible, we will end up with the very opposite.
Let me illustrate that by a couple of questions.
Firstly, why is it that we, in Europe, have to specify what it means to be on call?
Must it mean the same thing in every hospital in every town in every country in Europe?
And, if so, why?
It is a fact, though, that there is a difference between what goes on in an accident and emergency department, where people often have to go out in the middle of the night, and the situation in an orthopaedic ward, where, at night, everyone is asleep!
It is not acceptable â it is quite wrong â for these things to be tied to some sort of Procrustesâ bed!
Secondly, why can the extension of working time be governed only by a collective agreement?
Why can an individual employee not conclude an agreement for himself?
Who, in fact, gives us the right to forbid workers to come to agreements for themselves concerning their jobs and the hours that they work?
I know young doctors who would be perfectly willing to work a bit longer in future and to earn a bit more, because they are starting out on life or have just become property-owners.
Do we, in future, seriously want to prohibit them from doing that?
And what right do we have to do so?
Why, too, do we now also want to prescribe in minute detail the hours that family members may work?
Why do we want to prevent family firms from being, in future, as flexible as they always have been in the past?
Different work situations call for different solutions, and if we do not enable people to find them, we will be doing people an injustice and Europe a disservice.
Â Â  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it goes without saying that the biggest challenge we face today in our parliamentary work is the abolition of the opt-out, which â let me tell Mr Davies â has nothing to do with subsidiarity but everything to do with lawlessness and a lack of rights.
However, if we abolish the opt-out, we must find a solution for stand-by times, an increasing number of countries are responding to the Court of Justiceâs rulings by threatening to resort to the opt-out for sectors such as health care and care for the elderly.
It would be unacceptable to us, Commissioner, if stand-by and rest times were to be excluded from working time, for that is the time during which the workers are at their employersâ disposal, and what is more, exclusion of those hours would have major implications not only for the safety and health of workers, but also for patients in hospitals and the elderly in rest homes.
In my view, the solution presented in the Cercas report is an excellent one, treating periods of on-call duty as working time, in accordance with the Court judgments, while proposing that we allow the stand-by and rest times to be calculated differently by collective agreement.
I hope that the whole House will give MrÂ Cercas and his excellent report their backing, and let me say, Commissioner, that I hope that the Commission will change its position.
Â Â  â Madam President, the proposal for a working time directive to be put to the vote is the product of a synthesis of theoretical opinions on the organisation of working time and an effort to strike a compromise between the interests of employers and employees.
An effort is being made to place the actual situation and the needs of each Member State within a general framework, which each partner evaluates from his own point of view and finds uncomfortably narrow and anything but protective of health and safety.
However, the rapporteur, Mr Cercas, who deserves congratulations, and the shadow rapporteur of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, Mr Silva Peneda, and all the members of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality and, above all, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, did their very best, even if their opinions differed, to reconcile the differences.
Thus, the report to be put to the vote and the amendments to it â not the Commission's proposal, MrÂ Papadimoulis â do not accept the extension; they put an end to the derogation from the 8-hour day, they do not accept the Commission's proposal for an upper limit of 65 hours, they safeguard the 48-hour week and, in all events, they propose that conditions of work and safety and the need for free time and lifelong learning be safeguarded.
The Cercas proposal reinstates respect for the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Communities with regard both to working time limitations and on-call time, which is expressly referred to as working time.
It likewise respects the principle of subsidiarity and safeguards social dialogue as a regulatory factor.
Calculating working time on an annual basis is a compromise solution, but it will have consequences, unfortunately, for low-income workers relying on overtime in peak periods.
As regards the issues which concern working women in families, I would comment that the European Commission may have forgotten them, but Parliament is being called on to vote in favour of Amendment 12, which emphasises that employers must take account of the needs of lifelong professional and family life, and Amendment 22 requiring the Commission to submit ....
Â Â  Madam President, Commissioner, the 8-hour working day and the 48-hour working week were enshrined in one of the first conventions adopted by the International Labour Organisation, which was founded in 1919.
This was an acknowledgement of the fact that the health and safety of workers must be protected, and that they must be given time to rest and the chance to raise a family, or in other words to produce more workers.
The Commissionâs proposal does away with all that, however, and cites hypocritical reasons for doing so.
The opt-out clause, which is a disgraceful practice, invalidates everything that the trade union movement has managed to achieve over the past centuries.
If the Cercas report makes provision for the abolishment of this clause, it deserves our support.
Â Â  Colleagues, we are in the middle of a debate and have approximately another eight minutes left, including the Commissionerâs statement.
Please take your conversation outside.
Those of you seated behind Mrs KlaÃ, please ask your colleagues to leave.
That includes Mr Rasmussen and others.
Could the huissiers please escort out of the Chamber those who are leaving the debate.
Please sit down and be quiet for another eight minutes or leave the Chamber.
Â Â  There is no doubt that Europe has managed to establish a social model that is among the best in the world.
We should work to preserve this model.
Nobody is saying that we should not.
The parliamentary report before us goes too far, however, and could create serious problems, especially in Member States that have not yet obtained a certain standard of living.
Why should we remove workersâ right to increased wages, especially in new Member States where people necessarily have to work longer hours in order to increase their incomes?
What are workers who borrowed money from banks in the form of home loans going to do?
It is right to have ever higher social standards.
However, we must understand that we are dealing with reality, not theory.
At a time when we are talking so much about the Lisbon Strategy in order to make our economy grow and to create work, we should not pass laws that are less flexible.
Workers want us to pass laws that create jobs, not to stop them from working more than eight hoursâ overtime per week.
Who are we to take this right away from them?
I would be the first to agree that the working week should be shorter, but only if wages are enough to live on.
Some countries have not yet reached that position.
So let us use common sense.
If there is anyone who abuses the opt out and works an excessive number of hours with risks to health and safety, then let us attack this abuse.
We should not, however, remove workersâ right to choose for themselves whether or not they want to work longer hours.
Â Â  Madam President, if the Lisbon Strategyâs objectives are to be met, the social and employment situation in Europe needs to be improved.
The opt-out from the 48-hour week must finally be removed.
No country should be exempt from the rules governing working time and thus have a labour market in which employees are exposed to impossible and exhaustingly long working weeks.
The opt-out makes no contribution to a social Europe.
It opens the way to social dumping, whereby countries can pick and choose which rules they want to follow.
That is not the way forward for Europe.
We cannot and must not compete in terms of either low wages or long working days.
Europeâs populations must feel that the European Union has their interests at heart.
All studies clearly show that long working weeks are harmful to both safety and health.
A 48-hour working week which had better definitions of working time and recreational time and which called on companies to take account of workersâ family lives, would increase employeesâ options.
By voting in favour of the committeeâs report, we shall show the people of Europe that we want a social and just Europe.
Â Â  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in order to revive the Lisbon process, the Barroso Commission has publicly committed itself to cutting through red tape and to deregulation, and this House must support it in this endeavour.
Tomorrow, we will be able to take a step in the right direction by voting in favour of a flexible, modern and forward-looking revision of the Working Time Directive.
A European directive must, by definition, allow the Member States the creative space and flexibility to apply it in their own way, and so our main objective, at European level, must be only to set out the guiding principles.
If what the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has proposed is accepted, that is, if the whole of the time spent on call is, in principle, to be treated as working time, and if the opt-out is to be abolished, then this will represent a considerable hindrance to flexible working arrangements throughout Europe.
This is not what I would regard as a modern solution.
It cannot be fair that we should set down as applicable to the workers concerned the principle that time spent on call is seen in its entirety as working time, for there is no likelihood of, for example, fire-fighters, youth workers and staff in rehabilitation centres over-exerting themselves, as being on call in these involves being inactive for most of the time.
It is for that reason that we advocate the drawing of distinctions between different types of on-call service.
Let the hospitals, the doctors, the fire services and the youth workers, together with the local social partners, decide among themselves what working arrangements are right for them.
Let us vote to give workers freedom of choice.
Let us opt for flexibility, which requires the opt-out, longer reference periods and reasonable and appropriate differentiation between different types of standby duty.
It is for these that we are aiming with our Amendments 26, 27 and 32, along with Amendments 29 and 30 on on-call services, and these I ask you to support.
Â Â  Madam President, reviewing the directive takes more than a simple legal step.
As we know, it is in the workplace where law and practice differ the most.
The more means a country needs to mobilise in order to catch up, the larger the gap becomes between rules and reality.
In the new Member States, the length of working time is just barely above the European average, but the actual number of hours worked annually is 112 more, almost three weeks more, than in the existing States.
It is therefore especially important for us to set clear limits for working time.
Consistent participation of social partners in the creation of local rules is important, and so is the improvement of monitoring mechanisms on both a Community and Member State level.
Parliamentâs compromise proposal promises that the role of trade unions will become more important, the individual will not be left alone and that by monitoring Member State compliance with guarantees, it will establish consistent practice in the labour market.
Â Â  . Madam President, honourable Members, although the Commission is unable to agree with Parliament on all counts, the report by Parliamentâs Committee on Employment and Social Affairs makes it quite clear that we share the same desire to seek a broad consensus that would both protect workers and help achieve the necessary flexibility.
Before I focus on the individual amendments in more detail, I should like to make a number of more general comments.
Firstly, I would note that this proposal for a directive is a proposal for an amending directive.
The original directive, which has already been in force for 10Â years, needs to be amended from time to time, not least because provision is made in the directive itself for future amendments.
Furthermore, I should like to emphasise that this is a directive that relates to safety and health at work.
Its aim is therefore not to reorganise working time, but to protect workers, at the same time as maintaining the much-needed flexibility demanded by the Lisbon Strategy, and indeed by modern life itself.
The issues that form the backdrop to this directive are extremely complex.
They include the ageing of the population, which is something that calls for a much better balance between working life and social life.
As I have already highlighted, the directive relates to the protection of working time.
I have no hesitation in stating that working time has an overall influence on safety and health at work.
Consideration is currently being given to an extension of working lives as a result of demographic developments in society, and there can be no question that people need to reach the end of these working lives in good health.
The debate we have just heard covered a number of key proposals, which I should like to deal with in more detail.
I shall begin with the proposal for an extension of the reference period for calculating the maximum average working week of 48Â hours.
As you will be aware, the Commission is proposing that matters should be left as they stand, or in other words that the âstandardâ reference period should continue to be four months, with the option of extending it to twelve months by means of collective agreements.
The Commission wishes to ensure that the same conditions apply in all Member States, irrespective of the way in which relations between social partners are organised, and I would therefore propose that it should also be possible to extend this reference period by means of legislation.
I am glad to see that Parliamentâs position does not differ greatly from that of the Commission on this matter, and in fact Parliamentâs proposal offers a better guarantee that this extension will be possible.
I am therefore able to tell you that the Commission can accept almost all of Parliamentâs proposals in this respect, with the exception of that stating that the reference period may only be extended by means of legislation if the worker in question is already covered by collective agreements.
The Commission does not believe that collective agreements should be favoured to the extent that the use of legislation is denied in instances where either the reference period has not been discussed or no agreement has been reached.
The Commission cannot accept Parliamentâs position with regard to on-call periods, although it does appreciate Parliamentâs concerns.
I should like to make our views on this issue quite clear.
The basic aim of the Commissionâs proposal is to provide a guarantee of legal certainty, and I am sure I do not need to remind you that this problem has arisen as a result of the way in which the Luxembourg Court of Justice has interpreted the concept of âworking timeâ.
The Commission has chosen not to regard âinactive on-call timeâ as working time for safety and health at work purposes, in order to leave the Member States free to take the measures they believe will best protect workersâ safety and health.
I do not believe that Parliamentâs proposal, as set out in Amendment 10, would provide the same level of legal certainty, and it could well leave the door open for further judgments that would lead to even greater legal uncertainty.
I do, however, fully appreciate Parliamentâs concerns, which it has outlined in the draft report.
The Commission will therefore amend its proposal in such a way as to ensure that on-call workers are better protected.
The inclusion of inactive on-call time in the daily rest period of 11Â hours and the weekly rest period of 24Â hours will not be permitted.
I should now like to say a few words on the delicate issue of individual opt-outs.
Although both Parliament and the Commission are critical of the practical implementation of this provision, the two institutions hold differing views on its future.
The Commission is proposing that the issue be reviewed, whilst Parliament is calling for the opt-out clause to be abolished three years after the directive comes into force.
The Commission cannot accept this proposal as it stands.
It is, however, willing to discuss it, and to work together with legislators, who are themselves divided on the issue, in order to find the best possible compromise.
I am aware that this is a very political issue, and also a matter of principle.
In view of this, the Commission will continue to engage in intensive dialogue with Parliament.
I should now like to outline the Commissionâs position on the individual amendments.
The Commission can accept Amendments 2, 3, 12, 13 and 17 in full, as they either improve the text of the proposal or make it clearer.
One of them introduces a provision regarding improvements to work-life balance, which I regard as a key issue.
The Commission can accept Amendments 1, 4, 8, 11, 16, 18, 19, 24 and 29 either in principle, in part or on the condition that they are reworded.
In particular, I should like to draw the Houseâs attention to Amendments 16 and 18, on compensatory rest, and Amendment 19, on the reference period.
The Commission is unable to accept Amendments 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 14, 15, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25 to 28 and 30 to 52, some of which relate to the individual opt-out that I have already discussed.
As I said before, the Commission intends to seek a compromise solution to this issue.
The remaining amendments deal with matters not covered in the Commissionâs original proposal, for example ArticleÂ 17(1) on the derogation for managing executives.
In conclusion, I should like to thank Parliament for the high quality of the debate that has been held on this proposal.
The dialogue between the Commission and Parliament has made it possible for me to state with confidence that the directive which we now have, and which serves as a symbol of a social Europe, does even more to protect the health and safety of workers, whilst ensuring that the latter are not jeopardised by the flexible organisation of working time called for by our entrepreneurs.
It therefore helps to build a stronger and more modern European social model.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner.
Thank you also for being patient with this House and for speaking under more difficult conditions than usual.
Mr Davies, is your point of order really necessary, considering that the vote is about to begin?
Â Â  Madam President, Members of this Parliament were asked to vote here at 11.30 a.m.
It is not their fault that their time has been wasted: it is that of the Presidency.
It is not your fault, you are not responsible for every detail, but when is the Presidency going to start timetabling debates properly?
Â Â  Mr Davies, we will take note of that in the Bureau, but it is also the fault of the House itself.
I had to keep calling the House to order to give the speakers some quiet in which to speak.
It is also the fault of certain political groups, because one-minute speeches never last for one minute, they always overrun.
That can be dealt with in the Conference of Presidents.
I would be happy to abolish one-minute speaking time slots in favour of two minutes.
We can discuss the matter but we have to agree on it.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be tomorrow.
Â Â  â The next item is voting time.
Â Â  . Mr President, this report was not controversial in committee: it was accepted unanimously and without amendment.
Therefore, you may wonder why I seek to comment on it now.
That fact should not be allowed to obscure what was a very comprehensive piece of work by the Commission, making sense of a 25-year-old document that had undergone multiple revisions.
It has been recast into a document of some 300 articles, which is now comprehensible and which can, therefore, be better implemented.
Nothing in this requires any change of legislation in any Member State.
However, it makes sure that all the accession treaty additions etc. are incorporated into one document, which is useful.
As an individual who has frequently been critical of the European Commission, it is reasonable on this occasion to record our gratitude and to compliment the Commission officials who have undertaken this task and done it extremely well.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, whilst regretting the result of the vote, the Commission has taken due note of the position expressed by the majority of Members.
In line with the framework agreement that exists between Parliament and the Commission, the point will be raised within the Commission, with a view to very carefully examining its position in these circumstances.
MrÂ President, the Commission will shortly, and in an appropriate manner, inform Parliament of the results of these considerations.
Â Â  â The report is referred back to committee in accordance with Rule 52(3) of the Rules of Procedure.
Voting is suspended and will continue after the formal sitting.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, we shall begin our sitting dedicated to the official visit of the President of Afghanistan, Mr Hamid Karzai.
, which means that we welcome President Karzai to the European Parliament.
Mr President, this Parliament, like the rest of the world, has followed very closely the dramatic events in your country over the last quarter of a century.
Few countries have had such a turbulent history as yours: the Soviet occupation, the civil war, the international military intervention following the attacks of 11 September and now the difficult process of transition to democracy in a country which has suffered so much and which has seen its social, economic and political structures profoundly transformed.
Mr President, we wish to acknowledge your solid leadership, which is helping to develop this embryonic democracy, initially in a provisional capacity and now as democratically elected President of Afghanistan.
We also acknowledge the great personal risks you and your colleagues in government have faced.
We are all aware that there is a long way to go.
Sometimes the television cameras bring us harrowing images to remind us what is happening, but sometimes there are no cameras there.
The reality remains however; the conscientious, slow and methodical reconstruction of a country devastated by decades of war is not as attractive to the media as the war itself.
We in the Western world understand the importance of the impact of the big event when compared to everyday lives and events, which are only of importance when the media record them in a striking manner.
We also know that democracy cannot be consolidated overnight, that societies cannot be changed by decree, that it is one thing to guarantee the rights of women in a constitution, for example, but that it is quite another to ensure that these rights are respected in the remotest parts of the country.
We are also aware of your commitment to equal rights for women, but you will also understand that, when specific events revive our consciences, concern arises.
Let us hope to use the indignation this causes to increase our commitment to the task of democratic reform and progress in your country.
I am sure that you too will mention this in your speech.
We wish to offer you our commitment to this difficult process of transition.
We will do everything we can to help you to create a stable and democratic country.
This House, therefore, Mr President, is keenly awaiting the Parliamentary elections of next September and, as we have mentioned to you previously, this Parliament should seriously consider the possibility of sending a delegation to assess the current situation before the elections take place and then to send observers to monitor them on the ground.
We trust, Mr President, that, following the elections, we will be able to develop close interparliamentary relations, precisely because we believe that the European Union and Afghanistan will make their great potential for friendship and cooperation a reality.
For all of these reasons and in view of the importance of the country you represent, it is a pleasure for me and an honour for this Parliament to welcome you and offer you the floor.
Â Â  . Mr President, honourable Members of the European Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted and honoured to address this distinguished gathering, particularly as this is my first visit to the European Parliament.
It gives me great confidence for the future of Afghanistan and our region to see the countries of Europe come together here in a spirit of unity and cooperation.
It was not long ago that the Iron Curtain divided Europe into West and East.
Yet, today, that curtain has been removed to reveal a mosaic, where each piece retains a distinct identity, but together form a greater entity.
Two days ago, Europe celebrated the 60th anniversary of the Victory in Europe day, the anniversary of Europeâs new beginning.
While in the past, European conflicts had global implications, today European cooperation is improving lives and is a source of admiration across the world.
As you rebuilt after the Second World War, you had security guarantees, the Marshall Plan, and an international long-term commitment.
We, the people of Afghanistan, are also grateful for the international security and economic support we have received over the last three years.
The European Union, in particular, has been one of the largest supporters of Afghanistan.
We are grateful for your generous contributions, the commitment of troops from your nations, and the technical assistance you have provided and continue to provide.
Most importantly, you show us what our regionâs future could be: a future of peace, a future of unity, and a future of cooperation.
Afghanistan was one of the least-developed countries, even before its invasion by the former Soviet Union.
Ten years of fighting the Soviet invasion, followed by more than a decade of foreign interference and factional conflict, further impoverished our country.
Our infrastructure was almost totally destroyed, our communities devastated and our state institutions crippled.
The long and dark years of suffering, however, did not dampen our aspirations to build a stable, democratic and prosperous Afghanistan.
Given that opportunity in 2001, the people of Afghanistan enthusiastically began the process of rebuilding our country.
Today, we have an enlightened and progressive constitution which safeguards human rights, guaranteeing the equality of men and women, provides for a free-market economy and creates a framework for responsible government.
The first presidential election in our history was held last October in which more than eight million people participated.
The success of the election graphically illustrated the defeat of terrorism in Afghanistan.
In particular, the massive participation by the women of Afghanistan, 42% of the national turnout, demonstrated emphatically that a new era of social and political rights for women had arrived.
Here, I would like to narrate a story to you that I witnessed about two and a half months ago.
Two and a half months ago, I was having lunch with a group of tribal elders from a very conservative part of Afghanistan, and I noticed that with these tribal elders and clergy there were women.
I felt as if the women were from the urban parts of the country, and I greeted the tribal chiefs by name.
I knew many of them by name, and I said: âMr so-and-so welcome and how are you?â.
When I had finished greeting the men, I said to the ladies: âWelcome and good to see youâ.
Suddenly one of the ladies got up and said: âMr President, you greeted the men by name. You did not greet us by nameâ.
I was shocked.
I said: âWell, madam, I am sorry I did not know your nameâ.
She said: âYou know, you are elected because of our vote.
Next time I see you, you had better know my name or you will not be elected!â.
That is the change in Afghanistan for which we are very happy.
The presence of the International Security Assistance Force, led by Europe from the beginning, has provided us with a secure environment to exercise our political rights.
With help from Europe and others in the international community, we have trained a new police force of some 50Â 000, along with a special force to conduct counter-narcotics operations.
The new Afghan National Army, currently 20Â 000 strong, is increasingly taking responsibility for supporting security across the country.
We are accelerating the disarmament process, disarming both regular armed forces and armed groups.
More than 50 000 former combatants have been disarmed, and over 95% of the heavy weaponry has been cantoned.
Extensive reforms are also under way in other sectors, including the judiciary and the civil service â the administration.
Our judicial system is recovering in effectiveness and credibility from the damages of war.
Institutions of government and civil society are gaining increasingly in strength, giving the citizens more confidence, more services and more rights to enjoy.
The Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission continues the important work of promoting human rights throughout the country.
Thanks to the open political atmosphere in Afghanistan, the free press has enjoyed great development and success, as demonstrated by the publication of more than 300 independent papers, more than 30 independent radio stations and four independent television channels in less than two years.
We realised that political and security developments can be sustained only with corresponding improvements in the economic area.
Over the last three years, we have introduced a new currency, stabilised inflation and enacted numerous legal and administrative reforms to simplify our customs and investment processes.
As a result, hundreds of millions of dollars in international investment have flowed into Afghanistan.
Certain industries, such as the hospitality sector, banks and mobile communications, have particularly benefited.
Wages have increased, as has trade and commerce with countries of the region, notably Pakistan, Iran, Tajikistan, China and beyond.
I should like to give an example here of the changes that have occurred.
Three years ago, Afghanistanâs trade with Pakistan was less than USD 50 million.
Last year, this trade â in less than three years â surpassed USD 1 billion.
Today, trade between Pakistan and Afghanistan amounts to USD 1Â billion. The same applies to China and other countries around us.
Much has been done so far, but daunting challenges remain ahead of us.
Afghanistanâs social development indicators are still dismal: we have one of the infant mortality rates and one of the life expectancy rates in the world; and we have unacceptable levels of illiteracy, particularly among women.
Sadly, these social indicators place our country close to the bottom of the human development index: in fact, fifth from the bottom.
Terrorism has been defeated as a force, but its residues disturb our peace and tranquillity. While critical steps to establish an effective government have been taken, the ability of the new institutions to provide security and help lift the population out of extreme poverty is far from adequate.
Poppy cultivation and the drug economy are still afflicting our communities and remain obstacles to Afghanistanâs stability.
I wish to depart from my prepared speech to explain to you what is happening in Afghanistan with regard to the drug economy â the cultivation of poppies.
Thirty years ago, when the former Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, Afghanistan was a somewhat well-to-do agrarian society.
In the years of conflict, drought and difficulties for the Afghan people, Afghan men and women â families, fathers, mothers, daughters â had no hope for the future.
A father, a mother did not know whether their son or daughter would be alive or dead the next day; whether they would have food to eat or be hungry.
In that situation, people destroyed vineyards and replaced them with poppies; people destroyed pomegranate orchards and replaced them with poppies; people destroyed apricot orchards and replaced them with poppies, because poppies were easy to grow â there was not much need for irrigation â and easy to sell.
Therefore, because of a lack of confidence in the future and a lack of means, society became involved in that easy crop.
Last year, we began action against poppy cultivation, and the people responded because they have more hope for the future: they have more confidence in their country and in themselves.
We hope that there will be a considerable reduction in poppy cultivation this year in Afghanistan, a great part of it voluntarily.
My hope, and that of the Afghan people, is that the international community will continue to assist us in decreasing poppy cultivation in Afghanistan and to replace it with legitimate forms of agriculture.
In other words, to replace it with alternative forms of livelihood, so that our people can return to growing vines, pomegranates, apricots and the other agricultural products which Afghanistan is very good at cultivating.
Afghanistan produces the best pomegranates, the best foods; it can compete in international markets.
Please continue to help us bring a legitimate economy to the Afghan people again.
Nobody wants to have a bad name in the world, and Afghanistan is no exception.
Afghanistan wants to live an honourable life, a life where it can return to generating its own legitimate income.
I am grateful for what you have done for us so far, but please continue to help us.
Parliamentary elections in September will mark the culmination of the Bonn process in Afghanistan.
The Afghan constitution decrees that at least 27% of members of the Afghan Parliament should be women.
Yet, while we will have met all the benchmarks set out in the Bonn Agreement by the end of September, we will only be at the beginning of a long road towards achieving the vision set out for Afghanistan in that document.
The end of the Bonn process, therefore, must not be the end of your commitment to and support for Afghanistan, but the beginning of a long-term and more comprehensive partnership.
The end of the Bonn process will not mean the success of Afghanistan or the total success of Afghanistan.
The end of the Bonn process, the coming of the parliament, will lay the foundations for the success of Afghanistan but not constitute success itself.
Success itself will take many more years to come, and for that your help is needed.
From Europe, we need support and the assurance that Afghanistan will continue to receive assistance in a sustainable manner.
In particular, as you deliberate here about the European Unionâs future international commitments, I hope you will see the need for multi-year pledges of aid to Afghanistan to support our efforts at rebuilding our country.
We also need the United Nations, the United States, Japan and others who have assisted us so far to reaffirm their commitment to partnership with Afghanistan: a partnership that is essential if Afghanistan is to achieve lasting stability, democratisation and development.
Allow me to take this opportunity to thank you once again, on behalf of the Afghan people, for the generous support that the European Union, as one of the largest donors to Afghanistan, has provided over the last three years.
The people of Afghanistan are especially grateful to your sons and daughters in uniform who are serving courageously in our country.
To those who have given their lives to provide us with security, we offer once again our gratitude, our prayers and our pledge that we will never forget.
Today in Afghanistan, in a country which, not long ago, was totally isolated from the world, something unprecedented is taking place.
In a true spirit of cooperation, people from all corners of the world, people from different faiths, cultures and backgrounds, are together helping to secure the lives of the Afghan people and rebuild our country.
It is clear that without this cooperation Afghans would never have accomplished what we have accomplished over the past three years.
Afghanistan is as much in need of your help today as Europe was 60Â years ago.
Then, a long-term commitment from your friends around the world gave you the support you needed to rebuild your countries, your lives.
Today, we are asking for that same opportunity.
Thank you for what you have done so far for us.
We are very grateful.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I have asked to speak in order to draw attention to the content of Rule 9 on standards of behaviour and the code of conduct of this Parliament, since today, in this House, flags have appeared of a nation that does not exist â Padania, as it is described by MrÂ Borghezio.
I should like to denounce this act, which offends my country, Italy, a country that I am proud to represent, and I question whether the Presidency intends to take action against this offence caused to one of the Member States with the presence in this Parliament of flags belonging to a state or nation that does not exist and that is not recognised within any of the international organisations.
I hope that all Italian Members will join me in denouncing this affront to our country.
Â Â  Mr President, following President Karzaiâs powerful speech, for which our President did not feel obliged to thank him, I would like to thank him for addressing this House.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I intervene only to point out to every Member of this Parliament â including the Member who has just spoken â that up until the fall of the Berlin Wall there were many nations without statehood in Europe, and that one day the right to self-determination will allow Padania to also become a nation with its own state.
Â Â  â The Bureau is examining the issue and will certainly take a decision on the matter.
Â Â  . I am sorry to steal two minutes from your lunchtime, colleagues, but I have to table an oral amendment.
This is one of the first reports by a new Member from a new Member State.
I would like to say thank you for the help I was given in this job.
My special thanks go to French colleagues, from different political groups, who were very active in helping me.
Just before the French referendum it is important to understand the important and frontline role of France in preserving and saving the common cultural heritage of Europe.
They can be proud of their country.
My aim was to reach a first reading agreement and the Luxembourg presidency was very positive and active in this respect.
If Members adopt my amendments co-tabled by the Liberals and the PPE-DE shadow rapporteurs, there will be a first reading agreement in May in the Council of Ministers.
I have one oral amendment to amendment 59.
There are two extra words: âwithin two years of the adoption of this recommendation, legislative, administrativeâ â and now comes the oral amendment â âor other appropriate measures ...â
Thank you for your help and understanding.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I was going to take the floor to inform you that I had withdrawn Amendment 12; however, it lapses like Amendment 10, because they have in fact already been accepted by Parliament and the Commission.
On the other hand, I uphold Amendment 11, which refers to checks against drug trafficking, the counterfeiting of goods and above all against illegal immigration.
Â Â  We support in principle a closer association of Croatia, Serbia-Montenegro, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia and Albania with the EU.
Once these countries have complied fully with the Copenhagen criteria, they should become Members.
That would be a natural consequence of the enlargement begun in May 2004.
The EUâs Framework Agreements, designed to prepare the countries for membership, must concentrate on improving state administration, strengthening the judicial systems and combating corruption.
The countries concerned must not be acclimatised to the EUâs costly and damaging agricultural policy.
EU enlargement must not become an excuse for failing to reform and, in time, abolish the common agricultural policy.
An enlarged EU with up to 35 Member States requires a comprehensive reform of agricultural policy.
Â Â  .
I voted in favour of this report because I feel that the framework agreements in question form part, on a broader scale, of what should be the European policy on cooperation with its neighbouring countries, including these countries, whose recent past and future prospects justify support from, and close cooperation with, the Europe of 25.
Â Â  If Croatia, Serbia-Montenegro, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia and Albania ever in the future fulfil all the criteria for membership of the EU, they should be welcomed as Members.
The European Parliament should not, however, adopt a position on a Framework Agreement before there is a clear basis for the financial commitments to be provided by such an agreement to other Member States.
The document concerned should also show what types of aid and entitlements a Framework Agreement would entail.
Experience of previous Framework Agreements shows that a âyesâ vote creates political pressure from then on to support every conceivable form of aid and subsidy.
Up until now, it has often been a question of getting countries used to an EU system that should be reformed.
Various forms of aid for adaptation to, for example, the EUâs agricultural system is just one example.
Neither the EU nor potential Member States are helped in the long run by adaptation to a system that creates dependence upon subsidies.
I have therefore voted against the report and hope that the Commission will come back with a financial calculation and a basic document that clearly defines what forms of aid would be made available once a Framework Agreement had been signed.
Â Â  . By enhancing and harmonising the statistical tools used by the EU, we will be in a position to gain a better understanding of the social reality in the EU Member States and will consequently, in principle, be able to assist the Council and the Commission in the fight against poverty and social exclusion.
At the moment, any information on social exclusion is scarce, is supplied late, is not disaggregated and does not cover gender, as I have proposed.
We therefore hope that the Commission will bring in more, better and quicker indicators, so that we can gain a better understanding of the situation.
In so doing, we can take effective and timely action, because the EU and the Member States must provide structural responses, as a matter of urgency, to remedy an appalling situation in which there are almost 70Â million people live in poverty, and there is enormous economic inequality and high unemployment.
Â Â  We have voted in favour of this reportâs proposal that the EU (EC) accede to this international convention.
In general, we are sceptical about the EU as such acceding to international conventions, but, because intergovernmental organisations are able to accede to this convention and because we also believe that the EUâs accession would improve the internal market in this area, we are voting in favour of the report.
Â Â  .
The fact that the EU has signed up to the International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants (UPOV) is a positive step towards striking the right balance between the interests of breeders and farmers in terms of reasonable protection of breedersâ property rights regarding new varieties of plants.
For this reason, and because I feel that Portuguese interests are thus protected, I shall be voting in favour.
Â Â  .
There is across-the-board agreement on this report, given the need to prolong the transitional measures until a full package of measures for tackling BSE is in place.
We therefore agree with the rapporteurâs proposal to split the proposal for a regulation into two.
Firstly, the report proposes amending Regulation (EC) No 999/2001, to extend the transitional measures further until 1Â JulyÂ 2007, in order to give time for the debate needed on the two measures.
Then it calls for a new regulation to be drawn up, encompassing the amendments to the content of Regulation (EC) No 999/2001, in other words, the amendments to the rules for the prevention, control and eradication of certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, given that such amendments require in-depth knowledge of the situation as it stands, the progress made in categorising countries, scientific progress and a thorough-going debate on the revision of the regulation in question.
Â Â  .
We voted in favour of the report concluding the agreement between the EC and Switzerland on the latterâs participation in the European Environment Agency (EEA) and the European Environment Information and Observation Network.
The objective of the agreement and Swiss participation is to provide objective, reliable and comparable information on the environment.
Switzerland will be granted the status of non-voting observer, will be treated equally as regards the supply of environmental data, information and analysis, and will establish an infrastructure for providing uniform data on the state of the environment.
This agreement will facilitate and tighten up the provision of reliable and comparable information on the state of the environment in Europe.
It will also support integrated assessment and environmental reporting of the ecosystems that are shared by Switzerland and its neighbouring countries.
Â Â  .
The situation of the EU, its Member States and Switzerland, in terms of geography, economic importance and the relations established in various fields, justifies â indeed, demands â Switzerlandâs participation in the European Environment Agency.
In this context, as in others, dealing with practical reality cuts across geopolitical borders.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen,
We have voted against Mr Hudghtonâs report on the recasting of the multiple VAT directives because it is in fact only a recast, without fundamental changes, of texts whose standardising principles and principles in contempt of the Member Statesâ fiscal autonomy we rejected at the time.
Within this text, we see no freedom for States to freely set the taxation of purely localised activities, such as catering, which have no bearing on European competition.
We see no permanency for applying reduced VAT rates to labour.
On the other hand, we note that States will still have to beg Brussels in order to change their VAT rates.
We note that they are still not free to choose the sector or the products subject to a given tax.
We note above all that the announcement made, three weeks from the French referendum, to lower VAT in the catering sector is a final, pathetic attempt to buy the French vote.
Nothing has been done, nothing has been decided.
Enough of these lies and false promises.
Â Â  .
Given that there are no substantial amendments to the VAT system established in the Sixth Directive, which has undergone a number of amendments, I voted in favour.
I shall continue, however, to express my opinion on the various areas that fall under the scheme, when the moment arises in discussions on such matters.
Â Â  .
This report rejects the Commissionâs proposal as regards cofinancing for market support measures in the case of outbreaks of infectious diseases such as foot and mouth and classical swine fever.
In this respect, I agree wholeheartedly with the rapporteur and the proposals that he has made.
Where we differ, however, is on his reasons for rejecting the Commissionâs proposal; for example, the report mentions the potential negative impact of the proposal for the common agricultural policy, and for competition conditions in European agriculture.
Whilst this is true, it is not the main reason to vote against the Commissionâs proposal.
In addition to providing support to farmers in the event of outbreaks of infectious diseases, in the form of practical, financial measures to establish a level playing field in the market for farmers from all Member States, the EU must also take action to prevent such diseases, by means of support for farmers, particularly those with fewer resources.
It is well known that we are opposed to the reform of the common agricultural policy and to the measures proposed, given the impact on Portuguese agriculture, and especially on small and medium-sized farms and family farms.
Â Â  The EUâs task is to solve cross-border problems.
One of these is the spread of infectious veterinary diseases.
We are therefore voting in favour of the report.
Combating the spread of infectious veterinary diseases within the framework of the EU is no reason, however, for continuing to conduct a costly and damaging common agricultural policy (CAP).
We believe that responsibility for financing the CAP should be nationalised.
Â Â  .
The report rightly points out that the Commissionâs proposal will not only lead to inequality in agriculture, but also appears to form part of a broader question on the nationalisation of the common agricultural policy, on which the debate is far from over.
The right decision is therefore to reject the Commissionâs proposal and to call on it to table a new one.
Â Â  . Fianna Fail and the UEN Group today do not support amendments regarding:-
(a) The deletion of a new âsufficientâ classification introduced and agreed upon in the Council during the Irish Presidency in June 2004 in Annex I
and
(b) The erasing of the distinction between inland and coastal waters, again agreed upon in Council by the Irish Presidency.
Under the existing Directive of 1976 (76/160/EEC), the majority of Member States support the âsufficientâ classification as this classification establishes realistic, enforceable standards with a minimum legally binding requirement that will apply to all bathing waters in all Member States.
In addition, I feel that it will serve as a stepping stone and strong incentive to work towards achievement of the âgoodâ or âexcellentâ classification.
With regard to classifications for coastal waters, we support the distinction between it and fresh waters, as coastal waters have lower permissible levels of contamination than those for inland waters.
Â Â  I welcome this Report and the rules for the monitoring and classification of bathing water quality.
We cannot afford any weakening of quality standards.
I support the Environment Committee's rejection of the proposed quality category being âsufficientâ rather than proper.
I also reject any lowering of quality standards for inland waters compared to coastal waters.
Ireland achieves about 98% compliance with the current Directive, but it is clear that not enough is being done to ensure proper standards in water quality, and environmental standards generally.
Last month's ruling of the ECJ that Ireland is in breach of the EU's main waste management directive represented a damning indictment of the Governmentâs environmental record.
The Commission has also confirmed that Ireland has yet to report on the implementation of European Landfill legislation for the years 2001-03, and the Commission is now considering launching more infringement proceedings.
From this shabby performance we have more than enough evidence that standards of environmental controls are far from good enough and I hope today's adoption of the MAATEN report leads to further pressure for improvement.
Â Â  .
The undersigned Members voted against Amendment 27 of the Maaten report on the quality of bathing water, because, according to epidemiological studies, there are differences between coastal and inland waters.
According to those studies, the dangers of faecal contamination to children (the most vulnerable group) are caused by various bacteria.
It therefore makes complete sense to maintain the difference between coastal and inland waters, which is in fact what the Council had proposed.
The undersigned Members voted against Amendments 5, 7, 8, 12 and 32 because they are in favour of the existence of the âsufficientâ category for classifying bathing water.
This âsufficientâ classification would make it possible to assess a stretch of bathing waters on a gradual, rolling basis.
Accordingly, if those waters comply with the directive, they would have the opportunity to be promoted to âgoodâ and âexcellentâ levels.
Â Â  .
Broadly speaking, we welcome the amendments tabled by the rapporteur to the directive on managing bathing waters.
