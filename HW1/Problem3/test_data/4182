Â Â  â Mr President, it is clear that the increasing mobility of Europeans, tourism and, let us face it, bathing habits, mean that the beaches of Europe, the beaches of my country, Spain, which 50 years ago were half empty, have now filled up.
Not only with tourists, either: the local people also bathe on their beaches, something they did not do 50 years ago.
All of this means that the citizens of Europe aspire to having the same quality of bathing water, regardless of the country or location they are swimming in.
I therefore believe that the Commission is right to propose â and of I believe it is extremely timely â this greater control of bathing waters, better information for users and also improvements in the quality of those waters in cases where it is advisable or necessary.
The relationship between risks of various infections and water quality has been demonstrated beyond all doubt.
If, therefore, by means of this directive we can contribute to reducing the risk of contracting infections or other types of illness, our efforts will have been worthwhile.
Having said this, however, I believe that here also we must apply a cost-benefit analysis and not try to use a sledgehammer to crack nuts.
In this regard, there are certain aspects of certain amendments to this directive which I believe to be entirely out of context and unnecessary.
One of them is the issue of physical and chemical parameters: they are not important in terms of water quality; only microbiological parameters are important.
The rest is an aesthetic issue, but not a health issue.
Introducing these parameters would enormously complicate the application of the directive and, furthermore, would make the framework directive which already deals with these issues redundant.
With regard to information, I believe it is absurd and unacceptable to indicate the specific languages in which the information must be provided.
I believe that each Member State will indicate the language or languages appropriate for this purpose.
Finally, on another issue which has been debated, in relation to parameters, I entirely agree with the use of those parameters indicated by the WHO and I fully support my groupâs position.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, the proposal for the new bathing water directive that we are now discussing unfortunately has the same fundamental defect as the previous directive, namely a very vague definition of what is meant by bathing water.
One consequence of this has so far been that the Commission has been able to come up with its own interpretation of the concept, âa large number of bathersâ.
It is thus unsatisfactory in terms of legal certainty for the new directive not to contain simple and clear information, either.
It is also noteworthy that the directive does not take any account of the extremely varied conditions that apply in different Member States.
In Sweden, we have, for example, 1932 miles of coast and 95Â 700 lakes with a surface area in excess of one hectare.
Furthermore, we have the legal right of access to private land, which in principle means that everyone residing in our country has access to these bathing waters.
Support for AmendmentÂ NoÂ 76 means yes to a simple, clear and, so too, legally certain definition.
Nor should there be a negative effect upon Member States with basic conditions different from those in the countries of northern Europe.
It should thus be possible to apply the directive throughout the EU.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I should like to make some comments on the amendments tabled.
First of all, I thank Members for their comments, which I read as support for the basic philosophy and structure of the proposal.
Actually, both Parliament and Council also confirmed their support in negotiating the Sixth Environmental Action Programme in 2002.
I also thank Members for not bringing into question the health standards which the Commission has proposed.
The Commission cannot accept narrowing the scope of the directive via Amendments Nos 5 or 76.
What counts is the importance of a bathing site for a local community.
People in northern or non-tourist regions also have the right to bathe in safety.
The Commission therefore disapproves of limiting the scope for bathers to one hundred per day and restricting the scope for watersports to one hundred metres.
Although the Commission appreciates that many MEPs have attempted to improve the integration of the water framework and bathing water directives, the Commission cannot agree with all amendments concerned.
Amendments Nos 3, 4, 16, 21 and 33 are unacceptable because they create redundancy between the two directives.
Good chemical status is already covered by the water framework directive and we do not have to duplicate that.
In some cases, waters can be of excellent quality for bathing without having a good ecological status.
Nevertheless, the Commission accepts in principle Amendment No 32, which extends the bathing water profile by adding elements such as hydrological characteristics in relation to the water framework directive.
However, it must be kept in mind that the scales of both directives are very different.
The water framework directive applies to river basins, whereas the bathing water directive has a very local scope.
The Commission believes that the basis of good bathing water management is found within a well documented and updated bathing water profile.
The Commission cannot, therefore, accept amendments like 43 and 44, which reduce the knowledge and control of bathing waters.
The Commission welcomes Amendments Nos 8, 11, 14, 17, 18, 20, 34, 35 and 36 concerning bathing water management, public participation and information to the public.
However, the Commission would prefer to leave to subsidiarity the choice of symbols and logos depicting bathing water quality and therefore does not want to take on board Amendments Nos 21 and 27.
On Amendment No 19, I would like to say the following: the Commission is open to a certain amount of flexibility on bathing waters which suffer from predictable and manageable short-term contamination.
However, flexibility should not undermine the credibility of the directive.
Bathing waters which suffer from occasional and short-term events should be identified as such to the public.
It is also important for the evaluation of EU bathing sites that no bathing water remains in conformity if the pollution is neither properly identified or mastered.
As regards Amendment No 19, the Commission rejects the levels proposed by paragraph 2, the unlimited exclusion of samples in paragraph 3(a) and the almost unconditional conformity as proposed in paragraph 5.
I regret that some amendments aim to increase the risks people will face when bathing.
Amendments Nos 62 and 66 both increase the risks of illness from 5% to 9%.
The Commission is aware of the need to adapt legislation to technical and scientific progress and welcomes Amendments Nos 28, 29 and 30 on the revision and adaptation of the directive.
In this context, the Commission has just launched a call for proposals under the Sixth Framework Programme calling for projects on virus detection techniques in bathing waters.
In conclusion, the Commission can accept, to a greater or to a lesser degree, 32 amendments of the 76 amendments tabled.
I therefore look forward to the results of tomorrow's vote.
I should like to conclude by expressing my thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Maaten.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
The vote will be tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Â Â  â The next item is the report (A5-0290/2003) by Guido Sacconi, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council decision on a monitoring mechanism of Community greenhouse gas emissions and the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol (COM(2003) 51 â C5-0031/2003 â 2003/0029(COD)).
Â Â  . â Mr President, honourable Members, I address you today in the knowledge that a compromise package aimed at securing a first reading agreement is on the table.
Accurate monitoring of greenhouse gas emissions is vital to give us an overview of how effective EU policies are in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and what more needs to be done to meet our Kyoto targets.
This decision is an important further step in implementing the Kyoto Protocol and in ensuring that the Community delivers on all its commitments under the Protocol.
Let me extend my thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Sacconi, and his colleagues in the European Parliament, who have worked hard to enable a first reading agreement to be reached on this decision.
Reaching agreement at first reading stage will enable this decision to enter into force quickly and be implemented by the Member States and would be a further concrete demonstration of the Community's commitment to addressing the problems of climate change.
Finally, of course, I warmly encourage Members of the European Parliament to support this possible deal.
Â Â  . Mr President, since 1992, the international community, or a substantial part of it, at least, has been reacting to and combating one of the greatest environmental and economic challenges facing mankind: climate change.
As we know, it is the most significant global issue in the area of environmental sustainability and is having disastrous effects not only on the climate but on ecosystems and plant and animal species too.
The Union took up the challenge in May 2002, with the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, thus demonstrating that the combating of climate change is one of its strategic priorities.
In the decision ratifying the Protocol, the Member States agreed to fulfil their obligations under the Protocol jointly.
In order to ensure that the Community as a whole succeeds in complying with the international legally binding commitments, they have agreed different emission reduction and limitation targets for each Member State.
The Member States are therefore still responsible for reporting the data on annual emissions.
The proposal for a decision on which we are about to vote therefore establishes the necessary framework for ensuring the Community and its Member States meet the requirements on emissions reporting and accounting through an improvement of the quality and accuracy of the information provided on policies and measures adopted and on emissions and removals of all greenhouse gases, including methodological aspects.
Following the structure of the Kyoto Protocol and the United Nations Convention guidelines, different reporting requirements are to be addressed by distinguishing between annual and periodical reporting obligations.
In addition, there are two provisions that are central to compliance with the commitments under the Convention and the Kyoto Protocol.
These are the implementation and the periodical update of national programmes for limiting or reducing gas emissions and the transparent monitoring of actual and projected emissions.
Tomorrowâs vote will oblige the Member States to calculate and send the Commission data on actual and estimated gas emissions by 15 January each year, so that the actual progress made can be assessed and the Community can draw up annual reports in accordance with its international obligations.
The few amendments your rapporteur has made to the proposed legislation are aimed at rendering the mechanism even more binding and effective, especially in the light of the latest, barely encouraging, data that show an increase in greenhouse gas emissions in the European Union for the second year running.
As Mrs WallstrÃ¶m said, regarding the proposed amendmentsÂ âÂ 18, to be preciseÂ âÂ in the informal negotiations which took place with the Council and the Commission after the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy had given its opinion, an agreement was reached which incorporated the essence of our amendments, including the amendments with the greatest political significance such as those concerning the necessarily and mandatorily supplementary nature of the use of flexible mechanisms with regard to the internal action plans which each Member State is to introduce and pursue in order to achieve its own greenhouse gas emission reduction goals.
Therefore, in tomorrowâs vote in the Chamber, we will be tabling a package of amendments on which agreement has been reached.
I hope that Parliament will genuinely give fresh impetus to the measure, allowing the Member States to bring themselves into line with these rules quickly.
I believe that it will also be a clear political signal with a view to a major event, next December in Milan, when we hope that more of the international community will ratify the Kyoto Protocol.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, global warming is a phenomenon that we are all experiencing on a daily basis.
The heatwave, which affected us severely this summer, is a reminder of how serious the problem of greenhouse gas emissions is.
We urgently need to find sustainable solutions to this problem.
Clearly the European Union has to comply with the Kyoto objectives and above all contribute to ensuring sustainable development for future generations.
The proposal for a decision, to be put to the vote during this part-session, is an important piece in the European Union's regulatory jigsaw on greenhouse gas emissions.
Apart from the environmental aspect, we have to bear in mind that governments and industry are the main players here.
The text in question makes it possible to put in place an efficient and reliable emissions calculation and projection system, an essential precondition for producing an evaluation of the situation in Europe that can be passed up to international level.
At present, the information is still incomplete or inaccurate.
As far as current Member States are concerned, too much information is still lacking, mainly on carbon sinks.
The combination of environmental concerns, economic interests and governmental reluctance makes this a complex task, but we have been relatively successful in this case.
Nevertheless, I would draw Members' attention to a specific point, the flexibility prescribed by the Kyoto Protocol for determining the reference year for monitoring certain gases.
We should distance ourselves from the Commission's proposal of 1990 as the sole reference year and stick to the Protocol, while waiting to see what amendments might be made, as has just been said.
That apart, I would strongly encourage Members to vote in favour of this text, which provides a reasonable legal framework and an appropriate timetable, combining flexibility and efficacy.
Â Â  â Mr President, right at the start I wish to thank my colleague, Guido Sacconi, for his excellent levels of cooperation in drawing up the report we are discussing.
The fact that we can hopefully conclude the debate on the directive at first reading shows that the European Union wants to work seriously to slow down climate change.
There has been excellent cooperation between the Commission, the Council and Parliament, and I believe MrÂ Sacconiâs personal input has been important in this.
The Kyoto Protocol lays down the obligations of the Parties to report on emissions.
The decision on reporting in the EU, which goes back 10 years, has been an important basis for allowing us to reliably verify any negative trend with regard to emissions and create a framework to reverse that trend.
It does not, however, adequately meet the obligations under the Kyoto Protocol.
In terms of accuracy and the way it is divided up, current reporting practice does not correspond, for example, to the way it should be divided up according to category of activity under the directive on emissions trading, which was adopted by the EU in the summer.
Furthermore, there have been major omissions in the work of Member States and information that has either not been submitted or is inadequate has had to be supplemented by making the necessary calculations.
With the text now to be adopted the quality and accuracy of reporting will improve significantly.
At the same time the intention is to rationalise how frequently information is submitted by distinguishing between annual and periodical reporting.
Under the so-called compromise package Parliamentâs rapporteur, the shadow rapporteurs and the Council have agreed between themselves that Member States must establish national inventory systems as soon as possible, and in any case no later than the end of 2005, for the estimation of anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases by source.
Compliance with the Kyoto agreements â both the setting of absolute targets and monitoring their achievement â obviously depends very much on how the inventory system is brought into operation.
It is, of course, regrettable that there are not any guarantees of it being in operation when the first allocation with regard to emissions trading is made in the Member States.
It will be important to adopt the grand total of 48 amendments contained in the compromise package in tomorrowâs vote so that the Member States can start to prepare for national implementation without delay.
I wish in this connection to express one small hope.
Under the Kyoto Protocol emissions in the first Kyoto commitment period will be examined on the basis of a five-year average.
I would hope that the Community, for example the European Environment Agency, will also start to publish trends in emissions on the basis of a five-year average.
That way we would eliminate, for example, differentials resulting from annual fluctuations in temperatures and rainfall when assessing how far the Community and the Member States are from the target.
Present practice gives cause for unwarranted optimism and unwarranted pessimism, which can be hard to understand for the public at large.
Â Â  Mr President, we are absolutely obliged to take steps to propose to Parliament that a clear and effective mechanism be set up to monitor greenhouse gas emissions.
I therefore fully support the compromise proposal to be brought forward tomorrow because it is important that we act with some urgency on this issue.
It is a sad reality that, since we signed the Kyoto Protocol, gas emission levels in Europe have gone up instead of down.
It is high time that we assumed our responsibilities.
These responsibilities lie primarily with the Member States and it is time, as I said, that we assumed our responsibility not only for the health of our population today, but for the protection of our environment for tomorrow's generations as well.
Last week's report indicated that three countries â Ireland, Spain and Italy â accounted for almost half of the five hundred infringements of environmental laws in the European Union over the last five years.
This is an example of how Member States, having approved directives and transposed them, are failing to ensure that they are implemented.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I should like, personally and on behalf of my group, to congratulate the rapporteur and those of my fellow Members who sit on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, who have managed to work together efficiently to table these compromise amendments with the aim of having this report adopted in one single reading.
There is no doubt that the urgent procedure was appropriate faced with the dreadful scourge of greenhouse gases and their consequences in terms of disrupting the climate, not to mention their impact on ecosystems and biodiversity.
Indeed we saw their deadly effects this summer during the month of August.
I would also pay tribute to the Commission, which is proposing a more binding mechanism for implementing the commitments that we made in Kyoto in 1997.
I might remind you that the Protocol, which was adopted the same year and ratified by the European Union in 2002, sets objectives in terms of emissions that the contracting parties must achieve by 2012: a reduction of 8%.
The reference date for measuring this reduction still remains to be specified of course, without penalising those countries that made an earlier start on reducing emissions.
Latest studies to date show that, unfortunately, total emissions have been on the increase since 2000 and, if we are to believe the forecasts of the European Environment Agency for 2001, overall emissions in the European Union of the six gases deemed to be responsible for climate change are up by 1% on the year 2000.
This proves that we need to strengthen the legal monitoring instrument that was implemented in the European Union through a decision in 1993, and that is the purpose of the proposal being examined and debated today.
It confirms that the Member States are responsible individually for the conditions under which they participate in the Kyoto mechanism.
That is a good thing, provided that effective coordination and proper monitoring are guaranteed.
My group obviously welcomes the new requirements for improving the quality and accuracy of the information provided on policies and measures, including on emissions and the absorption of all greenhouse gases, as well as on the aspects relating to methodology.
My group also agrees with the rules stipulating how often this information needs to be provided and it also seems to me to be essential for the Commission to table a report to Parliament and the Council following its annual assessment of anticipated progress, measured on the basis of the estimated impact of policies and measures to reduce emissions.
Following the rapporteur's example, my group therefore supports the request that the decision should become immediately effective.
What we are actually requesting is for this exercise to be classified as a top priority.
It is the future of our earth that is at stake and all of the measures taken in other existing and future texts need to comply with the framework and standards set out in Kyoto.
Â Â  Mr President, I welcome the proposal to choose 1990 as the reference year.
It is important to recognise the tremendous efforts that have been made by France and Finland to reduce their emissions between 1990 and 1995.
This proposal replaces the mechanism in operation since 1993 for monitoring greenhouse gas emissions and evaluating progress towards meeting commitments in respect of these emissions.
These proposals reflect the reporting requirements of the Marrakesh Accords to the Kyoto Protocol, including the use of flexible mechanisms and registries.
It is essential to ensure that more information is available concerning the emission levels from within the Member States of the Union.
We all agree on the importance of complying with the Kyoto Protocol on Climate Change.
The earth's average surface temperature rose by around 0.06o Celsius during the 20th century.
Evidence is getting stronger that most of the global warming over the last 50 years is attributable to human activities.
These activities relate to the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, which have caused emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.
We want to see all industrialised countries take urgent action to reduce or limit future greenhouse gas emissions.
Temperature increases can trigger serious consequences, with coastal areas flooded and the lives of many people living in island communities under threat.
The European Union is implementing the European Climate Change Programme, which will ensure that the Union achieves the 8% cut in emissions between 2008 and 2012, which is our political commitment under the Kyoto Protocol.
I congratulate Mr Sacconi on his report.
Â Â  Mr President, let me start by acknowledging the contribution that my colleague, Mr Moreira Da Silva, has made to the emissions trading directive and all matters relating to Kyoto for so long.
He has been called back to serve in the Portuguese Government.
He will be missed, and particularly his expertise in that area.
This evening we are dealing with a proposal for revising the monitoring mechanisms laid down in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and in the Kyoto Protocol.
New rules are necessary for many reasons: scientific progress in the last decade, new elements such as carbon sinks, the transboundary nature of gas emissions and the obvious need for a Community approach and the harmonisation of rules in this area.
In other words, as the European Environment Agency has told us, we need consistency and transparency in reporting on greenhouse gas emissions.
From an Irish perspective, we view the proposal very positively.
It is in our interest to have a structured system in place at EU level to assist in the development of our own domestic requirements.
The proposal is also relevant for the assessment of national allocation plans under the proposed emissions trading directive, which is going through at the moment.
We have some concerns in relation to deadlines.
I hope that they are practical and achievable, as regards the various aspects in the proposal.
If they are practical and realistic, then it will be possible to insist on delivery from all Member States, even those that have difficulties in reaching targets in this area.
If they are not practical and people are agreeing to them, then we will be giving hostages to fortune in this regard.
Ireland's situation as regards Kyoto targets is, to be honest, fairly dismal.
Ireland was offered 1990 levels, plus 13%.
The last time we looked, emissions were already at 1990 levels, plus 22%.
I understand that the EU average is currently at about 1% over.
Ireland has a lot to do in this particular area and anything that can help us to collect our minds and deliver â as we must as a nation â is to be welcomed.
I welcome the proposal before us here today.
Â Â  . â Mr President, when the European Community signed the Kyoto Protocol, we knew that this commitment would require solid action in future, and the recently adopted European Union emissions trading scheme is a centrepiece of that action.
This decision is another key piece of that jigsaw; therefore, the Commission can wholly endorse this first reading agreement.
Monitoring and reporting are of course crucial, and I can reassure Members of Parliament that I will also do everything in my power to make sure that we report to citizens on how Member States are doing.
We naturally base our information very much on the work of the European Environment Agency.
We will return to this matter, but our assessment is that this is a feasible and practical system.
That is not to say it will be easy for Member States.
That is certainly not the case, but we will have to live up to our commitments, and I ask Parliament to conclude tomorrow by voting through the amendments with a resolute majority.
In this way, the European Union and the European Community will reaffirm their commitment to the Kyoto Protocol and underline the commitment to put in place the necessary measures in the fight against problems of climate change.
Everything we do to demonstrate that we want and are able to live up to our commitments will also send a signal to the rest of the world â and in particular to a certain country which we want to ratify the Kyoto Protocol as well.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
The vote will be tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Â Â  â The next item is the report (A5-0296/2003) by Bernd Lange, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Directive 97/68/EC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to measures against the emission of gaseous and particulate pollutants from internal combustion engines to be installed in non-road mobile machinery (COM(2002) 765 â C5-0636/2002 â 2002/0304(COD)).
Â Â  . â Mr President, honourable Members, let me first thank the rapporteur, Mr Lange, for the quality of his work on this technically complex issue.
This proposal is part of the Community's on-going efforts to reduce emissions to improve air quality in order to protect the environment and the health of our citizens.
The objective of this proposal is to tighten emission standards for engines in non-road applications in the light of technological developments and the sector's contribution to emissions to air.
The proposal also aims to extend the scope of the current Directive 97/68 to include engines in inland waterway vessels.
Emissions from conventional on-road transport continue to be reduced; it is therefore right that, in parallel, further progress is made in the non-road sector, as technically and economically feasible solutions become available.
At the same time, the Commission is conscious of the global nature of the market for engines covered by this directive and is aware of the benefits to industry of aligning developments with parallel regulatory proposals in the United States.
I am very pleased with the progress that has been made on this proposal and applaud the important role that Parliament has played in moving towards an agreement at first reading.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, the title of this report, which you, Mr President, have just read out, may be somewhat incomprehensible to the public.
What, then, is this about?
This is about the exhaust emissions from construction machinery, excavators, locomotives and inland waterway vessels, and I believe that it is clear to many members of the public that we have to do something about them.
On a building site on a street in a European city, the position is that the excavator and the bulldozer are allowed to disgorge far more emission into the atmosphere than the lorry that takes away the rubble, even though they are equipped with the same engine.
It simply defies explanation that the same engine, at the same location, but installed in two different machines, is allowed to produce different levels of emissions.
It is clear, then, that we have to do something about this.
I am also very glad that it has been possible, even before first reading, to negotiate with the Council a compromise that was brought in jointly by the major political groups and with the support of many Members, with the ultimate objective of avoiding a conciliation procedure.
This compromise goes some way towards what we decided in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
We want to reduce the emissions from machines that are not road-going, and to do so in several stages.
In so doing, we are in fact going down the same road as the United States, whose Environmental Protection Agency, as recently as April this year, submitted a proposal dealing with what is also our main concern â nitrogen oxides and particulate emissions â and indicating courses of action similar to the ones that we have discussed.
This leads me to believe that this is the right way to go, as these machines are marketed around the world: several stages to reduce nitrogen oxides and particulates, with the result that, at the final stage, the incorporation of a particulate filter is an invariable requirement, enabling the substantial risk to health to be contained and the public, especially in urban agglomerations to be protected.
We are also including railway locomotives in this directive.
Some of you may well have seen, when standing on a station, the quantity of particulates that a diesel shunting engine discharges into the atmosphere as it goes back and forth.
This, I believe, is another area where we need to act, but we are proceeding more cautiously than with the other machines, in that we have incorporated a review process in order to ensure that technological solutions remain feasible.
The same applies to inland waterway vessels.
I think this is an area in which we could have gone rather further, but there was no great momentum to do so â not because of technical considerations, but because of political considerations at Council level.
We agreed to take care to ensure that engines cannot be electronically adjusted.
We have seen how, as a result of electronic manipulation, the emission performance of some models of lorries in the United States was quite different under actual operating conditions to what it had been in the test cycle for type-approval.
That possibility, too, will be excluded.
We have agreed that performance once the test cycle is completed must not result in vastly greater emissions into the atmosphere, but that close attention must be paid to ensure that it remains within reasonable bounds in relation to the test cycle.
I see us, today, as being able to take a significant step in the right direction.
We have also ensured that manufacturers who complete the stages early can use that as a selling point.
I believe that, ultimately, customers will see that as a crucial factor in their decision to buy, so that they can say, âhere are engines that adhere to emission standards that are not yet in force â that could be the machine for meâ, and bringing them onto the market at an early stage could represent a sales opportunity for the manufacturers.
Overall, then, this is the right step to take and in the right direction.
With it, we are following in the tradition of the many and varied pieces of legislation that we have adopted on cars, lorries, motorcycles, chain saws and lawnmowers.
I believe that it can truly be said that we are writing another chapter in the success story of âClean Air for Europeâ.
I thank all those who have helped in this.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I warmly support the rapporteur.
We in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, not being environmental scientists, have only examined the rationale underlying this report.
Of key importance is, of course, the principle that the same standards must apply on and off the roads.
With regard to non-road mobile machinery, we must draw our conclusions from experience gathered from cleaning engines in lorries.
This report clearly indicates how the methods used can also be applied to other polluting engines in road machinery other than trucks.
The share of emissions of non-mobile machinery has increased relatively speaking, precisely because of the success of engine cleaning techniques used in lorries.
This is, in my view, an additional argument in favour of this adaptation.
In a broader sense, though, this is also about the reputation of water and rail transport, of which it has always been claimed that they are cleaner than road transport.
If that is the case, progress should also be made here, and cleaner diesel engines must be provided.
The technology exists and is becoming available, and this is why the sector is given time to adjust.
This must be done in such a way as to ensure that an incentive is given to the sector to accelerate the replacement process with diesel engines that are cleaner and that meet the prescribed conditions.
Needless to say, harmonisation must also be examined at global level.
This is about one market of a certain type of machinery, and that too has been given due consideration in the report.
The Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism supports the purport of the rapporteur's proposals and we are, in principle, in favour of including in this report environmental standards for diesel machinery, that is to say diesel engines used in rail transport with a capacity in excess of 560 KW.
In this respect, the rule that applies elsewhere should also apply here, namely that the sector is given a reasonable amount of time, coupled to technological development, to carry out the necessary innovations.
In short, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, I can say that Mr Lange's proposals are a step in the right direction.
Â Â  Mr President, I should first like to pay tribute to Mr Lange for all the work he has done on what is an extremely technically complex proposal.
He has certainly gained a reputation in committee for having an extremely good technical understanding of the subject matters involved.
Even if I do not necessarily agree with all the conclusions he reaches, I pay tribute to all the work he has done and for his understanding of the issues.
I opposed many of the amendments that Mr Lange first proposed to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, but I am happy to say that since then he has put in an enormous amount of work to negotiate compromises with the Council, the vast majority of which I am happy to endorse.
I always believe that the approach we should take on environmental emissions directives must be proportionate.
We must ensure that the environmental benefits are always balanced against the cost.
So often in the EU we impose enormous costs on business and industry for sometimes relatively marginal improvements in environmental performance.
Many of the compromises that have been negotiated I am happy now to support.
The text is much more closely aligned with US EPO-proposed tier 4 limits and dates.
The document now states that the proposed package of limit values should be aligned, as far as possible, with developments in the United States so as to offer manufacturers a global market for their engine concepts.
That is an approach I strongly support.
The text now puts back the review date to 2007, which gives much more opportunity for practical experience with after-treatment technology to be achieved before stages IIIB and IV are confirmed.
Having said that, I will not support Amendments Nos 71, 75, 82 and 89, concerning replacement engines, the classification of auxiliary engines and engines used to perform maintenance or construction work.
Because specific rail technology has not yet, in my view, been satisfactorily developed to meet the requirements of stages 3 and 4, I believe it is not possible to establish if and when these requirements can be met.
I am happy with the vast majority of the compromises that Mr Lange has so skilfully negotiated and wish to pay tribute to the work he has done in that respect.
Â Â  Mr President, on behalf of the Socialist Group, I would also like to congratulate Mr Lange.
Over the last few weeks, and literally single-handed, he has achieved â that was a pun! â quite incredible results with the Council.
We now have a second reading agreement which we can all probably support.
With one or two reservations, I think Mr Callanan will also be able to put his hand up for most things, so I think that we have a very good result.
This is a very important step forward in controlling emissions in a sector not really yet touched.
A whole range of non-road mobile machinery â construction equipment, barges and all sorts of niche equipment we have not yet though about â is going to be brought sensibly under control, putting an end to a lot of smelly diesel fume emissions in all sorts of strange places that prompt complaints.
Sensible arrangements have been made for seasonal agricultural equipment and special equipment such as the diesel engines used to launch lifeboats in the UK, all of which have limited hours of operation every year.
I think, quite frankly, that the ambitions of Parliament, as expressed by the Committee on the Environment, have exceeded the wishes of the Commission and the Council, particularly with regard to diesel engine trains.
This is an area that we need to revisit at a future time and examine the particular circumstances that exist in the new Member States when they enter the Union.
But we are now reaching a point where we can thoroughly support, by a large majority, the outcome of the rapporteur's work.
I congratulate him on his efforts and hope that we will make future progress on the outstanding matters within an appropriate timescale.
Â Â  â Congratulations, Mr Lange.
Five years ago, you needed three readings to achieve a sound result in the car oil programme.
Now, and I am thereby briefly looking at Mr Bowe, agreement has been reached with the Council after first reading.
That is first-rate!
Air pollution in the traditional sense of the word will soon be a thing of the past in Europe, at least once we have introduced the new engines in cars, lorries, in ordinary engines, chain saws and now also in pile drivers, freight trains and inland waterway vessels.
The Commission did not want to introduce legislation, particularly for those trains and inland waterway vessels, until much later on.
Parliament and the Council, though, refused to be thrown off balance and regulated this straight away, because it is technically possible.
Freight trains and inland waterway vessels use much less energy, simply because resistance is much less significant.
This means that the environmental benefit from freight trains and inland waterway vessels is completely back to what it used to be, something with which we in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance are delighted.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr Lange, we are indeed heirs to a fine tradition in this area of European lawmaking.
We have laid down rules for cars, motorbikes, ships, and motor-driven saws, and now it is the turn of non-road vehicles.
This House is characterised by its continuity, in that you do not have to agree with every word, but every time, we have the same problem.
The industry that builds the machine says, âWeâll sort it outâ.
Those who use the machines will of course say, âOh God, we will need to use this for a long time before we can write the investment off.â
All this is understandable, and so I believe that the compromise at which we have arrived is the right one.
It is in particular the fact that we are in step with the Americans that means we are on the right track when it comes to doing our bit to reduce distortions in competition.
I am quite convinced that the reduction of emission values is more expensive in an area as industrialised as Europe than it is in other countries.
Our problem is a simple one; there are more and more machines.
They may be getting cleaner, but machines as a whole are becoming more numerous, and so we cannot take as rosy a view of our pollution of the environment with exhaust gases as we might wish.
Although I am glad that we have found a way to accommodate the railways to some extent, a degree of harshness is still apparent, so there are two or three amendments with which I am not quite so happy.
It is quite clear, though, that if people want, in the long term, to run these large motors â which are not 80 horse-power jobs, but check in at between 600 and 1000 kW, and have a correspondingly massive output â then they will have to put their hands in their pockets to do so; they must realise that they will have to do that in future, and they must make preparations.
I believe that we are on the right track.
If one thing or another remains to be sorted out, then our injured rapporteur will be able to handle that.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as has already been said, this proposal sees us continuing a tradition of this House.
We have, in the past, been very thorough in campaigning for a reduction in the emission of pollutants from motors, and now we want to deal with stationary apparatus and mobile machines, an area that has not hitherto been covered.
Combating these pollutants, or actually reducing them, has no profound influence on potential pollution overall, but it is significant, in that these machines and pieces of apparatus are highly localised and are generally in use for a considerable period of time.
This results in heavy local pollution, which is detrimental â particularly through particulates and nitrogen oxides â to peopleâs health.
This is something we should constantly bear in mind.
I can tell Mr Lange that we should be rather more cautious here, and that this is where we should not allow ourselves to be misled into presenting specific technical solutions as especially effective in reducing the emission of pollutants.
Not only do we have to cut pollutants, but we also have to think about reducing CO2 in accordance with the Kyoto Protocol.
We know that installing filters increases the output of CO2.
This, surely, is where a compromise has to be found, so that, while calling for a reduction, we nonetheless have to keep asking ourselves to what extent we have to approach this problem only from this direction.
I can agree with the specification that the rapporteur has proposed, and we should continue to take this robust line.
I can remember how, in 1998, it was prophesied that Europeâs oil sector would collapse; yet it ended up being quicker off the mark than the timescale we had proposed.
Our approach is without doubt the right one.
I am rather more cautious about extending this to railways and boats, where I am sure that there are still some open questions.
We are attempting to move more goods on to rails and boats.
We also know that public transport also has to be covered â a sector that makes particular use of rail vehicles.
These, though, produce pollutants, and it is on these that we want to impose rules.
We will have to re-examine this.
That is why the proposal is right to include such vehicles; had it not done so, approving it would have been a bit more difficult.
This way, we can agree on a common denominator.
Â Â  . â Mr President, the proposed compromise is well balanced.
It recognises the benefits to industry of regulatory alignment with parallel developments in the USA, and at the same time it is compatible with industry's capacity to respond.
It also provides for a marked improvement in the environmental performance of engines in non-road applications.
Importantly, it also includes a provision for a review in 2007 whereby the Commission will assess whether there is any need for adjustment to the Stage IIIb and Stage IV emissions standards and the timetable for their application or exemption.
In addition, the proposed compromise addresses the issue of labelling and a number of technical issues such as 'cycle beating' and test cycle improvements.
It also recognises that some details cannot be finalised at this point and are best left to comitology or the review.
The Commission is very pleased with the outcome and again I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Lange, for his efforts to reach an agreement at first reading.
The Commission can accept the proposed compromise amendments in full.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
The vote will be tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Â Â  â The next item is the Commission statement on the demolition of contaminated US warships in the European Union.
Â Â  . â Mr President, the Commission has received a formal complaint from a Member of this Parliament against the UK, regarding the import of old warships into the United Kingdom.
The Commission will, of course, write to the United Kingdom authorities as a matter of urgency to check whether there are any problems of compatibility with Community law.
Let me assure Parliament at the outset that, as European Commissioner for the Environment, I simply do not believe that it makes sense to tow these contaminated ships across the Atlantic to the United Kingdom.
Facilities for recycling them already exist in the United States of America.
We are concerned by information from third parties that suggest that the ships may leak oil, PCBs and asbestos.
Four ships have already left the United States and nine more are to follow.
Two ships left two weeks ago and two ships left last week.
An American court has issued a temporary restraining order regarding the nine remaining ships, and a final decision is awaited.
I understand that the US authorities have voluntarily agreed not to send these remaining nine ships until March next year.
If this is confirmed, I welcome the postponement, but I believe it should be more than just a postponement.
All of the ships should remain in the US for environmentally sound dismantling, according to the proximity principle.
More generally, and quite apart from this specific case, I am also concerned about the environmental and human health problems related to ship breaking, in particular the implications for non-OECD countries.
Our estimate suggests that around 2 200 ships will be phased out altogether and scrapped as a result of the follow-up to the Prestige disaster and the phasing- out of single-hulled ships.
We cannot dump this environmental problem on developing countries.
Dismantling of ships is often undertaken under operating conditions that, from an environmental, health and safety perspective, cannot be considered sound.
Unfortunately, it is the case that EU-owned and/or -flagged ships are also dismantled under such conditions.
The parties to the Basel Convention, which deals with the control and management of hazardous waste including old ships, are meeting this week in Geneva to discuss this issue among others.
I met with the secretariat of the Basel Convention this week to discuss the issue, and I am reassured that we will make progress there in addressing the issues before us.
At a time when we are committed to developing an ambitious new European strategy to protect and conserve the marine environment, I do not believe that we should run the risks associated with transporting these ships across the Atlantic.
In the light of the Erika and Prestige disasters, we need a precautionary approach to protecting this most fragile resource.
In conclusion, I put to Parliament the question I put to the UK authorities last week.
Would it not make more sense to send British expertise in the other direction, across the Atlantic?
Â Â  â Commissioner, Mr President, this issue is obscured by a great deal of North Atlantic fog.
If you ask the intelligence services about the current state of play, a whole load of questions are raised.
Let me say at the outset that â unlike you, Commissioner â I am not fundamentally opposed to European shipyards, which are undergoing a major crisis, specialising in scrapping thousands of ships from throughout the world, and doing so under strict environmental constraints, a situation utterly different from that which currently â and lamentably â prevails in India, where the worst conceivable environmental dumping is going on and endangering peopleâs health to a substantial degree.
We certainly do not want that.
It naturally follows that we have a lot of questions to put to the British government, but, in its absence, I will use you as my mouthpiece and ask whether these are actually warships.
The reason I ask this is that I have had widely divergent information.
I am given to understand that warships can be scrapped only in the United States.
Or are they vessels used for transport and commercial purposes?
How was the transaction conducted?
Did one government deal directly with the other, or were international middlemen involved?
What we need to know is why the work was not done in the United States.
Moving ships across the North Atlantic costs money, of course, and there are enormous risks involved.
Was it factored in to the calculations that one or other ship might sink?
That would have been a catastrophe of the sort that one would rather not talk about.
Without wishing to tread on anyoneâs toes, my second question is whether the country for which the ships were destined possesses the necessary infrastructures.
Does it have the infrastructures for putting a ship in dry dock, and so on?
These, Commissioner, are questions for you to answer; questions that you, as you have just mentioned, should concern yourself with.
Is all this in accordance with the Basel Convention on the Export of Waste?
We know, of course, that the Americans did not sign it.
These questions all call for serious scrutiny before we can come to a conclusion, but, all things considered, I would not want to exclude the possibility of Europeans offering such services to a very high environmental standard.
Whether or not a ship is towed across the Atlantic, whether or not it is possible to do that â these are questions to be considered by the experts.
Our approach to this topic should be highly critical, but very much in our interests as an industrialised continent, and we cannot of course accept it being confused with other matters.
All this I have said in order to drop a hint, and I hope that the interpreters understand what I mean by that.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased with Commissioner WallstrÃ¶mâs statement.
My reasons for taking a decidedly sceptical view of the whole business have to do with considerations of environmental policy.
As Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m said, this is where it is enormously important that the proximity principle should apply.
Surely, I would think, a country such as the USA must be able to lay its hands on the know-how and the technology to dismantle old ships â whether they be warships or mercantile vessels.
Mr Bowe is shaking his head, but I believe that a country that calls itself the best democracy in the world must be able to deal with its own problems.
I would like you to tell me, Commissioner, whether this discussion included any reference to the possibility of involving the non-OECD countries, where there is, of course, a great danger of enormous damage to health and the environment.
The âpolluter paysâ principle should also apply here.
I would like to conclude by re-emphasising that I am very satisfied with your statement, and that I believe that the proximity principle must apply in such a serious case as this.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted that the campaign that we, together with a few members of our group, have launched will bear fruit.
I am also very pleased with the statement that the Commissioner has made here, which has filled us with hope.
I fear, however, that the steaming of the two ships to the United Kingdom is part of a bigger plan to set up a larger waste merry-go-round to countries such as India and Bangladesh.
If these ships are allowed to cross the Atlantic, then this opens up the floodgates and sets a precedent.
After that, it will be legally possible, against the spirit of the Basel Convention, to ship waste to countries that do not have a sound social or environmental policy.
Over the past few years, all kinds of attempts have been made to prevent the export of waste and achieve a system whereby waste is processed as close to source as possible.
Having ships cross the sea in this way is diametrically contrary to this.
This is a very negative message from the United States, which has already put a few environmental treaties on ice.
Surely that country has sufficient capacity and expertise at its disposal to scrap these ships itself.
We should not point the finger only at the United States.
It does, of course, have the cooperation of an EU Member State, which thus becomes, at the very least, an accessory to the enfeeblement of the Basel Convention.
Moreover, that country has mapped out a course for these high-risk ships, as a result of which other Member States are put at risk.
If we look for yet other accomplices, we end up once again with the International Maritime Organisation, which offers little in the way of cooperation when it comes to enforcing compliance with the Basel Convention.
It is high time this changed.
For this, the EU must adopt a united stance.
Europe, too, exports old ships to the South for scrap, without their dangerous waste being processed first.
A list is currently circulating of 144 ships that are ready for scrapping in the South.
We are therefore relying on the Commission to create a legal framework as soon as possible in order to put a stop to this.
We would thus ask for a maintenance policy for European end-of-life vessels.
On 27 October, the Council of Environment Ministers will be holding a meeting.
This is, therefore, a good opportunity to give a warning shot and take a legislative initiative.
Â Â  Mr President, I have a particular interest in this issue because I happen to be an inhabitant of a neighbouring island of the UK.
It seems to me that the United Kingdom is acting in an extraordinarily irresponsible way in undertaking contracts to have ships of this kind brought across the Atlantic to be allegedly recycled in British ports.
One has to ask what will happen to the hazardous waste that we are told makes up a significant proportion of these ships.
We are led to believe that something like over 300 tonnes of PCBs and 600 tonnes of asbestos are contained in the four ships that are currently on their way to the United Kingdom.
There are questions as to whether in fact the United Kingdom is in breach of EU regulations.
The Commissioner has also already indicated that she has requested the UK authorities to indicate whether or not they believe they are still in compliance with EU laws.
My understanding from the briefings I have received is that there is a requirement to have such ships dealt with within a period of 180 days.
There is a requirement to have a dry dock basin available for the dismantling of these ships, but it is unlikely that they can be dealt with in 180 days and indeed there is no dry dock basin available for the recycling of these ships.
There are very serious questions here, Commissioner, and I do not consider it sufficient for you to say simply that you have asked the UK authorities.
When will they reply?
When will action be taken to protect the citizens of the UK, as well as the citizens of Ireland and elsewhere?
Finally, we are going to have arguments here about jobs in the UK.
If we look back over history we have heard arguments that we could not abolish slavery or the sending of children up chimneys because we would lose jobs if we ended those practices.
The environment is more important at this stage than a few hundred jobs.
Â Â  I would very much like to welcome Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m's comments.
It is absolutely appalling that the United Kingdom is allowing itself to be a dumping ground for something that the United States did not want to deal with.
The authorities there deemed these vessels to be too dangerous to break up in the US and it seems to me quite incredible that they would then be transported 4Â 500 miles across the Atlantic and through EU waters to be disposed of in the UK.
Originally the plan was for the vessels to pass through Irish waters but at the moment it seems that is not the case.
We are not sure whether we can be guaranteed that the routes will not change, but irrespective of that we have to look at our commitment, and the UK has to look at its commitment, to EU legislation â in particular the waste shipment regulation.
I would like to ask the Commission whether the UK's action is in breach of Article 19(3) of the waste shipment regulation and Article 4 of the waste framework directive.
In relation to Natura 2000, the Teesmouth and Cleveland coasts have been classified as special protection areas under that programme.
This means, for the conservation of natural habitats and wild flora and fauna, that any plan or project not directly connected with, or necessary for the management of, the site, but which is likely to have a significant effect thereon â either individually or in combination with other plans or projects â shall be subject to appropriate assessment of its implications on the site.
I would like to ask the Commission to investigate â or maybe it has already done this â whether the transportation and treatment of these ships is in breach of Natura 2000 legislation.
What the UK is doing in relation not only to the UK coast but also in relation to the EU as a whole is completely unacceptable.
We have just debated the bathing water directive and it is quite incredible to think that we are talking here about a Member State of the EU irresponsibly posing a major threat to our bathing waters and also to our fishing industry.
What will happen, who will compensate people if there is an accident, if there is a disaster involving fisheries, tourism or any other issue?
This is actually about protecting jobs that already exist and about protecting our environment and indeed our fishing industry.
I am very glad to see that the Commission is on our side on this, but it needs to put much more pressure on the British Government to behave in a responsible manner.
Â Â  Mr President, I have listened with complete amazement to some of the things that have been said here tonight.
It is very difficult to work out whether there are any facts amongst all that fiction.
There has been a complete cloud of confusion, and indeed a cloud of confusion that now has an odour of hypocrisy about it that I cannot believe.
These are the facts.
Those ships are dry cargo ships, they are not war vessels.
Those ships do not contain any more toxic materials than any other normal cargo ship.
The only asbestos on them is the asbestos you would find around any engine on any ship.
The only oil on them is the oil you would find in the tanks that fuel them â they are not petrol tankers.
They have very little in the way of PCBs and other hazardous substances.
They have a seaworthiness certificate which was granted to them before they left harbour â and they would not have left harbour unless they had it.
The States whose waters they pass through on the way have been consulted and their views taken into account.
We are doing this properly and we are doing it because we decided ten years ago not to dump our oil rigs into the North Sea, but to bring them back to Teesside and other places and recycle them.
We have the capacities.
We have the knowledge.
We have the capabilities to do what the Americans cannot do, because they dump their oil rigs into the Gulf of Mexico.
The Commissioner should be asking what is going to happen to the 100 and more ships that are leaving EU waters this year to be dumped and destroyed in the Third World in a totally unacceptable manner, rather than making remarks about things being done properly by the British.
Â Â  . â Mr Bowe, that was exactly the point I made!
I put this in the bigger context of the responsibility we have under the Basel Convention â we have to be able to fulfil the requirements of that Convention.
This is part of the much bigger picture.
You are right to point out the need for accurate information.
That is why I have written to both the UK Government and authorities and also to the US, in order to gather the correct information.
What I have been able to find out so far is that these 13 vessels are part of the national defence reserve fleet administered by the Department of Transportation, Maritime Administration (MARAD).
I also understand that all these ships were built between 1945 and 1967, so are between 36 and 58 years old.
They are estimated to contain in total 698 tonnes of PCBs and more than 3 300 tonnes of fuel oil, as well as substantial amounts of lead, cadmium and asbestos.
These ships are owned by the United States military administration and are no longer in operation.
MARAD has reported many of the ships to be in a deteriorating condition.
Eleven of the 13 ships figure on their priority list of the 40 ships in the worst condition.
That is what I have been able to find out so far.
Let us wait until we have all the information.
In principle, I am not against the shipment of waste for the purpose of recycling.
This is part of the existing legislation.
But, at a time when we have fought so hard to clean up after the and accidents, along with other pollution accidents at sea, and when we are struggling to protect the marine environment, I do not see that this is the best way forward, when, apparently, there are recycling facilities in the United States.
This is what I have asked for.
We should make sure that this is an absolutely safe operation before we embark on it.
Is this wise overall?
Is it common sense to do this, with the risks involved in towing these old ships â the oldest ships they have â containing so many dangerous substances?
Currently, we do not have a legal case against the United Kingdom.
It is important to say that.
We are looking at compliance with the existing directives that relate to Natura 2000, the Water Framework Directive and a number of other directives.
Of course we will follow up the complaint we have received.
I am responding as the Environment Commissioner.
Is this the best thing we can do at a time when we are trying to protect our seas, waters and marine environment?
If we know that facilities exist, according to the proximity principle, in the United States, then why not send experts in the other direction.
That seems less dangerous.
As yet we do not have a legal case.
We have asked for more information.
But I cannot hide my own views on this particular issue.
Â Â  â Thank you, CommissionerÂ WallstrÃ¶m.
The debate is closed.
Â Â  â The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0336/2003) by MrsÂ De Sarnez, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on the Council common position adopting a European Parliament and Council decision establishing a programme for the enhancement of quality in higher education and the promotion of intercultural understanding through co-operation with third countries (Erasmus Mundus) (2004-2008) (8644/1/2003 â C5-0294/2003 â 2002/0165(COD)).
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, we have now been working together for two years on the birth of Erasmus Mundus.
I would therefore like to take this opportunity to thank the Commission, the Council and all of my fellow Members of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport for the work that has been accomplished.
By adopting the Erasmus Mundus programme for the period 2004-2008, the European Union will be creating a new instrument of exchange and cooperation in the field of higher education, with a view to forging links between European universities and creating a genuine European Higher Education Area, which alone will make it possible to attract students, teachers and researchers from across the world.
I should like to remind you briefly of the main features of this programme.
The first action consists of creating 250 European Masters Courses, known as 'Erasmus Mundus Masters Courses', with the label and support of the European Union.
These Masters Courses, which will be selected for a period of five years, will have to involve a minimum of three higher education institutions from three Member States.
They will lead to the award of officially recognised dual or multiple diplomas.
The students following these Masters Courses will have to pursue their studies in at least two of the three associated universities.
The second action consists of creating Erasmus Mundus scholarships for 4Â 200 students coming to Europe from third countries.
The value of these scholarships is significant.
They are on a par with the scholarships granted under the Fulbright programme in the United States.
These students will receive an average of EURÂ 1Â 600 per month to study on a postgraduate course within Erasmus Mundus.
The third action focuses on teaching staff.
One thousand lecturers or researchers from throughout the world will be able to visit European universities for teaching or research assignments of an average of three months.
They will receive a bursary of EURÂ 13Â 000 for the assignment.
The fourth action consists of developing partnerships between higher education institutions in third countries and European universities.
These partnerships will be based on joint projects lasting a maximum of three years.
They will focus mainly on the mobility of European students and teaching staff outside Europe.
The fifth and final action is to promote European higher education on the world stage.
To publicise Erasmus Mundus throughout the world, the European Union will make financial support available for international promotion campaigns and for the provision of services that make information available to third-country students, thus facilitating their access to European universities.
Finally, I should like to stress the priorities that Parliament has championed, and which have been given a favourable hearing by the Council and the Commission.
First priority: the name of the programme, initially entitled Erasmus World, has become Erasmus Mundus, making it easier for people to identify it with the European Union.
Second priority: to preserve cultural and linguistic diversity, we have given students the opportunity to learn at least two of the languages spoken in the countries where their universities are situated.
Third priority: we wanted the 'Erasmus Mundus Masters Courses' to be selected on the basis not only of the quality of the training proposed but also of the quality of the student hosting.
Fourth priority: we also insisted that the diplomas and studies be officially recognised, as this is essential if we are finally to move towards a European Higher Education Area.
We need to create real freedom of movement for diplomas within the European Union.
This tour of Europe that we are offering students from third countries will thus also benefit European students in the future if they so wish.
Fifth and final priority â the fifth priority that we in the European Parliament championed: we have agreed a budget that is equal to the programme's ambitions.
The Education Council proposed allocating this programme EURÂ 180Â million.
The Commission was proposing EURÂ 200Â million.
In this second reading, Parliament has succeeded in obtaining a budget of EURÂ 230Â million.
I should like to reiterate here, Commissioner, how much I have appreciated the positive spirit in which we â Parliament, the Commission and the Council â have all worked together.
I think that we can be pleased with the advances constituted by the Erasmus Mundus programme.
I hope that Erasmus Mundus enjoys the same success and the same popularity as its little brother, Erasmus, and that it will thus enable the Europe of knowledge, to which we all aspire, to become a reality.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, may I first say that MrsÂ deÂ Sarnez has done an excellent job.
This is also â and I think that everyone would agree â an excellent initiative, which, I must confess, is among those that are closest to my heart.
It seeks to make European higher education more attractive throughout the world and also here, in Europe; it seeks to enhance its quality, thanks to the European Mastersâ courses, which will link several universities from different countries on our continent and which will be open to students and academics initially from here at home and later from the whole world, on the basis of the award of scholarships.
We are at the second reading stage and I can tell you, MrsÂ deÂ Sarnez, that the Commission can accept all seven of the amendments in the draft recommendation.
In addition, I should like to congratulate Parliament and the Council on their efforts to reach a consensus â an important consensus, because it will enable us to accelerate the procedure and launch the programme as planned in 2004.
As I have already said, the Commission fully endorses this consensus.
It respects the substance of the proposal and it includes a budgetary allocation of EURÂ 230Â million, which is worthy of a PHARE programme. This allocation is also in line with the budgetary programming prepared by the Commission with a view to enlargement.
The Commission can accept Amendment NoÂ 5 on the budget; Amendment NoÂ 1 clarifying the scope of the notion of higher education; Amendment NoÂ 2 referring to the new generation of programmes; Amendments NosÂ 3 and 6 about the requirement of quality to be met by 'Erasmus Mundus Masters Courses', and Amendments NosÂ 4 and 7 on linguistic diversity, which is very dear to our hearts.
I should like to say to MrsÂ deÂ Sarnez and the Members of this House that wherever I go, in the Europe of Fifteen or in the new countries, and even outside Europe, everyone agrees that Erasmus Mundus is a magnificent initiative and everyone has high hopes of it.
I am sure that it will contribute to greater convergence of our higher education systems and that it will have a major impact on how attractive they are to the rest of the world.
Erasmus Mundus has the potential to become both a benchmark of European academic excellence and a vector for dialogue between peoples.
I would like to thank Parliament very warmly for its cooperation from the very beginning to the very end of this process.
I think that we have set up a marvellous programme.
It will be up to the academics, students and teachers to really make it work.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner Reding, we have been in the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, Media and Sport until now, where we voted on three very complicated reports.
That is why I arrived so out of breath, but we did very well.
I would like to thank MrsÂ deÂ Sarnez for carrying out her work with such determination and so much drive.
In doing so she achieved what we wanted to achieve; we will be able to start the Erasmus Mundus programme at the beginning of 2004.
This report emphasises something that is very dear to Parliament, that is, we are creating a European learning area, an expression we were not allowed to use in relation to Socrates II.
Today, I think everyone is talking in such terms and that, I believe, is a good thing.
We are bringing Europe back onto the international stage.
Europe will become more competitive and more attractive to young people from abroad.
As against the EURÂ 180 million that the Commission wanted, we have set a figure of EURÂ 230 million.
Achieving this increase took a great deal of effort, but I believe that it is also a reflection of the ambitions we have for this programme.
To be genuinely appealing such a programme requires financing.
We put further emphasis on language learning and that is a very important point because the students who come here study in three different countries and we expect them to try to learn at least two of the languages of these countries.
I see Erasmus Mundus as a marvellous way of continuing Socrates-Erasmus, and I believe that we will make this programme a great success in 2004, the very year that the European elections are taking place.
I hope that in so doing and in showing what we are capable of, we will make this a real attraction in the European Union and beyond.
These students, coming from outside the EU, will be able to study in three places in Europe; they will assimilate the cultural diversity of the European Union, they will learn the languages and they will carry Europeâs message abroad.
I am glad that we have come so far together on this road.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, often in this Parliament â and I will surprise no one by saying this â our debates are not terribly exciting and we address rather complex issues.
As Chairman of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport and having only just left a meeting of this same committee where we were voting without you, Mrs de Sarnez, I should like to say here that it was with widespread, indeed unanimous, enthusiasm that the Culture Committee worked on MrsÂ deÂ Sarnez's excellent report.
To be quite frank, when we saw the Commission document we thought the idea was excellent and we agreed that in some respects the Commission was almost being too cautious.
Firstly, in respect of the budget.
It is just as well that we were there to increase it a little.
I might say straight away that this Parliament's Culture Committee does not consider the EURÂ 230Â million to be sufficient and tends to think that it will have to be supplemented further.
Moreover, if you think of the world today and the considerable number of large countries who, for reasons of international uncertainty, give the impression of being closed off, the fact that it is precisely under such conditions that Europe should choose to open up completely is of exceptional significance in our view.
In the same way, we wanted to reinforce, consolidate and write in stone how valuable a degree such as the European Union Masters is.
The Commission text tended to give the impression of any old studies leading to the award of a little certificate.
We wanted to consolidate this qualification, this Masterâs degree.
In addition, MrÂ President, we thought it was very important to tighten up the wording on the learning of two foreign languages in this context.
Where the Union's language policy is concerned, we have often protested in this Chamber about those governments who were not making it compulsory to learn two foreign languages in their countries.
Some still do not do so.
We will exert all the pressure we can in support of this policy and we are pleased to have found an opportunity to do so here.
Finally, I should like to say that opening up European culture to students from throughout the world seems to me to be a wonderful initiative.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a year ago, we celebrated the enrolment of the one millionth Erasmus student.
If it were up to me, we would offer yet many more students across the world the opportunity of studying at other universities.
I am also indebted to Mrs de Sarnez for the energy she has put into the successful completion of her report.
It is important in Europe to offer a sound alternative to the American universities, to which the majority of our European students go at present.
As Europe seeks to become the world's most competitive knowledge economy, we ought to advertise ourselves as a centre of excellence, where academic standards are high, so that it makes it worth the effort for foreign students to come and study over here.
For various reasons, I have always propagated that it is of major importance for students to learn foreign languages, at least two.
This is a for anyone from the Netherlands.
It also promotes the understanding of other cultures.
I see this reflected in your report, which I welcome.
The knowledge of languages does not only help the student with a university degree to secure a better competitive position within the labour market, it also contributes to his cultural baggage, and, lest we forget, to mutual understanding.
I should nevertheless like to make an observation with regard to this report.
The programme is intended for students and university lecturers from all over the world, hence the name 'Mundus'.
I should, in this connection, like to press for extra attention for universities in developing countries.
Education is the best weapon in the fight against poverty.
By giving students from the developing countries the opportunity of acquiring learning within the EU, we can help them disseminate this knowledge in their own countries.
However, I should like to add explicitly that it must, of course, be ensured that they plough their knowledge back into their own countries once they have completed their studies.
The programme is not, after all, intended to crank up the brain drain.
This requires sound cooperation among European universities and the universities from the developing countries, which must have the broadening of knowledge and experience of students and lecturers as a priority.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I should like to present my warmest congratulations to the rapporteur for her excellent work.
By covering postgraduate education, this Erasmus Mundus programme will be a very useful addition to the existing Erasmus programme, which, as you know, promotes respect and intercultural understanding as well as dialogue between our different peoples.
The greater openness to the outside world that these Erasmus Mundus programmes bring is something quite remarkable and will make it possible to further enhance understanding between peoples.
Yes, peoples: I did say peoples because I note that these days, unfortunately, it is the fashion to talk about citizens and to forget about peoples, as we see in the Convention's draft constitutional treaty.
I belong to a people, the Catalan people, which does not necessarily coincide with the French and Spanish states, and I am pleased to recall here that the Erasmus Mundus programmes will foster mutual understanding between peoples, not only European peoples, but peoples from all over the world.
Catalonia â since that is what I was talking about â hosts many students from throughout Europe.
Barcelona is an attractive cultural centre and the fact that Catalan is not, regrettably, an official language astounds some students when they arrive there.
They then discover that in Barcelona, Valencia, Palma or even in Perpignan, classes, or some of them, are taught in Catalan.
In Barcelona, the majority of classes are taught in Catalan.
You may have had the opportunity to see a very wise and very well-made film by CÃ©dric Klapisch, which is the story of some Erasmus students and which also mentions this language problem.
I think it is desirable for all European languages to enjoy equal rights, not only in these Erasmus Mundus programmes, but also in all of the European institutions.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, probably few topics are discussed in this Parliament on which there is consensus within this House.
I hope that today's debate will prove an exception to this.
Anyone who is concerned about the quality of education within the European Union, at whatever level, will be delighted that the Council and Parliament have reached agreement to start a programme whose only goal is to improve the quality of higher education in the Member States.
In the past, only a chosen few were able to gain experience at foreign colleges of higher education or universities during their studies.
That Europe is working towards offering more and more students this opportunity is a development about which we are all thrilled, no matter which political party we belong to.
As a representative of Flanders, one of the smallest nations in the European Union, I often notice that our language, Dutch, is repeatedly under threat within our own universities, among others because an increasing number of courses, not only in Flanders, but also in the Netherlands, are being taught exclusively in English.
I am therefore particularly pleased that the Council and Parliament, in their common position on the Erasmus Mundus programme, are asking special attention for the promotion of the knowledge of languages of students both within and outside of the European Union.
By offering students in the Erasmus programme the opportunity to learn a minimum of two languages that are spoken in the countries where the colleges of higher education are based, we may be able, in time, to reverse the pernicious trend that we notice mainly in the large Member States.
It is a sad fact that, over the past decades, European young peopleâs knowledge of languages, as well as of culture and history, has diminished.
I am therefore stressing that it is not only students from third countries who should be encouraged to have a command of at least two EU languages.
Our own young people of Europe too should urgently realise that a good command of various languages is the best guarantee that they will learn to appreciate other cultures.
This is also the best way to maintain in future the rich diversity within the European Union.
Accordingly, our universities and colleges, the entire higher education system, in fact, will remain a showcase to the rest of the world of which we have every reason to be proud.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, the recommendation for second reading by MrsÂ DeÂ Sarnez, and the amendments unanimously tabled to it by the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, are to be welcomed because they clarify and enhance various aspects of the Erasmus Mundus programme.
The Education Councilâs agreement that the financial envelope should be set at EURÂ 230Â million is important, since that figure seems fairly satisfactory.
Just as important is that this programme should open up new prospects in higher education, both within Europe and in terms of Europeâs collaborative relationships with third countries. Those relationships, moreover, should exist not only at student level, but also at the level of the non-European scholars invited.
Finally, the care taken over linguistic matters and the principle of cultural diversity, the quality label and coordination between higher education and professional training, are also important.
All of this becomes even more significant given the adoption of the measure making it possible for participants in the programme to travel round Europe attending several different universities.
Furthermore, access to this same programme for European students has not been forgotten. Neither have their scholarships and inter-university Masterâs courses.
Thinking in terms of enlargement, this agreement becomes even more meaningful, since from now on we have the opportunity to enhance the already impressive scope and size of the above-mentioned tour of Europeâs academic centres.
It has now become necessary to devise a promotional campaign in order to allay the doubts and fears which, according to the media, have already arisen in certain academic circles.
Some fundamental questions remain, however.
Is this the way for the European education system to compete on truly equal terms with its United States counterpart, in either quantitative or qualitative terms?
Also, at European level, will a more even distribution of students among universities in the Member States be obtained?
Only time will tell us the answers to these questions.
For now, it should be noted with approval that, in terms of higher education, Europe now has at its disposal yet another extremely useful international tool, which has raised the hopes of many, and justifiably so.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner Reding, it is encouraging that we are able to initiate two new educational programmes today, which, although they perform different functions and tasks, have a common goal, that is to say to make Europe more attractive and thereby to arouse greater interest in Europe across the world.
The point has already been made that the programme, which generally applies to higher education institutions and students from across the world that have gained a first degree, must, however, also take account of vocational training, such as technical courses for engineers and higher technicians, which are included in the category of âhigher education institutionsâ, and for which appropriate proposals are to be drawn up.
Close cooperation between various European universities will make it possible to increase quality and increase international competitiveness.
The compromise on the financial framework of EURÂ 230 million is just that â a compromise and no more â and I believe that this programme will only succeed in achieving its ambitious goal if all parties involved âÂ the European Union, Member States and universitiesÂ âÂ accept these challenges and do their bit.
EURÂ 230 million alone will certainly not suffice.
Furthermore, it must be made clear that these financial resources must be raised in addition to other educational programmes and not redeployed from them.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, CommissionerÂ Reding, I would like to congratulate MrsÂ de Sarnez on her excellent report and thank her once again for her cooperation.
The Erasmus Mundus Programme can only be passionately supported.
On the one hand, the programmeâs added value consists in the possibility of mobility, in the learning of foreign languages as well as in intercultural exchanges.
On the other hand, Erasmus Mundus accepts, in a pro-active and constructive way, the educational challenges of globalisation.
It is precisely because the programme is open to students from third countries that Europe can distinguish itself further in the field of higher education.
In an age of globalisation, there is competition for the best products, the best ideas and last but not least, for the best brains.
It is for this reason that Europe must make itself more attractive and competitive as a place of study and education.
As draftsman for the opinion of the Committee on Budgets for the first reading of the report in April 2003, I too am particularly pleased today to see that Parliament has notched up one significant success.
With EURÂ 230 million instead of the proposed EURÂ 180 million, Erasmus Mundus will have a sound financial basis.
After all, what can sensible programmes achieve if they are not adequately funded?
What we have achieved is creditable, but the current commitments and the new initiatives are altogether inadequate when set against the Lisbon objectives.
When money is tight and budgetary resources limited, we cannot expect to reach dizzy heights, but nor should money being tight and limited budgetary resources be excuses for preventing us from making farsighted political commitments.
Ladies and gentlemen, education is the number one investment in the future.
Do we want to have the most dynamic and most competitive economic area in the world by 2010?
If so, then we have to get our priorities right by investing in research and training, and Erasmus Mundus is a step in the right direction.
Â Â  â Mr President, I wish first of all to thank the rapporteur, Marielle de Sarnez, who has done excellent work with the Erasmus Mundus programme.
We have achieved a result that is acceptable not only to Parliament but the Council too.
For once we will have concluded a multi-annual programmeâs legislative process before the programme is supposed to begin.
Hopefully this exception will now become the rule for other programmes deliberated upon by the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport.
The European Union at present is very obviously less attractive an option than the United States for higher education students from third countries.
Each year the EU gets around 100Â 000 fewer new students than the United States.
I believe that, in five yearsâ time, when Erasmus Mundus is well and truly under way, that figure will have decreased.
The purpose of the programme is to improve the quality of European higher education by attracting more students and skills and know-how to Europe.
We have to remember, however, that skills and know-how should not be lured here at the expense of third countries.
Cooperation with universities in third countries is just as important, so that we can, for our part, strengthen the status of higher education in the countries participating in the programme.
Seven months from now, the 10 new Member States acceding to the European Union must be closely involved in the implementation of Erasmus Mundus right from the start.
When the Unionâs external borders change, it will be important for us to put to use the skills and know-how the future Member States already have from relations of cooperation with, for example, Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova.
I believe the close involvement of the new Member States in this programme will also contribute to their participation in the implementation of other objectives with respect to the EUâs education policy.
I am pleased with the result we achieved with regard to the programmeâs linguistic issues.
Fostering linguistic diversity is one of the fundamental values of the EU, but the aim of the Erasmus Mundus programme is obviously not the teaching of languages.
Its purpose is to make European higher education look more attractive, and I therefore welcome the formulation we arrived at.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Erasmus Mundus will significantly improve the quality of higher education in Europe: 250 European university courses, more than 4Â 000 scholarships for post-graduate students, 1Â 000 visiting professors from third countries, 4Â 000 students, 800 university scholars by 2008, partnerships between universities in third countries and Erasmus-Mundus universities in Europe â these are all important elements in boosting Europe as a place of knowledge andÂ âÂ as MrsÂ Pack saidÂ âÂ in creating a European learning area.
The financial perspectives do not seem quite so impressive; in the first reading we made it clear that EURÂ 200 million was not enough, we called for EURÂ 300 million.
I agree with other Members that the Councilâs proposal of EURÂ 180 million is completely unacceptable.
Increasing the funding does not, by any means, put a burden on existing programmes.
MrsÂ de Sarnezâs proposed compromise of EURÂ 230 million is sensible and it is in accordance with the new Interinstitutional Agreement.
I think the excellent CommissionerÂ Reding is certain to vote in favour of these perspectives.
What is the point of a highly ambitious Lisbon objective if we do not have plenty of specific measures?
In Germany, we have learned from experience â and the Pisa study has made it very clear â that these do not come free of charge.
What is the point of it when we are not investing enough in education in our ? We will then be clearly lagging behind.
It is the European Union that must award the âErasmus-Mundus Masters Coursesâ quality mark, so that we can then clearly identify a particular higher education, with good proficiency in the languages of at least two Member States.
We have left a clear political mark both in terms of courses and in hosting students.
There is one more thing that I feel is important.
Vocational trainingÂ âÂ such as for engineers or higher techniciansÂ âÂ must be integrated in such a way that we achieve uniformity in higher education too.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to congratulate the Commissioner and Mrs de Sarnez on this ambitious programme, on this big, substantial step.
Opening the Europe of education at international level, which is a daring move, promotes the European learning area and we are now starting to look at it not in a fragmentary manner, but with the bridges which it has, with the cooperation which it has, as a real area.
I think that the Erasmus Mundus programme is of a different quality in comparison with all the previous programmes, precisely because it is not based simply on exchanges, on mobility; on the contrary, it gives us a new stamp, a new reference point, to which the thousands of students and the hundreds of education institutions using it will be able to give real meaning.
It is very important that Europe has the courage today to open up to competition, to languages and to cross-cultural understanding.
We reward both the institutions and cooperation between them under this programme, as well as promoting the excellence of the students from whichever country, continent or cultural background they come.
That means we are promoting European values.
I think that we owe it to them.
More importantly, we have to give something back to the countries from which the millions of economic migrants come and I think that what we are giving, these grants we are giving, are recompense and I trust that the majority of students will come to us from these developing countries.
European students, inoculated from cooperation with foreigners, have a great deal to gain and a great deal to understand from the culture which they will bring to us.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow from 11.30 a.m.
Â Â  â The next item is the debate on the recommendation for second reading (A5-0314/2003), on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on the common position of the Council with a view to adopting a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council adopting a multi-annual programme (2004-2006) for the effective integration of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in education and training systems in Europe (Learning Programme) (8642/1/2003 â C5-0293/2003 â 2002/0303(COD)) (Rapporteur: MrÂ Mauro).
Â Â  . Mr President, with todayâs debate and tomorrowâs vote, the Learning programme is officially coming into being. The time has come to congratulate those responsible for this achievement.
The mother of the programme is, without a doubt, the European Commission, which launched the first Learning pilot action with its May 2000 communication, although, at that time, the action was not financed by its own budget line.
Tomorrow, two years on, thanks to meticulous work characterised by cooperation between the institutions, the first multiannual Learning programme will be put to the vote.
It is not, therefore, difficult to understand that the measure had a father too, as well as a mother.
It is always more difficult to identify the father, and a question mark remains in this case too, but I would say that the role belongs equally to Parliament and the Council.
The endeavours of the Council, both under the Greek Presidency and, more conclusively, under the Italian Presidency, enabled Parliament to find a substantial opening for its requests and, therefore, to allocate to the Learning programme sufficient funds for it to be launched.
This multiannual programme, which stands alongside other historic programmes such as Socrates and Leonardo, meets the demands of the Lisbon, Stockholm and Barcelona European Councils.
The main objectives are fighting the digital divide through implementing computer literacy methods, promoting virtual campuses, -twinning of schools, promoting and disseminating good practice and cooperation between Community programmes and action instruments promoted at national level.
The programmeâs budget was, as I said, increased to EUR 44 million thanks to what I would like to call close cooperation between the institutions.
As regards the -twinning of European schools, in line with the objectives adopted in the previous European Parliament resolution, I wanted to stress once again how teacher training remains a priority.
I would like us to reflect once again on the fact that, in 2003, on average, 90% of primary schools, 98% of secondary schools and 99% of vocational and technical schools in the Member States were connected to the Internet, but only 39% of primary school teachers, 50% of secondary school teachers and 58% of teachers in vocational and technical schools actually used the Internet as a teaching tool.
There is, therefore, a great need for this programme.
In actual fact, these averages conceal huge discrepancies between the Member States: while the average figure for Denmark is approximately 70%, the average figure for Greece is below 9%.
From these figures, which are already, in themselves, quite clear, two things can be inferred.
The first concerns the use of the Internet as a tool to facilitate teaching.
It is not just a question of availability of infrastructure and school equipment but of teacher training, mentality and school organisation.
The second concerns the use of technological resources.
The setting up of virtual training rooms, for example, is one way of achieving the goal of exchanges of good practice between teachers in the different Member States, at both methodological and teaching level.
For these reasons, I have attempted to stress in the report that theLearning programme should attach greater importance to finding more effective methods that will help teachers incorporate the use of the Internet into their teaching and encourage the dissemination of good practice in this sector.
Once again, I would like to thank the Commission and all the Commission staff who have contributed to the success of our work.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I should like first of all to thank Parliament for having made the Learning programme possible, because this programme relies on the results of preparatory and exploratory measures in favour of online training â Learning â that Parliament has voted for ever since 2001.
Parliament's active support will therefore enable us to adopt this programme in record time, less than a year after the Commission tabled its proposal in December 2002.
It is also your rapporteur, whom I should like to thank, who has made it possible to respect this very tight deadline.
MrÂ Mauro has spared no effort and has done an excellent job.
For example, thanks to him, teacher training has become one of the main objectives of the programme.
In fact, we are aware that this training is one of the keys to the programme's success and that all of the Member States are already working on it.
I am grateful to him for enriching the programme in this way.
Today, then, we need to reach a decision with a view to the second reading, and I am sure that Parliament will be able to agree.
The Council agrees with the content, including with the addition of teacher training.
But, as you know, its position on the programme's budget, as set out in its common position, which was adopted by qualified majority, was initially very different from Parliament's.
An agreement has now been reached.
There is no doubt that we would have preferred a higher amount than that proposed by Parliament, but this has proved to be impossible.
The EURÂ 44Â million on which your institution must vote is therefore a compromise, but a compromise that will make it possible to complete the procedure, saving time and resources, and to launch the programme as planned on 1Â January.
I believe that, on this simple basis, we should tell ourselves that it is better to have a little less money and be able to start implementing a good programme straight away.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner Reding, training and education will be a major issue in the Council, the Commission and in this House, and I believe that, if we want to do justice to the -Learning programme, in order to bridge the digital divide between individual countries, regions and generations, then this report has certainly taken a step in the right direction.
All European education and training systems must accelerate access to and use of new information and communication technologies to improve quality and reduce discrepancies.
Once again I would like to mention the Bologna and Barcelona objectives, which, as you have already heard, could, if implemented, give the European economic area and learning area a chance.
I am sorry to say that the situation in many countries â Austria included â is currently such that cost cutting has prevented increased investment in education that had been agreed, resulting instead in an increase in cutbacks in the education sector.
Regrettably, we are moving further and further from the objective of becoming the most knowledge-based society in the world by 2013, as the Council has already indicated and predicted that it will still take a long time.
When new programmes are initiated, they should also be implemented with the necessary determination, which means that they shouldÂ âÂ as the -Learning programmeÂ actually does âÂ show visible signs of success after three years.
I think that it is for the European Union to give a visible impulse in this area, thus starting a chain reaction and again making education a top priority in the Member States, so that it does not fall victim to the cost-cutting that has been the case to date.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mrs Reding, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report.
A dynamic knowledge economy requires a sound Learning programme.
I should like to make three observations.
First of all, I think it positive that primary education is also involved in the programme, but the target group should also include people other than young people, for we must not neglect the elderly, or, for that matter, those who live in remote areas.
It is precisely those people that we need to take out of their Learning isolation.
Via lifelong learning, they benefit from this programme and they can pass on their knowledge and experience to the next generations.
Grandmothers can chat online with their grandchildren â I am an expert at it.
Secondly, there is virtual twinning of schools.
There are large discrepancies between the different areas in Europe in terms of the use of information technology in education, and we must ensure that disadvantaged schools are given the incentive to dare take the plunge to Learning.
Exchanging information and best practices via the Internet platform is of key importance.
This is how schools will be able to benefit and learn from each otherâs expertise.
Thirdly, the candidate countries must also explicitly be involved in the programme.
From experience, I know that there are schools that are already far advanced in the application of ICT in their education.
The Join Multimedia programme run by Siemens is a case in point.
I sit on its jury, and it is also appropriate, Commissioner, that this is linked to a European prize.
I have attended the prize-giving ceremony and I was deeply impressed with what was on offer, to which this prize gives a boost.
Finally, not only is the quantity important, but the quality should also be superior.
I hope that the private sector that has been established, with the Learning Industry Group, can make an important contribution to this.
Cooperation between the private and public sector is a necessary step towards a European dynamic knowledge economy, which is, after all, our aim.
Â Â  Mr President, I too would like to join in congratulating the rapporteur on his speed and efficiency with regard to this programme and also to thank the Commissioner for her initiative in recognising the opportunities offered by information technology.
I think the two more important points, as mentioned by the Commissioner herself in her address, are, firstly, the question of finance: it is vital for any programme that it be properly budgeted for and given the resources to ensure that all can benefit from it.
Secondly, I think the whole question of school-twinning is important, utilising best practices to bring up areas that have fallen behind and guaranteeing that the digital divide does not get any wider, because we now have the new illiterate, who are people of a certain age group â and I do not want to be ageist when I say this â who have a fear of technology and a phobia with regard to the use of it, and who risk being left behind because of a lack of access.
In so many ways we see our education systems as older people passing information and knowledge onto younger people.
Yet this is the one area where young people could actually be the teachers for older generations, giving them the skills and resources they require to utilise fully the opportunities afforded by this brave new world created by information technology.
Obviously, the new job opportunities that are going to be created in the future will be based very much on technology.
It is quite interesting when you look at the figures, which show that 70% of the workforce that will be employed in the year 2010 is already at work, but only 20% of the technology which will be used in that year is available at the present time.
It is also quite interesting when looked at in another way: of all the scientists and inventors that have ever existed, 92% are living today.
So the rate of change and the types of change which will take place in the future will be even greater and more vast and our capacity as human beings to cope with that change will be determined by the skills, knowledge and training that we are given in the interim period.
Â Â  â Mr President, the Unionâs earlier education programmes are success stories because they are programmes on a human scale.
The e-Learning programme now under discussion will hopefully extend that series of success stories.
The general aim of the programme is to improve the quality and accessibility of education and training systems by means of information and communication technologies.
I hope that teachers and learners will have a major role to play in achieving this aim.
If we succeed in this we will also be more likely to realise the programmeâs aims.
The e-Learning programme is a good example of how pilot projects can claim a place in European Union policy.
Back in 2001 the European Parliament began to support the initiative to promote e-learning and now we hold in our hands a proposal for a five-year action programme.
Although we have not managed to increase the programmeâs budget to the level we wanted exactly, the rapporteur, Mario Mauro, can be very pleased with the work he has done.
The main focus of the e-Learning programme will be the e-twinning of schools.
If networking between twinned schools truly gets under way, schoolchildren in different parts of the EU can get to know other pupils of the same age and learn about their everyday lives.
If it is successful in this way, the programme could reinforce the idea of EU citizenship.
E-learning offers new pedagogical models for teaching and learning.
According to a study by the European Schoolnet, the development of interschool learning environments is flourishing in Europe.
Commercial learning environments are used by just one in three users of virtual education.
It is very important that these individual endeavours are made visible and available for others to make use of.
The e-Learning programme does not give direct support to this, but hopefully in future we can also invest in the development of content.
Â Â  â Mr President, the use of ICT increases productivity, changes the way we work, creates the possibility of community in a new way, facilitates study, raises quality and largely eliminates geographical differences.
The problem, however, is the digital divide, which probably affects about one third of our population.
Education and training do not reach them, and they do not have computers.
For that reason, I propose, Commissioner, that funds be made available, as directly as is possible, for organisations devoted to caring for the disabled, unemployed, poor and elderly, which can maintain levels of education and training within their own circles, as education and training do not extend to these sorts of people either.
In this way they will also be able to purchase and build up a stock of equipment, because the digital gap is, of course, in practice an even wider form of social gap.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow from 11.30 a.m.
Â Â  â The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0319/2003) by Mrs Hermange, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the Commission proposal for a Council decision authorising the Member States to ratify, or accede to, in the interest of the European Community, the Convention on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law, Recognition, Enforcement and Cooperation in respect of Parental Responsibility and Measures for the Protection of Children (the 1996 Hague Convention) (COM(2003) 348 â C5-0302/2003 â 2003/0127(CNS)).
Â Â  . â Mr President, this proposal aims to authorise Member States to ratify the 1996 Hague Convention on child protection in the interest of the European Community.
It is a follow-up decision to the decision of 19 December 2002 which, exceptionally, allowed Member States to sign this Convention in the interest of the Community.
The current proposal concerns the second and final stage of this procedure, that is, the ratification procedure.
The scope of the Convention, which was concluded in 1996 within the framework of the Hague Conference on private international law, is very similar to that of the Council regulation on parental responsibility, which was approved by the Council on 3 October and will apply between Member States as of 1 March 2005.
The new regulation creates a common judicial area in the field of divorce and parental responsibility.
It contains specific provisions to facilitate cross-border visiting rights and to deter child abduction within the Community.
It is widely recognised that the Convention would make a valuable contribution to the protection of children in situations that transcend the boundaries of the Community, thus usefully complementing the regulation on parental responsibility.
The similarity between the two instruments will facilitate the parallel application of the two instruments that share the aim of offering increased protection to children who are resident within the Community or third states respectively.
The Commission would like to express its gratitude to Parliament in general, and to the rapporteur, Mrs Hermange, in particular, not only for their continued support of the Commission's work in the field of parental responsibility, but also for their enormous efforts in this particular case.
The Commission is aware that Parliament has done everything in its power to speed up the procedure, including changing the date for the plenary vote from December, as originally scheduled, to today.
The work of the rapporteur and the responsible committee has thus taken place under considerable time pressure.
The Commission takes note favourably of the amendments proposed and is extremely grateful for these efforts which will enable the Council to adopt this proposal in early November, at the same time as the regulation on parental responsibility, thus ensuring parallelism between the two instruments.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Europe has a duty to continually step up its efforts to establish a harmonised judicial area, in particular for the benefit of the weakest members of society.
It is against this background that today's debate on parental responsibility is taking place.
Parliament was consulted on this proposal for a Council decision at very short notice â as you reminded us, Commissioner â but the importance of the debate and the issues involved meant that it was willing to comply.
I believe that we cannot do other than welcome this proposal, because this debate on parental responsibility is the consequence, dare I say it, of the political determination of a number of Members of this Parliament â foremost among them my colleague Mrs Banotti â who have been campaigning since 1994 for Parliament to take into account the child's best interests and the rights of the child.
Although the Hague Convention of 1996 is a traditional legal instrument within private international law, it has already been a significant source of inspiration for those drafting the new regulation on parental responsibility.
We already know that on 3Â October, the Ministers of Justice of our respective countries adopted this new regulation, which should make it possible to avoid those interminable legal battles that are so detrimental to children.
This new text also extends the scope of Brussels II to all decisions relating to child custody, which should be welcomed given that in many countries, in particular France and Germany, divorces and separations between couples from two different countries are still giving rise to substantial conflict.
It will also mean that one single text will determine the judge competent to rule on a divorce or on issues affecting children.
It is therefore a step in the right direction.
Nevertheless, we should not forget that the thorny issue of parental responsibility also arises outside the European Union with regard to third countries.
That is also why, in the same spirit, I support the Commission's proposal to authorise the Member States to accede to the Hague Convention.
I am convinced that this Convention can make a valuable contribution to strengthening Community legislation on child protection in cases that go beyond the borders of the European Community.
I would draw your attention to the fact that the overlap between the scopes of the Convention and the new regulation will, I am sure, make it easier to apply these two instruments in parallel.
As you will have seen, given the rather procedural nature of the Commission's proposal, I have not tabled many amendments.
I do not think that Parliament has had cause to object to the content of the proposal.
It is an exceptional procedure, as I have underlined in my report, given that the Hague Convention stipulates that only sovereign states can be parties to it.
This illustrates the importance of Parliament's role, because a parliamentary opinion is required for the Member States to accede to the Hague Convention.
Commissioner, I have stressed the timetable.
The Commission had proposed a very long deadline: 1Â MarchÂ 2005.
That is why I have tabled an amendment proposing to bring this date forward by six months, to 30Â June 2004.
I do not think that you will have anything against this, particularly given that it is in the interests of the children.
I have also tabled two further amendments, one of which refers to the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the other to the work of the European Convention.
You will be aware that in the first part of the draft constitution, ArticlesÂ 3 and 4 provide that the Union shall combat exclusion and discrimination and provide social justice and protection, equality between women and men, solidarity between generations and protection of children's rights.
It is in this spirit that I have proposed this amendment.
Commissioner, we all know that enacting rules on the subject is not enough and we must not simply see this as an empty gesture, because we constantly need to follow up specific cases that are submitted to us.
It is therefore essential to ensure that the rules are properly applied, but, given that it is up to the Member States, who remain sovereign in this field, to do this, the European Parliament will always have to ensure that, in accordance with the recent conclusions of the UN World Summit for Children, the child's best interests remain a prime concern, not only in all judicial decisions relating to children, but also in all of the decisions made by our Parliament.
Â Â  Mr President, Mrs Hermange is absolutely right.
She was right to emphasise in the context of her excellent report that at the heart of all of this must be the best interests of children.
As Parliament's mediator in these areas I receive many phone calls.
I have spoken to some very distressed people representing parents whose children have been taken away.
They tell me of a lack of access to these children and difficulties in getting the children back once they have been on access visits in another country.
The great value of this particular piece of legislation is that we hope that many countries that, due to their own judicial systems, were unwilling to sign the Hague Convention of 1980 on the transnational abduction of children, will see their way to signing this piece of legislation, thus ensuring the safe and quick return of children who have been abducted.
The good news is that Morocco has recently become the first Islamic country to sign this particular piece of international legislation, for which I would like to congratulate that country.
We hope this will set a precedent for many of the other Islamic countries who do not feel, due to the type of legislation they have â Sharia law â that they can sign the 1980 Convention.
The good news also is that very recently the Council passed the Brussels II Convention.
Even though the rights of children are not enshrined in the Treaty yet â and we hope this will come eventually â we now have several pieces of excellent legislation that should ensure the safety and rights of these children to know both their parents in the event of a marital breakdown.
The fact is that under the Brussels II Convention the decisions made in the court in the country where the child normally lives can be implemented in the country where the abducted child is being held.
The 1996 Hague Convention is an excellent piece of legislation.
I can assure you, Mr President, Mrs Reding and Mrs Hermange, that they will be raising glasses of champagne to us tonight in The Hague.
They have been most anxious to see this matter progress.
The Secretary-General of the Hague Convention, Mr Duncan, will be absolutely delighted at the speed, efficiency and care with which Mrs Hermange has brought her report to us.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, MrsÂ Hermangeâs report is in fact a very important one.
Recognition, enforcement and cooperation in respect of parental responsibility and measures for the protection of children are of such great value that the Group of the Party of European Socialists will vote unreservedly in favour of all of the amendments and MrsÂ Hermangeâs report.
We will do this because we know how important the protection of children is.
As you know, I am a member of a Franco-German mediation group, and know what difficulties and sad cases we have to deal with in it.
It is the children themselves who suffer.
We will vote in favour, although as a Member of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and as a rapporteur, or a designated rapporteur for this CommitteeÂ âÂ we could not draw up another report because there was not enough time to do soÂ âÂ I would like to make a few remarks.
In fact, I would like to mention three questions, which I forwarded to the Commission through MrÂ Gargani, the Chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, and also a question that MrsÂ Hermange asked, which referred to the importance of this agreement in connection with Community law.
We have Brussels II, we have drawn up legislation for the European Union, and our input into this legislation is, in my view, highly creditable.
Yet, at the same time, the Commission allowed this agreement to be discussed and certain things to be deliberated on without informing Parliament or giving it the chance to be involved.
That poses an important institutional question as to what the connection is between the agreement and the European legislative procedure, and what Parliamentâs rights are on this matter.
The upshot is that we agree with this exception, because we see this agreement as exceptionally important and we do not want children to be punished in any way just because it there a potential interinstitutional conflict.
We will, however, raise this question again in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, since it cannot be acceptable for Parliamentâs rights to be annulled due to parallel legislation at European and International level.
That would not be in the least bit sensible.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my sincere thanks and congratulations go to MrsÂ Hermange for an excellent report.
It is extremely important that the Hague Convention on parental responsibility and the protection of children, which dates back to 1996, is ratified by the rest of the Member States as quickly as possible.
The Hague Convention and, in particular, the Regulation on the recognition and enforcement of judgements in matrimonial matters and in matters of parental responsibility, which was adopted at the beginning of the month by the Member States of the European Union, will be a considerable help in settling disputes on custody within Europe.
In Europe we have actually acquired an instrument to help us to reach swift and effective decisions in disputes over custody and enable us to avoid long, expensive and difficult legal proceedings with regard to separations across borders, which are so painful for children.
We can really ensure that children grow up in a calm environment.
I am glad and a little surprised to see just how excellent a reception the Regulation has had throughout Europe.
Both the press and childrenâs organisations have together commended us on what we have achieved.
Divorce is always a traumatic experience for a child, as it is for adults too, and if it is followed by litigation that lasts for years it can become absolutely intolerable.
With this Regulation the EU will have, for the first time, an instrument by means of which conflicts arising from different laws in different Member States can be avoided.
Of course we cannot meddle with the content of the Hague Convention in this report by MrsÂ Hermange.
For that reason, I wish to ask whether the Commission and the Council are aware that the biggest problems are in any case disputes over the custody and the abduction of children when one of the parents comes from outside the EU and a country that has not ratified the Hague Convention.
We have all read sad stories in the tabloid press about children being abducted, a harrowing experience for parents and the playmates of the children involved.
Could the European Union itself have a hand in promoting the ratification of the Hague Convention?
Could the Commission and the Council try to negotiate more bilateral agreements so that the Hague Convention might be signed in still more countries?
We would achieve even better results if we could involve countries outside the EU in this same arrangement that now allows us to deal with custody disputes within the Union.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow from 11.30 a.m.
(1)
Â Â  We now come to the decision on urgent procedure:
Proposal for a Council Decision on additional macro-financial assistance to Serbia and Montenegro amending Decision 2002/882/EC providing financial assistance to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [COM(2003) 506 â C5-0428/2003 â 2003/0190(CNS)]
The Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy has already adopted a report by MrÂ Belder on this subject.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, in June 2003 Parliament adopted, by a large majority, a report by MrÂ Belder, in which we called for there to be no more ad hoc Parliament approval on urgent macro-financial assistance and for this no longer to be allowed.
The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance can only be amazed that, this morning, we did exactly the opposite in a report by the same MrÂ Belder.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I support the call for urgent procedure.
Yesterday the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy gave almost unanimous approval to a request for this procedure.
There are good reasons to approve such macro-financial aid as a matter of urgency.
This is a separate issue from the ongoing debate on the legal basis.
As the House will be aware, the situation has changed considerably since the murder of the then PrimeÂ Minister MrÂ ZoranÂ Dzindzic in March of last year.
The present economic situation calls for urgent action by the EuropeanÂ Union.
Â Â  Does anybody wish to speak against the urgent procedure?
Â Â  MrÂ President, I did not quite understand.
Has MrÂ Turmes just proposed to vote in favour of the urgent procedure or against?
It was not altogether clear.
Â Â  MrÂ Turmes, could you please clarify this?
Â Â  My tongue is a bit slow this early in the morning.
We are against.
Â Â  We now come to the vote on the request for urgent procedure.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on the following four recommendations for second reading:
- A5-0327/2003 by MrÂ Jarzembowski, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the Council common position with a view to adopting a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Directive 91/440/EEC on the development of the Communityâs railways [8011/3/2003 â C5-0295/2003 â 2002/0025(COD)];
- A5-0325/2003 by MrÂ Sterckx, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the Council common position adopting a European Parliament and Council directive on safety on the Community's railways and amending Council Directive 95/18/EC on the licensing of railway undertakings and Directive 2001/14/EC on the allocation of railway infrastructure capacity and the levying of charges for the use of railway infrastructure and safety certification (Railway Safety Directive) [8557/2/2003 â C5-0297/2003 â 2002/0022(COD)];
- A5-0321/2003 by MrsÂ Ainardi, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council Directive amending Council Directive 96/48/EC of the interoperability of the trans-European high-speed rail system and Directive 2001/16/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the interoperability of the trans-European conventional rail system [8556/2/2003 â C5-0298/2003 â 2002/0023(COD)].
- A5-0323/2003 by MrÂ Savary, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council regulation establishing a European Railway Agency (Agency Regulation) [8558/2003 â C5-0296/2003 â 2002/0024(COD)].
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is early in the morning, and those of us who work in the domain of transport policy are delighted to have the opportunity to debate transport issues in the morning for once rather than at 9 or 10 p.m.
We hope that a few journalists are here too on this occasion, because the evenings are always so long, and so it is sometimes a little difficult to adhere to scheduled starting times.
Anyway, without further ado, let us turn to the matter in hand.
What we are discussing today are better conditions for railway operations in the European Union.
By means of the three directives and one regulation, we seek to ensure that conditions are improved to such an extent that the railways in Europe will again be able to transport more goods and more passengers.
As the rapporteur for the Directive on the development of the Communityâs railways, allow me to begin by expressing my great satisfaction at the Councilâs acceptance of our parliamentary position, which, contrary to the Commissionâs proposal, advocates the preservation of the Trans-European Rail Freight Network that was established on 15Â MarchÂ 2003.
Since that date, this first step towards the opening of the rail network in the fifteen EU Member States, which effectively covers 90% of the main rail corridors, has presented rail operators, irrespective of their national origins, with an equal opportunity to use the European rail network for international freight traffic in a way that best suits the needs of customers.
Secondly, Parliament agrees with the Council regarding the opening of the remaining lines in the rail network to international freight traffic on 1Â JanuaryÂ 2006.
That, however, is by no means a huge leap forward, since, as I just mentioned, practically 90% of total track mileage was opened to international freight traffic on 15Â March of this year.
Consequently, Parliament continues to call for the rail networks to be fully opened to national as well as international freight operators on 1Â JanuaryÂ 2006 so that the entire EU rail network will be open to all freight services, be they national or international, on that date.
In this way we can truly achieve the aim set down in the Commission White Paper â and I am grateful, Commissioner, that we have always followed the same line here â to restore rail transport to its former market position by 2010 and to transfer as much freight as possible to the railways.
The aim is more comprehensive than this, however.
The White Paper is not just about freight; it is about striking a balance between the various modes of transport by the year 2010.
For this reason, Parliament takes the view that passenger networks must be opened up too.
If you consider the increase in the number of private cars on the motorways and the growth in the volume of air traffic, you will appreciate that our motorways and air corridors are coming close to saturation point.
And this is why we in this House want the rail networks to be opened to operators of passenger trains on 1Â JanuaryÂ 2008.
Unless we take that step, the shift from road to rail and air to rail that is envisaged for the year 2010 will leave passenger traffic untouched.
It is quite worrying to see how low-cost air carriers are taking custom away from the European railways.
I hope, Commissioner, that in the next few days you will have something to say about Charleroi airport in Belgium, because it is not acceptable that the railways should be making huge losses on their long-distance passenger services because the cheap airlines are luring their customers away and congesting our skies.
In short, we want to ensure that the aim of rebalancing the transport market by 2010 applies to passenger transport too.
Some people have repeatedly stressed that the Commission has announced the presentation of a third rail package by the end of the year, a package that will include passenger transport.
That is all very honourable, Commissioner, but it does not help us in any way, because, as you know, if the Commission failed to present this package by December of this year, we could no longer adopt the package, or even give it a first reading, before the end of the current legislative term.
Even if we did manage the first reading, the intervention of the European parliamentary elections, the appointment of a new Commission and the need to reactivate the legislative process would mean that it would effectively take one to two years to put through a bill on passenger transport, and so we could not adopt a third railway package before 2005.
I believe, however, that the train operators need to know for certain now whether they will be able to benefit from a legal right of access to the entire network.
We want them to have time to anticipate the needs of the travelling public so that we are actually able to effect the transfer of a substantial volume of long-distance traffic from road and air to the railways by 2010.
Lastly, the committee proposed that the existing options allowing Member States to permit companies other than railway undertakings to apply for train paths should be scrapped in favour of a provision enabling consignors, forwarders and the like to apply for the use of train paths alongside railway undertakings in all Member States.
We believe that every effort must be made to optimise the use of the rail infrastructure.
We know that there is still spare capacity today, even on the Brenner line, and there is no point in our continued grumbling about HGVs when even this transalpine rail link still has spare capacity.
In other words, we must enable more players in the market to apply for and use the available train paths if we want to maximise the volume of freight carried by rail.
Allow me, as the spokesman for my group, to say a few words in anticipation of the other two reports, because it would make no sense for me to sit down and then stand straight back up again.
I should like to begin these remarks on behalf of my group by expressing my sincere thanks to the rapporteurs from the other groups.
We worked very well together, both at the time of the first reading and in preparation for the present second reading.
Although MrsÂ Ainardi, MrÂ Sterckx, MrÂ Savary and I differed in our positions on specific points, we always regarded the railways package as an integral whole, hence our close cooperation as rapporteurs.
I am highly gratified that we are all trying to follow the same line.
You will be aware that the Council has already tried to find compromises that will enable us to conclude the legislative process quickly.
The Council, along with the rapporteurs, has basically been trying to reduce the number of points at issue between the Council and Parliament, sometimes by accepting parliamentary positions and sometimes by proposing compromises, with the result that the conciliation procedure will focus on a core of considerably fewer than sixty or seventy points.
I hope that we shall hear some judicious statements from the Council tomorrow regarding its intention of adhering to the line we began to discuss last week.
We are interested in reducing the number of disputed points so that we can really focus our full attention on the major problems at the conciliation sessions.
To this end, my group will carefully examine the latest batch of amendments to the railway directives and will vote accordingly on Thursday.
Allow me to make two or three remarks on the Sterckx report.
Mr Sterckx has tried very hard â for which I am grateful to him â to ensure that the European rail-safety standards guarantee a high level of safety and that there is no scope for the introduction by the back door of new national safety rules which would ultimately reinstate arbitrary restrictions on international traffic.
I believe it is very important that we cooperate with the Commission in order to find a mechanism that prevents the introduction of allegedly essential safety provisions that are actually designed to discriminate against other rail operators.
My group also attaches importance to the proper training of train crews and all other personnel on whom the safety of rail travel depends.
We still have a problem here, Commissioner, that being that one directive devoted purely to the training of engine drivers might not suffice.
We must train all other safety-related personnel to the appropriate standard of qualification.
I support Mr Sterckx on the last point I wish to address from his report, a point on which I believe we all agree: staff training certificates must not lose their validity when personnel move from one railway undertaking to another.
We need a single market for engine drivers too.
We need competition throughout the domain of rail transport.
Let me turn now to the Savary report.
Mr Savary has very carefully incorporated the new budgetary rules, and I believe that the Council will endorse this so that all agencies have uniform budgetary rules and so that we avoid a situation in which each agency has its own rules, creating an incomprehensible tangle of budgetary provisions.
The main point in the Savary report â and we are right behind the rapporteur on this â is the imbalance in the Councilâs proposal for the composition of the Administrative Board.
The amended proposal made by the Commission is for an Administrative Board comprising six representatives of the Council, four representatives of the Commission, and six non-voting representatives of the industry, in other words of the relevant railway undertakings, and rail users.
The Council is now proposing that all Member States be represented on the Board.
This would mean that six representatives of the interested parties, four Commission officials and, from May of next year, twenty-five Council representatives would sit on the Board.
Only the Council could devise such a ludicrous scheme, and we therefore endorse the rapporteurâs view that we must use the conciliation procedure to put an end to it.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr Jarzembowski.
I wanted to comment briefly on your remark about transport policy being discussed in the morning for once.
My reply comes from Part Two of Goetheâs : ââ (âFor he whose strivings never cease is ours for his redeemingâ).
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, it is clear that safety is essential.
Railway safety is good in most cases at the moment, and it is imperative that it remain good, at least as good as it is now.
I extend my thanks to many of my fellow Members, therefore, for their valuable contribution to the debate on safety, and also to many people from the railway community, who have made a fair few suggestions, improved the texts, pointed out difficulties and so on.
If a European rail transport market is established, there must of course also be a European safety system.
We are creating that by means of this Directive: Common Safety Targets, a method for achieving those targets, and a safety authority in each Member State that uses a common method to give licences to all the parties concerned.
Following the Council common position, we held a number of discussions, and there followed mediation by the Commission with representatives of the Council.
We were able to eliminate a whole range of problems, as there were quite a few differences between the common position and our first reading.
I have tabled a number of compromise amendments about these, which I ask my fellow Members to support, including compromise amendments concerning the driving licence for train drivers â for which we have found a solution via a new Commission proposal â and also concerning interoperability.
I should also like to stress the importance of the agreement reached by the social partners (the trade unions and the European railway companies).
Indeed, I should like to ask that the Commission transpose that agreement as quickly as possible, so that we also demonstrate that we attach great importance to the creation of a social framework for our planned railway reforms.
I think that this is an important point, and that it must therefore be emphasised.
A second point on which we reached agreement concerns communications and the crossing of linguistic borders, something on which I had laid a fair amount of emphasis.
If MrsÂ Ainardi is in agreement, we shall move that point to the Directive on interoperability, and thus that, too, will be settled.
There are two significant points on which we disagree with the Council, however.
The first is the speed at which the new safety system should start off.
The European Parliament wants to proceed more quickly, and I think that we should stand firm on that view.
Secondly â as MrÂ Jarzembowski has already pointed out â working towards a European safety system implies keeping the number of new national safety rules that are introduced to an absolute minimum.
Hence the importance of ArticleÂ 8: the role of the Commission as supervisor of the system.
We as a Parliament must stand our ground on that point.
We have already reached agreement with the Council on a number of points, but one remains, and we do need to negotiate hard about this.
Indeed, we shall see whether the Council is also able to follow up tomorrow the points on which we reached agreement.
I think that agreement is possible, and we must strive to achieve it.
I should now like to talk about the other reports and the whole package: we must keep the four directives as a single package.
We must enter into the conciliation procedure on those four directives simultaneously.
In general, the European Parliament is more in favour of an open European rail transport market and of European railway companies than the Council.
The Council does not yet go as far as this: much less far than the Commission and Parliament.
We must negotiate hard in the conciliation procedure in order to bring the Council a long way towards our position.
The decreasing market share held by the railways speaks for itself: our Belgian railways again lost nearly 6% of the freight market in the first half ofÂ 2003.
That is a very regrettable development.
There is a small increase in passenger transport, but the situation regarding freight has taken another turn for the worse.
I think that, particularly in our country, inland water transport and coastal water transport are poised to take over that market share.
It is important, therefore, that the railways defend themselves much more effectively, that they ensure their presence on the market.
The railways must become more efficient, much more dynamic, than is now the case.
In some countries they are, but in others they definitely are not.
Railway companies must not focus on themselves.
They must focus on their customers, those who use their services, and they must focus on their service â ensure that they are giving their customers the best possible service â so that those customers stay with them, or come back to them.
I think that this is important.
Nearly every week I come across a company that says âWe should indeed like to do a number of things by rail, but it is not possible.
The railways are bad, too slow, too expensive, unreliable.â
In my opinion, these are very regrettable reports, and something must be done in this regard.
That is the very first aim of this package of directives
I should also like to mention that what we are proposing here is not wild capitalism on the railways.
That is definitely not the aim of the directives that are on the table now.
This is not an asocial or antisocial package.
Indeed, my request that the agreement between the social partners be ratified took its inspiration from the social sphere.
This package gives the railways the opportunity of ârecapturingâ the transport market.
My use of a military term is deliberate, because if the railways do not win their share of that transport market back, we shall really see some very serious social carnage.
Â Â  . â Â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, an entire programme of parliamentary and institutional work on railways is now drawing to a close. The railways represent a tremendous challenge for Europe and for the future.
The report on interoperability seeks to make the directives on high-speed and conventional rail systems more consistent. Significantly, it also proposes greater harmonisation.
This is a way in which the Union can benefit the railways, enabling trains to move freely across the European network.
The decision to tackle the issue of rail was made on the basis of the ongoing decline of rail as a means of transport in Europe.
Consequently, the proposals contained in my report seek to support the development of the railways. Rail is a sustainable and safe means of transport.
In addition, it places different areas on an equal footing. Both at a European level and at the level of each MemberÂ State, public authorities should take resolute action on railways.
They need it. The reasons for the decline of the railways are many and serious.
Moreover, some of these reasons are not related to the aim of my report.
One such reason is the failure to take account of the environmental costs of road transport, which is the main competitor of rail transport.
The decline of the railways is also linked to problems concerning finance.
On this issue, I am bound to refer back to what I said previously and I can only reiterate that this aspect is far from satisfactory.
The time will come when it will be necessary to make available means that match our stated ambitions.
I would now like to turn to the recommendation for second reading of my report.
Although there was general agreement on the common position, my report includes the proposals made by the relevant parliamentary committee at first reading. This is progress.
I would like to cite two examples.
First, there is the proposal seeking to equip trains with recording devices. With satellite control, these devices will greatly enhance the flow of rail traffic by monitoring changes in real time.
They will also increase safety.
Rail employees put this proposal to me at the very beginning of the first reading and it has now been accepted by the Council. In my opinion, this is a good example of how we can improve parliamentary work by taking the time to debate issues with the main parties involved and to listen to them.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to draw your attention to the amendment seeking to replace the phrase âminimum level of safetyâ with âoptimum levelâ.
It was important to eliminate any ambiguity concerning the possibility of a âlevelling downâ type of harmonisation. Allowing safety standards to differ between MemberÂ States might suggest that harmonisation could be used to reduce safety standards so as to facilitate access for new entrants.
On the contrary, it is essential to ensure that all rail users respect the complete set of standards guaranteeing better safety.
I would now like to turn to the other reports on the rail package.
I support the proposals of my fellow Member MrÂ Savary on a European Railway Agency.
I think the proposals for each and every one of the players to be represented on the AdministrativeÂ Board of the agency are essential to progress.
I believe it is very important for rail employees and their organisations to contribute to the process of drawing up the technical specifications for interoperability (TSIs).
I agree with a number of the proposals made by MrÂ Sterckx on safety.
I believe each MemberÂ Stateâs particular situation and know-how must be taken into account. In addition, however, I feel it is important to allow sufficient time.
For historic reasons, our rail networks are extremely complex. Effective change must take account of the human factor.
I would also like to highlight the issue of national standards.
It is essential for MemberÂ States to retain the right and the ability to improve their safety conditions and systems. If this right were removed, there would be a serious risk of them all being reduced to the lowest common denominator when the aim should be to help all networks increase their safety levels.
Lastly, our rapporteur will understand that I do not agree with amending our objectives, including opening up the sector to competition and considering this action to be as important as safety. Everyone has their own opinion on opening up the sector to competition.
We happen not to agree on the subject. It is, however, a shame to make a hotchpotch in a directive that has harmonisation and improvement of safety as its main objective.
As for Mr Jarzembowskiâs report, I have to say that I do not share his desire for liberalisation.
We have only just begun on the process of transposing the previous directive and an assessment of its impact is required.
The rail sector is of such social and economic importance that the precautionary principle must be applied.
No one would want the European rail system to experience the same mishaps, not to mention disasters, which have befallen certain other networks.
Liberalisation at any cost implies certain theoretical assumptions.
This can prove dangerous and has been shown to have disastrous consequences for the railways, employment and the social and economic situation.
These are the grounds on which we rejected the proposals to accelerate the opening up of both the national and international freight sector, proposals which unfortunately were accepted by the Council. Since we rejected these proposals, it follows that we cannot support Parliamentâs bid to liberalise passenger transport if the report is accepted.
