As we inevitably wind down some of the supports in the process of enlargement and, at the same time, maintain the pressures to protect the environment and the consumers, then there will be friction between the producers and the European administration.
To devote as many resources as possible to good relations is a wise policy.
Mr President, firstly I would like to thank the rapporteur, Maria Izquierdo Rojo, and the members of the Committee, for their report.
The proposed regulation intends to provide the Commission with a tool to help it to present an operational model for European agriculture, and give wider publicity to the common agricultural policy.
In this way, the implementation of agricultural policy is facilitated.
Now I would like to speak about Parliament' s proposed amendments.
They are not generally aimed at changing the subject matter but rather at amending the proposals.
Amendments Nos 2 and 6 concern organisations falling within the scope of aid. It is the opinion of the Commission that it is not necessary to mention the groups and organisations by name.
All agricultural organisations and rural players fall within the scope of aid according to Article 2.
This being the case, the proposed addenda are unnecessary.
Amendments Nos 5, 8 and 10 concern measures that are eligible for aid.
Amendment No 5 contains amendments regarding information services and fora for discussions for men and women in rural areas.
They are unnecessary, as they are already contained in the Commission' s proposal.
One of them, which reads "supporting them in their choices" is not in harmony with the Commission' s proposal.
The purpose of this regulation is not to offer farmers any special services.
Local bodies are better qualified to do that.
The resources available would not be sufficient for that either.
I would, moreover, like to make the comment, with regard to the amendments tabled for Article 3, that information visits are not being ruled out.
The list of activities that are eligible for aid is not exhaustive, which is indicated in the word "particularly" .
The Commission is prepared, however, to adopt this amendment.
The funding of long-term exchange programmes cannot, however, be accepted, as such action is not a part of the information policy.
Amendment No 10 concerns Article 5.
The Commission supports the objectives mentioned here, proof of which is to be seen in the fact that they are implicitly contained in Article 1, which concerns the operational model for European agriculture.
That is why it makes no sense to repeat the contents of the model in further detail.
Amendments Nos 7 and 13 concern contributions.
The Commission thinks that it is not desirable to pay more than 75% of eligible aid costs.
The funds available are modest.
The lower the contribution stays the more measures there will be that can be financed and the greater the multiple effect.
Amendments Nos 9 and 12 concern the allocation and approval of appropriations.
As we know, Parliament is a budgetary authority together with the Council.
For this reason, the Commission thinks Amendment No 9 is not necessary.
Regarding Amendment No 12, which proposes including the allocation of appropriations in the regulation, I would say that if the allocation is settled on beforehand, the administration of the budgetary heading will lose its vital degree of flexibility, which might be damaging from the point of view of proposed applications for financing.
Amendment No 11 concerns evaluation.
The Commission agrees with Parliament on the usefulness of regular evaluation.
It can best be taken account of in the implementing regulation.
Amendment No 4 concerns administration.
This extra recital is unnecessary in the regulation, in the opinion of the Commission.
Provision for administrative details, evaluation and later assessment will be laid down by the Commission in the Implementing Regulation.
In this connection, it has to be said that the effective monitoring of public funds has to be assured in the process regardless of how open and simple the process is.
Amendments Nos 1 and 3 concern linguistic nuances.
These the Commission does not consider significant, as Recitals 4 and 7 in the Commission' s proposal are not as restrictive.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
Grain legumes
The next item is the report (A5Â­0045/2000) by Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 1577/96 introducing a specific measure in respect of certain grain legumes [COM(1999)428 - C5Â­0187/1999 - 1999/0182(CNS)]
Mr President, I am presenting a report by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 1577/96 introducing a specific measure in respect of certain grain legumes.
The European Parliament has been analysing this proposal since October 1999 and approved this draft legislative resolution unanimously on 23 February 2000.
I would like to highlight the following aspects of the amendments proposed by the European Parliament.
First, Amendment No 1 on the inclusion of a Recital 2a.
This amendment supplements the Council approach, which is purely commercial, and opts for a proposal with wider economic, human and food quality aims.
Whereas the Council only talks about the market, the European Parliament highlights the economic interest for the Community of the production of these grain legumes.
Given the deficit of protein crops in the European Union, Parliament considers that this system should be improved without cutting the level of aid.
Secondly, Parliament' s Amendment No 2 proposes that seed vetches should also be included in the aid system.
Aid for seeds already exists for rice, chickpeas and lentils.
We propose this aid because, as we all know, the production of seeds is subject to supplementary technical and quality control requirements, so that if the cultivation of seeds were not supported by some form of aid, this could have extremely negative consequences for the quality of production of seed vetches.
Thirdly, Amendment No 3 indicates that, in our opinion, the Commission should, without further delay, make proposals for the 2000-2003 period.
Before I finish, Mr President, I would like to point out that in 1993 - which is some time ago now - the Council indicated that it intended to gradually strengthen the current aid system for grain legumes.
However, this has still not been done.
Secondly, successive periods show that we are faced with a chronic imbalance in this system.
The maximum guaranteed area is being systematically reduced, thus penalising time and again the farmers who are suffering reductions in aid of up to 20%.
Therefore, Mr President, what the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development of the European Parliament would really like to see is an improvement in the system.
However, we appreciate what the Commission is telling us, that this is a time of serious budgetary restrictions that we could not implement without reducing aid.
That is why we are presenting this proposal, which is really a maintenance proposal, and what we are saying to the Commission is that, without further delay, proposals must be drawn up at the latest for the 2000-2003 period to achieve an improvement in this system without decreasing aid.
I thank all the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for their collaboration and support, as well as the opinion of the Committee on Budgets.
Thanks also to the Commission for its willingness to hold a dialogue and I hope it will be open to our proposals.
Mr President, Commissioner, the report that is being proposed for approval today in plenary refers to a minimal reform of Regulation 1577/96 on aid for the grain legume sector.
So slight is the reform that it does not amend the total maximum guaranteed quantity, although it does split it into two, nor the amount of aid per hectare.
The only new element is the substitution of the management committee by the cereal management committee.
As the Spanish saying goes, which is very much in agreement with this regulation, 'Esto son lentejas; si quieres las tomas y si no las dejas' [ 'here are some lentils, take them or leave them' ].
Consequently, my Group will support the rapporteur's report and, above all, will particularly support Amendment No 2, which proposes the inclusion of areas dedicated to the production of seed vetches in the aid system, as this will lead to high-quality crops.
Nevertheless, I would like to make it clear that we have missed the opportunity to support a substantial, very arid area of southern Europe, which has no other crop alternative for its soil.
Furthermore, the demand for vetches for feeding livestock is increasing all the time, as shown, at least in Spain, by the fact that the area sown in the last three years has exceeded the proposed maximum guaranteed area by 100 000 hectares per year on average.
On the other hand, the food problems we have had in the European Union have been caused by feeding herbivores with animal-based feedingstuffs, and if we do not encourage the feeding of livestock with plant proteins, such as legumes, and lower their price, farmers will continue to resort to animal meal due to the enormous pressure of competition.
Finally, it just remains for me to lament, once again, the fact that the Commission's agricultural policy is more concerned with reducing spending - or, at best, not increasing it, as on this occasion - than with maintaining a genuine European agricultural sector that is so essential for the equilibrium of the region.
Mr President, I am participating in this discussion in order to support the report by my colleague, MarÃ­a Izquierdo, whose proposals, like those of the Commission, seem to me to be beneficial and of interest.
Grain legumes are a traditional crop in certain areas of southern Europe, including Spain and, more specifically, Castilla-La Mancha, the region I come from, which contains one third of the total area dedicated to these crops in Spain.
Our concern is therefore to avoid damaging the aid system for this sector of agriculture and, more specifically, for the production of chickpeas, lentils and vetches.
Chickpeas and lentils are two essential products in Spanish gastronomic culture and in our diet, the Mediterranean diet, which is now so highly thought of by scientists, which includes dried pulses in our traditional recipes.
The purchase of dried pulses in Spain has been increasing by up to 5% annually.
In my country, the consumption of these is 6.5 kg per head annually and anyone who knows how these products are cooked can vouch for the fact that this is a very substantial amount.
Religious customs, for example, mean that we do not eat meat during Lent and due to the wiliness and common sense of our compatriots, meat has been replaced by other dishes - delicious dishes, of course - such as our lentil and spinach stew.
We are talking about uses that have been consolidated throughout history and are now consumed throughout the year, including by non-believers and those who do not practise a religion, and that have left an almost infinitely varied series of main courses based on dried pulses, which undoubtedly increase the consumption figures.
Another sector which requires this type of product is livestock farming.
At times like this, when we are seeing fraudulently-fattened livestock and the use of unauthorised products, it becomes essential for the market to provide reasonably-priced, good quality natural feedingstuffs, such as some of those that this regulation concerns, and specifically vetches.
Finally, we are talking about Community protection for a crop which last year, in my region, provided an honest living for around 17 000 families.
Moreover, this is a sector in which, fortunately, there has not been a proliferation of bounty-hunters who move into agriculture in order to receive grants from the Union.
Here we are dealing with traditional crops farmed by people who devote themselves to these crops from generation to generation, and who have contributed to the formation of a large part of the countryside and cuisine of substantial regions of Europe, which still interest us and which we should maintain.
I am therefore asking for the support of Parliament for the Commission's proposals and the improvements which, by way of amendment, are contained in MarÃ­a Izquierdo's report.
Mr President, we are able to support an extension to the proposal but, at the same time, I would draw attention to the fact that Agenda 2000, which was decided upon last year in Berlin, is based, of course, upon our looking towards free trade and endeavouring to reduce the present level of aid and to reach a number of agreements under the aegis of the WTO whereby, by virtue of market mechanisms, we can obtain greater access to the many markets out in the world.
I would also draw your attention to the fact that, in recent years, conventional farming has been put under pressure. Prices have fallen for just about every product.
This is what some people call stability. Farmers experience it somewhat differently because costs are, of course, rising and price freezes will therefore automatically be experienced as a setback.
I would also recall the fact that the Commission has recently tightened up on the conditions for intervening in the area of grain.
Wheat growers, in particular, will be affected very badly, which they already are because of a 15% fall in prices, but then there is also a tightening up on quality and with regard to the issue of protein crops.
This means, moreover, that, especially in the northern part of the EU, there will be further price falls in the offing.
On behalf of my Group, I shall, as I said, support an extension to the arrangements, but I would strongly urge the Commission, before 2002-2003, to make a concerted effort to investigate possible changes to the way in which we employ resources so that we can, in the future too, safeguard that group of farmers which, until now, has been supported by means of the aid arrangements in question.
- (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, we must support the production of grain legume crops by improving the system without reducing the level of aid, given the current shortfall in grain legumes both for human consumption and animal consumption.
The fact is that the system of aid established in 1989 has been modified several times, but no report has been presented on the application of the present system.
Now, by advocating a maximum guaranteed area of 400 000 hectares, the Commission wants to reduce the average production area over the last three years by around 100 000 hectares, which will mean considerable reductions in aid.
On the other hand, although we do not disagree with splitting the maximum guaranteed area into two, we feel it is necessary to adjust the historical reference period in order to calculate each of the maximum guaranteed areas excluding the last three years, in order to reduce the damaging impact for Portugal on products designed for human consumption.
Finally, it is important to point out that it is vital for Portugal that dry bean should be considered in this system, even without the change to the maximum guaranteed surface.
We therefore firmly believe that the Commission should bear in mind these amendments to the new system which it hopes to establish for grain legumes.
Mr President, I would again like to thank the rapporteur, Maria Izquierdo Rojo, for an excellent and constructive report.
There are two Commission documents that serve as a basis for the issue of grain legumes.
The first is a report on the aid scheme in place for grain legumes, and the second a proposal for improved administration of the system.
What vegetables are we actually talking about?
I know that the Spanish members know the subject well, but I should mention that by grain legumes are meant three annual vegetables with a high protein content and which are gathered in the form of dry seeds.
Lentils and chickpeas serve as food for humans, while the seeds of vetches, which to us are more unusual vegetables, are used as animal feed.
Grain legumes are grown as field crops, particularly in the southern part of the Union, as they thrive well in dry climates. In fact Spain accounts for 90% of all EU grain legume production.
Grain legumes are not covered by the aid scheme that was remodelled with the Agenda 2000 programme, although they can be used in crop rotation schemes involving other crops such as corn.
Grain legumes are covered by their own scheme where the amount of fixed aid per hectare is EUR 181 and the maximum guaranteed area is 400 000 hectares.
The scheme was established in 1989 when the growing area of grain legumes was reduced at the expense of corn, which was already suffering from overproduction.
The special scheme aimed to preserve traditional legume grain growing areas by means of the aid per hectare arrangement.
What are the conclusions of the Commission' s report?
An examination of how the scheme has been applied reveals that the MGA of 400 000 hectares has been systematically exceeded.
There are two conclusions to be drawn from this.
First, the aim of the scheme has been successfully achieved and, second, the growing areas have to be brought under better control.
The MGA overruns in the last few years have shown themselves to be mainly with regard to vetches.
Although the scheme is being applied satisfactorily as a whole, MGA management is problematic, as those responsible for the overruns are not being treated any differently from other producers.
So how could the system be improved?
We should aim to find solutions regarding improvements within the framework of the present scheme and the appropriations set aside for it.
We are in a situation in which the Agenda 2000 reform has been adopted and international trade negotiations are drawing closer.
I would like to point out that the rapporteur' s proposed amendment whereby the current aid scheme for vetch farmers could be combined with another market arrangement, i.e., that for seed vetches, would not achieve the improvement desired.
This is a reference to Amendment No 2.
It cannot be adopted for two reasons: firstly, the schemes are mutually exclusive, as in one scheme the seeds, in principle, have to be harvested as animal feed, while, in the other, they are designated for sowing.
The other reason is that it might involve extra expense.
The Commission' s report recommends that the MGA should be divided into two parts based on the earlier land area division in the proportion 40/60. It would divide up thus: 1 600 000 hectares would be used for the production of lentils and chickpeas, and 240 000 hectares would be used for the production of vetches.
In addition, it is proposed that the Management Committee for Dried Fodder be replaced by the Management Committee for Cereals.
The purpose of this change is only to legally endorse what has become common practice on the committees.
Finally, I would like to say that the Commission will adopt the rapporteur' s amendments that reinforce its position, proposing that the Commission submit a new report, as in Amendment No 3, and seek ways of improving the system, as in Amendment No 1.
Members of the European Parliament, in the light of my comments, the proposal will probably not be difficult to adopt so that it can be applied from the marketing year 2000 - 2001 onwards.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
Additionality
The next item is the debate on the following oral questions to the Commission:
B5-0207/2000, by Mrs Evans and others, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, on additionality
B5-0209/2000, by Mr Davies and Mrs Attwooll, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, on the additionality principle in Structural Fund appropriations.
Mr President, Commissioner, the purpose of the Structural Funds is to target the poorest and most run-down areas of the European Union, those in greatest need of development, with extra money to help them begin to rebuild the economy, create jobs and regenerate poorer communities.
Additionality is meant to ensure that happens and to prevent governments from using EU funding to replace their own aid as this would defeat the object.
But in many regions and nations that is what happens at the moment and I can illustrate the problem using the example of Wales.
The granting of EU Objective 1 status to West Wales and the Valleys last year was an acknowledgement of the poverty in two-thirds of the country.
EUR 1.2 billion of European funding used effectively could provide exactly the additional help that is intended.
But if we look at the government budget to Wales, in practice there will be no more government spending next year with Objective 1 than there is this year before Objective 1.
The National Assembly budget which comes from the Treasury remains the same so that in the first fifteen months, at least, of the new programme period there are no additional resources at all.
The money will be taken from other budgets in the National Assembly, such as health and education.
Therefore central government expenditure is reduced.
Under the Structural Funds, areas of greatest need are identified and selected on regional criteria.
Yet when the Commission looks at additionality it is dealt with on a Member State level.
This is a clear contradiction.
The rules as they stand allow this to happen.
Member States are not legally required to demonstrate additionality at the regional or programme level.
I agree with the statement made by Commissioner Barnier in a written reply to me when he said that the spirit of additionality rather than the letter of the law on the matter is an important consideration.
We need the revision of the system and a central part of that is looking at additionality internally in the Member States at the programme level as well as at the Member State level.
Mechanisms need to be in place to ensure that Member States respect the principle and the spirit of additionality so that funds are targeted and spent effectively.
So we are asking in this question, Commissioner, for confirmation that this will be done and I look forward to the vote on this debate in April.
Mr President, the principle of additionality exists in order to ensure that transfers to the Member States under the Structural Funds add to, rather than replace, national expenditures on structural development measures.
In this way, European Union structural policies will have a greater impact on reducing regional and social disparities.
The ex-ante verification of additionality is at present being undertaken in application of Article 11 of Regulation 1260/99.
This is an integral part of the negotiation of the Structural Funds programmes with the Member States.
This exercise is a demonstration of the Member States' intention to implement the principle of additionality over the programming period that lies ahead.
Where necessary, the Commission may request clarification from the Member States on the details of their forecasts for eligible expenditure for the period 2000-2006.
As a further measure, the Commission has prepared detailed implementing provisions for inclusion in the programming documents covering both the situation ex ante and also the mid-term and final verification of additionality.
The second issue covered by the questions is the possibility of the verification of additionality at regional level.
I would like to develop a number of elements of previous answers.
Firstly, although additionality is implemented at the level of the overall eligible spending by the Member States rather than at regional level, it must be borne in mind that the overall additionality required to be demonstrated is, by definition, the sum of the eligible expenditures at the lower level.
In practice, reduced national eligible expenditure in some regions would have to be balanced with an increase in other regions in order for additionality to be respected overall.
On this point the Commission can give a clear assurance that, where evidence exists of reduced national expenditure in a given region or regions, it will be particularly attentive with regard to the credibility of the overall figures.
A second point of clarification concerns the scope of additionality and the suggestion that, when implemented at national level, it may be incompatible with the regional vocation of the Structural Funds.
It must be borne in mind that the development-related expenditure of a Member State which is taken into account for the assessment of additionality is generally a mixture of resources allocated and managed at national level and those managed at regional level.
While there might be some categories of expenditure for which stability could be expected at regional level between the programming periods, it could hardly be suggested that the level of spending on, for example, major infrastructure should be maintained at the same level in each region regardless of current needs.
This is why the Commission takes the view that the strict application of additionality at regional level would lead to excessive rigidity in the management by the Member States of their own development expenditure.
Finally, regarding budgetary provisions within the Member States between the central government and the regions, the Commission can only repeat that these are matters exclusively for national consideration and are not related to additionality as defined in the regulations.
Mr President, can I begin by thanking my colleague from Wales - though from another party, Jillian Evans, for raising this issue.
I do not think that there is a more important issue in Wales at the moment than the application of Objective 1 funds and it is important to look at the background to the issues that we are currently considering.
There are two major news stories breaking in the United Kingdom today.
One is the shock news of BMW's decision to break up the Rover-Land Rover Group with the threat of massive redundancies right the way across the UK and the other breaking news this morning is the Conservative Party's stunning victory in the Ayr by-election driving the defending Labour Party into a miserable third place with a swing of almost 10%.
Now these stories are not just topical background to this debate.
In my view, they underpin the very issues which we are considering in the context of Structural Fund spending under Objectives 1 and 2 in those parts of the European Union which are facing major economic problems.
As we have already heard from Jillian Evans, a major part of Wales, in constituencies which I also represent, has been granted Objective 1 status, but sadly ever since that announcement was made by the Commission, our problems in Wales have actually got even worse.
As a direct result of what I would describe as UK government policy, our agricultural economy has all but collapsed.
Farm incomes are at their lowest level for a generation and this decline is also hitting the manufacturing sector.
I do not apologise for saying that the massive overvaluation of sterling which gives the UK Labour Chancellor an electoral war-chest of unprecedented proportions has handicapped every Welsh and UK manufacturer trying to export into the European market.
It is little wonder that BMW blames the Rover decision directly on UK government economic policy, but that I fear is little comfort to the thousands of workers in Rover who have strained to improve the efficiency of the company only to find that their efforts have been undermined in Downing Street.
I turn then to the central hand of Labour government at work in terms of the European Structural Funds package.
The unacceptable behaviour of the UK Government over this has already brought about the timely end of the political career of the first Secretary of the Welsh Assembly.
Sadly, the Structural Funds spending issues have been marked by delay by disputes in relation to matched funding and also in relation to the issue of additionality.
Lest it be raised later in this debate let me make it clear: this is not a new issue and I share the view that it is an issue that needs to be examined very carefully by the Commission itself.
I have the honour to be appointed as the rapporteur on the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee for the Structural Funds guidelines 2000-2006 and the committee agreed on that occasion, based on our recommendations to the Regional Policy Committee, that the Commission should pay attention to this issue of additionality.
We reiterated the importance of ensuring that Structural Funds do not just merely, as it were, replace public spending otherwise earmarked for those areas that are lagging behind.
I am rather sorry that the Regional Policy Committee did not incorporate that in the report themselves, but there it is.
There are a number of questions that I would ask Commissioner Liikanen to take back to Commissioner Barnier.
I appreciate that he is the Commissioner in office today but he may not be in a position to respond to these points himself.
However, these are points that I seek to put in the context of certainly the area that I represent and I daresay they are points that would be supported by Jillian Evans on behalf of her party.
What progress is being made in relation to the approval of the programming documents within the Commission?
Will the Commissioner take the step in terms of transparency of publishing at an appropriate time the correspondence that has taken place between the Commission and the National Assembly?
We were assured, I am bound to say by a rather complacent Economic Secretary, who has now become the First Secretary, that all matters were proceeding in an orderly fashion.
Yet we hear from remarks that are made from time to time by the Commission that there are real problems and we find it difficult to do our job within this Parliament without that degree of transparency.
So, will the Commission undertake to make that information available to all Members of the European Parliament?
Will they undertake to keep us informed in relation to these matters?
Will they undertake to challenge Member State Governments in relation to the maps that have been drawn up in relation to Objective 2 where also there has been quite clear evidence of jerrymandering also.
The additionality issue is an important one, but I must say it is not the only one which gives much concern to many Members of this European Parliament.
Mr President, I should just like to touch on a couple of points that Mr Evans raised.
First of all, I acknowledge that there is difficulty in the Midlands with the Rover Group.
I would not like to make political capital out of it.
There are too many jobs at stake.
Secondly, he also mentioned their by-election.
I congratulate his party in securing a victory in this by-election.
But, unlike him, I have been in Ayr for the last three weeks, on the doorstep.
I can tell you that additionality was never raised once.
I turn to the question at hand.
I thank the Nationalists for having raised this.
It is right that we have a proper discussion on the whole question of the Structural Funds.
But I suspect there is a deeper plot here.
What are they actually trying to achieve?
I listened to Ms Evans.
Basically, what I took from her contribution is that she wants to redefine the Structural Funds regulations.
I would remind people in this Parliament that it was not so long ago that this Parliament passed, by the assent procedure, the rules and regulations governing the Structural Funds, including Article 11, which defines additionality.
Is it therefore Parliament's role now to change that?
We should not change that.
The role of this Parliament is to ensure that the rules are complied with.
That is what we should concentrate on.
I know that Ms Evans, along with one of her colleagues, Dafydd Wigley and a member of the Scottish Nationalist Party, Mr Wilson, went to meet Commissioner Barnier.
I should like to read out the statement made by Commissioner Barnier after that meeting:
"I know that there has been a great deal of debate in Scotland and Wales recently about European regional funding.
But I have the impression that this has sometimes confused two separate issues - additionality and cofinancing.
I am not surprised that there is a certain amount of confusion among the Nationalists on this.
Additionality, whether or not EU funds are providing additional impact, compared to what would otherwise have happened, can be used as one of the selection criteria by the local programme planners before they decide to approve aid to individual projects.
The Commission, on the other hand, is obliged by the rules to make a global assessment of additionality for the UK as a whole, with the specific aim of ensuring that the European financial aid is additional to, and not a substitute for, national finance.
We have always been satisfied in the past that the national requirements have been met" .
Mr President, it is clear from what the Commissioner has said that the Commission is conscientious in measuring the additionality of structural funding at Member State level, and it was good also to hear his assurances about the various different levels of evaluation that take place.
As the Commission will be aware, however, a number of Member States within the European Union have devolved systems of regional government.
Such regional systems of government are normally financed in whole or in part from central government funds.
It appears to me that, under the present rules, central government can build the EU contribution to structural funding into its calculations for determining regional government budgets.
There appears to be no mechanism, despite what the Commissioner said, for ensuring either of two things: first, that the additionality rule is applied to this calculation, and second, that the amount of EU funding which ultimately reaches individual regions corresponds directly to the amount earmarked for those regions at the planning stage.
At the very least, this engenders a lack of transparency.
It may also mean that the additionality principle is not being properly implemented on a region-by-region basis.
I accept, like Mrs Evans, that this does not, strictly speaking, contradict the letter of European Union law on this matter.
But, unlike her, it seems to me to be quite clearly contrary to the spirit of additionality rules and undermines the very purposes for which structural funding was established in the first place.
Although I come from Scotland, I know these issues are of concern not just to my Liberal Democrat colleagues from other parts of the United Kingdom but also to ELDR members representing regions across the whole of the European Union.
Mr President, first of all I would like to congratulate my Welsh colleague for her excellent speech and I am also glad that there is basic agreement from all sections of the political spectrum.
Some of us newcomers to this Parliament are already beginning to tire of good intentions, fantastic programmes and of hearing about the spirit of the Community regulations. Instead of spirit, we are going to end up with ghosts and sleepless nights because, in reality, commitments are not being fulfilled.
It is therefore appropriate for the European institutions themselves to start by making good their commitments with regard to additionality.
The Court of Auditors has already drawn up an assessment of the implementation of the additionality principle in June 1999 which shows that it is a total disaster and a mistake.
Secondly, we must take into account - and this is a political declaration - the real Europe, the citizens' Europe, the Europe of nations and nations within the States, because until these are taken into account, we will keep coming back to the same old problem.
Scotland, Wales, the Basque country, Catalonia, Galicia, even a region as large as Andalusia, cannot depend on the decisions of a central State, however much of a State it is.
Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to reiterate the words of Mr Miller, who spoke earlier - and who is regrettably no longer in the Chamber - when he criticised the authors of this question by saying that our main task is to ensure that the rules are complied with.
The first rules that need to be complied with are those in the Treaty, in this case, Article 158, which takes the objective of economic and social cohesion to its highest level.
Our task is to ensure that following on from this, the Commission' s regulations and behaviour attain and serve to attain these objectives.
Our task is also to be alert enough here to criticise and to raise the issue whenever we see that this is not being done.
We support the good timing and the reasoning of the issues raised by the authors of the oral question and we agree with the comments that have already been made here.
We call on the Commission to exert more pressure to ensure that these instruments are used effectively in favour of the regions with the greatest needs, instead of, as it seems to us, letting the objective of economic and social cohesion go cold.
This subject is obviously a delicate one, and its development has been discussed at great length over the years, with many rules being regularly revised, but what we cannot accept is that the revision of these rules and the development of the bureaucracy always hit the most needy.
We cannot, for example, accept the fact that problems have been raised about allocating funds to regions which are eligible under various programmes, because if these regions are eligible for various funds it is precisely because their needs are the greatest, and anything that hinders the operation of these funds holds back their development and threatens the objective of economic and social cohesion.
Similarly, we do not accept that the Commission should in any way associate itself with the degree of inertia shown by some national governments who are not prepared to support the regions with the greatest needs.
We therefore call on the Commission to...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, I have been watching this whole business of Structural Funds and additionality for many years, and there are a number of things that we can learn from the past.
The first is that the money in absolute terms in most regions of the Community is relatively small, and its impact is political rather economic - though that is important too.
I have often said it is important that we as a European Union should not just make regulations telling people what they may or may not do, but that we should extend what appears to the European public and to the regions of the Union to be tangible benefits.
Even in rich regions they will appreciate the fact that the European Union tries to help close the gap between rich and poor.
The other thing in the macro-economic sense that we can say is that, if a certain amount of Structural Funds is allocated to Portugal or Greece or Ireland, as it has been in the past, then that money goes into these states in any case and that is the first impact that it has.
The money is actually transferred and, regardless of whether the letter of the law is observed or not, the countries become the better off.
Another point that I would like to make is that we can learn from the past.
First of all, we have now tidied up the regulations to some extent, but originally they were written in an effort to please every sector and every political interest, so that it became impossible, with the staff that the European Commission had at its disposal, to police the spending of the money, and that is still the case to a large degree.

We are now into to the third or fourth programme.
What we must do is learn from the mistakes of the past and try and apply the lessons to the future.
If you want to be absolutely effective with the way this money is spent, what you need to do is to look at what a country has been spending previously, and to ask them to submit their plans to the European Commission.
The European Commission identifies the weaknesses in this plan and says: This is the way we would like our money to be spent in addition to what you have already allocated for all this work you intend to do.
In my personal experience in Ireland, I never heard the European Commission take Ireland to task for failure in the area of additionality.
But one should remember that, between 1982 and 1992, the Structural Funds to Ireland peaked; they are getting less now, and there was a generous amount of money.
But, from 1982 to 1992, the public capital programme actually reduced, including Structural Funds.
It reduced in real terms by 30%.
So where did the Structural Funds go?
The Structural Funds actually went into public sector pay and social welfare, and it is very questionable as to whether they did a good or a bad turn to the Irish economy in those years, because they contributed to inflation and increased wage demands.
So there are lessons to be learned: set against the staff the Commission had at its disposal to deal with the Irish problem - three or four people - Ireland had 30 000 civil servants, and the Irish Civil Service won every time!
Mr President, I am going to refer to a subject that none of the previous speakers has discussed.
I am referring to the report by the Court of Auditors on the principle of additionality.
This is a report that was published in the Official Journal of the European Communities on 9 March.
This report contains a very interesting section - section 62 - that discusses privatisation.
Over the past few years, various European Union governments have enthusiastically embarked on a policy of privatisation placing the heritage which previously belonged to the community in very few hands.
In Spain, for example, over the last four years, public companies have been privatised to the tune of 4 billion, with a B for Barcelona or Brussels. These public companies have passed into the hands of private individuals.
Mr Liikanen is an expert in accounting, and knows that privatisation is a form of public disinvestment and, specifically, that it can be a form of regional disinvestment.
If, for example, an airline providing regional services was privatised, regional disinvestment could occur, and we would thus be infringing the principle of additionality.
The Court of Auditors has referred to this, saying that Member States are aware that spending decreases as a result of privatisation and it is in their interests to reduce it.
Taking into account the importance of the categories of spending affected, telecommunications, energy, etc., this simple operation can substantially modify the final result.
And we also have the response by the Commission, which must be very recent, and which Commissioner Liikanen, as a member of the College, must remember perfectly.
The Commission replies here with a system that we call the Olendorf method, a method of language-learning that consists of the teacher asking the student "Have you got my uncle's underpants?" and the student replying "No, but I have my grandmother's glasses" .
And the response given to us by the Commission in section 62 is very short.
It says: "Although the private sector sometimes invests in sectors that are traditionally considered public, it would be incredibly difficult to increase the verification of additionality in private investments, as this would imply the collection and examination of the accounts of a number of private companies which would not be obliged to provide the corresponding information to the national authorities or to the Commission" .
That is, the Commission is replying using the Olendorf method.
We have here Commissioner Liikanen who knows the subject very well, and perhaps he could give us a more specific response, as I believe that this considerably affects the core of additionality.
The second issue is that the Berlin financial forecasts anticipated a substantial reduction in the Structural Funds.
This year we have EUR 29 430 million. In the year 2006 we will have a nominal figure of EUR 26 600 million, that is to say, a reduction of 14% over seven years.
Taking into account inflation, I can calculate that there is a reduction of 20%.
That is, from now until 2006, the Structural Funds will lose over 20% compared with the current figure, which means that it will be very difficult to meet the needs we are meeting today and, as we have heard, there are still many problems in many Community regions.
There is a further problem, which should also not be hidden from the Commission or the members of this House: we are talking about the impending enlargement of the European Union with thirteen new Member States, most of which have a far lower average income than that of the poorest regions of the Community and there are no plans to fulfil cohesion policies with regard to these candidate Member States.
I know that the Commission will not be able to give me a reply on this question, but I am drawing the attention of the House and the Commissioner to the problem that this will cause with regard to Community cohesion policies.
Mr President, while I endorse everything that Mr Medina Ortega has said, I would like to say that, although we are a tiny Group with very little time to speak, I did refer to the report of the Court of Auditors that he mentioned, which is indeed from 9 March this year.
Mr President, Commissioner, as has been said here, EU funds cannot replace Member States' public expenditure and the structural aid that runs parallel with it.
This principle of additionality is important to reduce regional disparities, which is the aim of the Union' s regional and structural policies.
The Commission must oblige the Member States to work in such a way that the principle of additionality is implemented both nationally and regionally.
I suspect that this principle is being seriously violated in the Member States.
The effect of the Union' s regional policy is dramatically weakened by governments drastically reducing national, public and structural aid and subsidies, even in excess of what is coming into a region via Union funds.
In some cases this violation is covered up by including as national regional funds development funds, which are mainly, however, targeted at the fastest growing areas.
The regional failure to observe the principle of additionality aggravates the situation with regard to internal regional disparities within Member States, which runs counter to the aims of the Union' s regional policy.
President, it is a great pity indeed that Commissioner Barnier has been unable to be present here this morning, because this is a matter within his brief which is causing great concern not only in Scotland and Wales but in other parts of the Union.
It is a matter of real concern because it is made to appear as though a scheme which is supposed to provide specific help really ends up just been a conjuring trick between the Commission and the national governments in which extra money is supposed to be coming in, but we are told afterwards it makes no difference whether extra money went into the particular region as long as it went into the country as a whole.
That is simply unacceptable.
We are further told, however, that all is well, because the additionality rules in the regulation are being carried through properly.
Yet the Court of Auditors, in the very report that we have been talking about, says the following things: the difficulties encountered are caused by the limited development of the principle in terms of concepts and methodology and the joint failure to find appropriate and effective procedures for verifying it.
And then two paragraphs later, the identification of the structural assistance interventions in the eligible regions is unreliable, and this leads to the inclusion of a large number of estimates and hypotheses which are difficult to verify.
'Difficult' indeed, Sir.
No wonder that this causes disquiet throughout the Community and let us ask the Commission to give it its full attention.
Mr President, one of the main problems arising in this whole issue is that there is not any legal sanction from Europe to ensure that Member States adhere to the excellent concept of additionality.
I think we must look in detail at that problem, and we need also better coordination between DGs on this issue.
Additionality is your concept, and it is up to you to ensure that it works effectively in Member States.
We understand as well, of course, the problems you are facing concerning the overlapping of programmes, creating problems of continuity for you.
Verification is another matter that needs to be tackled with Member States, because they are guilty as well.
We understand your problems, that they are not providing for you sufficient data in good time, especially with Objectives 2, 3 and 4, to enable you to ensure that the system works more effectively.
One of the worst offenders in this connection is the UK.
No additional money has been built into the budget of our Welsh Assembly.
This is clear non-compliance.
The European Parliament and the European Union admit that our nation of Wales is poor and yet the UK government, not only the Labour government, has not complied with additionality.
It is all very well for my colleague Jonathan Evans to imply that his party is not guilty.
For eighteen long years the concept of additionality was not complied with by his government either.
I think some momentum is being lost, Mr President.
I was talking to councils in Wales yesterday.
They need this scheme to go ahead.
It is in line with the excellent principle of cohesion, and we ask the Commission to adhere to that and to assist the poorest regions in the European Union.
Mr President, I had not expected to speak today because I represent the south-east of England which is one of the more prosperous regions of England and of Europe.
We pay the taxes that make up the grants that other areas receive.
We have no Objective 1 funding.
What Objective 2 funding we had has been reduced by the present government and the Conver Fund that used to be very helpful is now being phased out.
So, why do I speak?
Because even in the south-east of England there are pockets of deprivation.
In particular I want to speak of the Isle of Wight, a beautiful island with 130 000 good people but 68% GDP per head of the European average - a very poor region.
It gets no support from Europe.
Why not?
It does not get the grant from Europe because at NUTS II it is classified with Hampshire.
Hampshire is a prosperous county - 100% of European average so, no money for the Isle of Wight.
Yet, it has a population of 130 000, a bigger population than the Ãland Islands which are NUTS II and do get grants from the European Union.
The island has taken its case against the British Government that it feels is treating it unfairly, to the High Court in London.
I think they might win that case.
As far as Europe is concerned, on my advice, they took their case to the Ombudsman because we believed that EUROSTAT, by refusing to define the Isle of Wight as a separate NUTS II region, was treating the island unfairly.
This week, in what I would say is a landmark ruling by the European Ombudsman, he has said that constitutes maladministration by EUROSTAT and by the European Commission.
Let me read out his ruling: "In the present case the Commission has not provided the Ombudsman with elements which show that EUROSTAT, when deciding not to classify the Isle of Wight as a separate NUTS II region, has taken into account all relevant factors including Article 158 of the Treaty and the Viola report of the European Parliament" .
He has recommended that the Commission and EUROSTAT should look again at this particular problem.
I would ask the Commission to consider fairly this recommendation that has come from the Ombudsman so that I can go back to the people of the Isle of Wight and say that this issue will be looked at again, that they can expect the Commission to treat fairly the particular problems and concerns of the island.
Then we can get in on this act of additionality and take up our fight with the British Government to make sure that we get support from Europe and from the British Government to treat fairly an island which to date has not been fairly treated either by the British Government or by the European Union.
- Mr President, Tony Blair and Donald Dewar will not have slept well last night!
Their worst nightmares have turned out to be reality.
The Labour Party heartlands of Scotland have sent them an unmistakable message.
The Scottish Labour voter - for so long taken for granted - has spoken.
The Scottish Conservative Party candidate in Ayr, John Scott, has humiliated Labour into third place - 5 000 or more votes behind.
This will only get worse for Labour when the truth about their incompetent and cynical administration of the European Union's Structural Funds becomes better known and better understood.
Because of the Labour Government's tardiness in submitting its proposed maps nine months late in December instead of March last year, it is still struggling to come up with acceptable specific projects.
Scottish local authorities are left not knowing whether or not the projects which they are having to underwrite will indeed obtain Structural Fund support.
Commissioner: three questions:
When do you expect to be able to provide certainty for the Scottish regions and the badly needed projects which are looking for EU support?
Are you satisfied with the preparedness of the Scottish Executive to provide the necessary matching funding and to assure you that it is truly additional?
Or is it all just the usual Labour/Liberal coalition hot air, all mouth, while feet drag along the cobbled streets of Edinburgh and European money is hijacked by the Treasury in London?
I have listened carefully to this interesting debate and I will transmit all the questions which were raised here to my colleague, Mr Barnier, and he will respond accordingly.
I am sure he will send you his replies at least to all those issues which concern Structural Funds and additionality.
Mr President, inevitably Commissioner Liikanen was not in a position other than to reply formally to the debate and say that he had heard what had been said and would pass it on.
That is not very satisfactory from the point of view of the many Members of this House who made important points.
I request that Mr Barnier gives a written summary of his response to these points.
I am sure that Commissioner Barnier will be willing to follow up on this interesting debate.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on 11 April.
Adjournment of the session
Ladies and gentlemen, I wish you a good weekend and I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
(The sitting was closed at 10.50 a.m.)
Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday 17 March 2000.
Statement by the President
Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, on Tuesday a terrible accident took place in Kitzsteinhorn, near Salzburg.
Eleven people were killed in an avalanche and that is not the final death toll.
It may be worse yet.
The next few hours will tell.
I would simply like to tell you that at these difficult times my thoughts, indeed our thoughts go out to the victims of this disaster and to their families.
Madam President, the verbatim report of proceedings for 16 March did not record my speech in full.
I should like to correct it because the meaning has been distorted.
It says: "I am therefore able to tell the House that both Felix Habsburg-Lothringen and Karl Ludwig Habsburg-Lothringen have valid passports without any form of restriction."
Now comes the mistake: "Neither signed the declarations of renunciation required by the constitutional office, because they "have distanced" themselves from the house of Habsburg" is what is recorded in the verbatim report of proceedings.
It should read "will never distance" .
Madam President, I call upon you, our President, but also upon the Council and the Commission to clarify certain questions, raised by the events of the last few days, with the Turkish government.
Firstly, the existence of a blacklist of Members of Parliament and representatives of NGOs whom the Turkish government deems undesirable.
Secondly, the arrest, which took place at the very time when a delegation from the European Parliament was visiting Turkey, of Akin Birdal, a human rights campaigner who, apart from anything else, was in a very poor state of health when he was taken back into custody.
In addition to this, there has been a marked return to suppression of journalistic activities, which has been documented in a report by other sources as well.
We feel that these actions taken by Turkey against Members of Parliament are cause for very serious concern.
I would like the Turkish government to be asked to clarify whether blacklists also exist for European countries other than Italy.
Thank you, Mrs Morgantini.
We shall, of course, look into the matter thoroughly.
Madam President, I am rising to speak about what has just been said by Mrs Morgantini.
In my capacity as chairman of the Socialist delegation which visited Turkey, on Monday evening, after speaking to the Prime Minister, Mr Ecevit, to raise the situation of Mr Birdal and Mrs Zana, and to express our concern - and I would like to point out that we were able to receive the first report which is being discussed by the Turkish government on adapting the Turkish constitution and legislation to the Copenhagen criteria - we held a meeting in the Commission' s headquarters in Ankara with representatives of the NGOs, including Mr Birdal, who participated very actively in the meeting.
Yesterday, Tuesday morning, Mr Birdal went to prison to serve the sentence that the Turkish courts have imposed on him.
From Turkey we expressed our vigorous condemnation of the fact that a person who has fought for human rights for many years, like Mr Birdal - who has not paid with his life in this struggle, although he has unfortunately paid with his health - had gone to prison.
We also expressed our opinion - which I believe is not only that of the Socialist Group but also of the whole of this House - that, in order to set Turkey on a path which may lead to a good relationship conducive to full accession, it is clearly necessary - as the Turkish government is now saying - to amend the constitution and the legislation and also to implement a law of amnesty so that people such as Mrs Zana, who is in prison, or Mr Birdal, who has just gone to prison, do not have to pay for crimes of opinion which fortunately do not exist in any of our countries.
Madam President, you will remember perfectly that, at the last plenary part-session which we held here in Brussels, all the political groups, without exception, condemned the murder of the Basque Socialist Member of Parliament, Fernando Buesa, at the hands of ETA.
Since then, Madam President, dozens of Spanish and Basque citizens have been victims of attacks, extortion and threats of a type that can only be described as fascist.
In fact, almost every day we witness events that take us back to the darkest days of European history.
The Spanish journalist, Carlos Herrera, is a symbol of all those victims, Madam President, and I would like to ask you, on behalf of the European Parliament, to convey to him our feeling of solidarity, because this solidarity expresses the unquestionable defence of freedom of expression that we, as democrats, are obliged to make.
Thank you, Mr Galeote Quecedo.
Of course, we all remember the very moving debate we had right here on the subject.
We can assure the journalist in question of this institution' s complete solidarity and opposition to this truly disgraceful act of terrorism.
Madam President, I would like to inform the House of an incident which occurred at a joint meeting between the European Parliament Delegation for relations with Canada and its Canadian counterpart, which was here on a visit last week.
Mr Sturdy, the chairman of our delegation, was unable to attend at that precise time, Madam President, but he has written to you this morning to confirm what I am about to say.
Something quite astonishing for this type of meeting occurred.
The chairman of the Canadian delegation suddenly launched into the most obnoxious personal attacks upon myself, for no reason whatsoever, to the point that the other members of his delegation spoke up to disassociate themselves from his words.
Everyone was quite dumbfounded by this attitude.
This is regrettable in the extreme, since this was an otherwise excellent visit, and because we wish to maintain the best relations with Canada, after so many difficult years, principally due to conflicts over fishing.
It is imperative to restore good relations, and we therefore deplore this incident most strongly.
Madam President, I should like you to ask the Canadian government for some explanation of the significance of these declarations.
Of course, Mr Berthu.
This is certainly a quite regrettable incident.
Indeed, I seem to remember, as you have just stated, that the members of the Canadian delegation expressed their regrets at this incident and offered their apologies.
Madam President, 13 April will see the start of the trial, in Iran, of thirteen Iranian citizens who are of the Jewish religion.
Since they are being charged with spying for the United States and Israel - who have denied any connection with them - there is every likelihood that the thirteen citizens could face the death penalty.
Madam President, I know that you have already intervened, at the request of certain Members of Parliament, to request that a delegation of the European Parliament be allowed to attend the trial, but if I am not mistaken, the Iranian government has, as yet, neither granted nor refused our request.
I must ask you to intervene once again, and I also call upon the Commission to intervene, to ensure that human rights are fully observed in the course of this trial, so that thirteen people are not condemned to death for reasons unknown, given that this Parliament has repeatedly declared its opposition to the death penalty.
I would like to thank you in advance for your efforts and for the endeavours of Parliament and the European Commission to protect freedom and respect for the rights of the defence in the trial of these thirteen Iranian Jews.
Mr Tajani, you are quite right.
I did approach the Iranian government, but received no response.
You can count on me, therefore, to try again.
Tomorrow' s agenda includes the topic of human cloning.
It is important for Members of the House, as they prepare for that debate, to be aware that the scientists who work behind the research which led to the patent have given a categorical assurance that their project has nothing to do with cloning and it has not at any point been directed in that direction.
This does not affect any of the central questions in the debate about the conduct of the Patent Office but since it relates to the reputation of individuals I think it fair and proper that this should be noted by Members of the House.
I should also mention an interest of my own since I am a professor of the University on unpaid leave of absence from that institution which is also involved.
Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to get on with the items on the agenda.
I do not think that all these contributions are genuine points of order.
We do still have two of them, though.
Madam President, I shall be very brief.
We share Mr Galeote Quecedo' s disapproval of the displays of politically motivated violence in the Basque country.
Having said that, I think it would be a more accurate analysis and a fairer representation of the facts if we attributed this violence to its real instigators.
The murderers of the Basque country are not inspired by the doctrine of Benito Mussolini, but by Marxism.
These are the extreme left-wing ideas represented in this House.
Unless we therefore consider that they benefit...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Let us see if Mr Katiforis' contribution is a genuine point of order.
Madam President, I would simply like to follow up what Mrs Morgantini said about the lists in Turkey.
It seems that there is also a list of Greek subjects and I see that Turkey' s Foreign Minister has stated that any country can make such lists.
Naturally, I imagine, he must mean any country that does not belong to the European Union ....
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr Katiforis, we shall look into it, thank you.
Welcome
Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the House I should like to welcome to the visitors gallery the Scottish Parliament' s European Committee, led by Mr Hugh Henry, its convenor.
The Scottish Parliament is one of the newest institutions within the European Union since, as you know, elections to the parliament were held in May 1999 and the Parliament was opened in July that year.
Indeed it was our former fellow Member, Mrs Ewing, whom I must welcome more particularly, who opened the first sitting of the Scottish Parliament.
(Applause)
Agenda
The next item is the order of business.
Relating to Wednesday
I must inform you that the Commission statement on the decisions taken at today' s meeting is to be presented by Mr Byrne and that it will deal with general product safety.
Furthermore, the Council has requested that we bring the debate on hushkits forward on the agenda and enter it immediately after the Commission statement on general product safety.
Are there any objections to this request?
There do not seem to be any objections.
In that case, this will be the arrangement.
(Mr Gollnisch spoke to object and to request that this be put to the vote)
Mr Gollnisch, I take note of your contribution, and we shall, of course, put the matter to the vote.
It is your right as a Member of Parliament.
I shall therefore put to the vote the request to bring forward the debate on hushkits.
(Parliament gave its assent)
Both the Group of the Party of European Socialists and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance have requested that the debate on the oral question to the Commission on the subject of night flights and aircraft noise levels be postponed until the April part-session in order to have a little more time to prepare the matter.
Are there any objections?
(Mr Gollnisch spoke to request that this be put to the vote) We shall put the request made by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance to the vote.
(Parliament gave its assent)
Relating to Thursday
Regarding the Council and Commission statements on the Echelon system, the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs has requested that the vote on a joint motion for a resolution at the close of the debate be postponed until the April part-session in Strasbourg in order to enable the groups to assess the information given to them in the course of the debate.
I shall give the floor to Mr Watson, who is the chairman of this committee.
We will hear statements by the Commission and Council presidency tomorrow on the interception of communications.
It is a sensitive subject. It is one where the powers of the Union are strictly circumscribed and the major political groups have not wished to take a position until they have heard the Council and the Commission.
So we are asking that the vote be postponed to the April part-session and that the deadline for putting down motions under Rule 37 of our Rules be re-opened to allow the committee eventually to table a motion on this issue.
The item is on the agenda of our next committee meeting.
Madam President, I should like to speak in support of this motion.
I must say I find it extremely sensible, since the debate is to take place shortly and we are awaiting details which will enable us to give a more informed opinion on this very important issue.
I feel, in any case, that it is generally sensible, Madam President, not to give an opinion until one is in possession of all the facts, and, in particular, to wait until the speaker has come to the end of his speaking time before deciding on a point of order.
Is there any objection to Mr Watson' s request on behalf of his committee to postpone voting on the resolution on the Echelon system until the April part-session?
There do not seem to be any objections.
(Parliament gave its assent)
General product safety - BSE tests
The next item is the Commission statement on general product safety.
Madam President, there were two issues within my area of competence dealt with in the Commission this morning and I have the pleasure and the honour to report to Parliament on both of these issues.
The first one as you mentioned, relates to the proposals on the amendment of the directive on general product safety.
I am very pleased to be able to present to you the draft revision of the directive on general product safety which the Commission has approved today.
The idea behind the directive is in fact quite simple.
Only safe food or industrial products are to be placed on the market, and this means European products as well as imported products.
The two key objectives of the general product safety directive are, firstly, to ensure a high and consistent level of protection for consumer health and safety throughout Europe and, secondly, to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market.
We have undertaken an extensive stocktaking exercise on the implementation of the present directive.
The report on the main findings will be circulated in parallel to the draft revision of the directive.
While the general approach of the directive is sound, experience has revealed certain weaknesses which we are now trying to correct.
We first wish to clarify the scope of the directive.
This directive is meant to provide consistent assurances of the safety of products for consumers.
It is also meant to fill possible gaps in sectoral legislation, for instance market surveillance or emergency procedures, which are rarely foreseen in specific pieces of legislation.
However, it does not apply where a specific sector of legislation covers the same aspects under consideration.
We want to make sure that the directive gives the best coverage possible to products used by consumers.
This also means products which have migrated from the professional field to personal use, for instance laser pointers, and secondly products which are used to provide a service.
Two examples of that would be hair-dryers in a hair salon or equipment in a gym centre.
We want to have a more efficient system.
This implies, therefore, additional obligations for producers and distributors to provide information.
This is probably the most important element in this amended set of provisions.
The present situation is in fact far from ideal.
It is quite extraordinary that, for example, the authorities of a Member State were informed by the United States of a particular product that was dangerous because the provisions that prevail in the European Union do not provide for this.
This notification is compulsory in the United States but not so far in the European Union.
This particular provision is designed to rectify that situation.
I also want a reinforcement of the market surveillance by Member States.
As you know, there is no good law if it is not applied properly.
Member States now will be required to strengthen the tasks of the surveillance authorities.
They will be required to establish sanctions; they will have to develop links with other Member States as well, in particular through a network of enforcement authorities of the Member States.
This is also extremely important from an industry point of view in order to make sure that a level playing field is maintained between competitors, especially in relation to imported goods.
We also want to improve the rapid alert system, a system which is operated by the Commission to monitor the information on dangerous products and measures taken.
The scope of Rapex, as it is called, is extended to cover voluntary measures taken by industry to withdraw a product.
The practical operation of the system will be improved.
We now also foresee the possibility of opening the system to third countries, in particular candidate countries.
We also intend to introduce provisions to simplify the procedures for emergency measures at Community level, so that we can take rapid action with the advice of a regulatory committee.
I will mention here that we have now introduced an export ban for products withdrawn at Community level.
Another point to which I wish to draw your attention is improved transparency.
Consumers often lack confidence because they do not know what is happening.
We believe that in line with the general policy of the Commission, citizens have the right to know which real dangers they are exposed to and the measures taken.
The limitations to this is, of course, professional secrecy, as defined in Article 287 of the Treaty, but that of course is except when there are overriding public health considerations.
To conclude, I will say that consumers should be confident that products on the market are regulated in a consistent manner, that dangerous products are monitored in an appropriate way and that information is provided.
I believe that this draft directive can effectively contribute to our common goal of ensuring a high level of consumer health and safety and I look forward to more detailed discussions with Members of Parliament in future on this issue.
Could I, on behalf of my group, assure the Commissioner that these proposals are welcome and just ask him a couple of questions about them: firstly, could he say more about the consultation programme regarding the candidate countries?
It is urgent that those countries which aspire to join the European Union should be perfectly clear about the changing nature of the acquis communautaire and the regulations that they will have to follow.
Is there to be a regular process of dialogue in which they will be involved?
Secondly, could I ask about the process whereby dangerous products, or products that are deemed to be dangerous, are removed from the market.
In this instance, is it the case that it will be possible to speed up the procedure under the rapid reaction process for taking something out of the marketplace once it is perceived to be dangerous?
Finally, could I ask him about those products about which many people, including myself, have been in correspondence with him, which are thought to be dangerous but are not so regarded at this stage by the Commission?
Flammable furniture would be a case I have in mind.
Is there going to be a widening of the area of scrutiny which will take into account products of this sort?
Thank you, Mr Whitehead for those words of support which I greatly welcome.
Let me say in relation to your question on candidate countries that there is an ongoing discussion in relation to this issue.
My service and Mr Verheugen' s service, which, of course, is the lead service for enlargement, are in discussion on this, not only on issues relating to public health, but also protection of consumers.
Issues such as this particular provision will also be the focus of our attention.
In relation to the second part of your question, the rapid removal of dangerous goods, I would like to reassure you that under the rapid alert system, the Rapex system, there will be a speedy removal of products that have been found to be dangerous from the market.
Thirdly, I am aware of your concern in relation to flammable furniture and other items, and these are being kept under review.
Commissioner, you have just made the very important point that consumers should be able to be confident.
They should be able to be confident in all areas and that a whole raft of instruments seems to have been implemented to that end, particularly the White Paper on consumption and food safety.
Today, in order to give more meaning to all the current thinking on consumer safety and in order to reconcile Europe with civil society, particularly that society which successfully made its views felt in Seattle and elsewhere, expressing its anxieties about food quality and food safety, could the Commission not take the initiative of organising a forum for a large-scale debate between, on the one hand, the responsible parties from the Commission, the representatives of governments and members of parliament, of course, but also the representatives of civil society, non-governmental organisations, consumers' organisations, and professionals involved in the sector, in such a way as to ensure that these debates filter down to the European citizen?
This would forestall fresh criticism of us as rather a remote body, a forum that does not sufficiently involve the citizen in all debates.
Would you be in favour of establishing a forum of this kind?
I can confirm that there are a number of proposals in the pipeline in relation to the very issue that you draw attention to.
For instance, my service is currently putting the final touches to the framework document on public health, and contained in that document is a reference to the establishment of a public health forum, where issues relating to public health, and by extension the food and consumer affairs you draw attention to, will be able to be discussed.
I have been concerned by the lack of the involvement of the civil society in the issues that you talk about, particularly in relation to trade.
I also attended the WTO talks in Seattle with a view to promoting the ideas that you refer to, that is the involvement of, and the provision of a voice for, civil society, NGOs and consumers generally in the talks surrounding the whole WTO issue.
So I can assure you, Mrs Auroi, that I am concerned about these issues.
I believe it is important that there should be a connection between the work in the Commission and civil society and of course this is something that the Directorate-General of which I have the honour to be the Executive Head, must be closely associated with.
I take that responsibility seriously and we will be moving along in this way.
Madam President, if there is to be an export ban on products banned in the Community, have you investigated and calculated how many jobs will be lost in Europe as a result?
Has this been agreed with the trade unions and employers' federations?
I have to stress, Madam President and Members of Parliament, that my responsibility rests in the area of public health and consumer protection.
I have said on a number of occasions, including in this Parliament, that the primary consideration must be the protection of the public.
In circumstances where there might be a conflict between the protection of consumers, particularly their health, and monetary issues, public health must, of course, take precedence.
That is not to say that the considerations that you draw attention to should be ignored.
They cannot, but in any situation of conflict where you have to choose one or the other, public health must always prevail.
Madam President, Commissioner, I wish to congratulate the Commission on this initiative, which I believe to be extremely important.
I would, however, like the Commissioner to explain how we can take such an initiative against the background of the common agricultural policy, which runs totally counter to promoting food safety and quality?
As the common agricultural policy basically pays for production, and is based solely on quantitative criteria, namely production levels, and as farmers receive money according to the amount they produce, how can we accept a directive like this unless we first make our agricultural policy a policy based on quality, a policy based on food safety?
Or is this simply a way of dealing with public opinion, as the public is increasingly suspicious of the food chain? We cannot change public opinion overnight on the basis of this agricultural policy.
Why not start by changing our agricultural policy so that it inspires complete confidence in consumers?
Let me say that the provisions that are contained in this particular legislative document relating to food will operate for such time until the general food law comes into operation.
You will be aware that our plans, which are set out in the White Paper on food safety, contain a provision relating to the introduction of legislation in respect of a general food law, and there are many other legal provisions contained in the White Paper which are designed to protect food safety, and by inference consumers.
In bringing forward that legislation, of course, it will be necessary to have detailed consultations with the other Commissioners, and in particular Commissioner Fischler, who has the responsibility for the CAP.
I can assure you, Mr Campos, that the interaction that takes place at Commission level on these issues puts a high premium on food safety.
It is my belief that there will not be, nor can there be allowed to be, any conflict between concerns relating to the development of farming and concerns relating to food safety.
Madam President, I too would like to say how much the Commission' s statements today have pleased me.
However, I would like to dwell on the point of transparency because, like yourself, I too Commissioner think that transparency is directly and mainly related to the public' s confidence in food safety.
However, you mentioned the concept of 'confidentiality' in connection with transparency, and I would like to ask you where this concept of 'confidentiality' begins and ends because I think this is the most sensitive point if we are to win back the trust of European citizens.
This particular provision deals with improved transparency, and, as I mentioned in my presentation to you earlier, we believe in the Commission that, in line with general policy, the citizens have a right to know the real dangers to which they are exposed, and what measures can be taken to protect them.
As I mentioned the limitation to this is professional secrecy or confidentiality as defined by Article 287 of the Treaty, except in circumstances where there is an overriding public health consideration. In those circumstances, the provisions contained in Article 287 must take a back seat.
In those circumstances both the Treaty itself and the legislative provision that is being brought forward here this afternoon deal with the very situation that you identify and provide adequate and full protection for the consumer and full transparency.
Let me also say that I fully agree with you that consumer confidence is best enhanced by the provision of full information.
Transparency is hugely important in this regard and any apprehension among consumers that some information is being kept from them does enormous damage to consumer confidence.
I am acutely aware of this issue and therefore I fully agree with the import of your question.
Madam President, Commissioner. Food safety, product safety - I should like to dwell on this aspect.
We know that meat production begins in the stall.
The talk at present is of a total declaration of feedingstuffs.
We have also seen that the feedingstuffs industry has gone straight on to the defensive because they say that what is being asked of them here is unrealistic.
My question is this: how can we protect our farmers as producers if, in the final analysis, they do not know what they are feeding their animals and are then held liable?
You ask how we can best protect our farmers as producers when they do not know what it is that they are feeding their animals.
There is a body of legislation in place that deals with animal feed and in the White Paper this issue is also addressed.
There are legislative provisions in the annex to the document which indicate the Commission' s intentions in relation to animal feed.
Mr President, I too would like to thank the Commissioner for this important directive, which, as he himself says, is intended to restore consumer confidence.
The Commissioner is bound to be aware of the fact that Belgian public opinion has taken quite a knock and consumer confidence has fallen in the wake of the dioxin crisis. So much so, in fact, that a committee of inquiry was set up in the Belgian Parliament at the time of the crisis.
I would like to ask the Commissioner a specific question about the rapid alert system.
The said committee of inquiry accused the Belgian government, the authorities responsible that is, of being too slow to implement the system.
This met with the response that the rapid alert system procedures are not very user-friendly, nor is it very clear as to when exactly the alarm has to be raised.
Is the Commissioner able to provide assurances that these new proposals will overcome this problem?
You are perfectly correct in what you say about the provision of information by the Belgian authorities in respect of the dioxin issue.
There was quite a considerable delay at that time which was a matter of concern to everybody, not only the Commission, but obviously Parliament as well.
It was of such concern to the Commission that proceedings were instituted by the Commission against Belgium in the Court of Justice.
That litigation remains in place, even though the other aspects of the particular problem that you raise have been resolved, because of the delay in reporting this particular matter to the relevant authorities and to the European Union.
Perhaps I might continue with the other aspect of my presentation to Parliament this afternoon, which deals with the proposal for the introduction of BSE tests, and I have pleasure in presenting this to Parliament this afternoon.
I have announced on several occasions that I consider the new rapid post-mortem tests to be one of the most important tools in our efforts to control BSE.
The Commission' s services have worked on a proposal to introduce these tests in BSE monitoring throughout the Community since September last year.
Currently we have three different tests which have been found to give excellent results when used to test animals with clinical signs of disease after their death.
The tests offer new opportunities to test a large number of animals on a routine basis.
An active monitoring programme carried out in Switzerland has demonstrated that the use of rapid post-mortem tests could significantly improve the efficacy of BSE monitoring, particularly if targeted on animals which die on farms or are sent for casualty slaughter.
Since 1998, the Community has a BSE surveillance programme in place which is based on the examination of animals with clinical symptoms suggestive of BSE.
The Commission now proposes to replace that programme with a new programme where each Member State tests a representative sample of dead-on-farm and casualty-slaughtered cattle in its territory.
Compared with the current monitoring, the sample size will be increased twenty-five to one hundredfold in each Member State depending on the size of the cattle population.
I expect that the proposed new monitoring will provide significantly better information on the incidence of BSE in the Community than we have at present.
I am also happy to be able to tell Parliament that these particular tests will produce a result within 24 hours.
We propose to test a minimum number of 65 000 animals per year in the whole Community, and the testing will start in January 2001.
The proposed decision does not in itself have implications on the Community budget but that is an issue that will be discussed in the special veterinary committee next week.
I commend these proposals to Parliament which have been put through the Commission this afternoon.
Madam President, Commissioner, it will come as no surprise to you that I am not satisfied.
I have quite a few questions.
Parliament has been calling for the BSE test to be made compulsory since the BSE control committee.
I have asked you time and again for quite some time now: do you not consider that making the test compulsory as late as January 2001 is too little by a long chalk and much too late, given that the BSE tests were assessed a year ago?
Do you also not consider, Mr Byrne, that taking dead animals and sick animals is not good enough and that you will only get a proper overview, i.e. carry out proper screening, by testing one animal in every five, six or ten thousand to be slaughtered, depending on the BSE status of the Member State?
Mr Byrne, if the only reason for this weak Commission proposal is the Member States' unwillingness to agree, are you prepared to tell the House which Member States refused to agree to a more ambitious proposal?
This particular proposal, as I have indicated, will be put before the SVC within the next week or so and, assuming that there is agreement there, it will get to the system much more quickly than envisaged.
In the event that there is not a clear agreement, then of course the appropriate procedures that are laid down have to be complied with, that is to go through the Agriculture Council and so on.
Then, of course, the systems have to be put in place in Member States to enable this to happen, so that the dates that I have put on this are, as it were, a conservative estimate.
It may very well be that it can happen in a shorter space of time.
Furthermore, a number of Member States have already announced that it is their intention to bring forward their own testing at Member State level, and it may very well be that we are going to have Member States introducing these systems in a shorter space of time.
One must always bear in mind, however, that a system such as this will require not only legislative provisions to be put in place but the technical details will also have to be arranged.
Tests will have to be available to ensure that the systems that are put in place are monitored and working properly.
All this has to be put in place to ensure that we get the best possible results for the work that has been undertaken and for the expense that is incurred.
So the best possible date that I can predict for all this to happen and the best estimate that I can give for a commencement date having regard to all these factors is January 2001.
But if Member States are in a position to do that earlier, so be it and so much the better.
Mr President, Commissioner, you have already partially answered the first question on samples.
I have a second question for you.
I am convinced that, with regard to the consumer, we would be taken more seriously by producers if we were also to do away with the slaughter of animals at risk and if we were to have the same legislation throughout the entire Community.
My second point, Commissioner, regards application in 2001.
I feel it is necessary, in addition, to include the elimination of the emergency slaughter of diseased animals, so that only actual casualties are subject to emergency slaughter.
Control would then be much tighter in the production sector, thus benefiting the consumer.
I fully agree that there is a concern relating to the high-risk offals and that is why I will be bringing forward proposals relating to the removal of SRMs.
We know that there is a proposal there already and that will now be fast-tracked.
I am hoping that this issue will be dealt with by the Agriculture Council in or about June, which will meet the concerns that are raised by the question.
Commissioner, we are particularly concerned because the decision that has been taken does not appear to be an adequate proper response to the anxiety of the consumers.
The testing is not systematic or is limited to sick animals or dead-on-farm animals, and so we are in no way giving the impression of adopting a quasi-systematic, and hence reliable, approach with regard to meat quality and to the epidemiological policy which might be implemented.
You have just said that public health takes priority over employment and economic considerations.
Do you not think that, in this instance, considerations of the costs of vaccines and money have taken precedence over consumer interests?
This particular proposal is targeted on, as you say, sick animals and animals that have been slaughtered as a result of emergency procedures, but it is not exclusively targeted on those.
The reason why it is targeted on those animals is because that is where we are likely to get the best and most accurate information.
In addition, however, it must be borne in mind that there are proposals relating to the removal of SRMs, which add another layer of security for the consumer.
Moreover you are aware of the proposals that are in existence relating to the control of animal feed containing meat and bonemeal.
So all these factors must be looked at together.
It is not just one proposal that we are putting forward to you this afternoon as being the only answer to the protection of consumers in respect of the consumption of beef.
There is a multi-layered response, there are many issues involved, and I have indicated a number of them to you this afternoon.
I wish to assure you that there is concern to ensure the maximum protection of consumers in respect of the consumption of all food, including beef.
Mr President, Commissioner. I share all the concerns expressed by previous speakers.
As a producer, it is in my interest to restore consumer confidence in the production of cattle and sheep and related products.
My question to you, Commissioner, is this: so far, thank God, Austria has not had a single case of BSE.
Will these tests also be carried out in Austria?
Yes, these tests will be carried out in every Member State, including Austria.
Only by carrying out these tests in all Member States can we have the kind of security that we believe is necessary.
Many of you have spoken about the need to put before anything else the protection of consumers, food safety and public health, and in those circumstances the scheme that we have devised for these tests is predicated on the basis that to acquire the most valuable and accurate information it is necessary to carry out the tests throughout the European Union.
Just in order to concentrate the minds of the Member States, can we ask what the Commission, and indeed the SVC, have concluded as a result of the tests which have been carried out in Switzerland with regard to the number of animals, either by number or proportion, which have entered the human food chain?
I have to say I am not in a position to read the mind of the SVC but this particular issue is going before the SVC next week, and of course my representatives there will advance all of the arguments that I have advanced to you this afternoon.
You, Mr Whitehead, are particularly familiar with these.
I expect and hope that the proposals will receive a welcome at the SVC and there will not be a need for the proposals to then go forward to the Agriculture Council.
But I regret I am not in a position to read the mind of the SVC.
I hope that we will get a good response and I believe that from the contacts that we have had with some of the Member States, there is a real apprehension in relation to these issues, not least because of the finding of the one single case in Denmark very recently.
That has tended to concentrate minds very considerably.
I have just a minor question to add to what Mr Daul and Mrs Lienemann have already said. What is to be done?
Would it not be sensible also to eliminate the animals taken to the abattoir at the last minute, which are often likely to be infected?
Surely it is better to take them out of the food chain?
My understanding is that those animals are normally taken out of the food chain.
My question to Mr Byrne relates to the recent report of the Food and Veterinary Office in Dublin on the incidence of BSE in France.
This was a report which related to a period during 1999, but which came to the European Parliament and to MEPs not very long ago.
The findings of the report make extremely alarming reading.
A large number of French departments - I think about 23 departments - had not apparently been monitoring for BSE in the cattle populations within their departments, although they were departments in which there were a large number of dairy cattle.
The conditions and the controls in the abattoirs were such that one drew the conclusion from the report that it is perfectly possible today, 29 March 2000, that animals with BSE are still entering the food chain in France.
This must be an issue of great concern to the Commissioner.
I raised this with the French Agriculture Minister, Mr Glavany, when he came to Brussels last week.
He rejected out of hand the conclusions of the Food and Veterinary Office report and the findings of the inspectors.
I would like to know what the Commission is doing about this.
I realise that my question will be more properly posed to the Agriculture Commissioner, but Mr Byrne is responsible for food safety, and clearly there is a risk to the safety of food in France if the findings of the Food and Veterinary Office are accepted.
Could I therefore ask Mr Byrne what he is doing about this report?
This particular report came as the result of an inspection which took place in June last year. Following on from that, the report had to be written and evaluated and then discussed with the French authorities.
That was done into the Autumn and I have been assured that the issues that were drawn to the attention of the French authorities during that exercise have been addressed substantially in the responses by the French authorities.
I have to say, in relation to reports from the Food and Veterinary Office, that I have had discussions with them about the reports and we are currently reviewing how the reports are done, how they are written and what information they contain.
I was at a seminar in Dublin as recently as last weekend discussing these issues with the chief veterinary officers of the European Union and with the Food and Veterinary Office.
We have made a number of proposals and I am satisfied that when these proposals are put into place we will have met the Member States' concerns in relation to this and also, of course, taken account of consumer concerns.
I am satisfied that the French authorities have taken action.
I would also draw your attention to the fact that recently Mr Glavany, the French Minister of Agriculture, announced his intention of putting in place approximately 40 000 tests of the type that I have been discussing with you here this afternoon to determine the presence of BSE and the levels of infectivity in France.
Aeroplane "hushkits
The next item is the joint debate on two oral questions to the Commission by the following Members:
Mr Hatzidakis, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on hushkitted aircraft (B5-0018/2000);
Mrs Jackson, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the hushkit issue (B5-0020/2000).
Mr President, I look forward with great interest to the Commissioner' s reply to this debate.
The first question one wants to ask is: is The Financial Times accurate this morning in forecasting that the Commissioner is about to answer our questions by saying that only part of the noise regulation will come into force, the part relating to the European Union, on 4 May.
We believe that what the Commissioner is going to say is that the part relating to third countries, which should come into force from 2002, will not come into force and will in fact be suspended.
The Environment Committee is the committee responsible within the European Parliament for the original regulation on aircraft noise and we have watched with some dismay the reluctance of the United States to accept that the European Union is within its rights to insist on bringing the regulation into force by the due date.
The background to this is from our point of view continued prevarication on the part of the United States' administration whose attitude has, in the past, given us insufficient guarantees that they are willing to negotiate seriously through ICAO to find a way out of our difficulties.
The Environment Committee insists that we have every right, given the proximity of very many European airports to centres of population, to try to get lower noise levels from planes landing in Europe, no matter where they come from and who operates them.
Europeans should surely be able to legislate as they wish to protect the population of Europe, and give them the highest standards possible of noise protection.
To put it at its crudest, how will we explain the situation to the people of Europe if, after 2002, they still hear noisy old planes from third countries, fitted with the hushkits we judge inadequate, clattering round our skies?
This is, of course, a difficult issue to discuss sensibly in a United States election year.
We can understand that American politicians have little room for manoeuvre.
I think, however, that the Commissioner may be about to announce to us that light is dawning and that we can see a way forward that will enable both sides to be satisfied and to allow sensible negotiations to continue for a global solution.
The first compromise put forward a little time ago seemed to many in the Parliament to be much too shaky.
In effect the European Union would have suspended the whole regulation, and then the United States would have suspended its complaint to ICAO and negotiations would have gone forward.
Or would they?
The danger, it seemed to us, was that the European Union would have been left with absolutely nothing.
We look forward to what the Commissioner has to say, and I have to underline that it is very important that she should satisfy the Environment Committee and the Parliament, not least because if she is asking us to suspend the application of any part of the regulation, it will have to come through this Parliament by codecision.
Mr President, as has become clear we asked that question because Regulation (EC) No 925/99 on the reduction of aircraft noise must enter into force very soon, while in the meantime there are ongoing talks between Mrs de Palacio and the US, which has found the regulation, which was approved by the Council and Parliament, disturbing and is calling for its withdrawal and suspension.
As is clear, the regulation was adopted in order to protect the environment and the public.
At the same time, however, it seems that the regulation affects the interests of the American aircraft industry.
To show good faith, the Council and Parliament postponed the regulation' s entry into force by one year.
Despite our positive attitude, the Americans for their part have shown supreme arrogance especially towards the European Parliament, calling as I said earlier for the regulation to be withdrawn at first and then, as a slight concession, speaking about indefinite suspension.
As we know, Mrs de Palacio was authorised by the Council of Ministers to negotiate with the US.
I have no doubt that aside from being lengthy, those talks were also difficult.
A time came when it seemed that some progress had been made, though far from anything that could be considered satisfactory, but in the end even that slight progress has vanished in the last few days, since the US has petitioned the ICAO under Article 84 of the Chicago Convention against the European Union concerning the regulation whose purpose, as I said, is to protect the environment.
For our part, we wish to make it abundantly clear that we have no desire to create tensions with the US. We do not want a trade war, we want no problems in our relations, and we regard them as allies and friends.
However, as they themselves would say, they must understand that 'it takes two to tango' .
Our position, then, is as follows:
firstly, our strategy must aim for global agreement on much stricter standards on aircraft noise;
secondly, if there is no agreement, then it is clear that the European Union will have to act unilaterally;
thirdly, we consider that the position of the United States, calling for withdrawal of the regulation or indefinite suspension of its implementation, is totally unacceptable;
fourthly, we welcome the progress made within the Committee on Aviation Environment Protection towards gradually phasing out any noisy aircraft in circulation today;
fifthly, we oppose any further delay in the regulation' s entry into force for aircraft of the Member States, and this because we regard the issue as an internal one and we cannot consider the Americans competent to determine what we do about our own aircraft,
and sixthly, we are prepared to review Regulation (EC) No 925/99 on aircraft registered in third countries provided, however, that in the interim agreement is reached within the ICAO on new standards.
If good faith prevails, that agreement can become a reality.
Meanwhile, however, there is no reason to suspend the regulation for third-country aircraft, for the very simple reason that the regulation concerning such aircraft only enters into force in 2002.
In that sense I cannot understand the insistence of the US, who continually talk about the suspension of our own regulation.
And, of course, we believe the US ought to withdraw their petition to the ICAO under Article 84 of the Chicago Convention, because that kind of action blows the spirit of cooperation sky-high.
Mr President, I want to conclude with two respective observations.
The first is this: it must be made clear who is negotiating on the US side.
We know who our negotiator is, it is Mrs de Palacio, and to date she has proved a very good negotiator.
As for the other side, it is not clear who the negotiator is. This is preventing us from having a stable position from the US, and is also thwarting our own efforts.
The second observation is this: the US must understand that the European Parliament is no longer the body it used to be, in previous decades.
It is now a powerful body.
So they must understand that besides the Council, they must also talk to Parliament and take its views very seriously, because without Parliament there can be no progress.
So if they want us to help them, they must first help us, they must first contribute towards progress by showing goodwill.
With these thoughts, therefore, I would like to ask the Commissioner and the Council what their positions are.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, one thing is crystal clear: on 4 May, the 'Hushkits' regulation enters into force in the European Union.
That is all we know for sure.
From then on we will have to see how we can carry on negotiating with the United States.
The objective of this regulation is very clear: to achieve compliance with what has been agreed within the ICAO, that is to say, that the aircraft landing at our airports genuinely conform to the noise standards of the ICAO.
This regulation has no further intention, but I believe we need to be more ambitious.
The current standards, as Mr Blokland has reminded us, date from 1978.
Since then, world aeronautical technology has made great advances.
Today, the noise levels of current aircraft can sometimes be 20, 40 or even 50 times lower than those of older aircraft.
It is therefore a question of achieving new noise levels as international standards within the ICAO.
In this respect, we need to cooperate with the Americans who, after all, are our friends and allies.
The fact that this regulation will enter into force soon does not mean that we do not have to carry on negotiating with the Americans with the aim of improving the situation with regard to noise standards within the ICAO.
What can we negotiate?
We can negotiate two things:
Firstly, we are going to seek higher international standards within the framework of the ICAO, we are going to cooperate within the ICAO and we are going to seek a common objective, which will be to reduce noise at airports even further and thereby achieve lower noise levels, by applying more modern technologies, with a phasing out period for the most noisy aircraft with the establishment of a chapter 4.
Secondly, the Americans must suspend their complaint to the ICAO in accordance with Article 84 and we - this is something we could negotiate - could suspend the part of the regulation which refers to third country airlines; but certainly not in reference to European airlines, since that regulation enters into force on 4 May.
In other words, with regard to European airlines, there is nothing more to say: we can only negotiate with regard to third country airlines - for which we have some leeway until 2002 - and we would have to suspend that part.
Obviously, when we reach a new agreement within the ICAO, the Community standards will be adapted to the new ICAO standards, which, in any event, will be better than those laid down in the present regulations.
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr Hatzidakis asked me who we are negotiating with and Mrs Jackson reminded us of the meeting they have had with Mr Slater, the Secretary of State for Transport.
I have negotiated with many people from the United States administration.
The only problem is that what is required - and I hope that at some point we will obtain it - is not only negotiations but also the confirmation that the preliminary agreements reached with the particular negotiator on duty receive the backing of the United States administration.
I have kept you informed promptly and with complete transparency throughout all this time.
I am not going to expand on what the stages have been, since you are perfectly familiar with them. The last took place on Monday, with Mr Slater.
Agreement could conceivably be reached on the basic ideas which I presented to him, and we will continue to work on it.
Therefore, Mrs Jackson, what the Financial Times said is not true at all.
Only if there is in agreement on the other aspects would I come to Parliament to ask for your support for a postponement with regard to third country airlines, for a suspension of the provision of the regulation in this specific respect.
I hope that, between us all, we can reach this agreement.
Mr President, I should like to have begun my intervention with the title of a play by Shakespeare: 'Much ado about nothing' , but unfortunately it would be totally unsuitable.
There is much ado about a great deal.
However loath I am to put things a little more into the right context, thereby perhaps disassociating myself somewhat from the President-in-Office of the Council, the point is: we are not talking about the environment here, which I am otherwise quite happy to discuss, as you well know, we are talking about health.
What we are discussing today has very little to do with legislation on transport or the environment; on the contrary, we are legislating to protect people.
Every scientist in the world, including the USA, has established over recent years that noise makes people ill.
Noise makes people ill and therefore not only injures and stresses people themselves, it also damages the community as a whole, i.e. the national economy.
That is something which many of us here wish to bear in mind, which is why we tabled this legislation.
That is the only reason.
That is what we wish to bear in mind, irrespective of the fact that, otherwise, we are, of course, always happy to integrate transport policy into other policy areas and environmental policy into transport.
The legislation is in force, as everyone has said here today and, commendably, the Commissioner too has again made that quite clear.
The last few times I have listened to you, Mrs de Palacio, I was most impressed by the very clear, very logical and very decisive manner in which you conveyed that.
I welcome that and I congratulate you.
The legislation is in force and I therefore wonder what the Council of transport ministers discussed yesterday.
Basically, it has nothing to discuss, unless it wants to submit new legislation to us, which is obviously not the case.
Mrs de Palacio said earlier that she will need Parliament' s support at some point for the second part of the regulation, the part relating to third countries, including the United States, South America and the countries of eastern Europe, i.e. all countries outside the European Union.
That is the part which is due to enter into force in April 2002.
But if you approach us, Mrs de Palacio, and want us to defer this part, then I think you will need to offer us more than you have at the moment, as you well know.
If you go back and negotiate, then one thing must be made clear and I hope and believe that the House is relatively united on this question: it must be clear that we need a declaration of unequivocal standards.
We must be clear and united on where we want to go and what the ultimate goal is.
I am not haggling over six months, but I do want clear objectives and we must have a clear timetable.
If - and I say this now completely off the record, insofar as I can in a minuted debate - if, rather than April 2002, it were September 2002 or even January 2003, I would be the last to make a song and a dance about it, but I do want a clear, binding timetable to be adhered to by everyone concerned, including the USA.
Once we have all this, then I should like to see it go through the general assembly of the International Civil Aviation Authority, the ICAO, in September.
If it goes through in September of next year, then we still have enough time to suspend the regulation.
I am not prepared to consider a suspension without the conditions which I have just formulated.
If that is, nonetheless, what you come to us with, then it will be possible, but it will have to go through the normal legislative procedure and then you will need Parliament' s support - even the United States of America must understand that - and then perhaps we can finish at the end of the day with another play which Shakespeare might have called "No ado about anything" !
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I actually think it is a shame that you have had to invest so much time and energy in this issue, because as Mr Blokland said, we are spending all our time looking back at regulations from the seventies instead of looking to the future.
I think that is a particularly sorry state of affairs.
We must bring the new standard into force as soon as possible. It is in our interests to do so, but what we are lacking is commitment on the part of the Americans.
That much is clear.
They have not given us their commitment, that is what makes us so suspicious.
They have given it to us so often.
On so many occasions they have half committed themselves and then backed off again, and so on and so forth.
As far as I am concerned it is clear that the suspicion derives from the Americans' lack of willingness to commit themselves to something that is inevitable.
Only when they actually sign on the dotted line to this effect will we in the Union be able to help to move the situation on.
We should not turn things round.
Yesterday we had a talk with the American Minister for Transport.
It was my impression at this meeting, that in common with ourselves, Mr Slater is of the opinion that the hushkits are an issue of secondary importance which stands in the way of far more important issues, and that we must put this matter to bed as swiftly as possible. But there is a huge amount of suspicion on their side too.
And so I think that it is time for a clear signal; but it must come from them in the first instance.
What we need to hear from them is that they want to find a solution, not behind closed doors somewhere, but officially, on paper.
It is not acceptable for them to ask us to defer our own regulations.
Their future commitment depends on whether or not we are willing to defer.
The complaint they have filed with the ICAO is in fact uncalled-for blackmail.
I believe they should withdraw it.
Mr Hatzidakis has said that it should be withdrawn and you have said that we should defer.
I have tabled an amendment to the effect that they should definitely withdraw the complaint.
I think we need to word what we currently have on paper a little more strongly.
What is worthy of admiration, in my view, Commissioner, is that you are presently taking the same line as Parliament and, it would seem, the Council.
That being the case, I think our position is stronger than that of the Americans at the moment, and we must do all we can to keep things that way as far as possible.
Mr President, in my opinion, Commissioner Palacio is completely right to uphold the European position against the United States.
This is not the first time that our positions, laws and regulations have differed from those of the United States.
Consider the example of genetically modified organisms.
If we want to maintain our sovereignty, we must do so in every area, including this one.
Now, I feel that the issue here is not which devices should be used in aircraft to reduce noise, for standardised procedures exist to control the levels of aircraft noise, but that the important thing is for the noise limits not to be exceeded.
It does not matter whether this is achieved through the use of modified afterburners or other types of engine mufflers.
What is important is that the limits which have been set to protect our communities are respected and that their observance is enforced by the competent bodies.
Mr President, Madam Vice-President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I am happy that we are here together today, after all the discussions over recent months, and can confirm that all three institutions - the two legislative institutions and the Commission as the proposing authority - take the view that the regulation has to enter into force in May of this year.
No other course would be possible, because there is no legislative process which is fast enough to allow further changes to be made in May.
What is crucial in our view is that noise protection regulations are right for our people, that we must protect people in the vicinity of airports and that American interests have not, in any case, been affected thus far.
Individual interests of American companies may be affected, but the regulation does not enter into force for aircraft registered in third countries until 2002, which is why we must bite our tongue somewhat and choose our words carefully, Mr President-in-Office.
I wonder if we should abolish this regulation as far as third country aircraft are concerned.
It has not even entered into force.
It is on the statute books but will not enter into force until May 2002.
Why should we abolish it?
I think that we should begin with a legislative procedure at the end of the year.
Once agreement has been reached on global standards in the ICAO working parties, we can start to adopt these global standards in our regulation insofar as it relates to third country aeroplanes for the year 2002.
If, during the course of the legislative procedure, which takes six months or a year, we receive an indication in September that these standards have also been adopted by the general assembly of the ICAO as they stand, we can conclude the legislative procedure well before May 2002.
This was also what my fellow member was asking.
We should not begin the legislative procedure under the slogan "suspend" but under the slogan "adaptation to new, jointly-agreed standards" .
In this respect I think that Mr Slater should put his money where his mouth is, as we say in Hamburg.
It is not enough for him to say that he wants to agree with us; as the Vice-President has called on him to do time and again, he must also say what noise reduction quality standards he wants to agree on.
On that basis, Madam Vice-President, you continue to have our full support.
We admire you, because the Council has gone on the attack time and again, saying you should draw up a legislative proposal right away and give in to the Americans.
You rightly said, the Americans are our friends but we will not be blackmailed when it comes to our own environmental protection.
Stand by your guns, Madam Vice-President!
If the Americans approach us on this matter, we are perfectly able in principle to start the legislative process the day after tomorrow.
But I would advise that we wait for the first working results from the ICAO working party on noise protection regulations.
Then we can start on a sound legislative process in the interests of all our citizens, because we want global standards which are more stringent that those we have had in the past.
Mr President, Mrs Roth-Behrendt quoted from Shakespeare in her contribution and I would like to quote from Hamlet' s soliloquy: whether it is nobler to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune or by opposing end them.
As chair of the US delegation here in this Parliament, I am only too well aware of the many slings and arrows of outrageous fortune that make up the trade disputes between the EU and the United States of America.
But having said that, it is important to get each trade dispute in proportion.
Every one of us would want to welcome the small indication of progress that comes after the meetings with Secretary of State Slater and Ambassador Morningstar.
I say this knowing full well the massive pressures there are upon Congress in an election year.
I do not want to be too critical, we know only too well as parliamentarians about electoral pressures, but it is worth saying that the pressures in the United States are not so much from the citizens, from the voters, but from the big business backers of both parties and both campaigns and that makes an enormous difference.
The Commissioner and others have outlined the basis of possible discussions.
I will not go through all those again, but just say that there is a need not only for a timetable to agree stringent noise standards but also to agree a timetable in which they should be implemented.
Mrs Roth-Berendt has mentioned a target with which I will concur.
I want to make one other brief point, because this dispute highlights the need for earlier and more forthright discussions about the many issues over which there are disagreements.
The delegation for relations with the US is planning, as you probably know, a transatlantic legislators' dialogue using video-conferencing techniques so that we can discuss and understand - and clearly the Americans need to understand - what the powers of this Parliament are, the positive powers and also the negative powers and also the importance of timing in our joint negotiations.
We need to learn lessons on both sides but I very much hope that even at this late stage there can be some sort of resolution.
Mr President, I strongly support the resolutions that are on the table before us.
I do so not only because of the importance of the hushkits issue itself, although no one should underestimate the huge disturbance and the very real and significant health impacts from noise, but also because it establishes the principle of Europe setting its own regional standards.
The hushkits issue is also widely seen as a first case of how aviation issues will be dealt with in the future by the new Parliament and the new Commission.
It is very clear that ICAO standards need to be seen as a floor, not as a ceiling.
It should be quite possible and right to go beyond them.
This is a critical case because it is about how we face hard decisions about how to begin to make a deeply unsustainable industry a little less damaging.
It is about how we put into practice the Treaty of Amsterdam on integrating sustainability concerns into all policy areas, even the very difficult ones.
I wonder if we can use this conflict and these negotiations with the US to enter into a broader discussion about a proactive global environmental policy on air transport more generally.
Hushkits are important but noise pollution is only one aspect of the environmental damage from the airline industry.
It is the fastest growing source of greenhouse gas emissions and we know that it is deeply unsustainable.
We need to be looking towards a new policy architecture to deal with all these questions.
Mr President, I have problems with the genesis of Regulation 925 of 1999 to which the resolution before us refers.
It was voted through the last Parliament without any debate.
It is contrary to the principle of non-discrimination.
It offends against the fundamental requirement for reasons under Article 253 of the Treaty in that there is no explanation at all in the regulation for the use of the bypass ratio of an aircraft engine as a criteria when internationally approved noise and emissions standards certification for aircraft engines already exist.
It is contrary to the principle of proportionality and, most importantly, it is contrary to the rules of the WTO which require the use of performance standards, not design standards, as is the case in this regulation.
In whose interest was it to depart in this piece of fast-track legislation from tried-and-tested procedures and the practice of using objective performance criteria for environmental standards?
This legislation rolls out the proposal made by Airbus at an Airbus-hosted meeting in Toulouse on 29 and 30 September and 1 October 1997, effectively commercially sponsored legislation.
At that meeting the Members of the European Civil Aviation Council (ECAC) present were told by their legal advisor that they could not proceed under the ICAO Agreement as requested by Airbus and so Airbus persuaded the Commission to legislate where ECAC could not.
We now have legislation which threatens another transatlantic trade war - but that is another issue - which does not respect best environmental practice with performance criteria and which - surprise surprise - excludes aircraft using a modern US manufactured engine while permitting the continued use of the Rolls Royce engine which conveniently has a bypass ratio of 3.1.
Yes, Mr President, noise pollution affects 20% of our population, and 0.01% comes from aircraft.
I fully support the necessary standards to protect the health and quality of life for our citizens.
The strictest possible criteria to reduce noise and emissions from aircraft engines can only be achieved however by using performance criteria and not design criteria which is commercially sponsored and fast-track in anti-competitive legislation.
Environmental legislation based on design criteria, I put it to you colleagues, is without precedent, and for good reason.
I would ask with respect that the Commissioner, in the interests of probity, satisfy herself fully as to the genesis of this regulation in question to ensure the impact of its roll-out on the aviation industry world-wide.
I do not care whether it is America, Europe, China or Mars - world-wide is equitable.
Above all, it should serve as well as possible the important environmental objectives it purports to achieve.
I fully support the objective of the regulation and we must agree on a timetable to implement noise standards, but it must be one based on objective performance criteria and not design criteria.
The integrity of this House demands detailed answers to questions which raise major doubts about aspects of a regulation upon which the motion before us is based and on which we will be asked to vote tomorrow.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think Mrs Doyle cannot have examined the genesis of the actual situation, as we have debated this issue on several occasions in this House.
I cannot imagine, Madame Doyle, that the Council was unanimous and this House almost unanimous in taking a decision based solely on the Airbus defence.
No, there are thousands of residents living in the vicinity of airports who suffer considerable noise pollution.
Obviously, this regulation offers them the best protection as things stand at present under current international legislation.
Secondly, Mrs de Palacio, Mr Coelho, in my view, the postponement of one year served no useful purpose, for the simple reason that American interests - and when I say American interests I mean the interests of one section of American industry - are clearly interests which run counter to the general improvement of standards, even more so in the case of 'hushkits' .
There are only two things that will cause them to shift position: pressure from the European Union or pressure from their own public opinion for, unfortunately, the United States is a vast territory and the environs of airports are less badly affected than the territories overflown in Europe, which is, by virtue of its geographical layout, affected more seriously by such constraints.
American opinion will therefore only be shifted significantly in turn if we first make it known in our capacity as Europeans.
My regret is that this year' s postponement may have been seen by our partners as indicative of weakness in our position.
Let me tell you, then, Mrs de Palacio, Mr Coelho, that we want to see firm negotiation.
There are no grounds for suspending regulations.
We might at best revise them, but we could do so only in one instance: if an international agreement makes it possible to improve the situation and to draw up an overall framework agreement.
An overall framework does not mean evading the issue, as I began to doubt upon hearing the views of the Council.
Do we in fact all agree on the idea that the framework agreement should apply to standards on sound levels and should not seek to cover too wide an area, which would tend to force us to accept a number of compromises regarding sound levels, at the expense of some other type of pollution, which probably deserves our attention, but not so much so as to warrant our ceding our argument.
Mr President, Commissioner, as you know, I live in Bilbao, a city in the Basque country which, like other European cities, is very densely populated.
Our airport is very close to housing and, like 20% of Europe' s citizens, we suffer levels of noise from aircraft which health experts consider to be unacceptable.
On 29 April 1999, the European Union adopted a Council regulation with a view to controlling and reducing the noise produced by subsonic aircraft engines, limiting in due course the use of silencers, which do not resolve the problem completely, and helping airlines to update their fleets with new generation aircraft which create less pollution.
This has pleased the powerful American firms, as aircraft manufacturers, but at the same time harms them because they are also owner-investors in thousands of leased aircraft in all the countries of the world. Since these aircraft are antiquated, it would be difficult for them to operate in Europe.
Neither has the European Regulation been popular with the American manufacturers of aircraft engine silencers known as 'hushkits' and, therefore, the United States has announced commercial, financial etc. measures against the European Union unless we delay the entry into force of our regulation.
I understand that we must not be inflexible. We must offer an opportunity for dialogue and understanding, but in order for this to happen, the United States must agree to adopt certain approaches.
At the next assembly of the ICAO, the United States must commit itself to the adoption of a new and more restrictive standard for aircraft noise, as well as to withdrawing its complaints and coercive measures.
Only under these circumstances could we accept a delay in our regulation for third countries.
Mr President, the British delegate has just spoken using Mr Bowe' s speaking time.
I would be more than pleased to present her with the documents I received from Commissioner de Palacio, which weaken her story, so as to enable her to have another look at them, and so as to avoid her bringing the whole Parliament into disrepute.
I think, Mr Blokland, you could have done that without actually announcing it to Parliament, but never mind.
Mr President, like most of the other speakers here, I see absolutely no reason at all for any kind of immediate suspension, or urgent suspension, of the hushkit regulations.
There are regulations, we put them in place.
I was here at the first reading in the Parliament in Strasbourg.
There were not very many of us here, a lot fewer than there are today, when we introduced these regulations in the first instance.
They are good regulations.
There are going to be useful regulations and they are going to bring positive benefit to the people of Europe.
That does not mean though that you should not negotiate.
I was fortunate to have an opportunity to talk with Under-Secretary Slater yesterday along with a number of my other colleagues.
They seem to be reasonable people who would be willing to talk reasonably with you about a better, long-term solution.
We know there are better long-term solutions because we know our regulation applies only in Europe.
Although it may have some spillover effect in the not too far distant future to third countries, we are not having a world-wide effect.
Your objective, Madame Palacio, is to get that world-wide effect.
Your objective is to make absolutely sure that whatever agreement you come up with with the Americans secures new controls on aircraft noise world-wide out of ICAO in a clear timescale.
It is not just a question of agreeing to the controls and the levels but also a timetable for implementation that makes us happy and satisfied in this Parliament.
That is the mandate we are giving you here today.
That is what we would like to see you come back with at some time in the future.
In the meantime though, enforce and implement the regulations as we expect them to be enforced and implemented.
Tell the Americans that if they want to talk in an atmosphere of confidence and trust and goodwill, the first thing they can do is to suspend their Article 84 complaint in ICAO.
They do not have to withdraw it, they do not have to take it away, they just have to make sure it does not go on the agenda of the next meeting.
Suggest that to them, Madame Palacio.
Start the negotiations and then come back to us with a reasonable compromise.
Mr President, first of all I wish to thank all of you for your speeches and especially the Portuguese Minister for Transport, the President-in-Office of the Council.
Yesterday we discussed this matter and I received the full support of the Council, for which I would like to publicly express my gratitude.
Ladies and gentlemen, it should be made abundantly clear that our ambition must not be to conform to the 'Hushkits' Regulation, to the regulation on silencers.
The regulation on silencers means nothing more than implementing the noise levels of 1978 and we are in the year 2000.
We must go further.
We must reach an agreement within the ICAO, and to achieve this, the support and cooperation of the United States is essential.
The United States should not be the only country with which we cooperate, but we certainly must cooperate with the United States and with the United States in particular.
We must move beyond what has been reactive behaviour, that is to say, behaviour that has worked on the action-reaction principle, and move towards an approach which is ambitious and which looks to the future.
In this respect, there are two issues we should be discussing: in domestic terms, we must talk about the communication on air transport and the environment which Minister Coelho referred to, which we discussed yesterday in Council and which involves many other things, apart from simply noise, such as emissions, and a series of other issues. With regard to the United States, we must try to find a form of cooperation that goes much further than current cooperation within the ICAO.
We must try to create a common transatlantic aviation area which is a regional area in which we can achieve greater integration of the markets on each side of the Atlantic, because it is a geographical area with similar levels of development and which has the highest level of air traffic in the world.
Clearly, the tensions and confrontations involving the 'Hushkits' issue hinder this type of action.
We must therefore try to reach an agreement which will allow us to overcome the current situation of conflict.
I wish to make it very clear that the regulation on silencers comes into force on 4 May for European airline companies.
There is nothing more to say about this.
We have proposed to the Americans that, if they consider the definition of 'bypass ratio' to be a form of discrimination - and we think it is not - that we try to find a different definition. However, the United States have not wanted to enter into this type of discussion.
The regulation comes into force for European airlines on 4 May.
Nevertheless, ladies and gentlemen, if we could reach an agreement with the United States to act jointly, in order to obtain lower levels and greater requirements in terms of aircraft noise emission, I would be prepared to make a proposal to this Parliament and the Council to suspend the provisions of the current regulation with regard to third countries.
As Mr Sterckx has said, we must overcome any mutual distrust, we must overcome situations of confrontation and I believe that a gesture of this type, if backed on the American side not only by this commitment but also by the withdrawal, or even suspension, of Article 84 of the ICAO Convention, would be valuable if, in exchange, we manage to move forward together to achieve better international standards which will also be applied here in Europe, and which will allow us to go much further than we can go with this regulation on silencers at the moment.
That is all. Thank you very much, Mr President.
I would like to thank you once again for your support and I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council on Transport and the Council on Transport as a whole for the answer they gave me yesterday.
I have received one motion for resolution from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy pursuant to Rule 42(5) of the Rules of Procedure.
That concludes the joint debate.
The vote will be taken tomorrow.
Mediterranean policy

Bautista Ojeda, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, to the Council (B5-0214/2000);
Bautista Ojeda, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, to the Commission (B5-0215/2000).
Mr President, great is the frustration and disappointment of the European Parliament, almost five years on from the Barcelona Declaration, at the lack of progress made in the implementation of the programmes and objectives it set out.
Disappointment and frustration which are all the greater when we consider the substantial progress of European policies in other fields, for example regarding the East, Central Europe and the Balkans, and also relations between Europe and Latin America.
It is obvious to all of us that the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership has to complement the European policy for the Mediterranean Basin.


I would like to stress the basic points upon which we expect a detailed response from this debate: the clause which sets out the basis of the agreements, on respect for human rights, the undertaking to draw up ratification instruments for giving effect to the association agreements, and the development and acceleration of new linkages for a cooperation process with Libya, provided that the requisite political conditions are in evidence at the Cairo Conference on 3-4 April 2000.
Mr President, I would also like to stress the need to forge ahead with objectives that facilitate a greater involvement of civil society in creating networks linking cities, ports, universities, trade associations, entrepreneurs and non-governmental organisations, for the INTERREG programmes to be used to promote balanced development with regard to trade and territory through the modernisation of economic structures, so that the MEDA programme, which has received such a disappointingly small amount of funding, can at last bear fruit.
Finally, Mr President, may I say that the Union' s Mediterranean policy could become one of the common strategies laid down by Article 12 of the Treaty on European Union regarding foreign and security policy, and that we could also promote the political dimension of the issue through parliamentary debate.
Mr President, our group has joined with other groups to hold a debate on Mediterranean policy, and I cannot deny that this initiative stems from a two-fold concern.
The first is a general consideration.
I would like to make this very clear to the representatives of the Council and the Commission: as a group, although I imagine that we are not the only group to feel this way, we are concerned that the Mediterranean policy which, in 1995, was at the centre of a major project, the Barcelona project, no longer appears to be a political priority for the Union.
This is a general political concern.
We feel that Mediterranean policy needs to be thoroughly analysed and relaunched, on a par with enlargement, or perhaps more so than this, seeing that the enlargement strategy is now safely underway.
The second point is more specific.
In our view, Barcelona defined the major points of this policy, but, with the passage of time, these have been lost from sight.
Our feeling, which will become apparent from the resolution which is to be put to the vote, is that complete priority has been given to a procedure for the development of a free trade area, shifting the emphasis from other policies which, in our opinion, should go hand in hand with the objective of building a free trade area, which we fully support.
This means that the pillars which were the basis for Barcelona must be adopted and perhaps even reinforced.
I refer to a policy of support for investment, support for employment, support for decentralised cooperation and support for a policy of joint management of migratory flows, and also a policy for culture, schools, young people and for setting up dynamic, worthwhile exchanges between these countries and their communities.
Furthermore, we stress the fact that, although the association agreements are important and their ratification procedure does need to be speeded up, they cannot be used as the basis for a policy which must, by nature, be multilateral.
And this is a weak point.
We therefore welcome the major step taken by Parliament in deciding, through the Presidents of the Groups, to convene the Interparliamentary Forum.
We agree to support the civil forum.
We welcome the French presidency' s announcement in its programme of its intention to hold the next Euro-Mediterranean Conference in Marseilles, but we feel that the Marseilles Euro-Mediterranean Conference must be more than just a run-of-the-mill administrative conference.
The political signal which we must all send out together and the instruments which are decided upon must be capable of successfully relaunching this policy and restoring its status.
I hope I have been clear.
We feel very strongly about this issue.
Mr President, the Confederal Group of the European United Left are extremely concerned at the stagnation of the Mediterranean partnership and we see can no justification for the Commission and the Council' s reluctance to reopen the debate.
And yet two of the fundamental causes of the breakdown in the debate have now been eliminated: a new Commission is installed in Brussels which numbers the creation of a Euro-Mediterranean area of peace and stability among one of its priorities, and peace negotiations between Israel, Palestine, Syria and the Lebanon are once again in progress.
It is time for Europe to send a political signal to reopen negotiations with non-member countries of the Mediterranean, and this is why we welcome the idea from the future French presidency of the Council of organising another Euro-Mediterranean Conference.
However, the agenda must tackle the central issues and not skirt around them, as it currently threatens to do.
We are also concerned at the total lack of interest shown by the Commission in reopening the debate.
And yet much remains to be done in order to relaunch the three cooperation chapters decided upon in Barcelona.
A large workshop needs to be opened on promoting the protection of human rights in the area of justice, in a framework of mutual respect, for we cannot make concessions for anybody on human rights issues, not even civil Europe.
For a long time now, Parliament has been proposing to create a Euro-Mediterranean Court of Human Rights modelled on the Court in Strasbourg, and also to set up mutual consultation mechanisms to facilitate applications for peaceful solutions to conflicts and the fight against organised crime.
Political dialogue must be structured and take the form of regular consultations.
To this end, we propose that Summits of the Heads of State and Government of the Mediterranean countries of the European Union should be held regularly, and that the role of the special envoy for the Middle East should be consolidated, so that we do not relinquish the political role we desire to the United States.
There is now no reason to exclude Libya from the debate, and it should therefore take part in the next Euro-Mediterranean Conference.
With regard to economic and financial cooperation, the Commission has the duty to relaunch negotiations for the signing of trade contracts which are socially sustainable.
This is extremely important, for the mutual benefits are very great.
At the same time, however, I would stress that the bilateral approach hitherto adopted by the Commission does not seem adequate to meet the numerous challenges presented by the Mediterranean.
Economic cooperation must include multilateral/bilateral approaches facilitating the promotion of trade among Mediterranean countries and south-south trade. This multilateral approach must also be mirrored in the fields of cultural and social cooperation.
