Do you imagine that, by setting this magic date, the congestion of infrastructures for goods transport by rail or the problems with the interoperability of systems - not to mention other problems which fortunately the Commission is currently dealing with, such as the certification of locomotives and rolling stock - will disappear?
On the other hand, apart from the ceaseless liberalisation, there are also railway success stories that demonstrate that that is not the only sine qua non condition.
One example is the success of high-speed trains for passengers in Spain.
Admittedly we have not had the same success with goods, but I believe that Germany is the leader in this sector, and has been since before liberalisation.
Perhaps we should therefore learn from all of these experiences.
That is why we are advocating the method of gradual opening-up, which will enable us to focus on the criteria and conditions, paying particular attention to the viability of public services and the diversity of existing concession formulae.
Hence our vote in favour of Amendment 33.
We therefore support the idea that, two years after opening up international passenger transport, the Commission should draw up an assessment of the progress made and of any problems and, where necessary, propose new measures to accompany the subsequent opening-up process, as proposed in the texts that the three institutions agree on, because on the study, at least, we are all in agreement.
(The President cut off the speaker)
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say that, in general terms, I am satisfied with the progress achieved thanks to the long and exacting work of the European Parliament and, more specifically, of the three rapporteurs.
This reform of passenger transport by rail is absolutely essential if we are to create a genuine internal market, which will promote the mobility of all Europeans under optimal safety and accessibility conditions and which will very quickly, I hope, help to reduce the often exorbitant fares, without leading to the disappearance of services.
Nevertheless, with regard to access to the market, I would like to express my concern this evening about the temptation to set a date at this point for the opening up of the national passenger market.
I personally am not in favour of altering the Council's position on this point, since a hurried, and perhaps ill-prepared, opening up of national passenger transport could have serious consequences for the service.
I would like to see prior impact studies, particularly on the effects of opening up to international competition, on the cabotage system, which must be provided with a strict framework, and on the effects of the system of standardisation of tariffs.
Why not schedule a fourth rail package, which could look in detail at funding mechanisms, and particularly coordination with public service obligations, as well as the funding of loss-making lines?
With regard to the directive on international rail passengers' rights and obligations, I am delighted with the work that is going to give far greater responsibilities to rail operators and, at the end of the day, and very quickly I hope, give more rights to passengers, particularly those with reduced mobility.
I would also like to thank Mr Sterckx for supporting our group's amendment, which is intended to take account of the specific situation of suburban transport, which is particularly relevant in terms of public service obligations.
(DE) Mr President, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate you!
Mr Jarzembowski, I would also like to take the opportunity to express my respect - even though we have different opinions on a certain specific area of your report - for the resolve, tenacity and vigour with which you have pursued this report, as long as I have been in this House, and for the relative success you have achieved.
On the surface, we all want the same thing for the European railways: high quality, high safety standards and good working conditions.
It has always been said that we have differing visions of that and differing ideas of how to get there, but I am not so sure that that is really true.
I wonder why it is mainly those Members who did not really strengthen the railways in the matter of the Infrastructure Costs Directive, by rather overemphasising certain things, that are now on the pro-liberalisation side.
Why, for example, did the former Austrian transport minister push so hard for liberalisation, while at the same time running the Austrian railways almost into the ground with his domestic railway policy?
Why have we not all gone down the perhaps more sensible route of saying that we will first of all examine liberalisation in the international arena, and wait until we can see where this path takes us before we decide whether we want to continue down it?
If we had done that, I would have been able to say with certainty that everybody here is in favour of progress on Europe's railways.
I do not think that some kind of neoliberal anti-railway campaign is underway here.
I really do not think that, even though the rapporteur has shifted somewhat to the right in time to present the report to plenary.
I have shifted to the right with him, so that says nothing.
I do think, though, that there are many different reasons for following this path to liberalisation that I cannot fully share.
I therefore do not want to jump on this bandwagon just yet.
Perhaps I will be convinced in time, but at the moment, when it comes to national liberalisation, I do not want to be a part of it.
(PL) Mr President, I am delighted with the results obtained in the course of negotiations led by the rapporteurs for this third railway package.
The package really has been improved as a result of these negotiations.
It has not just been repackaged more attractively, it simply is a better package.
One issue remains outstanding, however.
Perhaps I shall begin with a few words to put it into context.
In my region of south-west Poland, an increase in rail passenger services was recorded last year.
It was not a large increase, but it was actually the first increase for many years.
Up until then, nothing but a continuous fall in services was being recorded, not just in my region but across the whole of Poland.
Perhaps last year's slight increase is an indication that railways are gradually beginning to compete with road transport, which is what we all very much want and a key principle of European transport policy.
I mention all this, because great care must be taken not to alter this trend when introducing new regulations concerning rail passengers' rights.
Railways must be competitive, and must therefore be cheap or even very cheap.
They must also be well managed, and offer their passengers a high standard of travel.
The difficulty is that if these two objectives are taken literally, a degree of contradiction arises.
A service cannot be cheap and luxurious at the same time.
That is why an effort to devise a suitable compromise in this regard is needed.
The railways are very gradually emerging from a long period of decline.
They need us to help them in their endeavours.
We must not impose additional burdens on railways if we want to prevent them going back into decline.
(LT) I would support the liberalisation of rail transport services if the social effect of opening up rail networks and its effects on the environment were to be analysed in depth.
On the other hand, opening of the EU countries' railway lines going into third countries gives the green light to unfair competition.
The right to use these lines will be acquired by third-country companies with branches in EU countries, whose main interest is to carry passengers into their own countries.
Some EU countries run the risk of losing the right to carry passengers into neighbouring third countries, because the latter are not obliged to adhere to EU directives and to open up their passenger transport market.
Railway enterprises in EU countries with an external border would find themselves in a more difficult situation compared to other EU countries.
I would invite you to vote against the fifteenth amendment.
I would urge you not to support my colleague Mr Sterckx's report on the twenty-first amendment, which, in my opinion, weakens the Council's motion.
(HU) I wish to draw attention to a few questions, the first of which is generally economic in nature.
When talking about liberalisation and the liberalisation of services, we always say the same thing.
It should not be the case that there is no deadline in the services directive, or that in some places we wish to liberalise only partially, because let us say as a German I am sensitive to this matter, whereas in other respects we need to open up services completely, for instance in financial or rail services.
I say this not in order to harm rail service.
Yes, some day this too will have to be completely liberalised, but to do so, we need to catch up in other areas as well.
The second question, concretely, is something I already mentioned at first reading.
The new Member States are struggling with a great many problems of domestic government administration.
I therefore say once again that only five years after the introduction of the euro can we truly accept full liberalisation, since before that time we are unable to capitalise our companies - in which there is enormous investment that must not be frittered away - in such a way that they are able to withstand competition.
The year 2022 in the current proposal is already quite friendly in this regard.
We must be very careful - especially in the new Member States - to maintain that we fulfil the obligation to provide public transport solely by means of buses.
That is, after one accident in which someone is hit, the State simply withdraws from the railways in its obligation to provide public transport.
The Savary proposal, in my opinion, goes in the right direction from this point of view, that is, truly towards the deepening of the internal market.
In connection with the Sterckx report - although of course everything it contains is very attractive - I must say, as a representative of a new Member State, that this will cost us a great deal, especially if we have to do this in the first ten years before the introduction of free movement of persons and the introduction of the euro.
This is very, very difficult.
I do not wish to oppose what is written in this report: as a goal it is very good, but in terms of timing, things do not fit together completely, and I would like it very much if such a degree of obligation were brought in only after the introduction of the euro and of the free movement of persons.
Actually, with liberalisation, quality will also improve, so that there will probably not be such serious problems in the future, but once again I repeat: we need to synchronise.
(SK) Mr President, I congratulate you on your new role.
In order to improve the competitiveness of railways vis-Ã -vis road transport and to place railways on an equal footing in terms of competing for business, it is necessary to complete the harmonisation of the conditions governing railway and road transport operations.
In the energy sector we are unbundling transmission systems from energy suppliers; in the railway transport sector as well, it is necessary to complete the reform of those state-owned railway companies that still have carriers and infrastructure operators in one and the same organisation.
The fact that road transport is flourishing, even in those countries where rail transport would be more appropriate from an environmental standpoint, is due to inadequate harmonisation, external factors, faulty interoperability and flawed transformation, as well as the poor quality of rail transport.
The second key factor is market liberalisation.
When opening up rail networks for passenger transport, however, it will be necessary to give the economies of the new Member States enough time to prepare themselves for this step.
(PT) Thank you very much, Mr President, I also wish to congratulate you on your election and wish you all the best in your new post.
The liberalisation of rail transport is something that needs to be brought about, but progress has been painstaking.
We must therefore keep up the effort to move ever closer to a European rail services market, which will help us implement the important objectives of the common transport policy.
In this regard, I should like to congratulate our rapporteurs on their outstanding work.
Although, for many, trains still have an image of romanticism and adventure derived partly from the famous Orient Express, the fact is that they are a safe, environmentally friendly means of transport that is adept at moving large quantities of goods quickly and at conveying large numbers of people comfortably and equally quickly.
The dream of rail services from the Atlantic to the Baltic and Black Seas remains a distant one, as we continue to come up against major obstacles to effective freedom of movement in the rail sector.
The problem remains of discrepancies between, for example, gauges inside and outside the Iberian Peninsula, as do those of the management of internal and international traffic and of ticketing, which are not easy matters to resolve.
We face enormous difficulties and, without the will of the Member States, we will not be able to overcome them.
Congestion in Central Europe and the accessibility of Europe's outlying regions are intimately linked.
If we want to see the economic growth of our countries, joint measures are required whereby development in one area ties in with progress in another.
The funding approved for the Trans-European Networks does not fill us with overwhelming enthusiasm.
We must therefore derive some satisfaction from the progress for which we shall hopefully vote tomorrow.
In its diversity, Parliament is doing its best, but the Council must respond positively to this impetus for progress and for the liberalisation of rail transport.
How can this be achieved?
It can be achieved by acknowledging that the deadlines for opening up the networks are reasonable and by not imposing unfair economic restrictions on this process; by accepting compromise solutions for existing concessions and for public service obligations; by agreeing to the rules on the certification of onboard staff in the interests of the security of people and property; and lastly by ensuring universal protection for the rights of all passengers.
Along with quality of service, this is the best way of attracting people to this means of transport, thereby ensuring its development and continued employment for those working in the sector.
(DE) Mr President, today we are discussing three essential steps that will help to breathe new life into Europe's railways and bring about a considerable improvement in passenger rights.
I would like to focus on just one aspect of the overall package that fits in perfectly with the start of the European Year of Equal Opportunities.
It is good that, in the regulation on rail passengers' rights and obligations, we are sending a signal and thus making our contribution to equal opportunities.
It obviously makes no sense to enact a regulation that is only relevant to international passengers.
In my view, all passengers should have equal rights.
At the forefront is the right of all citizens to transport, but passengers can only assert their rights if they know what they are, which is why information is a necessity.
I would call for all people with limited mobility, regardless of whether it is due to disability, age or another factor, to have equal opportunities to travel by rail.
It is quite clear that we need to work continuously to improve barrier-free accessibility.
It is also clear, though, that is not possible to adapt all vehicles and all buildings straight away to meet the needs of these people.
Once the regulation enters into force, station operators and railway companies will have to pay particular attention to ensuring that people with limited mobility can get information regarding the accessibility of railway services, the conditions for accessing trains and the facilities on the trains.
To ensure that, in particular, passengers with sensory impairments are provided with information regarding delays as efficiently as possible, we would call for information announcements to be made using both acoustic and visual systems.
In future, people with restricted mobility will be able to buy tickets on the train without paying a supplement, and, if a person cannot access the services provided in the train due to their restricted mobility, they will be able to be accompanied by another person who will travel for free.
A social Europe is on its way!
(FR) Mr President, I would like to congratulate you most warmly.
You ran a very good race.
11 October 2006 was a very dark day for the French railways and for the Luxembourg railways.
On a twin-track section of line, temporarily being used as a single track as a result of works, a collision between two trains killed six people and seriously wounded two.
A passenger train from Luxembourg collided with a freight train in French territory.
The accident, which, according to the enquiry, was due to a human signalling error on the Luxembourg side, was particularly tragic, since the signalman, having become aware of the error, triggered via the station to train radio an initial piercing alarm, which did not reach the driver of the passenger train.
He then wanted to switch off the current on the line, but it was not possible due to the difference in power supply between the two countries.
Furthermore, the Luxembourg train had already entered the French network and was therefore out of his reach.
Commissioner, this example illustrates the danger of a lack of coordination between rail networks, whether they be privatised or still under the public service system.
The responsibility falls as much to the signalman as to the two companies and the authorities of the two Member States, and also to the lack of a sustained will to make rail networks interoperable.
The citizens will not find it acceptable that, by crossing the border by train, they are risking their lives as a result of inadequate systems.
For Luxembourg, international traffic represents 70% of its turnover.
Our situation is therefore a special one, and even more efforts are required in order to achieve interoperability of networks.
This is a key priority. If our Parliament's Committee on Transport's approach leads to investments in the railways, then that is the right path to take.
Mr President, first of all, like all of the Members who have congratulated you warmly, I too would like to say what a pleasure it is to take part in this sitting over which you are presiding.
I would like to thank all of the Members.
We have had more than forty speeches, and I have seen that there is great interest in the future of Europe's railways.
I thank you, because the Commission and myself see this as an absolute priority.
I would like to make a few brief comments, Mr President.
First of all, I would like to point out that the Commission is not opposed in principle to the opening up to competition of domestic services, but that it believes that a decision within the context of the third rail package would be premature.
The Commission will continue to examine the issue and if it feels that the circumstances are right, it will be able to exercise its right of initiative in the field.
I would add that we also have the possibility of introducing competition elements, particularly by means of the text on the regulation of public service obligations, which itself is based on contractualisation, transparency and a degree of opening up to competition, while respecting subsidiarity.
I believe that the Commission's position has been clearly expressed in what I have said.
On the second point, I note that there is unanimity on the certification of train drivers operating locomotives and trains, and what Mrs Hennicot-Schoepges has just said to us demonstrates the absolute need for technical interoperability, but also for human interoperability.
Crew members responsible for rail safety, including drivers and all staff participating in the operation of the train, must receive training in accordance with their responsibilities.
I entirely agree with Mr Savary on this point.
Finally, the third proposal, which appears in Mr Sterckx's report, has the merit of covering domestic services, while providing for a system of temporary exemption.
That seems to me to be a very good basis for future negotiations.
I would also like to take this opportunity to say, to Mr Grosch in particular, that we have not forgotten the fourth element of this rail package, which is the quality of freight.
The Commission has not forgotten this issue, which is important in terms of revitalising rail freight in Europe.
It has regular contacts with the associations representing freight customers, and I shall produce a report on the development of the quality of freight in Europe before the end of the year, as was indicated at first reading.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, those are the comments I wished to make at the end of this debate, a debate that has genuinely demonstrated Parliament's interest in promoting the railways, both for passengers and for freight.
I hope that everybody, in their soul and conscience, will vote in a way that will allow us to move forward.
I would add that I am prepared to be fully involved in the delicate and difficult task of mediating between Parliament and the Council with a view to concluding this third rail package.
(FR) I am delighted that rail passengers are finally going to have rights, particularly in relation to compensation, information and facilities for persons with reduced mobility.
With regard to Mr Jarzembowski's report, while the liberalisation of international passenger transport is a good thing, which increases the efficiency of that mode of transport, I do not agree with the rapporteur's views on the opening up to competition of national traffic.
If this Parliament votes for total liberalisation of rail traffic tomorrow, I would like to be certain that you have taken account of two fundamental points.
First of all, the issue of standardisation.
We adopted an amendment to that effect in committee. It should allow loss-making railway lines to continue to be funded if they meet public service objectives.
Secondly, if Parliament decides to open up national rail traffic to competition, I feel that it is important to ensure that, during the transitional period in which only international traffic is opened up, we prevent the veiled opening up of national passenger transport through the practice of cabotage.
The transitional period is necessary in order to allow rail companies to adapt.
(EL) The 'third package of measures' on rail transport in the ÎU paves the way for full liberalisation, in other words for the railways to be handed over to the monopolies, in order to safeguard and increase the profits of euro-unifying capital.
The EU measures to date in this sector also have sent ticket prices rocketing, resulted in thousands of redundancies, exacerbated the workers' slavery, struck at their wage and social rights and caused the number of accidents to spiral, despite the insulting government subsidies in the Member States.
The liberalisation of rail services also and the terms and conditions for certifying the qualifications of workers laid down by the ÎU signal the intensification of their exploitation, greater intensification of labour and more risks to passenger safety.
The hypocritical pronouncements about institutionalising passenger rights simply 'cloak' the painful consequences of liberalisation for railway workers and passengers.
The basic conclusion is that, within this framework of the exploitative system which operates on the basis of profit for capital, this social requirement cannot be satisfied by the monopolies, which is why radical change is needed.
The Greek Communist Party voices its categorical opposition to the anti-grassroots policy of the ÎU and has voted against the third package of measures to liberalise rail transport.
Amendment of the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement (debate)
The next item is the recommendation by Mr Ribeiro e Castro on behalf of the Committee on Development on the proposal for a Council decision concerning the conclusion of the Agreement amending the Partnership Agreement between the members of the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States, of the one part, and the European Community and its Member States, of the other part, signed in Cotonou on 23 June 2000 (6987/2006 - C6-0124/2006 -.
rapporteur. - (PT) Madam President, firstly, I wish to congratulate you on your election.
Ladies and gentlemen, almost 800 million people are now covered by the Cotonou Agreement, which, following on from the LomÃ© establishing agreement, has guided relations between the EU and African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries since 2000.
I sincerely hope that these relations will be increasingly close and mutually beneficial.
The assent contained in my report, which I call on the Chamber to support, concerns the first five-yearly revision of the agreement, pursuant to Article 95 thereof.
Despite the fact that the amendments put forward are deliberately limited - after all, the stability of agreements of this type and size should be maintained - they are generally to be welcomed.
They are aimed at improving the effectiveness of compliance with the LomÃ©/Cotonou acquis, which is based primarily on equality between the parties and on respect for human rights, democracy, the rule of law and good governance.
After the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the Cold War, we were able to include references to human rights and subsequently, in 2000, to provide for a stronger political dimension to our relations and to give priority to fighting poverty and improving our economic and financial partnership.
The 2005 revision, on the other hand, strengthened the aspect of political dialogue, which became more systematic, structured and formalised, with a view to helping prevent and resolve crises.
Other aspects that should be brought into the body of the agreement include combating terrorism, given its pressing, topical nature, and reference to the Millennium Goals, which bind the EU-ACP joint commitment to reducing poverty and improving levels of education and health, without which there cannot be genuine development.
Other issues that form part of this revision are decentralised local authorities, prevention of mercenary activities, promotion of traditional knowledge, prevention of HIV-AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, and encouragement of student and youth exchanges, all of which demonstrates the signatories' greater awareness of the specific problems and aspirations of the people of ACP countries.
I must also highlight, and welcome, the fact that, for the first time, express reference is made to national parliaments as aid recipients.
The development of parliamentary capacity is key to ensuring good governance and to ensuring that there is full public debate on the development policy choices and priorities of each of the recipient countries.
Many of the countries to which the Union sends substantial aid as part of the Cotonou framework integrate these funds into their budgets.
Nevertheless, there have been many complaints that the funds sent have not always made an effective contribution, in terms of what is necessary and desirable, to promoting and firmly establishing these values.
There have also been frequent criticisms that the countries concerned often distribute European funds in a way that is discriminatory and arbitrary and that public administration is not always objective and impartial.
This type of situation flies in the face of the core principles that underpin the award of EU funds.
The Community institutions must therefore bring in tighter conditions as regards involving all of the political forces and the civil society of the recipient countries in discussing and defining the priorities for using the aid awarded.
As I proposed at the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly, which adopted this suggestion in November 2005 at the Edinburgh summit, this process of inculcating a sense of responsibility and of raising awareness at national level could take the form of an annual parliamentary debate in each national parliament of the recipient countries specifically focusing on external aid.
This should take place ideally some time before each country's annual debate on the national budget and would have the benefit of strengthening democratic institutions and of encouraging the people to exercise their rights as citizens.
Thus, as part of the agreement and the main body set up by the agreement, a spirit conducive to the crucial involvement of parliaments in programming and monitoring cooperation and in assessing the impact of such cooperation in the countries concerned would be created.
It is our duty to persevere with, promote and support this effort.
Notwithstanding the amendments, the most important of which I have highlighted, the Cape Verde Foreign Minster, speaking on behalf of the ACP countries, felt that the simplification of the administrative procedures applicable to access to the European Development Fund could have gone much further.
I share this concern and feel it is right to echo it here and ask the Council and the Commission to take it into account in future revisions.
To conclude, I invite the Members of this House to give their assent and urge Parliament, the Council and the Commission to do all they can to maintain and, where possible, to increase targeted, responsible aid to the ACP countries in the future.
Madam President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Ribeiro e Castro and the Committee on Development for their positive assessment of the amendment of the Cotonou agreement, which is the cornerstone of the partnership between the ACP countries and the European Union.
This amendment will enable us to enhance our partnership and to extend it to security issues such as the fight against terrorism, the prevention of mercenary activities and the fight against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
Thanks to that agreement, there will be a more systematic, more institutional, dialogue on issues involving human rights, democracy and the rule of law.
That dialogue will take place before the launch of the consultation procedure, known as the Rule 96 procedure, except in cases of particular urgency.
I would like to stress the increased role of national parliaments and of the joint parliamentary assembly within this context.
Furthermore, the revised agreement maintains a volume of aid identical to that provided for in the ninth European Development Fund with the addition of inflation, the impact of European Union GDP growth and the accession of ten new Member States in 2004.
As you know, that decision in principle was translated, at the meeting of the ACP-EU Council of Ministers in Port-Moresby in June 2006, into a commitment of around EUR 22 billion.
That is the total sum of the 10th European Development fund for geographical cooperation with the ACP countries for the six-year period from 2008 to 2013.
On an annual basis, that represents a nominal increase of 35% compared to the 9th European Development Fund.
Finally, since no money provided for in the 9th European Development Fund can be committed after 31 December 2007, it is essential that the review of the Cotonou Agreement, and of what is known as the internal agreement of the 10th European Development Fund, is ratified by all of the Member States before the end of 2007.
Otherwise, the operations of the 10th European Development Fund will be unable to begin on 1 January 2008.
I am convinced, and I am speaking on behalf of my colleague Louis Michel, that the assent of the European Parliament will send a strong signal to the Member States and will speed up the internal ratification procedures.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Madam President, I would like you to know first of all that I am very happy to see you holding this Presidency. It is rare to see women in that position.
The review of the Cotonou Agreement was a significant challenge.
We would like to give it real political content by refocusing it on the Millennium objectives and the eradication of poverty.
It should be acknowledged, however, that this revision does not entirely live up to its ambitions.
Our group has had the opportunity to express its disagreement on several occasions on two points in particular.
The first relates to the integration of two commitments into the fundamental values of the agreement: one relating to terrorism, the other to weapons of mass destruction.
We are not opposed to them as such, but we feel that the principles of democracy and respect for human rights must remain the main benchmarks of this agreement.
My second point relates to the financial dimension.
The tenth EDF, which has been the subject of tough negotiations, could not be integrated into the revised agreement.
Nevertheless, we are not now proposing that the assent be refused, firstly because progress has been made on many points, such as enhancement of political dialogue, the reference to national parliaments as beneficiaries of aid and support for the International Criminal Court from signatories of the agreement.
Secondly, because our ACP partners themselves have accepted the revised agreement and are eager to implement its financial chapter, for which I believe we have obtained a more or less acceptable sum.
It is therefore pointless to look back. From now on we have a new battle to wage.
We must be certain that every euro genuinely contributes to achieving the development objectives and therefore ensure that the programming of the tenth EDF is better.
For example, by setting political objectives that would consist in allocating 20% of the sums to basic education or health in the ACP countries, or by attaching more importance than we currently do to the gender dimension in our development policy.
That is the work facing us over the coming weeks, ladies and gentlemen.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, the new provision for building parliamentary capacity in ACP countries is particularly welcome.
In recent years the European Union has committed increasing resources to election observation missions in ACP countries, but those of us who have acted as observers are acutely aware that a well-conducted election is only the very first step in the process of establishing good governance.
Too many newly-elected parliaments have struggled in the absence of a trained civil service, or any opportunity to look at best practice in areas such as budget control, so the specific reference to enhancing parliamentary capacity is very important.
However, the fact that MEPs' involvement in the Cotonou Agreement is limited to the assent procedure is frustrating, especially as we take on new areas of scrutiny under the Development Cooperation Instrument.
It would be helpful for us to have at least some input into the formulation of ACP countries' strategy papers, which are the key instrument for the development of the Millennium Development Goals, now specifically referred to in the partnership agreement.
on behalf of the ITS Group. - (FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are discussing the revision of a complex agreement, the Cotonou Agreement, which contains 100 articles, 6 parts, 5 annexes and 5 protocols.
This revised agreement contains the whole catalogue of today's politics, with human rights, democracy, terrorism, arms, the International Criminal Court.
All the ACP countries need now is REACH, since they risk being victims of the regulation on chemical products, with losses of income and 315 000 jobs under threat.
Metals, alcohol, oils, ammonia, which are exported from 24 major ACP countries, will be hit by REACH, representing a potential loss of income of EUR 6 billion for those countries.
That takes us to the real truth about Europe's relations with the ACP countries over the last thirty years.
From the YaoundÃ© agreement of 1963 up to the Cotonou Agreement of 2000, revised in 2005, and the LomÃ© I, II, III and IV agreements from 1975 onwards, it appears that Europe has been audacious, particularly with the Stabex mechanism, which has protected cocoa, tea, coffee and groundnuts.
This demonstrates the spirit of the compensatory inequalities of the CNUCED.
Europe has also been generous by means of financial aid from the EDF.
Mr Barrot pointed out that there is an allocation of around EUR 25 billion for the 79 ACP countries in the 9th EDF.
The reality is different, however.
According to the figures, the ACP countries' share in the Union market has dropped from 6.7% in 1976 to 3% in 1998, and while the GDP of a European increased by an average of 2.3% per year, that of an African from an ACP country, if I dare say it, increased by just 0.6%.
In terms of actions too, Europe has forgotten about the ACP countries, just as it has forgotten about the Mediterranean.
Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, Europe has been interested in the East, but no longer in the South.
And what is worse, with the WTO, Europe has swallowed up the ACP countries in the world market, as we have seen in the case of sugar and bananas.
The multinational banana producer Chiquita has been given preference over Cameroon, which produces bananas, and the Ivory Coast.
Ultra-liberal Europe has chosen to make a customs gift of around EUR 2 billion to the multinationals Chiquita, Del Monte and others, rather than to the ACP countries, which have to face the same competition conditions as these multinationals.
Cotonou, with its talk of democracy and dialogue, is all very well, but when people have AIDS, human rights are not going to cure them.
In other words, rather than being revised, the Cotonou Agreement should be re-worked so as to be audacious in two respects.
Firstly, technical audacity through a new customs technology: rather than seeking, within the World Trade Organisation, to reduce, and eventually abolish, customs duties, we must establish a deduction of customs duties in the form of a customs credit deductible on all purchases in the economy of the importing country.
This customs credit would be reimbursable, that is to say, it would be higher than the sum of the customs duty paid, for example by the ACP country.
With new customs duties that are flexible, reimbursable and negotiable on the world stock market, Europe-ACP relations would be consistent with the necessary free trade and the equally necessary protection of the ACP countries.
Secondly, we should show political audacity in a reworked Cotonou Agreement.
With globalisation, the challenge of the 21st century consists in organising the common aspects of planetary co-ownership - that is to say, water, food, basic medicines and vaccines and education - all with a resource other than the classic State contribution of the EDF, a fiscal resource such as VAT based on the turnover of telecommunications services provided by space satellites.
In this case, we would no longer provide improved assistance in the name of co-development, but we would gradually move towards global land management.
That would restore the spirit of LomÃ©, and we would finally begin to build the world, which is the challenge of the 21st century.
(NL) Madam President, I am delighted that this week in Strasbourg, we are able to vote on the first five-yearly review of the Cotonou Agreement since we concluded it in 2000 for a 20-year period.
This agreement covers 78 countries in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific Ocean and involves no fewer than some 750 million people.
It is a partnership agreement about aid and trade and sets an example others should follow with regard to sustainable relations between the EU and development partners.
Europe as a soft power in conflict prevention, good governance, the fight against corruption - these things mean that, together with the EU Member States, we can make the difference as far as the Millennium Objectives are concerned.
From 1 January 2008, nearly EUR 24 billion, half of the total EU's development budget, will be available for a six-year period.
This is why it would be useful for Parliament to monitor spending in respect of the European Development Fund, but unfortunately, Commissioner, this EDF budget is not incorporated in the EU's own, which is something you in the Commission and we in this House would both have wanted.
In order to add meaning to the European Parliament's role, you, together with the Council - which is unfortunately absent today - will need to make specific agreements with us, as we did for the Development Cooperation Instrument, the DCI, which I would urge you to take as a model for the national policy documents of the ACP countries, in other words for more or less the whole of our Africa policy.
This means that Parliament will be informed in good time, enabling it to make a meaningful contribution to the national policy documents.
This will also translate into a clear and transparent process and an open dialogue between the Council, the Commission and Parliament.
Moreover, this will improve Parliament's input and scope for monitoring the programme, as well as implementing and assessing national policy documents.
This will also mean that the people's representation is not far removed from us, or from them, the parliaments in those countries or society.
Ownership is all very well, but this does not just involve the Finance Minister in a country like this; it also involves the parliament, the government and society.
If we go down this road, then, we are faced with the weighty opinions of the parties involved, even before the policy has been signed and voted on.
We want to move away from a situation where we all talk about the Millennium Objectives at the same time as Africa is actually moving further away from them, as is evident from the fact that we only appear to be filling in the cracks in the roads, however useful this may be.
We want the Millennium Objectives to take centre stage in the ACP countries too.
I would urge you to give this House democratic clout in respect of the EDF which amounts to half of the EU development budget.
This will stand both the Commission and the Council in good stead.
Pledge your support to democracy in Europe.
Which steps do the Commission and Council intend to take in order to achieve this?
Thank you very much, Madam President, and congratulations.
It is very good to see you in the Chair.
As others have said, we are very proud of the fact that the Cotonou Partnership Agreement represents binding contractual agreements with 78 African, Caribbean and Pacific countries.
It is, therefore, a very special relationship indeed.
Commissioner, we regret the fact that the great flurry of activity that we saw in 2005 on development and funding for development did not, in fact, include a substantial increase in the contribution of Member States of the European Union to the European Development Fund for the ACP.
The reality is that the 10th EDF represents only 0.28 % of Member States' GDP. That contradicts what you said in terms of how you saw the results of those negotiations.
I agree with you on the pace of ratification; that remains of enormous concern.
Only four Member States of the European Union and five of the ACP have currently ratified this part of the Agreement, and I think that is of some concern.
I have some questions for you.
I know you are not the Commissioner for Development, but perhaps if it is not possible for you answer them, you will pass them on.
In Barbados, Commissioner Michel promised to submit the country strategy papers to ACP countries' parliaments for their scrutiny.
I want to know whether progress has been made on this commitment, and whether we can have some description from the Commission on where we stand on that.
Further to that, I would like to ask you whether you are prepared to enter into structural dialogue with the European Parliament on the country strategy papers for ACP countries.
My colleague, Mr van den Berg, has said that we want the same status for the ACP as we have for the DCI country strategy papers.
Furthermore, I want to know how the Commission responds to questions that, I think, we in the Parliament have to ask, for instance on budget support to a country like Haiti, which has been recognised by Transparency International as the most corrupt country in the world.
How is it that the Commission is now proposing to give budget support to Haiti?
The same question applies to Equatorial Guinea.
On our committee, we find it very difficult to understand those decisions.
With regard to Togo, we see that the Commission is now prepared to normalise relations.
We want to know where we stand on the 22 commitments: are they being fulfilled by Togo.
At the Vienna JPA, the Commission promised to send details to us on the progress with Togo and we have, as yet, as I understand it from our secretariat, received absolutely no information on that.
Finally, Commissioner, will you undertake to work more closely with the European Parliament on these issues in order to make sure that the Joint Parliamentary Assembly's views are taken into account?
I urge the Commission to answer the serious questions of this kind that we are addressing to you this evening.
(FR) Madam President, please allow me to stress the curious aspect of this parliamentary consultation procedure.
Our institution has been invited to give its assent to the conclusion of the revised Cotonou treaty, which was signed back in June 2005.
By issuing our opinion today, we can only therefore approve something that has already been concluded.
Nevertheless, the decision-making process with the ACP countries would benefit from being enriched by the participation of the European Parliament.
Indeed, during the negotiations on the development cooperation instrument (DCI), we demonstrated our very significant added value and our capacity to defend interests other than those of the Commission and the Council.
Having said that, I believe that the revised Cotonou Agreement represents considerable progress, particularly with regard to the role of local sectors in development policy: for the first time, their role has been clarified, and they are explicitly recognised as full partners in the political dialogue.
We have just obtained the same recognition for the DCI.
The great development challenges are faced at local level.
The time has come to decentralise our development policy.
Access to water, healthcare and education are social services provided locally by bodies that are close to their citizens.
If European Union funds remain blocked at central government level, there will be no effective aid to benefit populations directly.
That is one of the reasons why I welcome the adoption of the revised Cotonou Agreement. We must now remain vigilant in order to ensure that it is implemented.
(PT) I too should like to congratulate you, Madam President.
I also wish to congratulate Mr Ribeiro e Castro on his report and on the positive developments evidenced by this revision.
I wish to highlight the support for the International Criminal Court and reference to the Millennium Development Goals, without which there could not be a development strategy.
Furthermore, I should like to highlight the importance of the new cooperation clause on combating the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, an area in which the EU must do more in terms of close collaboration and technical assistance.
We must also do more on the proliferation of small arms, which are the biggest killers in our partner countries.
I must also admit to feeling a degree of frustration as regards EU-ACP relations in seeing our counterparts from some ACP countries in the Joint Parliamentary Assembly convey the official positions of their governments uncritically.
We must clearly do more to strengthen national parliaments and their capacity to scrutinise the national budgets, and their budgets for cooperation and for fighting corruption.
For its part, the EU must stop overlooking, and start using, the clauses laid down in this agreement aimed at urging signatory governments to put an end to serious violations of human rights and of the most fundamental principles of democracy and good governance.
I join those MEPs who called on the Commission to involve Parliament in scrutinising cooperation policy with ACP countries.
(FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, though it has come late, I am delighted that the European Parliament is being consulted on this subject.
This evening's debate gives us an opportunity to express our satisfaction once again with the progress introduced by the revision of the agreement, particularly in terms of the improvements between partners, as a result of their policies on protecting human rights and promoting democracy.
This consultation is also an opportunity to recall our concerns at the time when the text was being signed.
I am thinking in particular of the article that makes the fight against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction a fundamental aspect of the ACP-EU partnership.
Having said that, I would like to stress, or recall, that the priority objective of the cooperation between the two regions was the fight against poverty and the fight for development.
Since 2005, new concerns have arisen.
They involve the future of our commercial relations with the ACP countries.
How can we state, as in the case of the revised Cotonou Agreement, that the Millennium development objectives must underpin ACP-EU cooperation, without worrying about the consequences of future economic partnership agreements for the well-being of the populations of these countries, without carrying out an impact study prior to the launch of the negotiations?
How can we emphasise the importance of supporting regional integration organisations created by the ACP countries, while not respecting existing groupings in the negotiations and also knowing that, in the negotiations as they are currently conducted, we cannot take account of the interests of countries of different sizes and different levels of development?
The revision of the Cotonou Agreement has above all made it possible to highlight the importance of political dialogue amongst partners.
It is on this basis that the European Union and the ACP countries must from now on work towards eliminating misunderstandings, make progressive and constructive progress in the negotiations and reach agreements that are fully in favour of the development of the ACP countries.
Madam President, I would like to say to all of the honourable Members who have spoken that I shall communicate their remarks as accurately as possible to my colleague Louis Michel, who will pursue the dialogue on the whole of this development policy in the way you wish.
I shall tell him that Parliament takes great interest in the evolution of this policy, which he manages with great conviction, as you know.
Many of you have stressed the importance of this partnership.
I would like to return to the financial envelope.
It is true that EUR 23.7 billion of that sum should be allocated as operational credits for the ACP countries.
This sum can be compared to the EUR 22.7 billion proposed by the Luxembourg Presidency.
This sum will be integrated by means of an increased effort on the part of the European Investment Bank in its support for the ACP countries through own resources.
It is still a substantial sum.
On an annual basis, it represents an increase of 35% compared to the 9th European Development Fund.
Furthermore, support for the ACP countries must be seen within the wider context of the Community's external actions and, in general terms, the ACP countries will also benefit from thematic budget lines and funds reserved for the ACP countries that are signatories to the sugar protocol, in the sum of EUR 1.2 billion.
These funds, which are payable from the Community's general budget, will increase the proportion of the Community's development cooperation earmarked for the ACP countries, as compared with previous financial perspectives.
I believe that I have thereby highlighted the progress that some of you have mentioned, while accepting that this policy will be subject to many further developments, since it is true that it is now part of the European Union's duty and purpose.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.

I declare the session open.
I am very pleased to have been elected: this is my first time as President of this House.
I regard it as absolutely crucial and highly symbolic that I am opening this session with a debate on gender parity and equality.
It must be said that our Parliament has made some significant progress, and I hope that it continues to do so.

Equality between men and women in the committees' work (debate)
The next item is the report by Anna ZÃ¡borskÃ¡, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, on gender mainstreaming in the work of the committees.
rapporteur. - (SK) Over the past few years, the issues of women's dignity and their mission have taken on a new dimension.
This is particularly evident within the framework of the European Union's horizontal policies that have been shaped by the Lisbon Strategy, such as those addressing the demographic challenge and the work-life balance, as well as those combating violence against women.
Recognising the differences between women and men, on the one hand, and nurturing complementarities between them, on the other, may contribute significantly towards enhancing democracy and parliamentarianism, to the benefit of EU citizens.
Freedom means more than just the freedom to compete, as the Chancellor, my favourite politician, pointed out yesterday.
Women have a special value in a broad and distinctive context inspired mainly by the protection of human rights.
On the one hand, this is due to the value of women as human beings with a right to inviolable respect for their basic dignity. On the other hand, this is due to their femininity, irrespective of the cultural context or their spiritual, mental or physical characteristics, such as age, health, education, employment or marital status.
The report on gender mainstreaming within the work of the European Parliament's committees is the fruit of cooperation in the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality during the first half of the present term.
The report was unanimously approved in the committee, for which I am extremely grateful.
In parliamentary committees we do not often enjoy such shared triumphs or the benefits of such a well-targeted approach. At present, the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality is the most important instrument for supporting the efforts that still need to be undertaken in other committees to ensure genuine equality between women and men.
My committee has come up with the first methodological model that can be applied to assess performance in all parliamentary committees.
The model is described in the Explanatory Statement.
The data from the questionnaires completed by the committees which responded to our survey were carefully processed by the secretariat of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality.
If all committees had responded, the evaluation would have been far more comprehensive.
All committees should heed our recommendations.
Following debates in the Committee on Women's Rights, a number of amendments were adopted which reinforce the content of the report.
I would like, however, to dwell on the three amendments pertaining to paragraphs 8, 21 and 22.
In my opinion, these amendments would undermine the powers vested with the Committee for Women's Rights and Gender Equality, and are not entirely consistent with the European Parliament's Rules of Procedure.
I particularly value the fact that the drafting of the report has fuelled a pluralistic parliamentary debate, highlighting the importance of the underlying problem.
I would like to thank all of my fellow MEPs, both women and men, who have been actively involved in this exercise and have helped me to prepare the report.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (HU) Madam President, the report of the chairwoman, Mrs ZÃ¡borskÃ¡, urges us toward an ever greater fulfilment of the most fundamental European issue, our common goal of equality between men and women, here within the walls of the European Parliament, with regard to the division of responsibilities and tasks within the existing parliamentary committees.
The question and the way the question is posed is far from unambiguous even within the walls of Parliament, as previous cycles and indeed the most recent one indicate; this is perhaps why the problem has not yet been resolved, even though in recent times the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality has made great efforts to assess the situation and to bring about change.
Integrating the principle of gender equality into the everyday life of society, communicating it to all people, the struggle against established stereotypes, the ever more fruitful use of women's capacities and knowledge, and our true equality of opportunity remain very distant goals in Europe.
This situation comes in for very sharp criticism by the rapporteur in the European Parliament.
In my experience, scepticism here in Parliament with regard to the question of gender equality is in many cases the consequence of the fact that equality of opportunity is still erroneously regarded by most people as a struggle in which one group - in this case men - surrender power and privileges in the interests of another group - in this case women.
The European Parliament is an institution that sets an example, and it can maintain and strengthen this status only if in the course of our daily parliamentary work we fully represent, in our professional committees as well, those principles and directives which we are struggling to realise on a European level, and which we set down as standards for the Member States.
We would like to see women in as many committee positions as possible.
The European political parties must strive to promote the participation of women in public life, to put more women forward for election, and here in Parliament they should encourage and create fairer and more equal representation.
The European Parliament must set an example.
In each policy area, from planning through evaluation, and for all practical questions before Parliament, we must keep the promotion of equal opportunities for men and women at the centre of our attention.
The struggle over committee positions and the Year of Equal Opportunities for All, in my view, provide an excellent framework right now for this purpose.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DA) Madam President, excuse my being late, but I had to speak somewhere else.
I should like to start by thanking the rapporteur for this very important report, and I want to say how necessary it is for us to take this issue seriously.
We have just witnessed our election of 14 deputy chairmen here in Parliament, only three of whom are women.
We are in the process of electing chairmen and deputy chairmen for all of Parliament's committees, and I think that we should have a policy on gentleman streaming where our own political appointments are concerned.
Thank you very much for the work done on the report.
I hope that it will be followed up.
Madam President, first of all I would like to wish you luck and success in your new and important position.
This year is a year of equal opportunities in the European Union, and thus it is a year for us all: men and women.
Today we are discussing gender mainstreaming in the context of the work of our own commissions.
And I would like to draw attention to the fact that this is the first document in the political work of the parliamentary commissions to be devoted to the concrete assessment of gender mainstreaming.
Here I would like to thank rapporteur Mrs Anna ZÃ¡borskÃ¡ for her expert work.
In a few months we will be celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Rome.
Pursuant to Article 2 of the Treaty Establishing the European Economic Community, equality between men and women is a fundamental principle of community law - I emphasise that this fundamental principle, and thus also its advancement, is the indisputable task of the community.
The Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms has been signed by all Member States of the European Union.
I ask you: why do we not implement it?
Why do we not have a functioning supervisory mechanism and effective measures to carry out and guarantee what has been decided upon?
These decisions were made half a century ago.
Parliament still passes new documents on the same topic every year, in which it emphasises, undertakes and requires.
In the document under discussion, however, we must recognise today, in the year 2007, that women are underrepresented in our own parliamentary administration in the bodies that make political decisions.
Finally, I would ask that all of us who have been elected to the highest level of European politics should be decisive and put an end to the wasting of already poor human resources and potential.
In our actions, let us accept women as equals to men, whether in the making of political decisions or on pay day.
Equal rights must become the law not only on paper, but also in everyday life.
This will also be the key to the successful implementation of the Lisbon Strategy.
You have congratulated me, and I congratulate those few men present in the House for this debate on gender equality because I believe that their presence is crucial when it comes to opposing the discrimination that still exists.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I truly wish you all the very best for your first day as President.
However, there is still a great deal left to do where women's rights are concerned; we have a long history of parliamentary work behind us, and it is precisely for that reason that we recognise how increasingly important it is to ensure that gender-related aspects are genuinely integrated into the work of the committees, and integrated in an effective and operational manner.
If we look at the reality of the situation, there are many problems to be resolved, and the figures are quite clear: it is still exceedingly difficult for women to enter and participate in political and institutional life, and that is without mentioning the endless unresolved problems they have in actually reconciling their working lives with their family lives.
That is precisely why, if we are to attempt to do away with the inequalities, we need to intervene openly in every action and policy carried out by the Union.
Furthermore, the rapporteur - whom I thank for her excellent work - has done well to highlight the fact that there is still not a suitable culture encouraging women to participate in political life.
I should like to give an example: in Italy there is no law on the so-called pink quotas, and, personally, I am not convinced that quotas are necessarily the best system.
However, in Italy, parties that have freely decided to include more women on their lists of candidates, such as the party to which I belong, have actually seen an increase in the number of female politicians represented in parliament, and this is a positive development - it is an example of good practice that should be exported, nay, imposed at Community level.
To conclude, I expect all the Community institutions and, in particular, the German Presidency, to put women back in the spotlight and to launch a genuine European family pact.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FI) Madam President, I too wish to thank the rapporteur, Mrs ZÃ¡borskÃ¡, for the excellent work she has done.
I would also like to congratulate the President on her election.
It is excellent that the European Parliament has made it compulsory for the committees to implement gender mainstreaming.
This is a process that is bound to take a long time, and it is important that the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality is heading the project.
I know that there are also those in Parliament that are doubtful about all this, and I feel that in most cases it is those very people who need to be educated in the matter of equality.
When I was made responsible for this issue in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, I asked the Committee on Women's Rights to specify those tasks that had to be accomplished in gender mainstreaming, and the committee produced the questionnaire in a form that was instructive and very welcome.
I drafted a preliminary proposal for the Committee on the Environment based on this questionnaire.
There are still no decisions on it, but I will be proposing in my committee, for example, that every year the Committee on Women's Rights should produce statistics on the gender distribution among coordinators and rapporteurs and in the secretariat.
I will also propose that a pilot project should be set up to establish mainstreaming in particular and to identify areas where especially close cooperation should be engaged in with the Committee on Women's Rights.
In my view, the Committee on Women's Rights could produce for the plenary sessions more concrete draft resolutions than these on what the committees should be doing.
I believe that this issue should be taken forward in the most effective way possible, so that plenary can both make binding decisions and recommendations on what should be done on the committee.
Finally, I would like to say that the political groups should also be paying heed to gender equality.
It is the political groups that will have the main role in deciding how equality is to be implemented when they elect their chairs and fill the posts of chair and deputy chair of committees in negotiations between groups.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (SV) Thank you, Madam President.
Please accept my most sincere congratulations on your new appointment as Vice-President.
I am very pleased indeed.
The current report rightly states that there is still an imbalance between women and men in all areas of society.
The evaluation of the ways in which the committees have so far complied with Parliament's decision that the gender equality perspective should always permeate our work shows, unsurprisingly, that there is still an incredible amount to be done before we can say that the equality perspective really has been integrated into our work.
This is not news.
There are many of us who, in the general run of our daily work, experience the inequality between men and women and the unequal conditions that apply to us.
That is not something peculiar to the European Parliament.
We are forced to observe that, whether we are talking about parliamentary work or about the way in which society operates in general, economic and political power is in practice still the province of the one gender, that is to say of men.
Despite all our talk about the importance of gender equality, it is clearly easier to talk about it than to implement it in practical terms.
We need a variety of instruments in order to tackle issues of gender equality and take steps to bring such equality about.
Such instruments include education and knowledge.
If we are to change things, we need to clarify the power structures.
We are therefore looking forward to the work of the Institute for Gender Equality.
Among the tools with which it will be able to provide us are more widely shared knowledge, together with statistics broken down according to gender.
Another important tool when it comes to gender equality is education.
It is important for us to allow officials to continue with their further training on the integration of the gender equality perspective.
What is just as important, however, is that Members of the European Parliament too should receive training in equality.
It is not true to say that, as elected politicians, we automatically have a sufficient knowledge of gender equality and the integration of the gender equality perspective.
This is, however, a situation that we can do something about.
We can vote in favour of the proposal in the report that gender equality training should be arranged for all MEPs before the next term of office.
I urge you to vote for this in the report.
Thank you.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Madam President, the previous speaker has just made reference, regretfully, apparently, to lots of jobs in politics going to the stronger people - the men.
She obviously never met Mrs Thatcher!
Why cannot these reports be written in plain language?
The term 'gender mainstreaming' occurs throughout the report; what is that?
Is it some kind of political correctness?
Paragraph 16, which is all about filling vacancies in EU institutions, says that gender mainstreaming is 'to be taken into account'.
Does that mean specific jobs for men and specific jobs for women?
Paragraph 1 calls for 'gender equality [...] which does not set women against men'.
Does that mean men and women cannot apply for the same job in case it sets the one against the other?
Recital A states that some committees 'never take an interest' in gender mainstreaming.
Goodness, what do we do about that?
But, wait a bit, there are some facts and figures to go with the jargon.
Recital F refers to the 'continuous increase in the percentage of female Members of the European Parliament, from 17.5 % in 1979 to 30.33 % in 2004'.
But, then, recital G notes that, in EU administration, 'women are under-represented in positions of responsibility' where political decisions are taken.
Clearly, we are leading to reverse discrimination.
Any kind of discrimination is not only thoroughly bad, but surely goes against all that the EU stands for.
Inevitably, you then move on to quotas, but the report also calls for the dignity of women.
In Britain, other political parties have women-only candidate lists.
What kind of dignity is that?
Our party does not do it.
In the situation under consideration here, what happens if not enough women apply to satisfy the quota?
Do you leave the post unfilled?
I suppose, now, some people will think they have got some kind of raving chauvinist on their hands - not so.
I am a teacher, I taught for 39 years and I did so happily with many women.
I worked for women in teaching, very happily - no problem.
I respected them all.
I simply believe that women should have no bar to going for qualifications and should apply for posts on a totally equal basis.
Anything else, like this report, is demeaning to women, and any self-respecting woman should find this report offensive.
I ask Members to dismiss it with their vote.
(SK) In 1993, the UN General Assembly in Vienna stated for the first time the principle that human rights include the rights of women, and that the protection of those rights was a priority objective.
The Beijing Platform for Action later recognised gender equality as a major objective and identified 12 critical areas of concern.
Let me mention but a few of them: women and poverty; education; women and health; violence against women; armed conflicts; women and the mass media; the participation of women in decision-making processes and in political and social structures.
Notwithstanding the multitude of institutions active in the enforcement of these instruments, including the UN, Council of Europe, OSCE and the European Union, one can conclude that today gender equality is only implemented de jure, not de facto.
We often seek an excuse in the percentages of women in various organisations.
What we fail to observe, however, is that those percentages primarily reflect a presence at the lower or lowest levels of an institution.
The higher up we climb the management ladder, the fewer women we find there.
I believe that the tried-and-tested principle applies in this case also: if we want to bring about change, let us begin with ourselves.
This is perhaps why the report drawn up by my fellow MEP, Mrs ZÃ¡borskÃ¡, is so important.
In the European Parliament we can also say that, percentage-wise, the representation of women has improved in comparison with the past.
We should realise, however, that women typically fill lower positions, be it in the European Parliament or the secretariats.
Moreover, I daresay that within the secretariats we have implemented the gender equality principle fully, as women enjoy a majority there.
But is it the case that in the European Parliament the old prejudices still prevail, according to which women make good wives, mothers, mistresses, secretaries, cooks or even cleaning ladies, but not senior executives ?
It is regrettable that the only speech made so far by a male Member of this House has been of the sort we have all witnessed before.
(SK) Madam President, I too would like to congratulate you on your election to this position.
Thefact that you are presiding over this very debate may well be indicative.
I would like to express my admiration for the rapporteur for the clarity she brings to her description in the report of how equal opportunities are being implemented in this Parliament.
She does not claim that there is nothing left to be done in this Parliament regarding the promotion of equal opportunities.
On the contrary, she says clearly that gender mainstreaming has been well formulated and reflected in resolutions passed by Parliament, as well as directives adopted by the European Community, and it has also been institutionalised in the working groups and committees.
In terms of substance, however, interest in the topic has been confined to committees pledging to train their secretariats in gender mainstreaming.
It seems that some of my fellow Members are also in need of such training.
I would like to draw your attention to the fact that, in this Parliament, we often tend to underestimate the implications of the problem that remain to be resolved.
The ageing of Europe will be an impossible problem to solve unless we revise our approach to gender mainstreaming.
There can be no doubt that overhauling and modernising pension schemes will not in itself suffice.
At present the underlying problems appear to exist on two levels at the same time.
Firstly, the philosophical approach taken by political elites leads to indirect discrimination as a result of the application of the so-called civic principle, which clearly results in discrimination and a lack of equal opportunities.
Secondly, there are absolutely no practical initiatives aimed at reconciling the demands of work with those of family life, which creates dramatic differences in the opportunities that are available to men and women as a result of existing stereotypes which are difficult to overcome.
In view of the seriousness of the challenge that Europe is facing due to demographic changes, I strongly believe that the European Parliament should be working much more closely with national parliaments on matters of gender mainstreaming.
In my opinion, the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All offers an appropriate framework for that.
(DE) Madam President, I, too, am glad to see you in the Chair today, and warmly congratulate you on your election.
So far, this debate has been conducted in the absence of the Commission and the Council, and that was only right and proper.
Its subject is the practical implementation of gender mainstreaming in the committees, and, more specifically, the first interim report following on from the report I produced and which was adopted in 2003.
This report highlights very well how we should implement gender mainstreaming in this House, and, while it was right that we should concern ourselves with this, I do now rather fear that we have missed an opportunity, since we are all talking about everything under the sun except what we can do in this Parliament of ours.
What has become of its Paragraph 1, with its action plan for a policy of gender mainstreaming, that is to say, equality in every evaluation and analysis and the new development of concepts for the equality of women and men in Parliament?
There is still a very great deal left to be done, and no actual plan of action.
And what of the second, with its priorities for equality issues and a high-level working party?
This working party has done its job very well, and the right procedure was followed, in that reports were produced by all the committees.
As we have heard from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, some of the Vice-Chairmen of committees have done very good work, but what they did was sometimes exposed to ridicule.
What has become of our demand for women in decision-making positions within Parliament?
No definite action has been taken to make that happen.
The groups and the national delegations treated this demand with varying degrees of seriousness, but no proper strategy has been forthcoming.
What, then, of the analysis of the Budget procedure?
Here, too, no definite action has been taken, although the policy of gender budgeting was meant to have been given tangible form.
What progress has been made towards achieving an effective press and information strategy - something else that we called for in 2003 - which is another area where there are still considerable deficits?
Now that we are to conduct a proper analysis and evaluation, I very much hope that we will be helped, in the analysis of the committees, by the European Institute for Gender Equality, which we have recently voted to set up.
It is to be regretted, though, that the report has far from enough to say about the state of affairs in the groups, the delegations and the substance of policies, and so I should like to see us taking a more ambitious approach and managing, by 2009 - when elections are due - to achieve real agreements that make gender mainstreaming possible and put women in positions of leadership.
Grateful though I am for the work that has been done, we must still make very considerable effort to get anywhere near achieving the goal that we set ourselves in the 2003 report.
(LT) Gender equality in the EU is one of the most important democratic values, enabling freedom of self-expression and interpersonal relations on the basis of full equality.
However, this value has not yet been fully implemented: women are discriminated against in recruitment for jobs, and they are paid significantly lower wages than men for the same work.
The issues of gender equality and an integrated outlook on gender equality are widespread and topical, both at the member country level and at the European Union level.
I congratulate the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality on having initiated this study and having prepared a report about an integrated outlook on gender equality in the work of the European Parliament's committees.
The committees were assessed on the basis of a completed questionnaire, which reflected each committee's outlook and activities in forming gender equality strategy, implementing an integrated outlook on gender, and implementing gender consultation and cooperation activity.
In the Development Cooperation Committee, where I am responsible for gender integration issues, there were no particular discussions.
The committee works more on gender expertise and consultation issues with NGOs and developing countries.
It is my understanding that the gender integration issue mostly encounters difficulties in the committee because of the d'Hondt system used in the European Parliament.
When this system is applied, even when 30% of parliamentarians are women, the women of the smaller parties realistically have very little chance of preparing a report or an opinion.
This also deprives women of the opportunity to demonstrate their abilities and to express their viewpoints on issues vital to their nations, the European Union and the world.
Even though the system itself is supposed to give small parties the opportunity to present legislative documents, in reality this is hard to put into practice.
When monitoring the implementation of an integrated outlook on gender equality, this issue should be looked at in a broader context - the context of the European Parliament's work rules, which need to be improved.
(PL) Madam President, nature determined that there should be two types of human being, the male and the female, though they are both of equal value and importance.
Whether we like it or not, every culture fashioned mainly by religion, be it Islamic, Jewish or Christian culture, understands the relationship between men and women in its own particular way.
These relationships are constantly evolving and improving as time goes by.
The existence of a Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament and the report before the House today mark a high point in that process of evolution.
This evolution must not, however, be allowed to become a revolution.
We must not attempt to impose an artificial male-female relationship by force.
It is obviously important to ensure that men and women can enjoy the same opportunities for development, but it is not appropriate to impose artificial quotas of any kind.
I have in mind, for example, quotas for involvement in public life.
I believe the training and awareness-raising referred to in the report will prove helpful, but the introduction of quotas would amount to discrimination against better candidates in favour of worse ones, and could prove detrimental to the cause of women in the future.
There is nothing finer than the diversity of nature and culture we see all around us, and no greater source of inspiration for humankind.
I believe that the differences between men and women are the fount of life.
(DE) Madam President, I warmly congratulate you on your election.
I wish to express my support for this report, which I do not believe contains anything that goes against this House's Rules of Procedure, and my thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs ZÃ¡borskÃ¡, for the very good cooperation over the last two and a half years.
I was a member of the previous Bureau with responsibility for equality issues, and we joined in the Bureau's high-level working party with Mrs Roth-Behrendt, Mrs Lulling and Mrs GrÃ¶ner, as well as with Mr Friedrich and Mr Daul, in promoting gender mainstreaming in the work of our committees.
I should like to express my appreciation to you all, and it goes without saying that I would like also to thank the administration staff, in particular those in the department of DG Personnel responsible for equality of opportunity.

I am certain that the newly-elected Bureau will continue the work of the working party without interruption and with the same committed attitude, and it can do its work on a sound basis, for the former Bureau recently adopted, unanimously, my report on the development of equality of opportunity between 2002 and 2006, which formulated ambitious objectives to be achieved by 2009, including a marked increase in the proportion of women in leadership positions in this House, in particular in middle and top management.
We will be taking further steps to better enable our staff to balance work and family life, and will be more careful in future to use gender-neutral language in the conduct of this House's business.
It was the Bureau that first took action on gender budgeting, which is to be a task for all of us in this House in 2008.
I hope we will be able to arrange the necessary training and retraining for all Members.
(PL) Madam President, I too would like to congratulate you as you take up such an important role.
Equality for women can never be guaranteed by legal provisions alone.
It stands to reason that discrimination against women on the grounds of their gender must not be condoned in any circumstances.
It cannot be allowed in the work of the committees or in any other context.
Left-wing and liberal groupings tend to focus unduly on the fine detail of such matters.
It must be borne in mind that respect for women is not achieved through legal provisions. It comes about solely as a result of family upbringing.
I belong to The League of Polish Families, and we are certainly aware of the problem of discrimination against women.
At the level of national legislation, we are putting forward a range of legal provisions to benefit women and mothers.
We support and promote the role of women in politics and society.
Women have an important role to play in this House too.
We also support the effort to eliminate all cases of violation of women's dignity and freedom.
The debate on gender equality is an important one, but it cannot be allowed to lead to an ideological conflict in which men and women pit themselves against each other instead of working together, resulting in the emergence of a new kind of dogma.
There is a fundamental question that arises from time to time.
Is all this really about equality, equal rights and human dignity, or is it in fact about creating a new ideology?
Is that what we are about in this House too?
In my view and in the view of the League of Polish Families, special legal provisions are needed.
Such provisions should, however, be designed not only to ensure equal treatment for men and women, but also to protect the latter.
(SK) Madam President, I would like to congratulate you on your election to this position, as well as on the fact that the first debate over which you are presiding happens to be about women.
Ladies and gentlemen, I congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs ZÃ¡borskÃ¡, for her well-balanced report, and at the same time I would like to thank her for the excellent work she has been doing as chairman of the Committee for Women's Rights and Gender Equality.
I agree that it is imperative for women to be represented in the executive bodies of the European Parliament which take political decisions.
I also welcome the efforts to incorporate gender mainstreaming into the practical work of all of the committees of the European Parliament.
It is important to encourage interest in the topic on the part of the committees, and to ensure that they pay adequate attention to gender mainstreaming.
Gender mainstreaming is not a strategy to be implemented in one fell swoop; it is like a thread which should be woven through the entire political process in order to incorporate a gender equality aspect into all community policies on all levels.
The gender equality requirement should express itself in a practical approach that does not pit men and women against each other.
More emphasis on the importance of men's engagement in gender mainstreaming will add to the significance of issues previously considered to be the exclusive domain of women.
The political groups in the European Parliament could play a very important role in the process by promoting women's participation in public life, for example, by encouraging women to stand as candidates in elections for the European Parliament and national parliaments.
I strongly believe that in 2007, which is the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All, the European Parliament should provide an example through its own organisational structures of how gender equality is part and parcel of the political routine pursued here for the benefit of society, based on non-discrimination, tolerance, equality and solidarity.
I trust that the Member States will subscribe to this appeal and will echo it through the implementation of gender mainstreaming policies.
(HU) It is natural, is it not, that procreation, childrearing, caring for the sick and the elderly, keeping the family together, as well as health care, education and social services are unimaginable without the participation of women?
This is true in almost every area of life.
How, then, can we take decisions on any question or pass any law or regulation without taking into account their distinctive points of view?
It is an important goal for the policy of gender equality in the long term to be incorporated into all policy areas and to be present at all levels.
Mrs ZÃ¡borskÃ¡'s report is the first one to address an integrated approach to equal opportunity - many thanks for this.
Although the committees pay greater attention in their work to the perspectives of gender equality, yet to this day not a single body has laid down among the fundamental principles of its work the demands of equal opportunity.
The strategic basis is lacking: more women, but without more significant positions?
In our parliamentary committees we need to take more seriously the need to fulfil the demands of equal opportunity for men and women, and for this to happen we need to ensure adequate training and information.
This must not be allowed to set men against women; we must strive, instead, to make sure everyone recognises that the expression of women's viewpoints is in the interests of men as well.
Madam President, I am very proud that we now have the first female first-Vice-President.
I wish to congratulate you, as we now have some women in the main body of the European Parliament.
I welcome this report on gender mainstreaming in the committees.
Is it unique?
It is unique of its kind.
I should like to thank the rapporteur in particular for her excellent work.
It is of the utmost importance that the European Parliament uses its influential position in the Community to support and promote gender equality through healthy self-examination of its own methods of working.
The right to non-discrimination is protected by several European treaties, in particular the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
Nevertheless, we need to continue developing the legal instruments in order to protect everyone - man or woman - from discrimination based on gender.
Coming from a country, Finland, with a long history of working for equal opportunities for men and women, I was very pleased with the findings of the report by the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality.
It showed that most of the committees, at least, attach some importance to gender mainstreaming.
However, I would underline that we still have a long way to go.
I support the ideas put forward by Ms JÃ¡rÃ³ka, for example that all committees should have female members.
Even though the number of women in the European Parliament continues to increase, inequality continues to exist when it comes to the really important positions in the political bodies, such as committee chairs, etc. I therefore urge each and every committee to put gender mainstreaming into practice in its own work, since this is one way of enabling women to take part fully in the decision-making processes of the EU.
Finally, I should like to emphasise the need for specific data broken down by gender.
After all, that is the only way really to evaluate how we are doing and what still needs to be done.
Such gender-based statistics are very important for our future work.
(ES) Madam President, I would like to begin by congratulating you on your election, and also Mrs ZÃ¡borskÃ¡ on the work she has done on her report, which unfortunately once again points out that also in the public institutions there continues to be inequalities between men and women in positions of responsibility.
If our objective is to achieve full equality in society, we must offer an example of our own political commitment in the European institutions, and in the European Parliament in particular.
An integrated approach to gender equality in our work and more women in positions of responsibility are therefore two issues that should be taken very seriously by all of the bodies in our Parliament.
This report has the merit of being a document by our institution that takes one further step in this direction, but it should be followed up on, setting clear objectives to be achieved, the methods for achieving them, the people responsible for working towards achieving them, and carrying out periodic assessments that enable us to identify, on the one hand, any achievements, and on the other, the reasons why they may not have been achieved.
Only through constant and rigorous work by everybody in this institution will we be able create true equality between men and women.
(EL) Madam President, I congratulate you and all your male and female colleagues on your new office.
According to the fundamental principle of Community law on equality set out in Article 2 of the Treaty and the ambition to wipe out inequalities between men and women on the basis of the principle of an integrated approach to equality laid down in Article 3(2), the European Parliament made a political commitment in its resolution to acquire an institutional framework for this purpose.
The momentum was created back in 2005 by the Committee on Women's Rights and Equality and with the work carried out by the High-Level Group on Gender Equality.
Under the inspired guidance of President ZÃ¡borskÃ¡, and with substantial contributions from the representatives of all 21 parliamentary committees in charge of equality issues and their secretariats, today, in the Year of Equal Opportunities for All, the first document of the EP embodying its political commitment to self-criticism as regards the application of an integrated approach has been submitted for approval.
The findings were made using an unprecedented method for the European Parliament, an inventive method which was developed in order to map the current situation.
It is positive that, even though several committees laid down their priorities without a strategy on our issue, they are in favour of incorporating equality issues.
The report stipulates how mainstreaming will be achieved, in accordance with the plan which we are voting today to instruct the Committee on Women's Rights to prepare by the end of this parliamentary session.
Of course, we shall all need to go to crammer school before then, both employees and parliamentarians, so that we can develop suitable evaluation mechanisms to take account of the peculiarities of each parliamentary committee and ensure that policies are complementary and consistent and combine Members' responsibilities and interests.
Consolidating control of the integrated approach twice per legislative term will provide an opportunity for qualitative and quantitative appraisal.
It is a question of justice and I welcome the fact that the Commissioner responsible for justice is with us.
We must not criticise the failure to promote women to decision-taking positions; we must criticise the fact that worthy women are prevented from competing with worthy men.
We are calling, Commissioner, for rights to be restored and for a meritocracy to be set up in which men and women are equal.
(PL) Madam President, the European Parliament represents European society, which is made up of 492 million individuals and 27 countries.
The House does not accurately reflect the social structure of the society it represents, however, as the percentage of female MEPs is barely 30%.
This is far too low.
Only 13% of Polish MEPs are women, and there is not a single female MEP representing Malta and Cyprus.
The situation regarding administrative positions of responsibility in the European Parliament's political decision-making bodies is equally unsatisfactory.
Most of the committees are favourably inclined towards gender equality issues, but in practice they fail to take them into account when setting their political priorities.
Against this background, it is worth highlighting the significance of the creation of a High-Level Group on Gender Equality.
This group is also charged with working beyond the European Parliament and encouraging Member States to implement gender equality policies effectively.
Political parties and groups have a vital role to play in enabling women to participate fully in political life.
Certain groups and parties have already successfully applied a quota system to lists of candidates for public office.
The remainder should follow their example, so as to ensure that gender equality will actually become a reality across the Union in the future and not remain merely wishful thinking.
In conclusion, I should like to congratulate Mrs ZÃ¡borska on a very well prepared document.
I would also like to congratulate you, Madam President, on the occasion of your assuming your important role.
As a woman, I am delighted to see you in office.
(SL) A society where both sexes enjoy equality, develops more successfully than one controlled by the members of one sex.
However, as a result of natural dispositions, certain occupations remain that are better and more easily done by men and others by women.
However, we have known for a long time that men and women can prove themselves equally capable of performing leading jobs or carrying out political duties.
So why is it then necessary to adopt a report on gender equality when we live in the European Union, the most democratic society in the world and which has set itself the highest standards of democracy?
It has been confirmed through my own experience that this work is more than necessary, even in the European Union.
In various documents we are imposing new duties on our citizens, but when it comes to the allocation of prestigious political positions in our Parliament, there is a ruthless struggle going on.
Gender equality and the equality of small and large States can easily be achieved with the d'Hondt method.
I am happy to be a member of the PPE-DE Group, but I am not happy with the allocation of seats.
If a woman finds the courage to put herself forward for a leading position, she has to withdraw her candidature if another female candidate puts herself forward for the same position, so that at least one woman can get herself elected amongst the crowds of men.
We should not put forward female candidates just because they are women but because we have among us many capable women who have already and on many occasions proved their merit in practice.
I do not wish to lay all the blame on men.
We women, too, must become more ambitious and not merely be the performers of the tasks entrusted to us.
Before we impose legal obligations and recommendations on our citizens, let us examine how we are fulfilling them ourselves.
(SV) Madam President, I wish to thank the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, together with Mrs ZÃ¡borskÃ¡, for an excellent initiative and an excellent report.
Following this debate, I have to observe, however, that the men who participated put forward some antediluvian views.
It really is very sad indeed.
A lot has already been said in this debate, and I want to spend the time I have on a number of issues of principle.
Parliament will never obtain integrated committees, half of whose committee draftsmen or chairmen are women, until half the Members of the European Parliament are women.
I speak from experience.
In Sweden, it was only when, in 1994, we had a situation in which half of our politicians and Members of the Swedish Parliament were women that we were able to implement major reforms.
Many women in the European Parliament's committees have problems combining parliamentary and family responsibilities.
As long as Parliament does not offer parents any opportunity of remaining at home, using parents' insurance, and of obtaining benefits and people to replace them at work, we shall have a gender equality problem.
One of the strengths of the report is that it both discusses and proposes measures affecting officials and ourselves as MEPs, but I should like to see more targets and more measures affecting employees in the next report.
I should also like to see a debate on how and when we women are to comprise half the number of MEPs.
I should like to thank everyone for their congratulations.
I regard it as highly symbolic that the first debate over which I have presided is on the report on equal opportunities.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon.
Law applicable to non-contractual obligations ("ROME II") (debate)
The next item is the debate on the recommendation for second reading, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, on the Council common position (9751/7/2006 - C6-0317/2006 - for adopting a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations ("ROME II") (Rapporteur: Diana Wallis).
rapporteur. - Madam President, Commissioner, ROME II has been a long journey for us all and, whilst we might have hoped that this was the end, it seems likely that we are just at another staging post.
Let me start by saying that we appreciate that the common position took on board some of our ideas from the first reading.
Commissioner, I also want to emphasise the importance that we attach to this regulation, providing, as it will, the ground plan, or roadmap, which will provide clarity and certainty for the basis of civil law claims across Europe.
We need this, and we, here in Parliament, want to get it done, but it has to be done in the right way.
This has to fit the aspirations and needs of those we represent.
This is not just some theoretical academic exercise; we are making political choices about balancing the rights and expectations of parties before civil courts.
I am sorry that we have not reached an agreement at this stage.
I still believe that it could have been possible, with more engagement and assistance.
Perhaps it is because both the other institutions are not used to Parliament having codecision in this particular area - I am sorry, but you will have to get used to it!
I also want to thank all my colleagues in the political groups in the Committee on Legal Affairs, who have stuck together with me on this long journey and supported a common view, which, subject to sufficient presence in this Chamber today, will be clearly shown in our vote.
Now let me detail the points that still separate us.
We have always made it clear that we prefer a general rule, with as few exceptions as possible.
If we must have exceptions, they must be clearly defined.
Thus, we have accepted the position on product liability.
However, problems still remain in respect of unfair competition and the environment.
With unfair competition, we also face a simultaneous proposal from Commissioner Kroes.
The two proposals must work together; currently they do not.
We have tried to present a more acceptable formulation, which, sadly, I think is unlikely to succeed here at today's vote, and I would therefore urge colleagues to support the deletion, to allow us to return to this at conciliation and do the work properly.
It is the same with the environment.
I know and deeply respect the fact that many would like a separate rule, but it should not be a rule just for the sake of a headline.
It should be a rule that is clear in terms of what facts it applies to.
Given that we already have several possible formulations, the safest course, again, I would urge, is the general rule.
This would also allow us to delete the separate rule today and return to the definition at conciliation.
Now I come to the two big issues for this Parliament.
The first is defamation.
Please understand that we know only too well how difficult an issue this is.
However, we managed to get a huge majority at first reading across this House, and you will likely see a similar pattern repeated here today.
That the Commission decided to exclude this issue before we could consider it again was disappointing, to say the least.
That it did so on the basis of a clear two-year review clause, which has now been abandoned, is unacceptable.
We know the issues surrounding this area of media and communication will only increase and continue to haunt us.
Maybe we cannot deal with it now, but we will soon be looking at Brussels I again, and it is imperative that jurisdiction and applicable law remain in step.
So, would we deprive ourselves of the opportunity to look at this again?
Exclusion may truly be the only answer, but this Parliament wants to try a little bit more to see if we cannot resolve this.
I turn to the issue that my colleagues have been most tenacious in their support for (and I am very grateful for that): damages in road-traffic accidents.
Commissioner, we have the support of insurers, the support of legal practitioners, the support of victims, the support of those we represent, but somehow we cannot transmit these concerns to the Commission or to the Council.
Even last week, I was confronted by a very senior justice ministry official who thought that what we were trying to do was the equivalent of applying German law to determine liability in respect of a road-traffic accident which had happened in the UK, where, of course, we drive on the 'wrong' side of the road.
Do you really think we are that stupid?
I wish people would have the courtesy to read and understand what we are suggesting: merely the accepted principle of restitutio in integrum - to put victims back in the position they were in before the incident.
There should be nothing so fearful in this.
Indeed, the illogical approach would be for a judge in the victim's country to be able to deal with the case by virtue of the Motor Insurance Directives and Brussels I, and then have to apply a foreign, outside law in respect of damages.
This, indeed, would be illogical - and that is the situation we are currently in.
Please look at what we are saying and appreciate that, given the even the greater mobility of our citizens on Europe's roads, this matter needs attention, sooner rather than later, and a four-year general review clause just will not do.
My last hope is that our debates will have brought the subject of private international law out of the dusty cupboards in justice ministries and expert committees into the glare of public, political, transparent debate.
Therefore, all we ask is that you bear with us a little longer so that, together, the institutions of Europe can get this right.
Mr President, I should first like to thank Mrs Wallis for her report.
As you know, we have been discussing this proposal for three and a half years, and I feel that, following the improvements made by Parliament and the Council at the two reading stages, this project has now reached maturity, if I may put it that way.
Firstly, it would appear that those working in the economic and legal fields are very much looking forward to this regulation that is essential for legal certainty, and secondly, it would appear that this text is of vital importance for the construction of the European area of justice and for the smooth running of the European internal market.
This is why your vote, ladies and gentlemen, represents a crucial step for the future of this issue.
The best solution would, to my mind, be to proceed without the conciliation procedure, although were this procedure to prove inevitable, the Commission would deem it essential for all the conditions to be in place after your vote for it to adopt a satisfactory text.
I remain confident that a favourable solution can be found with Parliament's support.
Like you, Mrs Wallis, I regret the absence of special rules on defamation in the Council common position.
We reluctantly accepted the removal of that rule.
Why?
Because it has not been possible to reach a compromise on a text.
I should like to point out that over ten different options were on Council's table in April 2006, not one of which has any chance of success, either now or, probably, in the future.
You will also know that the revision clause has no chance of success.
I firmly believe that to accept a provision that cannot obtain even the slightest consensus between the institutions, as several members of the Committee on Legal Affairs have stated, would be to reopen a can of worms.
Another important point is that the number of international lawsuits in this area is very limited.
Perhaps you know that even associations representing the press ultimately accepted this exclusion in a message sent to me a few days ago.
You touched on other key issues, for example the removal of other special rules on competition and the environment.
To be frank, I find it difficult to accept the removal of the special rules in these areas.
Special rules are not always appropriate for every situation, but when it comes to competition, the special rule is, in my view, vitally important, because it clarifies the general rule for locating the market concerned.
I therefore welcome the fact that the rapporteur from a major political group will now advocate retaining special rules of this kind and will support this drafting proposal.
As regards the environment, the special rule is aimed at preventing environmental dumping, and, in the current political climate, the Commission is the guarantor of a very high level of environmental protection.
I believe that Rome II can contribute to this.
As for the Council, you will be aware that most Member States that have codified private international law have special rules for these two issues, and the Council advocates not only retaining these two special rules but, like the Commission, its has in fact added further recitals.
We are of the same opinion: special rules must reinforce legal certainty.
As regards traffic accidents, I share Parliament's concern to improve the situation of traffic accident victims.
This, at least, is one of the objectives contained in its proposal.
The Committee on Legal Affairs today proposed a new rule whereby the judge must ensure that compensation is provided for all prejudice sustained.
This is a very interesting idea, but I believe that that comes under harmonising the Member States' material civil law and is no longer a matter of private international law.
Rome II is not, in my view, the right framework for such harmonisation, but I can confirm that I want to find a solution to the problem posed by the Committee on Legal Affairs and by Parliament, albeit in a different context of substantial harmonisation.
As regards the issue of whether the general rule can lead to satisfactory solutions in this area or whether a new special rule is required, I remain open to the idea of studying this problem in detail, as provided for in Amendment 26 of the Implementation Report.
This quickly leads us on to the issue of implementing foreign law.
This is covered by Amendments 12 and 21, and is a vital component of the Hague Programme.
Let me reiterate that Rome II is not the right framework for such rules, which should apply to the entire commercial and civil field.
More generally, I am happy to commit to carrying out a detailed study of measures aimed at facilitating the implementation of foreign law.
The same indeed applies to the directive on the country of origin principle.
The Services Directive already preserves the application of the Rome II and Rome I instruments. Accordingly, I do not feel that the rule proposed in Amendment 24 is necessary, not because this principle does not need to be clarified, but because there is already a guarantee.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I, too, wish to thank Mrs Wallis for having made some important points.
We have, this past week, heard much about the 'citizens' Europe'.
When one looks at the title of this document, one is inclined to assume that many members of the public would, at the sight of it, 'switch off' on the grounds that they regard the law on non-contractual obligations as difficult, but it is the European issue par excellence, something to which most European motorists have given thought at least once, and along these lines: 'I am from country A, am travelling through country B and meet with an accident involving a driver from country C, who may well have a person from country D travelling with him'.
Situations such as that are a regular occurrence, and we are, by means of this dossier, doing more work on a citizens' Europe.
The need to regulate such matters is made even more pressing as people become more and more mobile and borders less and less important.
There are still improvements to be made on this front.
It follows that the 'citizens' Europe' is at stake.
We have, today, already made reference to other aspects of the law that certainly come up less frequently than road accidents, namely liability for criminal acts, unfair competition and the complicated things to consider with reference to the environment.
My group will seek to keep this House's options as regards this third reading and conciliation procedure as open as possible.
We believe that there is still a lot of scope for making the regulations more suitable to their task.
I want to underline what Mrs Wallis has already said.
What this House is being asked to help decide on here is a new reality, one aspect of which will be that we will, once the outcome of the third reading is known, have to pay very close attention to those things that might well not have been legally approved, but did, at second reading in this House, gain the approval of a majority, and consider whether these things - which matter to this House - might perhaps be taken on board after all.
We have every right to await with tense anticipation what will emerge from the third reading.
We will try to get the options for a citizens' Europe kept as open as possible.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Mr President, we are dealing with a rather complex text that has been subject to a series of amendments in the European Parliament's Committee on Legal Affairs and with regard to which the committee is drawing up our position on the points of view expressed by the Council.
I believe that the rapporteur has done a good job, but the positions in the Committee on Legal Affairs were adopted by one group, with a majority in that committee but not in plenary, and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament is therefore expressing its disagreement with several of the amendments approved by the Committee on Legal Affairs.
I am referring in particular to the removal of the reference to 'special rules', for example those relating to television without borders, e-commerce and other things.
I am also referring to the issue of environmental damage. Environmental damage is now such an important issue that we cannot possibly have legislation that does not take account of that special aspect.
There is another aspect: the issue of unfair competition. Unfair competition also warrants some kind of detailed regulation.
A statement of a general nature is not sufficient, since it affects many aspects of the internal market.
In summary, we agree with the majority of the amendments presented by the rapporteur, but we disagree with several of the amendments approved within the Committee on Legal Affairs, which reflect a majority that I would describe as circumstantial, and which is probably not going to be reflected in this Chamber.
In any event, I have the feeling that we are going to have to examine this issue in detail in conciliation, depending on the result of the votes held here.
Given that different political groups have presented different amendments to several of the amendments approved by the Committee on Legal Affairs, until we have the results of the vote tomorrow, it is going to be rather difficult to know what Parliament's final text will be.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, 'Rome II' is an abstract title cloaking issues that have a very direct, and very considerable, impact on the public, and it was for that reason that the arguments in committee on the various issues were so hard-hitting.
I propose to highlight three of them.
The first is the issue of the impact on the environment of damage from across borders.
Where the protection of the environment is concerned, the fatal tendency generally manifests itself that people try to ignore the problems of their neighbours, even when they themselves, by means of irresponsible action, are the cause of them.
We cannot but note with regret that it is turning out over and over again that people do not care and that installations emitting pollutants are being built very close to borders.
We have tried to come up with rules enabling victims of such environmental problems to enjoy the maximum protection possible and preventing the sort of environmental dumping to which the Commissioner referred.
It is regrettable that both the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe have decided not to agree to this, thereby opening the way to a retrograde step that I think would be fatal.
I look to the Council and the Commission to help us find a better way.
We have managed, where protection against defamation in the press is concerned, to come up with a compromise that I see as protecting and supporting press freedom, one of the European Union's fundamental values, which we must treat with respect and which must be central to what we do, and which is best protected if the legal consequences can be discussed in the country in which the newspaper or medium is based.
I regard road accidents as particularly important, in that anyone can, potentially, be affected by them; on this point we have arrived at a compromise, and I hope that it will be accepted in the course of negotiations with other bodies.
The public can expect us to take account of their day-to-day needs and to prioritise the interests of the victims; that is what the people of Europe expect of us.
(PL) Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking the rapporteur.
She has worked hard to ensure that this difficult and technical report reflects Parliament's amendments after first reading as accurately as possible.
This is most important, especially as regards the article on defamation, which is of particular interest to the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs.
I appreciate the political difficulties that make it exceptionally difficult to reach agreement in the Council on the issue of the article concerning defamation.
We would do well to remember, however, that Parliament's stance on this matter at first reading was very clear.
In my view, the solution proposed at first reading really was the best attempt at a compromise reconciling the interests of injured parties and publishers.
The Commission, in its amended opinion, and the Council, in its common position, rejected the idea of including in this regulation provisions concerning legislation to be applied in cases of defamation.
As stated in its opinion at first reading, however, the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs believes that this issue should not be excluded.
The stance adopted by Parliament at first reading is a sensible one and it is in line with the jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice.
Turning briefly to the remaining issues, it should be borne in mind that conflict-of-law rules tend to be governed by a logic of their own, and linking it with legislation concerning the common market may create problems through lack of consistency.
Nonetheless, the exclusions concerning unfair competition and environmental protection which result in these areas being covered by special provisions actually introduce unnecessary complications into European private law and run counter to the general effort to deregulate and simplify our legislation.
In conclusion, I should like to state that our Community now has an opportunity to lay the foundations of a common system of civil law.
Work on the Rome I and Rome III Regulations is under way.
I trust we have almost completed the work on Rome II as well. Work on common reference frameworks is progressing too.
I hope all these projects will make a positive contribution to the smooth running of the internal market within our great European venture.
(PL) Mr President, I should like to begin by warmly congratulating Mrs Wallis, the rapporteur, and thanking her for her work on such a key issue for the future of European integration.
This represents an important step forward towards the development of a common area of freedom, security and justice for Europe.
As we consider the draft regulation before us today, we should pay particular attention to the need for consistency between provisions in force and subsequent regulations.
It is important to ensure that the latter do not impose additional burdens and do not therefore hinder the efficient operation of the internal market.
On the contrary, they should stimulate its development.
Mr Medina Ortega has already referred to several specific issues, including those relating to environmental protection and competition.
I should like to state the importance of ensuring that issues pertaining to applicable law are considered appropriately, both by the parties and by the court, thus guaranteeing legal certainty.
Standardisation of provisions is called for in certain cases. These include issues relating to defamation, violation of the right to privacy and personal rights, and establishing the amount of damages in cases of bodily injury.
We should support Parliament's position at first reading with a view to ensuring that the regulation covers situations in which a manifestly closer connection may be considered to exist with the country which is the principal place of publication or dissemination of information, for instance information constituting defamation of character.
This can be achieved by a single provision applicable to all publications including those on the Internet.
The position concerning the application of national victim law to determine damages in the case of accidents causing bodily injury should also be supported.
Such an approach will make the free movement of people within the internal market more attractive.
It will also avoid placing an unfair burden on the social security and assistance schemes of the country of habitual residence of an accident victim.
Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking Mrs Wallis for her pertinent work on this dossier and for her excellent cooperation as the ALDE Group's coordinator in the Committee on Legal Affairs.
Together with the Rome II Regulation, the EU is establishing a coherent legal framework with regard to relationships between international private laws and other Community instruments.
This regulation should promote rather than hamper the proper functioning of the internal market, in particular the free movement of goods and services.
I was very unhappy to hear that the negotiations with the Council have been unsuccessful so far, but I am absolutely certain that Mrs Wallis will continue to raise the points of both our committee and Parliament.
I should like to raise two issues in particular.
Firstly, the violation of privacy and rights related to the personality, including defamation, should be excluded completely from the scope of Rome II.
In the absence of rules protecting editorial independence, exclusion would be the only viable solution that would not undermine press freedom.
It is regrettable that the Council did not give its support for this amendment at first reading.
The second issue is an important question of principle - as was the previous issue - notably regarding Article 9 of the proposal regarding industrial action and applicable law that raises specific difficulties for the European maritime and shipping industry.
The Swedish Government proposed this article in the spring of 2006, with reference to the European Court of Justice judgment in Case C-18/02.
This case concerns questions regarding jurisdiction and choice of law when a ship flying the flag of one Member State is being boycotted in another Member State.
Ships moving around are typically serving harbours of different countries.
If industrial action against ships were to be governed by the laws of the different harbours served during a voyage, the rules that would apply would vary all the time, i.e. different rules would form the basis of legality of industrial action taken against a ship.
This would both be impractical and create great uncertainty.
It is generally the case that all internal relations on a ship are governed by the law of the flag state.
Therefore, let us not give these powers to the labour unions, which would certainly use these provisions to blackmail our shippers and hamper the competitiveness of the European seafaring industry.
(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, infringements of Community competition rules have, or may have, effects in several Member States.
The possible application by legal authorities of the criterion of using as many legislations as countries affected may complicate actions for damages, hinder legal action and weaken competition.
As rapporteur for the report on private actions for damages deriving therefrom, I believe that they deserve their own treatment, and I would point out that the Commission has reserved the right to present proposals once the consultation under way has been completed.
The amendment that I presented, together with Mrs Berger, with which the rapporteur agrees - and I thank him for that - draws attention to this situation and proposes that the actor making the claim in the place of residence of the defendant should have the option of choosing the lex fori for their claim.
The conciliation will enable us to go further into the issue and decide how to deal with it appropriately.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place shortly at 12 noon.
Written statement (Rule 142)
In view of the progressive cross-border movement of people, products and information it has become essential to achieve a common identification of the law applicable in non-contractual obligations.
However, there appears to be a distinction with what is being proposed by the Commission and the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs.
The essence of this legislation is whether it can co-exist in harmony with existing national laws or it can supplant same.
The Committee believes that national laws and what is being proposed will not hinder but enhance national laws.
A clear distinction has to be made and once there is general agreement of more uniformity then this legislation should be all-encompassing and it is important that the possibility of ambiguity of the applicable law is resolved.
It is apparent that there is a lacuna in the Rome Convention of 1980 and that subsequently entered into in Brussels, and whereas the applicable law arising from non-contractual obligations has been adequately tackled, the relevant disputes still need to be addressed in full.
The second important distinction relates to the content.
There seems to be a different approach as to what non-contractual obligations should be included in the current legislation.
Such issues as environmental ones are to be left to national legislation, whereas the original proposal had a wider scope.

(DE) Mr President, over the last couple of hours there have been further discussions on two items, those being Amendments 22 and 47, as a result of which my group will be voting a different way.
I would like to ask the rapporteur whether he is able to give us any further information on those two amendments.
rapporteur. - (NL) Mr President, the original wording of Amendment 22 created problems for some railway companies in a number of EU Member States, because they work with very short notice periods for contracts.
In order to counteract these problems without necessitating fundamental changes, we have split the amendment into three sections, keeping most of the text but taking out the word 'existing' after the second split vote, and removing the last sentence after the third split vote, as a result of which we have retained the essence but managed to do away with the practical problems.
(The oral amendment was accepted)
- Before the vote on Amendment 47
rapporteur. - (NL) Mr Jarzembowski had also asked why we had requested a split vote on Amendment 47, the second part of which has to do with a second person travelling free of charge, and it is the huge number of objections to this system that have prompted me to ask for a split vote.
I would also like to know - hence the split vote - how many Members are backing this proposal and who are not, since this is something with which some Member States experience major problems.
Hence my request for a split vote.

Imposition of the death penalty on medical personnel in Libya (vote)
- Before the vote
Mr President, I would like to suggest a couple of minor adjustments for the sake of greater clarity.
In paragraph 2, line 4, I suggest replacing the words 'for itself and' by the words 'of capital punishment in', and in paragraph 8, line 3, inserting the word 'affected' in front of the word 'children'.
(The oral amendments were accepted)
- Before the vote on paragraphs 6 and 12
(FR) Ladies and gentlemen, certain terms concerning the Libyan authorities need to be corrected.
We have been somewhat European in our choice of words.
We should therefore replace 'President Gaddafi' by 'Colonel Gaddafi'.
I should also like to point out that in paragraph 12 'Popular Assembly' should be replaced by 'General People's Congress' because that is the right name, and 'government' by 'General People's Committee'.
One needs to be precise when referring to the Libyan authorities.
(The oral amendments were accepted)
- following the vote
I will take this resolution as the occasion for once again calling on all those in positions of responsibility in Libya to spare these people's lives and set them at liberty.

We would like to take this opportunity to thank Mrs Hedkvist Petersen for the work she has done in this House over recent years.
(Applause)
Mrs Hedkvist Petersen, such lively applause entitles the President to thank you, with quite especial warmth, for the work you have done and to wish you all the best in every way.
I extend to you the warmest congratulations on this splendid report and wish you, personally, all the best.

I am happy to grant Mrs ZÃ¡borskÃ¡ this request.

Statement by the President
Ladies and gentlemen, the ability to speak openly is not something to be taken for granted.
I am sure that you have all heard about the terrible murder, on 19 January, of the Armenian-Turkish journalist Hrant Dink, who had, over recent years, frequently drawn attention to himself with his calls for engagement with the history of the Armenians under Ottoman rule, attracting the hostility of many nationalists and being repeatedly prosecuted by the Turkish justice system on account of what he wrote and said.
I wish, on behalf of this House, to express our outrage at this crime.
We acknowledge, and are glad, that the Turkish Government as a whole has expressed similar sentiments and that its determination has already resulted in the arrest of one who has admitted perpetrating the deed.
The alleged murderer - who is only 17 years of age - is evidently motivated by, among other things, nationalist sentiments and complete contempt for the opinions of others.
According to media reports, Hrant Dink's funeral was attended by thousands of people, and these included Mr Joost Lagendijk, representing me in his capacity as chairman of the delegation to the EU-Turkey Joint Parliamentary Committee, and Mrs HÃ©lÃšne Flautre, the chairman of our human rights sub-committee.
The overwhelming sympathy of the Turkish people and media give cause for hope that this sad event will prompt the Turkish Government to delay no longer in introducing further reforms in the area of criminal law aimed at protecting the free expression of opinion.
I will now ask you to do as we did when the great Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya was murdered and rise from your seats to honour Hrant Dink in silent remembrance.

Moratorium on the death penalty (debate)
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the moratorium on the death penalty.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what I have to talk to you about today is one of the most fundamental components of the European Union's policy on human rights, and the many motions for a resolution tabled by the various groups in your House indicate just how live an issue this is.
Taking as its basis the guidelines for the EU's policy in respect of third states and the death penalty as adopted in 1998 by its Council of Ministers, the European Union is campaigning worldwide for the abolition of the death penalty under all circumstances, and the declaration of moratoria has for some years been a consistent feature of that campaign - albeit not as its main objective, but as an intermediate stage on the way to the practice's abolition once and for all.
The European Union will continue its policy of protection for human rights under German Presidency and will therefore be arguing forcefully for moratoria on the death penalty and for its permanent abolition.
That means that we will, on the one hand, continue to pursue the debate on the issue of principle - not only on bilateral contact but also in multilateral fora, the United Nations in particular - whilst also, on the other hand, continuing to be pro-active in approaching those countries that are at a turning point - that is to say, those in which either positive or negative trends are perceptible as regards the death penalty - and to bring influence to bear on them by means, that is, of very definite demarches in many urgent individual cases.
I am aware that your House has been a constant advocate for this policy and am glad to be able to say that we have already, together, achieved a great deal.
The fact that, in something like two-thirds of the world's countries, the death penalty has been legally abolished or is in practice a dead letter is attributable to the sustained efforts of all active campaigners against the practice, and I am happy to be able to stress that active involvement in the Council Europe has played its part.
Thirty-three states have now ratified the 13th additional protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights, the effect of which is to outlaw capital punishment even in time of war.
I would also like to mention, however, that there are still too many states - numbering 66 - that continue to carry out executions, along with some regrettably retrograde trends when it comes to the observance of moratoria.
This is why it is so important that we should be unstinting in our efforts and should aim our arguments for the abolition of the death penalty at international fora and elsewhere.
The European Union submitted resolutions to this end to the Human Rights Commission from 1999 until the Commission's dissolution in 2005, and, over that period, it proved possible to secure stable majorities in favour of them.
Since that body was dissolved, we have had to seek new ways of moving the debate on the abolition of capital punishment forward, although it has to be said that, since there are no easy answers to this, our actions have to be very well thought-out if - and this is a priority - we are to avoid being obliged to retreat from positions already secured.

On this line there has, up to now, been firm agreement in the European Union, but we have, up to now, refrained from putting a resolution to this effect to the UN General Assembly in view of the continued high risk of it not being supported.
Instead, on 19 December, at the European Union's initiative, and for the first time ever, a unilateral declaration against the death penalty was put to the General Assembly, and it is important to note that it was supported by 85 states from all parts of the globe.
Encouraging though this result is, it does also confirm that the chances of a resolution from the EU meeting with success in the General Assembly cannot as yet be seen as 100% certain.
What, then, is to happen next?
It is clear to all partners in the European Union that we want to continue to actively promote the cause of the campaign against capital punishment, at the United Nations and elsewhere, but I would, at the same time, like to make it clear that this is still a very difficult area, and so any campaign against the death penalty will only meet with success if the European Union's actions are step by step and well thought-out.
Our watchword should continue to be that the possibility of a new EU initiative's failure should be excluded as far as possible, for a defeat for the European Union would be a victory for the advocates of the death penalty and hence a reversal in the fight against this inhumane mode of punishment, something that we do not want and must not allow to happen.
I believe that we will also find supporters.
It is for that reason that some of the principal players among the non-governmental organisations, Amnesty International being one of them, advise against precipitate action and are reminding us that insisting again on this subject being debated in the General Assembly of the United Nations could turn out to be counter-productive for the European Union.
Agreement was therefore reached at the General Affairs Council of 22 January that we would first devise a well thought-out approach that would progressively enable us to present our concerns more effectively to the United Nations.
The ambassadors in New York and Geneva were therefore mandated to do everything possible, and without delay, to bring forward a debate at United Nations level.
It will also be necessary to draw on the experience and current estimates of the relevant NGOs as to what further steps to take in combating the death penalty at UN level.
This will then enable the Presidency of the Council to make proposals in February to the EU partners as to further action.
This I regard as a first and important step, and I hope that we will find others willing to support us in this course of action.
(Applause)
Member of the Commission. Mr President, I also welcome this opportunity to exchange views on the issue of the death penalty and on the means to promote the universal abolition of this odious practice.
As you know, the abolition of the death penalty worldwide represents a key objective of the external human rights policy of the European Union, and I am personally committed to seeing the EU continue to play a lead role, as we have just heard, in this global effort.
Since all of us here agree on the ultimate goal of our action in this field, namely universal abolition, I wish to provide some thoughts on this process of abolition and on the means to reach our common goal.
Firstly, let us not forget that the experience of abolition on the European continent has been a slow, often tortuous and protracted process, which has been, for most of our Member States, driven by a combination of strong political leadership and a mature level of development of human rights protection, the rule of law and democratic institutions.
With some notable exceptions, including the United States of America and Japan, the global map of abolitionist countries also closely follows that of democratic pluralism.
Visionary leadership and political courage are key to abolishing the death penalty.
These efforts often need to be bolstered by a dynamic and open nationwide debate to ensure that the ultimate political decision to abolish the death penalty in a country is also a permanent one.
In the Philippines, and to some extent Kyrgyzstan, the recent abolition of the death penalty was precisely the result both of remarkable courage on the part of the political leadership and a profound nationwide debate, which witnessed wide participation from civil society actors - which has been mentioned - and institutions.
In the United States of America, there are also some encouraging trends in some states, like New Jersey and Maryland.
On the other hand, it is not excluded that a country falls back into the practice of death penalty as we, unfortunately, have witnessed in Bahrain and need to fear in Peru.
And in many other countries our appeals to abolish the death penalty have fallen on deaf ears until now.
The execution of Saddam Hussein and his henchmen has now sparked a renewed debate on the death penalty.
The horrific videos of his undignified end upset even some supporters of the death penalty.
But let us not forget that every year thousands are executed, most of whom are certainly somewhat better people than Saddam and many are even innocent.
Their deaths should outrage us even more!
While evidently the abolition of the death penalty in any country is, to quote Robert Badinter, 'a victory of humanity over itself', one must remain realistic as to the influence of external actors, such as the European Union, in this process, because this process remains first and foremost a domestic one.
This is not to say that the European Union will sit on the fence.
On the contrary, the EU has been and will remain at the very forefront of international efforts, notably at the United Nations, as was mentioned, to fight the death penalty.
Last December, the EU presented a Declaration on the Death Penalty at the UN General Assembly, which received the support of a record 85 states.
In line with our guidelines on the death penalty, the European Union has carried out numerous demarches on individual death penalty cases, including in countries such as the United States of America, Iran and Indonesia, and will continue to do so in the future.
The EU is also the leading source of funding for abolitionist projects run by civil society, and over the past ten years, we have spent over EUR 15 million supporting such projects around the world.
The European Parliament and civil society actors have traditionally played a crucial role in both supporting the abolitionist efforts of the European Union and in stimulating the debate on the means to enhance our policy.
It is of prime importance to listen carefully to those voices when discussing possible initiatives in various international forums, as the Council is currently doing.
This has certainly been illustrated most recently by the Italian proposal for a universal moratorium on the death penalty at the UN General Assembly.
Without prejudging the final outcome of this process of reflection, I wish to share three observations made by abolitionist actors on the moratorium which have struck me as relevant for feeding today's discussion.
While representing a key element in the EU's strategy towards universal abolition, leading NGOs have stressed that a moratorium is not a panacea.
They claim it is by essence fragile, reversible and must be followed by abolition in law.
They refer to the example of Kyrgyzstan, where the regularly extended moratorium on executions has not prevented the number of prisoners on death row from increasing.
I think we need moratoria that hold firm.
Secondly, some NGOs underline the fact that the moratorium is one abolitionist tool among others.
I agree that, in this context, the promotion of the Second Optional Protocol providing for abolition, the support for legal counselling for death row convicts and other efforts have to be included in our toolbox.
Hence, we should avoid the current discussion on the moratorium to eclipse the fact that abolition is a multi-faceted process.
Lastly, when bringing the issue back to the UN General Assembly, we need to be cautious as to the possible outcome.
It is paramount to secure a positive result.
We need to be alive, however, to the risk of an ambiguous or even a counterproductive outcome - and the Council Presidency has alluded to it - given international divisions on this subject.
