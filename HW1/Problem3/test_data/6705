Thirdly, it is good that the countries in the area as a whole will soon all be members of the European Union, from Romania to Bulgaria, Austria, Greece and so on; in other words, there will be a positive impact on developments in these countries from all sides.
And then we shall need to do our utmost, politically, to help these nations, which lived in peaceful coexistence for hundreds of years, to regain their historic foothold, to rediscover their modus vivendi, to rediscover the political union and common way of life which, unfortunately, have been upset over recent years by untimely movements and careless initiatives.
Mr President, I find myself particularly irritated by the sections about Kosovo in Mr Lagendijk's substantial report.
For instance, Paragraph 4 rightly calls for attention from the Council and the Commission for the political future of ancient Kosovo Polje.
In this connection, the negative contribution from Belgrade is disappointing.
According to Michael Steiner, UN representative for Kosovo, this city is like a hot potato which the Serbian leaders pass quickly on.
I would be pleased to learn from the Council and the Commission of their experiences and of the efforts they have made.
Meanwhile, the local elections of 26 October in Kosovo offered little encouragement as regards the Serbian contribution.
A heavy price was paid for Belgrade's conflicting appeals for very limited participation on the one hand or, on the other, for everyone to turn up and vote.
In fact, the boycott of the elections by the Serbian population of North Mitrovica meant a complete rejection of the very generous seven point plan proposed by UNMIK chief Steiner - a proposal that, however, actually wants to go a long way towards meeting the interests of the Serbian minority in a predominantly Albanian Kosovo.
In the light of this, I find myself struggling with the highly idealistic composition of the rapporteur's amendment to Paragraph 40.
Very sensibly, the original text of this paragraph urges a rapid end to the actual situation whereby the town of Mitrovica does not fall under the authority of UNMIK and the interim government of Kosovo.
In concrete terms, that means the disappearance of parallel Serbian security and administrative structures, financed with Serbian money.
And that is totally along the lines, and in the spirit, of Steiner's seven-point plan.
In short, with a brief, factual addition - which referred to the seven-point plan - the rapporteur would have lent the paragraph more power of expression, for clarity and decisiveness on the part of the international community is for the benefit of all Kosovan inhabitants for the sake of their collective future.
How do the Council and the Commission feel that they can, within the framework of the Stabilisation and Association Process for South East Europe, lend support to Steiner's noble efforts to make Mitrovica into 'a normal European town'?
Mr President, Joost Lagendijk's report covers a great many issues, and we cannot comment on all of them here.
However, I would like to start by saying that I totally support it, and that applies equally to my group.
This part of Europe is a multi-speed region.
Some countries, such as Macedonia and Croatia, already have agreements; theirs are stabilisation and association agreements, although that does not of course necessarily mean that all the conditions are being complied with in detail.
Joost has already listed the deficits.
It is, however, with some satisfaction that we can consider Albania, a country which has managed to make up for the fraudulent elections held in 2001 by electing a consensus president, something very few people expected, including the Commission.
We would now like to see an early start made on the negotiations around this process, although we know that it will not be concluded rapidly, as there is still a lot of homework to be done.
Turning to Bosnia and Herzegovina, it has to be said that this country is struggling to square the circle. I am referring to the Dayton Agreement.
I simply wish to say, for example, that 67% of Bosnia and Herzegovina's entire budget is spent on ministers' salaries. There are over 120 ministers who only exist because they are virtually stipulated in the Dayton Agreement.
Something has to be done about this and the last elections were a warning signal.
Serbia and Montenegro's President and Prime Minister are squabbling with each other instead of jointly fighting for their country.
Serbia and Montenegro should now be finding a joint path towards European membership, and the Solana proposal, no matter how limited it may be, is at present the best and the only way forward.
With regard to Kosovo, which I visited again just last week, I can only say that we should be able to make sure that its peoples can coexist, thus making Serbian enclaves unnecessary.
They have many problems in common.
There are ethnic tensions in some countries, there are unsatisfactory refugee return arrangements, there is the battle against trafficking in human beings, which is also unsatisfactory, and there is corruption.
Only one thing is clear, and that is that we must not back off from our commitment.
That is the litmus test for our credibility.
As Joost has already said, we need to have a precise idea of what we wish to achieve in this region in the near future.
Mr President, as always Mr Lagendijk's report is excellent, comprehensive and prudent.
I genuinely believe that the Stability Pact and the Stabilisation and Association Process have chalked up a lot of successes overall.
Some of these have already been mentioned, such as the elections in Macedonia and developments in Albania, although I have to say that I have heard that the consensus reached between the major political groups in Albania is now at breaking point.
I would, however, like to comment on some of Mr Lagendijk's fundamental observations, because they seem very important to me.
You mentioned the debates on enlargement and the debates on the Balkans.
I was present at both debates today, and I was also at the enlargement debate, at which President Prodi made a statement that I consider to be very important. He pointed out that the enlargement process with the ten new countries and also with the subsequent applicant countries has not yet been completed, and that this gives an important signal to the Balkans in particular.
I believe, and I also stated this in my own speech, that our experience with preparations for enlargement must act as a signal - and this applies to the Balkan countries too - that countries that advocate democracy, the rule of law, protection of minorities and human rights have a chance of joining the European Union at a later date.
I believe that we need to consider now how we are to manage the organisational requirements.
As I see it, the Stability Pact - and this is Mr Bussek's intention in his role as Special Coordinator - needs to become more focused, with a reduced role and tasks being increasingly transferred to the Commission. This should not, however, take place outside the enlargement process, but should come in at the latest with effect from 2004/2005, when the new Commission will meet in accordance with the enlargement process.
I accordingly believe that we in this House need to give the Balkan countries a signal, or rather hope, that they too have a place in Europe, bearing in mind the Zagreb II Summit also.
It will then be up to them to decide if they wish to do all this so as to effectively secure a place in Europe.
Mr President, South Eastern Europe, or if you like the bankrupt estate of the former Yugoslavia, which was torn apart by bloody ethnic conflicts, putting Albania to one side, is essentially the parade ground for the European Union's Common Foreign and Security Policy.
It is also its most severe test.
Our efforts to provide these countries with economic and political support are much needed.
We certainly should not put them on the back burner because of the enlargement of the European Union.
In fact it is that very prospect of a future in Europe that we need to hold out to them.
That is the purpose of the Stabilisation and Association Process for South East Europe.
I consider the rapporteur's proposal that priorities should be set an extremely sensible one.
Kosovo's final status needs to be clarified as a matter of urgency, as does the structure of Serbia and Montenegro in terms of constitutional law.
Until we have done that, it will simply not be possible to enter into negotiations on an association agreement.
The ill-defined status of Kosovo is a latent source of uncertainty.
It means that business has no trust whatsoever in the situation and that there is inadequate investment.
This leads in turn to an increase in corruption and to a growing trend towards emigration, in other words migratory pressure that we in Austria are particularly, but not exclusively, sensitive to.
One of the most important conditions, and this applies to the entire region, is to impose the rule of law, and to fight corruption and organised crime.
One very positive step here has been the creation of the Regional Centre for Combating Transborder Crime in Bucharest, and this centre will be represented at the relevant conference in London on 25 November.
We visited this centre in Bucharest together with Dr Swoboda, and I should perhaps mention that those who work there include Austrian customs and police officials.
It would be good if this centre had more input from Europe and not just from America.
Another point I consider important is that under its Special Coordinator, Erhard Bussek, the Stability Pact has taken a great many political initiatives.
It should be possible for this work to continue, and we need to achieve rapid agreement both in the Council and in the Commission on appropriate budgets for and extension of the Stability Pact.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, economic and social cohesion is at the very heart of the European Union.
It offers the prospect of sustainable, harmonious and at the same time policentric development for the EU as a whole.
The current debate is about the European Union of the future, be it a Union of 25 or even 27 Member States.
This Union's commitment to integration will only continue to be credible if there is a corresponding willingness to jointly accept responsibility for the European social model in a spirit of solidarity.
Our starting point has to be the assumption that the public's view of Europe does not depend on their regional and social position and is being tackled as a joint political exercise by all the Member States.
We further need to assume that all our citizens are being given comparable opportunities and that we are not living our lives at the cost of the next generation.
Nevertheless, it would be an illusion to believe that we have substantially more money available for this task than is currently the case.
That is why it is our job to develop a concept which will function in line with the basic principles I have mentioned and which can at the same time manage with the same financial resources, in relative terms.
While my report was going through its various stages in this House, I found I received different answers to these questions.
One group says we should fight to make sure that everything is acceptable to everyone, and that everything will resolve itself later on.
Others say that everything is acceptable as long as their own constituency does not lose its privileges.
They demand solidarity for their constituency but they are not willing to participate in a wider solidarity.
There are others again who do not accept the European social model anyway, and who welcome this dispute.
And there are those who dare not tell the truth and accept the consequences.
The truth is that we need to start to plan now if we want to make the first payments to the regions on 1 January 2007.
No one can talk their way out of that one, because we know that two years are tight enough as it is.
Everyone knows what the central issue is: how do we define the poorest regions of the European Union?
The main principle of economic and social cohesion is that those areas that have the most catching up to do should receive the most support.
However, as I see it, the concept of solidarity becomes meaningless if we repeatedly invent new criteria in order to ensure that our own constituency receives the support that is really intended for the poorest regions.
In any case, that is short-term thinking.
Widening the criterion in force and recognised up to now, according to which any regions with a GDP below 75% of the Community average are considered the most needy regions, will have a number of consequences. Firstly, it will mean that everyone will receive less money, that the phasing-out process will not continue, and that special regional support for the unemployed or for rural areas will no longer be possible.
Another consequence will be that we will simply have to pump support into genuinely disadvantaged regions like those in Eastern Europe over a longer period.
Another possibility is that constituencies that require intervention at present will suddenly become net contributors.
The study by the German Institute for Economic Research indicates that this would happen in three years.
The worst consequence of this plan and of this short-term thinking would be that it would mean the end of solidarity.
In that case we would have nothing left at all, because we would have no plan and economic and social cohesion would be an empty clichÃ©.
I come from an Objective 1 region that would lose its status for statistical reasons if we strictly observed the 75% criterion, and yet I am convinced that generous phasing out would make it possible for that region to solve its development problems.
If we in Parliament establish a cornerstone for the Structural Funds of the EU of the future, with clearly defined Objective 1 regions, we will on the one hand oblige the Commission to follow where we lead and on the other hand we will be issuing a challenge to the Council.
I would like a roll-call vote on this tomorrow.
There are two things on which we can agree.
One principle we agreed upon was that of 'one programme - one fund'.
This is an effective concept for simplifying the management of the Structural Funds.
We have also agreed to support the Commission's idea of tripartite contracts with the regions and Member States for the implementation of structural policy measures, so as to facilitate the participation of local stakeholders.
I hope that this means we will be supporting an efficient and successful concept and not undermining solidarity within Europe.
Mr President, the Commission congratulates the European Parliament on such a positive contribution to cohesion policy which is essential for the building and integration of Europe.
I would like to thank Mrs Schroedter on behalf of the Commission for the report she has compiled. Her report represents a very important contribution to the debate on the future of cohesion policy.
This debate began in January 2001 with the adoption of the second report on cohesion drawn up by Mr Barnier. It is essential that, in view of the Commission's preparation of proposals on the future of this policy, we should work towards establishing a consensus between the different institutions involved, as the rapporteur has just explained.
The Commission will respond to the different issues the honourable Member mentioned within the framework of the second progress report on cohesion.
This report will be adopted by the Commission at the beginning of 2003. We will include a more specific and in-depth response to these same issues in the third report on cohesion we are scheduled to present at the end of next year.
I would like to remind you that the Commission has already promised to include proposed priorities which should form the basis for the policy from 2007 to 2013 in the third report on cohesion to be put before Parliament and the Council. We have also promised to propose a new system for the organisation and management of the policy in the same report.
We want to put a joint proposal on the table, one that responds adequately to the key issues already raised by the House concerning the European UnionÂŽs response to the future of the economic and social problems of both present and future Member States.
As regards consistency across different Community policies, the current review of governance has already yielded a number of possible courses of action that the Commission will be sure to take into account when preparing future policies.
The challenges of enlargement are certainly not limited only to discussions on decision-making procedures or the distribution of competencies.
Policies on these issues should also provide for the greater diversity and greater imbalance among the different areas which will constitute the future European Union. In addition, policies should set out the precise contribution to be made by Member States to the economic and social cohesion of the European Union as a whole, and its effects, albeit in purely statistical terms.
This will have to be taken into account.
Regions that are currently poor will not become richer just because some new arrivals are poorer.
The poor regions will simply be less poor than some of those due to become part of the European Union.
Mr President, the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy focuses on the need to examine cohesion policy in terms of its effect on intergovernmental relations and on how countries view the European Union.
Obviously, what is most important is that the economic and social imbalances between the new and the old Member States can be effectively diminished.
Enlargement, however, must not lead to a situation where regional policy in the most disadvantaged regions of the current Member States is wound down.
Other factors besides figures for GDP have also to be taken into account, such as regional climate, remoteness, sparse population and the unemployment rate.
At the same time differences in living standards on the Union's new external borders must also be reduced.
The Committee on Foreign Affairs would like to remind everyone that every European state that meets the conditions of membership has the right to join the Union and would like to stress how important it is to assist them in preparing for membership.
As the European Parliament's northernmost Member, I know how important these proposals are in practice.
EU enlargement will do nothing to improve the relative position of Lapland or other peripheral regions of Finland and Sweden.
Actually, it is more likely to weaken it, as the wealthiest regions will reap the benefits of enlargement.
The northern areas of our neighbour, Norway, are now experiencing vigorous economic development as a result of investment in energy and sound regional policy.
In circumstances such as these EU regional policy must not be watered down, but should be strengthened in accordance with the principles underlying the Northern Dimension.
Our other neighbour, Russia, has many problems that threaten our wellbeing and security.
The EU therefore has to become more effective beyond both the current and the future external border, as the Committee on Foreign Affairs suggests.
Mr President, Madam Vice-President, Article 159 of the Treaty states that the European Union will take account of the objective of economic and social cohesion when drawing up its policies.
The second report on cohesion has shown that aid currently provided by the common agricultural policy favours producers in the more developed agricultural areas rather than those in the less developed ones.
It would therefore be a mistake not to alter a system of aid which values production above other economic, social, environmental and land-related issues.
Ladies and gentlemen, the latest proposals presented by the Commission contained in the mid-term review and the reform of the common agricultural policy could exacerbate still further the differences between the more and less developed rural areas. All the necessary impact studies must therefore be carried out before these reforms are implemented.
At present, rural areas account for 80% of the European Union, and this percentage will increase following enlargement. The negative effects of the common agricultural policy, which has not fulfilled initial expectations, will therefore be even greater.
We cannot do away with the functional model which has to underpin our agricultural policy. Nonetheless, we need to define new aid for small farmers, and policies to redistribute resources more equitably.
Environmental conditions have to be mainstreamed.
We should link agricultural and environmental polices and coordinate them.
We must ensure our policies do provide for cohesion. Otherwise they could have a devastating effect in rural areas and cause a huge exodus from the countryside.
There should be specific support for young farmers to establish themselves, and support also for small farmers who guarantee rural sustainability.
Parliament's Committee on Agriculture has concluded that enlargement will increase regional disparities and that targeted measures and an increase in structural funds will be needed to counter this.
Enlargement and its negative effect on statistics will exclude a large number of regions which currently meet the criteria for Objective 1. For this reason we need to set a transitional period for these regions.
We also need to devise a new classification system that takes account of the specific disadvantages of each region.
I have in mind depopulation or the relief of the land.
Enlargement does not just pose a challenge for Objective 1 rural areas.
We must also remember that a kind of hidden enlargement is taking place as a result of Association Agreements with third countries to the south. Above all, there is one principle that we should re-define, namely Community preference in the general context of cohesion.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as shadow rapporteur for the PPE-DE Group on the report on economic and social cohesion, I would like to thank Mrs Schroedter for her work, although there are still a number of points which, by agreement with my group, I am seeking to modify by tabling a series of amendments which I hope the rapporteur will be able to accept.
In particular, I feel that it is premature to ask the Commission to produce a proposal on the future of the Objective 2 regions and the future of Community initiatives even before the third report on economic and social cohesion is published, not least in that the time frames necessary for an in-depth analysis to be carried out by December 2003 - Commissioner Barnier's deadline for presenting the report - have not been established and we have not been provided with the necessary information.
We would prefer to be able to take the time necessary to work on reforming cohesion policy, in other words to work according to the time frames specified by the Commission, avoiding, above all, hasty conclusions being drawn which will not benefit the regions and will benefit the new Member States still less.
Next, I would like to point out that, in an enlarged Union, some of the Objective 1 regions will automatically statistically exceed the threshold of 75% of the average Union GDP without this representing any genuine increase in development.
In this respect, in line with what was decided in the second report on economic and social cohesion, for which I was the rapporteur, I feel it is inadequate to take GDP as the only indicator.
Other criteria, including, in particular, the unemployment rate, should be taken into account.
We also believe that the Union's policies and the sectoral policies of the Member States must focus on the achievement of cohesion objectives and sustainable development plans for the regions.
Lastly, we will vote against paragraphs 16 and 22, for they are repetitions of paragraphs already included in the rapporteur's text.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it seems to me that this report, for which I would like to thank the rapporteur very sincerely, is a refinement of the Musotto report that we adopted at the beginning of the year.
To be more precise, this report is about the direction Parliament wishes to go in.
I am quite willing to admit that we have not totally achieved that, because there is still too much in this report, but I still think that it is a good one.
All in all, I do not think the picture is as black as the rapporteur has painted it.
In this report we have once again emphasised certain points that have already been identified, such as our rejection of any renationalisation of structural policy.
We have also once again made it clear that regions currently benefiting from support will have to accept cuts; we do not want to pull the wool over anyone's eyes about this.
However, we have also managed to clarify some points in this report.
I disagree totally with the previous speaker on this, because I think it is very important for the Commission to make proposals at this stage about how it will move forward with Objective 2.
People are waiting for a signal in Objective 2 regions too, and we cannot just concentrate on Objective 1 in our discussions.
The same applies to Community initiatives.
This is also an important area where we need to either clarify matters or at least identify a recognisable direction.
How will the Community Action for Border Regions be continued?
And how will action on cities move forward? And rural areas?
I would like to stress two more points of great concern to me.
One is that the programme must be scheduled to start so that funds are actually available on 1 January 2007, and, equally important, we need a more coherent approach, and in that regard we need to send a signal to the Commission that it should at long last achieve greater coherence between individual policy areas.
My final point is this: I believe, and my group has also taken a decision to this effect, that for Objective 1 we should neither establish a fixed criterion nor a fixed percentage.
We need to make a decision on the basis of concrete proposals, and the Commission is in the process of drawing something up.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Vice-President of the Commission, of course, I too would like to thank the rapporteur for her valuable contribution. I would also like to say that the committee of which I am chairman has discussed the matter in depth with its usual skill and has put a tremendous amount of effort into finding solutions for both present and future situations.
This is the first progress report on the second report on cohesion, which has come just a few weeks before the second progress report and a few months before the third report on cohesion, which, as has already been said, will be the decisive report.
What is the backdrop to the debate?
The first point concerns the current programming period.
There has been a great deal of discussion in recent days on the need for expenditure and simplification. These are recurring themes which must serve as some kind of warning for the future too, and by the future I mean the 2007-2013 programming period, the crucial time for the accession of a further 10, then to be 12 countries.
There are many problems and areas of concern, and I would like to mention one which is of particular interest to me.
A few days ago, in Brussels, the Commission organised an extremely interesting meeting on the mountain regions.
For those mountain regions which will not be covered by Objective 1, there is a possibility that a specific fund can be set up on the basis of the concept contained in the second report on cohesion of regions which suffer from permanent geographical or natural handicaps. These would include mountain regions, remote islands and sparsely populated regions.
In addition to providing more funds for these regions, this would also introduce rules which are fairer than competition rules.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, even if this is just an interim report to be produced every three years, it should be used not just to take stock, but also to give an overview of the next planning period.
It is quite right not to go into detail and not to give precise figures, but the key points need to be identified and central issues need to be resolved in good time.
One of these central issues is the 0.45% share of the Union's GDP set aside for cohesion policy, which may not be exceeded even during EU enlargement.
Another central issue is treating the regions as a reference unit for cohesion policy tasks and not nation-state criteria.
Anyone who would like to see anything else is missing the point.
A further central issue is the concentration of support on disadvantaged regions in an enlarged EU with clear, transparent and quantifiable criteria for the concept of 'poor regions'. These and these alone can be dependent on the 75% criterion.
Any other factors taken as a basis for measurement cannot be clearly quantified and open the way to arbitrary decision-making.
This even applies to a criterion such as unemployment, for which there is no EU-wide definition and which is therefore bound to lead to inaccurate estimates.
When it comes to supporting disadvantaged regions, we first need to consider those regions with less than 75% of EU GDP.
But those regions that will be lifted over the 75% threshold after enlargement, becoming 'statistically wealthy', also need to have a more generous phasing-out arrangement.
We wish to see regions receiving more support the closer they are to the 75% threshold.
In this respect I agree with the rapporteur, who has tabled an amendment on this point.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think that the final version of Mrs Schroedter's report, as adopted in committee, throws up some interesting views and proposals.
I am thinking in particular of the extended partnership which the report supports in the form of tripartite contracts with the regions and Member States.
I think this proposal is a daring move; it will make it easier to apply the principle of subsidiarity and cut out a lot of unwanted red tape.
We should also be encouraged by the fact that the most efficient programmes have been those based on maximum participation.
Any innovation, however, needs to be introduced carefully, under some sort of failsafe procedure, if we are to avoid rocking the boat and ensure that financial prudence under the Community budget is left well alone.
I therefore think it would be advisable if the Commission were to fine tune this proposal, so that we can evaluate how and to what extent it can be implemented in the initial phase and then go on to examine application guidelines for it.
We shall also have to monitor the implementation of this extended partnership closely, in tandem with the potential for decentralisation of each Member State, both old and new.
I should also like to point out that, despite the simplifications and changes decided under Agenda 2000, there is still a serious take-up problem and appropriations are not turning into payments.
So what do we conclude from all this?
Do we need to keep simplifying procedures or is there perhaps a deep-seated structural problem which the Commission and Member States need to address?
Has Community funding perhaps become so complicated that it no longer holds any attraction for investors?
To close, may I point out that this matter deserves our serious attention, especially in the run up to enlargement, which will obviously exacerbate the take-up problem in that our new partners will also have to deal with difficulties caused by their lack of experience in applying the acquis communautaire.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to thank Mrs Schroedter for drawing up an important report.
Measures to achieve economic balance have been inadequate.
Differences in levels of prosperity between regions have even increased to some extent.
Differences in levels of unemployment have also to be taken into serious consideration when planning regional and structural policy.
Commitment on the part of small and medium-sized enterprises to projects, and targeting structural actions at the most disadvantaged regions are important areas of emphasis.
Furthermore, regional development must be supported by other areas of policy, such as agricultural, taxation and transport policy.
I agree with many of the other speakers that GDP is not the only criterion to use when determining eligible areas.
Permanent handicaps due to difficult natural conditions must equally be taken into account.
For example, an exceptionally sparse population, migration, an ageing population, long distances, and a cold or hot climate cause permanent problems.
In the future we shall have to pay very special attention to the issue of strengthening rural vitality and diversity.
If Union enlargement is to take place, cohesion policy will need to be strengthened.
At the same time we have to remember that regional differences are not going to disappear because new poor regions will be joining the Union.
Enlargement must not come about at the expense of the more disadvantaged areas but through united efforts.
As Mr Caveri said, the simplification and clarification of regional and structural policy also remain a continual challenge.
The administrative load must be lightened, for example, by switching to the 'one fund' principle.
It is important that all the Union's resources should be efficiently utilised, even in the remotest regions.
Together we must ensure that the whole of the area of the Union is included in the single market and enjoys the benefits which that brings with it.
Mr President, I must congratulate the rapporteur on her report as I appreciate and have seen for myself the great effort she has put into this difficult task, even though we disagree on some of the points contained in the document.
I would like to begin by stressing that I come from a region which does not meet Objective 1 criteria. It never has been an Objective 1 region, and never will be.
My region is an Objective 2 region. That said, I would also like to point out that in the past, this House heard from leaders with a vision of the future who set courses of action leading to the growth and development of a European policy for union, based on a policy of social cohesion.
What we are experiencing today is not however in line with that approach.
I am particularly alarmed by the plans to reduce the growth and development of social cohesion policies. I would go so far as to say that these are penny-pinching plans.
To date, social cohesion has been at the heart of policy within the European Union. It is, at the very least, surprising that reference is made to minimum percentages when there are regions exceeding the 200 GDP level.
As the Vice-President rightly said, what we are about is ensuring there will be no more poor regions.
We should encourage all European regions to involve themselves in the cohesion-building process. We must prevent any increase in differences.
The last report demonstrated that whilst it is true that the poorest regions have achieved growth in percentage terms, the richer regions have grown at least as much.
That is another issue to be studied.
Ladies and gentlemen, I believe this is a problem to be resolved in the future, and not now, as currently proposed.
Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, this report forms a link between three major processes: the revision of cohesion policy, the reform of the CAP and the completion of the process of unifying and enlarging the Union.
The future of Europe will depend to a large extent on how the three major processes interact, and the extent to which the European Parliament succeeds in influencing these processes will determine the extent to which its role of codecision is a proper political role rather than just a formality.
The debate has only just begun, and I am pleased to say I have just three points to make today.
Firstly, cohesion policy must remain one of the driving forces of the European Union.
Secondly, the need for cohesion support cannot be determined on the basis of the unfair, unreliable, misleading parameter of GDP.
We call upon the European Commission to specify new parameters - unemployment, infrastructure and quality of the environment - which are more correct indicators throughout the Union.
We in this House want to help you.
Thirdly, the implementing phase of Agenda 2000 must be monitored carefully, not just as regards quantity and expenditure but also as regards quality.
Preparing our regions for enlargement means also and above all using these funds to increase the competitiveness of our human and social capital.
Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, in this speech, I shall restrict myself to discussing the key political issue underpinning the future of cohesion policy.
This, as I am sure you can work out, concerns the amount of funds to be allocated to this crucial pillar of the process of European integration during the period 2007 to 2013.
This is a key political issue because Europe will only be viable if it is founded on a project of solidarity towards its most disadvantaged regions; the European Union will not succeed on the basis of excessive regional disparities.
By subscribing to the Franco-German agreement on the freezing of common agricultural policy spending until 2013 on the basis of spending in 2006, the last European Council, held in Brussels, makes the assumption that the same principle of freezing could also be applied to funds earmarked for cohesion policy.
In other words, the same Union budget that has served a Europe of fifteen countries will also have to serve a Europe of twenty-seven. To this we can add the end of the illusion that the savings made from the CAP could be channelled into cohesion policy; not forgetting that strengthening the rural development of the CAP has been extremely difficult and the CAP, as we know, has a cohesion-based approach.
It could be said that a cohesion policy that is funded to an approximate value of 0.45% of Community GDP would already be a major achievement.
At least scenarios of renationalisation, which have been brewing in some countries where cohesion policy is concerned, would be averted.
Nevertheless, I should like to emphasise the lack of resources, which endangers the future existence of a balanced cohesion policy that on the one hand does not ignore the cohesion deficit that still exists in today's European Union of fifteen and on the other, that is equal to the task of the greatest challenge ever set for the process of European integration.
I would also emphasise, with regard to this matter and in conclusion, the contrast with the recent past, when financial resources for cohesion have been doubled where other major challenges have arisen.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report upon which we are to vote tomorrow is first and foremost a progress report on cohesion policy.
We must congratulate ourselves on the positive impact of this policy, which has proved crucial to the harmonious development of the Union.
Having said that, a great deal still remains to be done.
I believe our objective should be to make this policy simpler, more intelligent and more generous.
By more intelligent, I mean that this policy must be flexible and take account of the wide variety of handicaps facing the European regions.
We need to define clearer allocation criteria and set achievable objectives.
In this regard, the GDP statistics have a clear advantage.
This, however, is a simplistic solution, which can only be partial, and which does not allow for adaptation to all the realities in the field.
We must take account of other indicators that are just as relevant and quantifiable, such as accessibility, public infrastructures and employment rates.
This approach would enable us to develop a cohesion policy that benefits regions whose development is lagging behind, but which is also suited to mountainous regions, sparsely populated regions, and regions with geographical handicaps.
The new regional policy must also be simpler.
That means that its beneficiaries must be able to use it easily.
Together with Commissioner Barnier and the Member States, we have started to work towards this, but the current exercise is restricted by the framework set by the regulations in force.
We must do more to simplify the administrative framework after 2006.
The third objective is to make cohesion policy more generous.
Today, fund absorption capacity is often used to justify restrictions on subsidies that are granted.
I believe that after 2006, if we succeed in coming up with instruments suited to local needs that are easy to use, the budget for these can and should be greater.
The problem is not that there is one cake to be shared between regions, as some would have us believe.
The Union must show ambition for the sake of all its citizens when it comes to showing that it is an area of solidarity.
Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteur on this very important report.
The RETT committee amendments are in line with the conclusions of the Musotto report, particularly on the need for a cohesion policy which will improve existing and future disparities between European regions in an enlarged Europe.
In this context, I would highlight and support Amendment 12 which recognises the need for a generous phasing-out period for those regions which may no longer qualify for Objective 1 support but which may still need this level of funding.
My own peripheral region has received only 10% of all EU funding to Ireland over the past 30 years and is therefore still seriously under-developed in terms of infrastructure.
I cannot, however, support paragraph 16, nor part of paragraph 17.
I believe they could lead to a by-passing of national government responsibilities and duties.
Finally, in the context of enlargement, the EU must ensure adequate aid for family farmers - the backbone of our rural communities - and, in addition, specific aid to young farmers to ensure the survival of our rural communities and our agricultural sector.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen and rapporteur, I want to thank you for a sound report and an interesting debate.
As the last person to speak, I can say that.
Regional policy is extremely important for today's EU, but also in terms of solidarity in the EU of the future.
The closer we get to 2007, the more intensive are the discussions in our regions of what the future will entail.
I can confirm that there is a lot of concern in the regions about what will happen regarding future structural policy.
As the Commission's reports show, we still have problems, for example with unemployment and wider gulfs between city areas and other regions that are lagging behind.
We must make effective use of currently available resources, something which also applies to future structural fund budgets.
That is why it is important to have partnerships, substantial regional influence on how the money is used and a simplification of administrative methods so that red tape does not prevent the regions from making good use of the money.
One of the excellent things about the report is the emphasis it places upon the fact that geographically disadvantaged regions must be given priority in the structural funds of the future.
We know that a very great many regions are very far away from the large markets and have to live with that geographical fact.
I also think that Amendment No 10 from my own group, the Group of the Party of European Socialists, is extremely important, pointing out as it does that indicators other than GDP must govern the use of the structural funds.
Finally, I want to emphasise how important it is for all the policy areas to promote regional development.
If they do not do so, regional policy will be ineffectual.
Agricultural policy, especially transport policy, must promote regional equality.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 7 November 2002.
The final draft agenda, as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday, 14 November 2002 pursuant to Rules 110 and 110a of Parliament's Rules of Procedure, has been distributed.
Monday:
Mr President, you must be aware that it is very foggy around Strasbourg and I have been told that many Members are not here.
Some of them regret that they will be unable to participate in the debate on the Medina Ortega report on tobacco sponsorship and advertising.
I would ask you to consider postponing that debate until later tonight.
I have been told that a bus is bringing people from Brussels and is expected to arrive about 8.30 p.m.
Mrs Malliori, the draftsperson of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, is on that bus and it would be regrettable if she were not here for the debate.
I do not want to get involved in the matter of the weather now but we may return to it later.
Mr President, this matter concerns the agenda in general - I do not know if it affects Monday.
As you are aware, the Prestige, failing to live up to its name, spilt several tonnes of oil off the Spanish coast, which not only created an oil slick more than 200 kilometres long, but is also a source of great environmental concern and great economic concern for the families affected, which number over 5 000.
Therefore, Mr President, as I understand that Parliament must be sensitive to our citizens' concerns, I would ask you to include in our agenda a Commission statement, followed by a debate, so that we can examine the circumstances in which this incident took place, the causes, the measures that the European Union needs to take in order to prevent a recurrence and possible terms for European Union solidarity.
Mr President, I do not know whether this can be done on Monday or on Thursday, due to the Commission statement on climate change, but I would like to establish it clearly now, so that if the rest of the political groups agree, we can include it in our agenda.
I am trying to work my way systematically through our week.
You have anticipated something which your group and other groups proposed for a change to Thursday's agenda.
I ask any colleagues wishing to speak on that matter to hold their comments until we deal with Thursday's agenda.
But I take note of your request.
Tomorrow is absolutely impossible.
It already looks close to impossible even without adding another report.
Listening to the rapporteur, and in the light of the fact that requests of this sort must be placed with the services one full hour before the sitting, it seems to me it is best to proceed.
I do, however, express my regret that Mrs Hautala and we as a Parliament should today find ourselves in this position of being unable to assure the attendance of colleagues who set off early enough in the day to expect to be able to contribute to a debate.
I do not want to continue the debate unnecessarily and I fully appreciate the difficulty.
The main rapporteur has suggested today or tomorrow.
There, we have no choice: today is the only option.
However, I do accept that perspectives can be different across committees.
In the light of the exceptional circumstances and the absence of the draftsman, Mrs Malliori, I would invite the Environment Committee to ensure that someone who has attended the debates and voted on the Committee is available to give a reasonable account of the Committee's view during the debate this evening.
Looking at colleagues' reactions, that seems to me to be an acceptable suggestion.
We will therefore begin today's sitting with the joint debate on media.
We will follow that debate with the Medina Ortega report and with the opinion that should accompany it.
Wednesday:
As regards the Council statement on the tripartite social summit, the Council has asked that this be brought forward on Wednesday's agenda and entered immediately after the statement on Pakistan.
(Parliament agreed to the request)
Thursday:
I have received from the Group of the European People's Party and European Democrats and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance a request to include in the agenda for this part-session a Commission statement on the application of the Erika package on maritime safety to the wreck of the oil tanker off the Galician coast and the measures to be taken to alleviate the socio-economic and ecological disasters caused.
I have already indicated that we have received from two groups, including your group, a request for a statement.
We do not need a debate now, we just need a procedural vote on the request from the PPE-DE Group and the Green/EFA Group for the inclusion of the statement on Thursday.
(Parliament agreed to the request)
As regards the report by Mr Maaten on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy currently entered for voting time at noon pursuant to Rule 110a, I have received an objection in writing from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance to this procedure being applied.
This group wishes to have a debate on the Maaten report to be included at the end of Thursday's agenda.
(Parliament rejected the request)
December I part-session (4 and 5 December, Brussels):
No change.
Regarding tomorrow's meeting with members of the parliaments of the accession states, I would like to request that, at the group meetings tonight, the Presidents of the different groups inform both our Members, and their counterparts from the accession states - if they have been able to get here - that it is absolutely essential that no-one should use or switch on their mobile phones.
Interpretation will be an enormous challenge with so many new languages and thus, to facilitate the process, an infra-red interpreting system will be used.
Anyone switching on their mobile phone to receive text messages, or to make or receive calls, will actually interfere with the technical capacity for our guests to hear in translation what is being said.
While we normally have a procedure that invites colleagues not to use mobile phones, tomorrow it is an absolute, technical necessity that everyone switches off their mobile phone before coming here.
I will repeat the warning tomorrow but I would appreciate it if the groups could take note of this matter.
I count on your cooperation.
Regarding the general difficulties experienced by colleagues arriving in Strasbourg today, I have a number of letters from various authorities; from airport authorities, from the Mayor of the city and from Air France.
I should like to read to you part of the letter from the airport authority:
Mr President, on a point of order, I wish to ask whether you can confirm whether the reindeer were on the ground or in the air at the time.
If I were to answer it might introduce too much levity to the situation.
I should like to remind colleagues that these speeches should be limited to one minute.
Mr President, as a Galician and as fisheries coordinator of the majority group in this House, I welcome the decision we have taken for the Commission to attend on Thursday in order to explain to us in the finest detail - because we are going to require the finest details - how this extremely serious accident could have occurred.
Mr President, Galicia is black: its beaches, its coastline, its fauna, its fish, its birds ? and the people are facing a black future.
I would like to ask you, Mr President, to declare your solidarity, on behalf of this House, with the Spanish and Galician authorities and to address them directly.
On Thursday we shall call for aid and an enquiry from the Commission.
I would also like to announce, given that this House, in accordance with the new Rules of Procedure, does not allow us to table resolutions, that through the Committee on Fisheries I shall propose a resolution to establish protected European sea-fishing zones in susceptible areas, which will increase the required distances to be maintained between these zones and ships carrying dangerous goods and bring forward the obligation for this type of ship to have a double hull, which is currently laid down for the year 2015, and I shall call for it to be brought forward to the year 2005.
Mr President, I am telling you this as an Irishman and a Celt: we cannot allow another disaster of this kind to occur in Europe.
We must increase control and prevent our environment from being destroyed.
Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of the Socialist Group and also as the Socialist coordinator of the Committee on Fisheries to draw the attention of the House to the oil spill from the Prestige, to which previous speakers have also referred, which took place last week near the coast of my region, Galicia.
On Thursday - the accident happened on Wednesday - I tabled a motion for a resolution before this House and also tabled two motions for resolutions, because I understand there are common interests here: environmental interests, fisheries interests - which the Committee on Fisheries will have to pursue - and interests relating to the maritime transport of dangerous goods, which the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism will have to pursue.
The tanker has already left an oil slick 37 km long which is spreading towards the coast, paradoxically, despite being named Prestige - and you can see that this will indeed be a European problem - it is Bahamas-flagged, with a Philippine-Romanian crew, it was travelling from Lithuania - a candidate country - to Gibraltar, which involves a European Union country, a Member State, in this case the United Kingdom, and was under the command of a Greek captain.
I would call on the Community institutions to strengthen legislation in this field, comply with existing legislation and devote their attention to this kind of disaster by means of European solidarity, such as that provided, for example, in the cases of the natural disasters that have taken place in four Member States over the summer.
Mr President, on a point of order, I will speak about another catastrophe.
Operating at world level, the United Nations' Committee against Torture publishes its findings every four years and makes recommendations to the signatory states.
Until now the Spanish Kingdom has not passed this test.
The Spanish report for the period 1997-2001 does not give guarantees concerning the incommunicado detention or solitary confinement that can lead to ill-treatment and torture, which is commonplace in cases relating to the Basque country.
More than this, the end result of instances of torture in Spain has been a pardon for torturers.
The Spanish delegation of the Ministry of the Interior has all the same concluded, and I quote: 'that the number of pardons was not comparable with the number of criminal proceedings involving police officers for offences against human rights' and there was no policy for granting pardons, such a process being 'not automatic' in the words of the delegation.
Tomorrow afternoon the report on Spain will be issued at 3 p.m.
Could the Conference of Presidents of political groups take a look at it please?
Mr President, on a point of order, you are aware that the Joint Parliamentary Assembly is due to begin next Monday in the Hemicycle in Brussels.
I understand that the Conference of Presidents has sent quite a strongly worded letter to the Belgian authorities concerning the prospect of two members of the Zimbabwean delegation being on the visa ban list.
I understand that visas have now been granted to those two ministers from Zanu-PF and they are due to arrive in Brussels tomorrow.
Mr President, could you give us some indication what action the European Parliament will now take on this very serious matter?
In the light of Parliament's resolutions which we conveyed immediately after the Conference of Presidents to the Belgian authorities - who had already issued visas and did not wish to withdraw them - I propose that the Conference of Presidents should again this week appraise the current situation.
We should discuss Parliament's options consistent with its resolutions and consistent with the necessity to be coherent in following up its resolutions and consider declaring these two persons personae non gratae with regard to access to the Parliament itself.
Should the Conference of Presidents make such a decision, it will then convey that decision to the Belgian authorities and to the authorities in Zimbabwe.
That would be my personal preference.
In any event, I guarantee that the matter will be raised in the Conference of Presidents.
It will be for the majority will of the Conference to determine the appropriate action to be taken and then to convey that decision to you and colleagues, and also to those outside the House.
Mr President, on a point of order, I endorse the remarks that have just been made, but could I also suggest that, if there is any question of this Joint Parliamentary Assembly going ahead somewhere else and the banned Zimbabwean ministers still being there, it should be recommended that Members of this House do not join in that Assembly for as long as those ministers are present.
I ask Members wishing to pursue the matter to ensure in the preparatory political work in their respective groups this week that the groups are in a position to arrive at a clear political preference.
A statement of that preference will come from the meeting of the Conference of Presidents on Thursday of this week.
Mr President, four weeks ago, I asked for support for the operation to recover the hundreds of victims of Africa's biggest shipping disaster involving the stricken ship Joala off the coast of Senegal.
Nothing has happened to date.
According to the Commission, there is reported to be religious opposition on the part of the Senegalese to this recovery operation. The recovery of bodies is said to be technically difficult and President Wade is reported to prefer burial at sea to recovery.
However, these reports have now been superseded by completely new facts.
From my contacts with the Senegalese, it appears that President Wade would give priority to recovery and that he has set aside a certain sum of money for this purpose.
Local divers have already recovered over 200 bodies. Technically speaking, therefore, it is possible, but further funding is lacking.
The Senegalese relatives and all the relatives from France, the Netherlands and other Member States cannot live with the dreadful thought that their loved ones could not be given a dignified send-off.
It is not a question of religious opposition.
On my own behalf, I would ask you to convey this message once again to the Commission as a matter of the greatest possible urgency, for this is about Africa's biggest shipping disaster.
If this had happened off our own coasts, we would not have hesitated for one moment to intervene.
These people deserve a dignified recovery.
I will pass on that observation to the relevant authorities in the Commission.
I shall say for the record that after the debate on this matter on the last occasion, I communicated on behalf of Parliament our sincere condolences to the relevant authorities, which was the request made of the presidency at that time.
Mr President, the statute of the Members, an oral question to the Council, now features on the Brussels part-session agenda.
There was a minority in our group who thought it unwise to table this question to the Council at this stage, because we are still debating it ourselves, but a democratic decision has been taken.
From the Conference of Presidents report, I noticed that you have held talks with the prime ministers of the Member States.
Could I ask you, Mr President, to write to the Members of this Parliament who do not attend the conference about the contacts you had and what you discussed with the prime ministers, so that we too are well equipped for the task ahead and know what we are talking about in the plenary meeting on 4 December.
In the light of your request the best thing I can do is to say that I will take personal steps to communicate with the Members before we have these debates.
In the interim, I can tell you that I had an opportunity for the first time to report back to the Conference of Presidents on the results of exploratory discussions on the Statute for Members which I held on behalf of the Conference of Presidents with the relevant Council authorities.
A decision was made last Thursday at the meeting of the Conference of Presidents to invite the rapporteur, Mr Rothley, to again develop our thinking and his report before the Committee on Legal Affairs and Internal Market, with a view, at a date yet to be determined, to discussing the matter and voting on it in plenary.
In the interim period, we could contemplate an oral question or invite the Council to make a statement at the first part-session in December.
When I have had the opportunity this week to report to the Bureau, which is the next body in sequence, having reported to the Conference of Presidents, I will then try to take some steps to ensure that all Members have their own appraisal of the state of the exploration as we made it.
Mr President, while the fire-fighters of Strasbourg were wandering through the Strasbourg fog, trying to catch the - eurosceptic, I am sure - fawns belonging, I believe, to Mr Roger Helmann, the aircraft in which I was travelling circled round and round in the sky above, giving me the time to read and reread the Italian newspapers reporting the statement of the Italian Minister for Economic Affairs, Giulio Tremonti, to the effect that 'Europe must decide on pensions'.
Are we Europeans so powerful, then?
Of course, we are unable to stop deer running around in the fog but we have to decide what to do about pensions.
I believe that this is a case of the principle of subsidiarity being reversed: when it suits the States, then it is the States that decide; when they need to cut pensions and make pensioners tighten their belts, then it suits them to say that Europe has to make the decision.
Do you not think you should do something, Mr President?
That is a very wise observation on your part, Mr Fatuzzo.
Mr President, on a point of order, because of the historic debates that will take place this part-session there is no Question Time.
I had submitted a question to the Council on the legislative process and the way in which this House is potentially being treated in relation to the proposed directive on legal aid.
The Council intends to adopt this measure at the end of the month on the basis of a different text to that on which Parliament was consulted.
This will avoid the codecision procedure, which would kick in after the end of the month, and it also avoids the strong advice of the Commission that the Council should reconsult Parliament.
I should like to know, on behalf of this House, why the Council feels it has no obligation to reconsult us.
Does it not agree that this action runs absolutely counter to the principle of mutual respect and good faith between these institutions in the legislative process, as set out in the Treaties and endorsed by the Court of Justice?
Mr President, this is serious and I would ask you to look into it.
Mrs Wallis, in the absence of Question Time, your question is noted.
Let me take up your request to see whether we can have some indication from the Council as to its response on the question of substance you have now posed.
Mr President, on a point or order, I am following on from what Mr van Hulten said concerning Wednesday, 4 December.
As a member of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, I am well aware of the constitutional and practical importance of moving forward with the Statute of Members - even though I would not myself have chosen this particular way of doing it.
However, I note that on the agenda for that day there are major debates on fisheries - the first for ten years - looking at the fisheries industry of Europe at a critical time.
Constituents all over Europe will wonder what the European Parliament is thinking and doing about that.
What the newspapers will tell them is that Parliament delayed discussing it until it had talked about its own pay.
This is a scandalous state of affairs.
I hope that if the Conference of Presidents persists with this agenda in this form it will change the order and bring the fisheries matter - which is of utmost importance - before and ahead of the debate on the Statute of Members.
If colleagues wish to discuss this issue they could raise it at the Conference of Presidents on Thursday.
I remind you that we have just voted on the adoption of the December agenda for Brussels without any discussion or contradiction or proposals from the floor.
I take note of what you have said.
It is still open to the groups to look at the order of discussion on that day.
Mr President, on a point of order.
I welcome the recent acquittal of the British and Dutch plane-spotters on spying charges in Greece and the fact that the appeal court had the integrity to put right the original miscarriage of justice that the conviction represented a year ago.
I recall that it took many years to right similar wrongs in cases in the United Kingdom in the 1980s, so I am pleased that, although a year is an ordeal for the defendants, it was no longer.
But the fact is this prosecution should never have happened and the way it developed raised a lot of concerns about the treatment of defendants and trial standards.
It is therefore essential that we progress the agenda for ensuring high minimum procedural standards of justice for persons accused in criminal proceedings which the Commission will be putting forward in a proposed framework decision next year.
We also need to put flesh on the bones of our human rights commitments in the European Convention on Human Rights and the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
Mr President, just a quick word on the tanker accident off the Galician coast, which is another terrible and tragic accident of which we have certainly not heard the last.
A few days ago, a representative of the Commission, speaking in Lisbon on the subject of EMSA, the European Maritime Safety Agency, addressed the concept of a European environmental coastguard.
That is something we have been demanding for ten years, but without getting very far with it as yet.
I also want to prevent the occurrence of anything like what recently happened in Germany.
It was a year ago, in a similar situation, that we set up a maritime casualty taskforce that has still not yet become operational.
It was stated in a weekend newspaper that three potential bases are being sought for it, the best of which will be chosen.
I would have you know that the public take a critical view of this, to say the least, and I would simply ask that we should not allow ourselves such blunders, at least within the European framework.
Mr President, I would just like to draw the attention of the House to something which happened in Italy on Thursday night. Twenty 'no global' activists were arrested and kept in isolation on charges such as 'subversion of the economic system' or 'preventing the institutions and government representatives from doing their job'.
These are offences which have existed under the Italian penal code since the 1930s. They were introduced to stop anarchists and socialists from expanding their political activities during the period of fascism.
If these offences had existed in a candidate country and were brought to the attention of all the European institutions, the country in question would not have been successful in the enlargement negotiations.
I feel that this is an issue which is relevant throughout Europe and that such incidents must not be repeated either in the Fifteen or the Twenty-five.
We too must keep an eye out for this kind of situation. We must discuss the issue or, at least, be aware that such things are happening.
Mr President, I wish also, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, to express my sympathy with those affected by the events in Galicia.
We all feel powerless.
I myself looked at the web site where all vessels are supposed to be listed and looked for the vessel Prestige.
It is not there, even though it ought to be.
I would ask you to convey to the Commission that we too wish to know about the part played by Latvia in what has happened.
I also want our Latvian colleagues to comment on the matter so that we obtain a debate, for the vessel was on the way from Latvia to Gibraltar.
I also believe that these countries should comply with current standards.
At the same time, I would ask the Commission to find out the name of the charterer.
I have tried to find it in the newspapers.
It is a piece of information we need if we are to be able to monitor developments.
In the light of previous interventions, I want to point out that Wednesday is the day when we celebrate the rights of the child.
I think that we should celebrate together and that greetings should be sent to Carol Belami.
Perhaps we could ask the Commission to take note of your question in advance of the statement which will be made by the Commission on Thursday.
Mr President, today we saw at the airport that nature can sometimes turn against technology.
To avoid deliberately upsetting nature, we must draft effective climate policy.
The emission of CO2 must be drastically reduced.
A majority in this Parliament has been pleading for years that environmental costs should be passed on to the consumer.
Environmental tax must be incorporated into air fares, especially in the air transport sector.
So far, however, the European Union has failed, for there is no climate tax.
Fortunately, there is also some good news.
For a fee, the organisation Trees for Travel plants trees after each plane trip you make.
Every time you fly, you can buy a climate certificate to balance out the emission of CO2 from your trip.
Despite a lack of legislation, we can at least put our money where our mouth is.
The Dutch delegation in the Group of the Party of European Socialists has decided to back this initiative and to buy climate certificates in Strasbourg this week for their plane trips.
I urge the President and all the other fellow MEPs who travel regularly by air to do the same.
Mr President, as a Member for a peripheral maritime region, I would also like to express my solidarity with the Galician fishermen affected by the Prestige ecological disaster.
Secondly, I would like to say, as a member of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, and a substitute member of the Committee on Fisheries, that four aspects are significantly affected by this disaster.
I would therefore like the Commission and in particular the rapporteur, Mr Izquierdo Collado, to ensure that this White Paper on transport takes into account, for the year 2010, something that concerns me and that a Member from the Canaries, Mr Medina, mentioned to me today: the failure by many ships, both Community and other, to follow routes which avoid the exclusive economic zones in certain regions, such as Galicia.
That concludes the item.
The next item is the joint debate on six oral questions to the Commission concerning the media:
Oral question (O-0045/02 - B5-0498/02) by Graham Watson - 'Internal market: media pluralism and enlargement'
Oral question (O-0053/02 - B5-0499/02) by Enrique BarÃ³n Crespo, Michel Rocard, Barbara O'Toole, Reino Paasilinna, Demetrio Volcic and Karin Junker - Media concentration
Oral question (O-0080/02 - B5-0500/02) - by Raina A. Mercedes Echerer, Daniel Marc Cohn-Bendit, Monica Frassoni, Heide RÃŒhle and Jean Lambert - Media concentration
Oral question (O-0082/02 - B5-0501/02) by Fausto Bertinotti, Lucio Manisco and GeneviÃšve Fraisse - Media concentration
Oral question (O-0083/02 - B5-0502/02) by Mariotto Segni, William Abitbol, Teresa Almeida Garrett, Guido Bodrato, Juan JosÃ© Bayona de Perogordo, Jean-Louis Bourlanges, Luigi Cocilovo, Gerard Collins, Thierry Cornillet, Paul CoÃ»teaux, Brian Crowley, Luigi Ciriaco De Mita, GÃ©rard M.J. Deprez, Giorgos Dimitrakopoulos, Carlo Fatuzzo, Fernando FernÃ¡ndez MartÃ­n, ConcepciÃ³ Ferrer, Jim Fitzsimons, Konstantinos Hatzidakis, Liam Hyland, Florence Kuntz, Franco Marini, Mario Clemente Mastella, Reinhold Messner, Juan Ojeda Sanz, SeÃ¡n Ã Neachtain, Marcelino Oreja ArburÃºa, JosÃ© Pacheco Pereira, Giuseppe Pisicchio, MarÃ­a Antonia AvilÃ©s Perea, JosÃ© Javier PomÃ©s Ruiz, Bartho Pronk and Lennart SacrÃ©deus - Media concentration and pluralism
and
Oral question (O-0084/02 - B5-0503/02) by W.G. van Velzen, Ruth Hieronymi, Christopher J.P. Beazley and Mario Mauro - Safeguarding the freedom and pluralism of the media in an enlarged European Union.
Mr President, in 1997 the process by which fixed and mobile telephony and television and the Internet were increasingly coming together was known by the buzz word 'convergence'.
The Commission adopted a much heralded Green Paper on this subject which promised a brave new world of horizontal regulation across platforms.
The reality was much more prosaic.
Convergence did not happen quite to the extent predicted and the Commission confined itself largely to revising the telecommunications regulation package to take account of new technology.
Since that time, however, we have witnessed a wave of mergers and take-overs in the media with the emergence of vast conglomerates such as AOL Time Warner, CBS, Viacom and Vivendi Universal.
Yet the Commission has not explored the idea of cross-media ownership and media concentration in any detail since its 1994 follow-up to the Green Paper on pluralism and media concentration.
The Commission's silence on such an important issue seems particularly strange because the European Parliament has been calling for a directive on a level playing field and media pluralism since the 1990s.
I recognise that regulating the media is a highly sensitive issue.
The media is not like any other industry as it lies at the heart of our culture, our way of life.
A diverse and pluralistic media is fundamental to democracy, freedom and cultural diversity.
But in view of the trend towards media concentration, towards the dominance of certain media conglomerates, my group believes it is high time that we come back to this issue.
What are the principles which should underlie our approach?
First of all we must recognise that a thriving media is the hallmark of a free society.
If control of the media becomes too narrowly restricted in the hands of a small number of people this poses a danger for democracy.
The media needs to be sufficiently diverse for all important points of view in society to be effectively presented.
Otherwise there is a danger that dominant media players can restrict access to information and thereby move public opinion.
Avoiding media concentration is also important to our economy.
Some have argued that with the explosion of different types of media, including digital, satellite and cable television, as well as the Internet, monopolistic control is impossible.
However, many of these different channels of communication are now controlled by the same media conglomerates, which can thereby cross-promote these services and provide incentives or pressure advertisers to buy space or air time in other media they control.
Last but not least, media concentration has implications for our cultural diversity.
A Europe in which the media is dominated by a few major players risks being one in which certain regions, cultures and minority groups are granted less access to the media.
A diverse media is likely to result in more home-grown original content, whereas large media groups may not resist the temptation to fill their air time with cheap imported programmes and repeats.
For the ELDR Group there is a clear case to look again at this issue.
My questions to the Commission today are: what action does the Commission propose to take?
If the Commissioner takes the view, as I suspect he may, that there is no legal basis for action, I would remind him of the articles of the Treaty governing the single market.
I would remind him too that Article 11 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights guarantees media pluralism and if that Charter is integrated into a new constitutional treaty, as Liberal Democrats hope it will be, would that not provide a necessary legal base for action?
Will the Commission undertake to bring forward a White Paper updating its 1994 communication in the light of technological change and developments in the industry?
It seems to me that we cannot ignore the dangers that media concentration poses to our society.
The power of media ownership now frequently extends across national borders.
Given that a free and diverse media is essential to our continent's democracy, prosperity and cultural vitality, it is high time that politicians face up to their responsibilities and return to this issue.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my group has tabled this question on media concentration and I must say I am very happy that the initiative has spread throughout the House, because we consider that this is not a single-party or single-group issue, but a concern over a matter of constitutional importance to the Union.
We did this because, ten years ago, the Commission put forward a Green Paper on pluralism and the internal market, and proposed - and even drew up - a preliminary draft directive to harmonise national legislation on media ownership.
Since then, nothing has happened, and the Commission, which has the monopoly on initiative, should also show that it deserves this right.
Many things have happened over the past ten years.
Significant technological progress has been made - the Internet over written media, cable, satellite television, digital technology - which have transformed the landscape.
A concentration process has also taken place which goes beyond our borders and means that certain names have spread and now represent the media throughout Europe, such as Murdoch and Berlusconi.
Others have fallen by the wayside, such as Messier and Kirsch, and others are arriving, such as Bloomberg.
We must also take account of the developments that are taking place in the United States, where the federal authorities are making changes in order to increase US technological capacity.
In any event, however, Mr President, my group thinks this is above all a democratic issue, because it refers to one of the bases of the system we live in, namely the protection of freedom of speech, which is one of the cornerstones of a democratic society.
I am not only referring to freedom of speech as we politicians defend it, but also to freedom of speech for all citizens and also for workers in the press and the media, because it does not make sense for us always to advocate greater democracy for workers in other sectors but not in this one.
This should also be extended to the candidate countries, where concern is spreading over the loss of the national character of the media.
Therefore, Commissioner, allow me to play devil's advocate.
I said that no progress had been made in ten years.
Why has no progress been made?
It would be interesting to analyse the matter.
Is it because it is very complicated?
European construction has always been a challenge and what I would therefore say is that if the directive was necessary, and it was necessary to address this issue, in 1992, it is all the more necessary now.
Secondly - and this is another of the questions we posed - it could be considered that the legal basis is insufficient.
Ten years ago, however, it would appear that it was sufficient.
It would be interesting if the Commission were to explain this to us, or otherwise tell us whether it would be appropriate, for example, for this issue to be considered as a matter of fundamental rights in the Commission proposal to the Convention.
Lastly, Mr President, we are aware that this is what is known as a cross-cutting issue.
I must say that I am very happy that it is the Commissioner responsible for the protection of consumer rights and health who is to respond to this question, because we are always told that this issue concerns the internal market or competition.
It is more than that. It concerns competition, the internal market, culture and fundamental rights.
There were four Commissioners I was thinking might appear, and it was a pleasant surprise to see Mr Byrne, who also has to defend us as consumers against this uncontrolled invasion not only of audiovisual messages, which are frequently subliminal, but also against uncontrolled advertising and the monopoly in the field of advertising.
I therefore hope that today's debate, in which all the parliamentary groups are participating and showing interest, will be a step forward, breaking this ten-year silence and allowing the Commission to exercise its monopoly on initiatives in this fundamental area responsibly.
Mr President, these debates on the hot topic of media policy have been going on since 1992, and Parliament had always taken a democratic approach to the issue.
Since 1997, though, silence has reigned, but now it seems that I can congratulate Parliament on having, like Sleeping Beauty, woken up.
I would like now to speak on behalf of my group.
I cannot but underline the arguments of those who have spoken before me, and I would like to pick up two of the significant points they made.
Entrepreneurship, on the one hand, has become out of balance with journalistic activity on the other, as it now is also with those who produce creative material.
It is for us to restore this balance.
The EU, which announced the creation of the internal market as one of its priorities, must assume its political responsibility in this process involving consolidation and concentration.
We did not liberalise a few years ago by breaking up media monopolies simply in order to create new media monopolies.
Both economic diversity and pluralism in the media are equally under threat.
The wide-ranging nature of concentrations merits particular attention.
My second point is that one of the pillars of democracy is the separation of powers, something that is of especial concern to my group.
Having successfully accomplished the separation of church and state, I believe we ought now to devote our energies to separating political power and the media.
I am speaking here of a European official culture, especially on the eve of enlargement.
One more practical question for the Commission: in 1997, the directive on media ownership disappeared back into a drawer, quite possibly as a result of political pressure, although we cannot be certain of that.
We need a better legal basis at European level, but then we know that; it is a statement we heard all of five years ago, and we do not need to have it repeated.
Why, then, has the Commission only now started to do something about it?
We are all aware of these problems; they are not new, and we do not need to reinvent the wheel.
Action is needed, O esteemed Commission!
I repeat that I support the arguments of those who have preceded me on the floor, and, as Mr BarÃ³n Crespo said, media policy is not a party issue.
We must not let it become one.
Mrs Fraisse is absent, probably due to transport problems, which we are all suffering today.
Mr Segni therefore has the floor for two minutes.
Mr President, I and 32 other Members have tabled a question calling upon the Commission - in view of the fact that the media, particularly television, is an area in which abuse of power is a serious threat to the proper functioning of civil and democratic life and in view of the fact that incidents of this nature do occur in many countries - to resume the process broken off in 1994 and work towards issuing a directive.
Twenty-two of the thirty-three signatories are from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, and others are from the Europe for a Union of the Nations Group, which shows, as has just been said, that this is not a display of particular or party interests but of the concern of all those who care about the basic principles of the liberal state.
It may be that we Italians are particularly sensitive to this issue, but I would ask the House to show some understanding.
I want to ask all the German Members of all parties whether they would not be concerned if their Chancellor, Gerhard SchrÃ¶der owned all the private television networks, one of the major magazines and one of the major daily newspapers.
I want to ask the British Members, if they are going to take part in this debate, what their reaction would be if Tony Blair had called publicly for the removal of three famous BBC journalists and had obtained what he wanted in the space of a few months.
I have brought this up not because these are problems which Europe has to resolve - they arose in Italy and we Italians must resolve them ourselves - I have mentioned it because, in actual fact, what is happening in Italy is different from the situation in other countries but there is one common factor: media concentration, which is becoming a world-wide phenomenon and is in danger of jeopardising media pluralism and thus freedom.
As has rightly been said, a line has to be drawn between politics and media reporting.
Although this does not by law fall within the sphere of the Commission's responsibility, Mr President, it is the point which is common to society throughout Europe.
That is why we have put the matter to the Commission.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union's core concerns include the safeguarding of freedom of information and the freedom and diversity of opinion.
These are among our fundamental values, to which, it is to be hoped, the Convention will give a prominent place in the constitution that will be our common possession.
That being so, Parliament has, over past years, repeatedly done in-depth work on these issues and taken actual developments in the European Union and the Member States as a yardstick when measuring the extent to which these things have become reality.
I do not think one can say that Parliament has been asleep.
It is not only 1997 that should be mentioned here; I would like to remind you all of what we decided together in 2000 with our position on the fundamental questions relating to the communication and information society in the European Union, and would also refer you to our common position on the revision of the television directive in 2001.
That was something on which we did not yield.
The only thing is that we have to take a realistic view of how things stand.
So far, the results are clear and unambiguous: we have no option but to draw distinctions.
The media markets continue largely to be the national markets that they were previously, as is unmistakeably clear in the case of the print media.
Secondly, it is the case that in the electronic media field, the television markets are still predominantly national in character.
It must, thirdly, be clear to us that development has progressed further.
Cross-border developments are increasingly taking place in the electronic media, especially where digital technology is brought into play.
This is a question on which we have to focus, examining very carefully what consequences this development is having for the safeguarding of freedom of opinion and information and pluralism of the media in the European Union and in its Member States.
That is why my group, that of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, has put to you a question with reference to this specific development.
We are asking the Commission to draw up a Green Paper on the current situation to take up the question of the structural developments observable today in Europe's political, economic and legal media.
We additionally ask you to table a proposal for our consideration on what you consider to be appropriate action in order to achieve the objective, which it is to be hoped is shared by us all, of safeguarding the pluralism of the media and of opinion in the European Union.
I do think that, if we travel together in this direction, we will together take a significant step along the road towards guaranteeing diversity of opinion in the European Union.
Mr President, undoubtedly the media play a crucial role in subjecting the exercise of public and private powers to permanent scrutiny.
Media pluralism is therefore of the utmost importance and lies at the very heart of the way our democratic societies operate.
Indeed it is one of the core values underlying the European Union, as enshrined in Article 11(2) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which refers explicitly to protecting the pluralism of the media.
On this subject, I can only endorse what you say regarding the situation in the media sector following developments over the past ten years.
I would add that while audiences may be focused on a small number of programmes, European citizens have, nonetheless, a far wider choice in their viewing, thanks to a range of technologies.
In this new setting, the Commission has made use of the instruments at its disposal.
In applying competition law it upholds freedom of competition in the media, particularly in innovative media services such as the Internet and UMTS.
Moreover, it applies the mergers regulation which serves to control the phenomenon of media concentration from the economic angle.
In addition, the Community legislator, on the basis of Commission proposals, adopted the television without frontiers directive, the satellite and cable directive and the conditional access directive, which address various aspects of cross-border television broadcasting.
The legislative framework was further supplemented by the e-commerce directive, adopted in 2000, the objective of which is to facilitate cross-border provision of new interactive media services distributed on a point-to-point basis.
Finally, the Commission proposal for a common regulatory framework for liberalising electronic communications networks and services was adopted in March this year.
One of its main aims is to open up access to electronic communications networks, including those which carry broadcast content.
To this end, it provides that operators who are identified as having a strong market position may have to meet ex-ante obligations on transparency, non-discrimination, accounting separation and access to or use of specific facilities.
The Commission monitors closely the transposition of these directives in the applicant countries as well as in the Member States, ensuring that national media legislation remains consistent with Community law.
While existing Community law instruments undoubtedly have positive repercussions on the protection of pluralism, it has to be said that their purpose is to ensure a certain economic balance between players in the context of the internal market.
These instruments directly affect the media sector as an area of economic activity and not - or at least only very indirectly - as a vehicle for delivering information to the citizen.
This situation stems from the fact that even though pluralism is a fundamental freedom recognised by the EU, it is not one of the tasks assigned to the European Community under Article 2 of the EC Treaty.
This is borne out by Article 21 of the mergers regulation, which allows Member States to forbid a merger in the interests of protecting pluralism even where it has been approved by the Commission.
Consequently, any new initiative based on internal market freedoms would encounter the same limitation as the instruments I have mentioned and would not ensure the protection of pluralism per se.
The question also arises whether such an initiative could be justified by reference to existing Treaty provisions.
The Commission is not aware of any concrete obstacles to exercise of the fundamental freedoms of the EC Treaty, particularly the right of establishment or freedom to provide services within the meaning of Articles 43 and 49, being encountered in the media sector because of national measures designed to protect pluralism per se.
Moreover, any initiative would have to be aimed at eliminating significant distortion of competition.
Under Court of Justice case-law, these are the tests for Community action on the basis of Article 95, involving measures to improve the operation of the single market.
We also have to consider whether such an initiative would comply with the principle of subsidiarity, since the purpose of legislative proposals based on internal market freedoms must in any event be to establish obstacles to the cross-border provision of services, not to regulate for specific situations in Member States.
As to whether it is desirable for the European Convention to provide for the protection of pluralism in general at EU level, I would recall that the Commission, like Parliament, believes the Charter of Fundamental Rights should be incorporated into the basic Treaty and constitutionally entrenched.
Finally, I close with the reminder that the Council of Europe exists, among other things, to preserve cultural pluralism and media diversity.
Closer cooperation with that institution should also be envisaged in order to enhance the protection of pluralism in Europe.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is no need for a dictatorship that relies on military force in the information society if in the same hands there is a self-perpetuating mega-power, a mighty conglomerate that represents the media, the economy and political control.
That is twenty-first century dictatorship.
If a country's leader has influence over two national television channels, for example, and therefore virtually all viewers, and under his or her control there is a continually present, manipulative and mesmerising force oozing out of those channels, what we have is an information society oligarchy.
This goo can also bring the competition to a halt.
When the media drip in every home continually feeds a touted leader's achievements by means of the results of massive Gallup polls then it is a matter of a new machine, a kind of perpetual motion that keeps itself going with a sense of its own legitimacy.
Just look at what is happening in Italy, a country I hold in high regard.
My own basic point of view is this: the more concentrated media communications are the broader the range of rights journalists must have in their work.
It is also wrong to say that a public service is always a monopoly. Not at all: it is controlled by a motley collection of social forces.
In certain applicant countries the government might intervene, in which case it is not a public service but government-run television.
Competition and markets do not always engender freedom or pluralism either: sometimes it is the opposite.
The situation can worsen as a result of concentration.
Neither will free commerce necessarily ensure diversity.
The markets may be self-regulating, but they just apply other sets of rules that are based on a mutual understanding and are undemocratic.
Commissioner Reding, we are calling on you to draft a directive on the concentration of media communications, and its effect on culture, diversity, freedom of speech and the rights of journalists.
Commissioner Monti, we are calling on you to investigate whether the rules on competition have been contravened and a dominant market position has been abused, and, Commissioner Bolkenstein, on you to clarify whether concentration, convergence and the new media have a negative impact on the Internal Market.
Finally, Commissioner Vitorino, please look into the matter of whether or not our citizens' democratic and cultural rights are being implemented.
We would furthermore like to ask the Commission why it does not draft the directive that we have all been hoping for.
The European Convention must also discuss this.
Mr President, one of the crucial principles of a properly functioning democratic society is freedom of expression and access to information.
In this Chamber, we have again and again emphasised the importance of openness and transparency.
Citizens must have access to information affecting their lives so that they can take part in the democratic debate and make their choices.
The media have a central role to play in this process.
If they do not operate properly, then neither does democracy.
At present, there are media trends that give rise to concern.
The consolidation we have witnessed may lead to less pluralism in the media.
We combat monopolies because they reduce the supply of goods, with a consequent decrease in prosperity, and the same applies to the media market.
Monopolies undermine democratic pluralism and lead to a decrease in democratic prosperity.
Previously, party political media such as newspapers were only able to exercise political criticism within their own medium.
They had no control over what other media put out.
The threat we face today is one of potentially powerful consolidation, which may mean certain points of view not being represented in any medium.
As legislators elected by the people, we are faced with striking a sensitive balance.
To what means can we have recourse to ensure free and diverse media without at the same time setting aside another cardinal principle of a democratic society - that of the distribution of power.
We want to set up basic rules that guarantee a level playing field without tampering with the actual content of the media.
We need, in this Assembly, to comply with our democratic responsibility and make sure that the media comply with theirs.
Mr President, as has been stated repeatedly in this debate, there is undoubtedly a link between freedom of information and democracy, and I feel that this debate must serve, not least, to make Parliament and the European institutions more aware than they have been hitherto of the link between democracy and suppressed freedom of information, of the way the media is used to suppress democracy.
This is the case in many countries with which we have economic or commercial relations and countries such as Iraq, China, Cuba, Vietnam and so forth. Certainly, safeguarding freedom of information as a guarantee of genuine democracy is a problem for Europe too.
There are two or three points I would like to make in this regard.
Firstly, in my opinion, we need to be very sparing in our calls for European legislation, in our calls for the Commission to impose some sort of constraints on a market - the merging telecommunications and media markets - which, we must not forget, has to be able to withstand the challenges of the international markets inasmuch as European undertakings have to be able to withstand the challenges of the international markets.
Now then, overloading a market which is already struggling - there are linguistic and cultural barriers, for example, which make it difficult for companies to grow - with the additional burdens of constraints and restrictions could be dangerous.
There is, however, a paradox which I would like to point out in this debate.
It is absurd that we who, although not members of national parliaments, are representatives of the European institutions, focus a great deal on market dynamics and concentrations but fail to even mention the powerful force of state media companies in Europe.
Take Italy, for example.
It is right to put the spotlight on the situation and it is right to be concerned, as it is always right to be concerned about the relationship between the media and democracy, but what is not being said is that half the information sector is in the hands of the state, in other words in the hands of the parties.
This is the case almost throughout Europe.
Do we really think that the parties are using their television networks with due respect for the pluralism of information and due respect for the citizens' right to be informed, or are they serving their own interests and putting across specific information?
There is another dimension to this, and here I pay tribute to the work of Commissioner Van Miert in the previous Commission.
The existence of state television networks is detrimental to the media and information market.
State television networks take up space which could be used for the creation of competing firms, possibly even European firms, and the charges, licence fees and funding associated with them siphon off resources which could be redistributed in the market and used to create a plurality of competing companies.
We must reflect on all this.
I feel that a comment from the Commission on these matters - state aid, competition, the abuse of dominant positions and so forth in the internal markets - would be appropriate too.
Mrs Fraisse has managed to arrive at Parliament from Basilea and I give her the floor on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left.
Mr President, we were indeed re-routed to Mulhouse and many of us arrived by bus, so please therefore forgive any difficulties I might have in presenting my comments to you.
What surprises me, with regard to competition and pluralism, is that we are essentially looking at this issue from two totally different and contrasting points of view.
On the one hand, we are looking at it from the point of view of our countries, the Member States, in which competition can sometimes be very fierce, particularly in Italy, as everyone here knows.
On the other hand, we can also look at the issue of pluralism and competition from the point of view of some of the candidate countries; we can even look at the issue of a single source of information which can have an adverse effect on the pluralism called for by Parliament, since it might be thought that, until now, media coverage in these countries depended exclusively on this single source.
The two extremes of the issue of competition are therefore at opposite ends of the spectrum.
It is, however, these two extremes that we must take into account if we are to find, at the same time, a balance between pluralism and a degree of concentration.
The balance is certainly delicate, but this is also because - and I do not think that we have emphasised this point enough so far in this debate - it is a question of public service.
It is not therefore merely a question of competition among the private media because this problem also concerns public service, and we must achieve a balance between the two.
In order to achieve such a balance, perhaps the Commission must reconsider its indecision regarding the need for a directive, something that has been called for by Parliament for several years.
The Commission must also re-examine the situation of the media, which has changed beyond recognition in recent years.
The last study on this subject was carried out in 1994.
We therefore call on the Commission to take note of the new difficulties and to propose a directive.
Perhaps we must also stress the fact that the Treaty of Amsterdam has a protocol on the system of public service broadcasting in the Member States.
The protocol is an extract from the Treaty of Amsterdam which lays down, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, that the Member States are responsible for defining and organising these tasks, and for financing them, provided this does not undermine competition.
In this area as well, state aid is obviously important and we must highlight and maintain it.
That is why all of us here today, and my group in particular, believe that it is necessary to review the need for a directive.
As far as media coverage is concerned, it is impossible to avoid the question of content.
A specific characteristic of the market and of competition clearly exists, a specific characteristic relating to content, to creation and which also relates to publishing in particular.
Let me remind you of the situation in France - which is of concern to us - where there is concentration in the publishing industry within the new markets which have recently become established.
This specific characteristic should be taken into account and we should also stress the urgent nature of this situation.
To sum up, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we hope that what the Charter says on pluralism will be respected by the Convention and that the latter will be able to safeguard this pluralism.
Mr President, the media system has developed alongside democracy, but our impression is that there has for some time been growing conflict between the two and that there is a tendency towards concentration, the result of which is, in practice, less democracy.
The media has an extraordinary influence over society, but I believe we have to realise that there is only one way to resist the domination of North American investments in the media and advertising industry and that does not involve media concentration in European Union countries.
In Italy, the President was moved to send a message to parliament on the matter, but I would also like to point out that the highest moral authority, Pope John Paul II, has called for clear, fair rules guaranteeing pluralism, freedom and participation, to avoid the abuse of what are extremely powerful tools having a devastating impact on people's consciences and society.
I would, however, like to point out that this issue affects other sectors as well as politics.
During the recent hearing organised by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats on television without frontiers, a reporter noted that television is exacerbating the commercialisation of sport and the concentration of advertising resources.
Thus, there is a growing divide between the few wealthy sports and the poor sports, and the link between television, advertising, sports rights and the owners of the major football teams is becoming increasingly close.
Public television networks can provide alternatives to these tendencies, but we all know that, in the world in which we live, in a liberal society, private, commercial television companies play a major role.
However, this role must not be allowed to develop in such a way that the extraordinary power to influence public opinion is concentrated in the hands of a few.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, media freedom and independence do not go well with accumulated economic power, not to mention monopolies.
This is especially true when one is dealing with political power wielded by a head of government.
The name to mention here is Berlusconi.
The Italian media tycoon and, in one and the same person, prime minister, along with Mr Murdoch and Herr Kirch, have given the champions of unfettered press freedom a lesson in fear.
That the Kirch empire has collapsed can be of little comfort in view of the pressure exerted on public service broadcasters by commercial enterprises - I am referring to the cost of rights to sporting events among other things - and in view of an increasing concentration of regional, national and worldwide media with growing cross-border involvements.
Media concentration to an illicit degree endangers diversity and pluralism of opinion and the promotion of cultural diversity.
Volume 44 of 'Media Research' a series of treatises published by the North Rhine-Westphalia Media Institute, has come out in the last couple of days; it gives a powerful description of media concentration's adverse effects on society's democratic and cultural foundations.
It also has to be said without equivocation that the rule of law in Italy is in danger.
It has already had the worst of the fight.
All this leads to only one conclusion, namely that European regulations are needed to limit concentration in the media, because national law does not apply outside the borders of states, or also because - as in Italy - the effort is not even being made.
Reference has already been made to the way the Italian State President's profound concern has led him to call for an Italian law to deprive the prime minister of practical political control over the services of the public-sector broadcaster RAI, and to restrict his power as a private individual over the media.
Berlusconi is in every respect a special case, and one that it must be hoped will remain unique, involving an array of legal actions relating to tax evasion, forged documents, perjury, payments from slush funds, the bribing of judges and similar things, not all of which have been brought to a conclusion.
We therefore call on the Convention to impose a constitutional ban on any such agglomeration of power, which is positively indecent.
Even the Pope - or so we have heard - is advocating regulations to safeguard pluralism and freedom of opinion.
That, Mr Prodi, Commissioners, is why I say it is now time for you to take some action!
Mr President, I take issue with most of my colleagues who have spoken in the debate so far, as regards their desire to rush into some form of undefined new directive or regulation on so-called concentration and media ownership.
As Mr Byrne pointed out to us in an admirably clear intervention, there is no treaty base for it.
How is it going to be defined?
How far do you intervene politically in issues of media concentration in areas that, as the Commissioner pointed out very clearly, cut across a whole range of other weapons the Commission has at its disposal to regulate monopoly power, a word that has been freely bandied around this Chamber this evening?
If there is monopoly power commercially, then the instruments are there to tackle it and they should be used.
I wonder how many colleagues who have contributed to this debate this evening have actually bothered to read the new package that regulates electronic communications.
Mr Watson, who opened the debate, probably has not, because if you look at that regulation - and I was one of the colleagues that worked on it very closely - you will see that it anticipates the fact that we will have convergence and that the big issues that are opened up in the world of convergence are about controlling access to channels.
There are provisions in this regulation to open up access, to make access available on fair reasonable and non-discriminatory terms, again key words we should be thinking about in any context, particularly in media.
It also makes provision for public service broadcasting, an issue that we ought to be discussing more in this context, to allow governments to open up channels where they feel that public channels should be conveyed to the market place.
Those issues are already there.
Do not ignore them.
I agree with what Mrs Hieronymi said.
Certainly we should invite the Commission to look at this problem, but the last thing we should do is to anticipate the results of that analysis.
Mr President, the question of media pluralism is an important subject, which affects the very essence of the values that provide a basis for our work in Europe. This is for reasons that all of us have very much in mind obviously.
Without pluralism, there is no opposition, no freedom and, therefore, no democracy.
Without pluralism, the freedom of audiovisual and cinematographic creation would be jeopardised and therefore the cultural identity of Europe would be at risk.
It is crucial, therefore, to ensure that the principles of diversity, pluralism and independence of the media are applied in the Member States and in the candidate countries.
Media pluralism concerns the broadcasting of information, television and the Internet as well as audiovisual creation.
In a constantly changing media environment, the presence of public service television channels and private television channels, as well as restrictions on mergers and acquisitions between commercial players, are essential in order to maintain audiovisual pluralism and cultural diversity.
Equally, we must ensure that sufficiently diverse information is broadcast from both public and private sources over all media platforms.
That is why the Commission should carry out a thorough assessment of the media situation in each candidate country and in each Member State.
A Green Paper was drafted on this issue in 1997.
Today, developments in communication technologies, the key role played by the Internet in spreading information and cable television are phenomena which are pushing us to look again at the issue of media concentration.
It is very important, for example, that the Commission begins work as soon as possible on resolving the problems raised by the lack of transparency in granting television licences in the Member States and in the candidate countries.
Once this assessment has been carried out, the Commission will be able to decide to establish competition rules ensuring media pluralism in the event of this proving necessary.
Freedom of expression is fragile and can only be guaranteed if genuine media plurality exists, and this is something we must all monitor on a regular basis.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, do we need legally binding European legislation to guarantee the pluralism of the media or not?
That is the question.
I say yes, we do.
And I would add immediately that it is extremely important that, in future, under the new Constitution, the European Commission should have sole power of initiative. We must not poach on the territory of others.
However, we are not discussing forcing the European Commission to do what it cannot and does not want to.
The point is that there is now clearly a legal gap. We must admit it and ensure that it is filled.
There is already a legal gap thanks to the remarkable, impressive technological innovations that have taken place, but it will be further widened when the Union enlarges to 25 Member States and, in particular, as Mr Watson said just now, when it establishes a new Constitution shortly.
The Constitution will include articles which are part of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, Article 11 of which enshrines the pluralism of the media.
Now, if we do not introduce new legislation, we ourselves - Parliament, Commission and the Council - will be in danger of actually promoting violation of this Constitution, which we all want to adopt soon.
In other words, the only thing we cannot do is nothing.
If - and this is something which I bitterly, very bitterly regret - one of the Member States of the Union ranks below the Republic of Benin, below position number 40 in the world in terms of media pluralism, that is not a matter solely or primarily for political dispute within the country concerned, and I am talking about my own country, Italy.
No, in my view, it calls for analysis on the part of the European Union followed by the adoption of political, institutional and legal measures - the substance of which will be for the Commission to decide.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if we were to accept the suggestions made in this Chamber by speakers such as Mr Segni, for example, and hold one particular person responsible for all the evils of the media sector, we should somehow have to conclude that the deer and other animals which invaded the runway at Strasbourg airport today were, in actual fact, extras from the Mediaset networks which had been recruited and enlisted to prevent this debate from taking place!
That is not the case!
The matter we are discussing is so much more complex and problematic that we must rather be aware that the speed of technological progress is leading, particularly in the field of communications, to the development of new ways of transferring knowledge, new forms of peaceful coexistence of peoples and new lifestyles and mentalities.
In other words, communications generate culture, and culture is transmitted via communications.
One might say that all our lives are now locked in a communication mechanism requiring a complete reassessment of all our basic points of reference.
The huge increase in information sources and the failure to distinguish between their levels of authoritativeness, the progressive replacement of interpersonal relations with a mediated approach and the expression of opinions on the basis of opinion polls which are not founded on fact, are all factors which ultimately lead to various forms of dissociation, which influence our very beliefs and lives.
The recent events in Italy were not the result of this very complex issue of the media.
Rather, what happened was that the left, which had controlled state television in recent years, went so far as to attempt to influence the last elections and, in its endeavours to hold the sword of Damocles over its political opponent's head, put off the issue of regulating the media sector indefinitely and made it very difficult for the matter to be resolved.
Absence of control and supervision has never brought guarantees or freedom, as many would have us believe. It ultimately fosters the indiscriminate use of extremely powerful tools which, if abused, have devastating effects on people's consciences and society.
I therefore call upon the Commission to be the guarantor of this principle of freedom and to propose an appropriate course of action to Parliament and the Council, which could, for example, be the subject of another Green Paper.
Mr President, we pride ourselves on the way in which the principle of competition oils the wheels of the economic system and it must not be allowed to weaken the most vital component of democracy, by which I mean sources of information, and undermine the principle of political competition.
Secondly, in this age of electronic democracy, we should all be investing in guarantees to safeguard our long tradition of democratic values and, first and foremost, the separation of media power from economic power.
May I, therefore, say that this motion should be adopted unanimously and point out that passing legislative and other support measures is a top priority for the democratic future of Europe, that there has been an unwarranted delay in taking action since the Green Paper was published, that the measures required need to be incorporated into general policy on audiovisual media, that we must accept that the traditional rules of market competition are inadequate and that we need an independent competitive network with its sights set on real pluralism and that, for these purposes, restrictions on concentration are compatible with Community law.
All the speakers present in Parliament have now spoken.
I have received six motions for resolutions
Article 11(2) of the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights states that 'the freedom and pluralism of the media shall be respected'
In fact, what is more fundamental in a democracy than the freedom to communicate and receive information?
Yet, in Europe today, media concentration, exacerbated by technological developments, means that this crucial media pluralism is at risk, if not already compromised in some cases.
It is high time that the Commission tackled the issue and ensured, particularly in the television sector, that there are many diverse operators, as it has already done so in many other sectors.
Although the existing founding treaties do not provide a sufficient legal basis for this essential regulation, it is now crucial that the Convention works on a new constitutional basis to ensure media plurality.
This is not enough, however, as the plurality of private operators alone cannot fulfil the fundamental role of information in a modern democracy, nor safeguard cultural diversity.
That is why we must reaffirm the importance of public service broadcasting.
I am thinking not only of national public service television channels, but also local channels, whose value in terms of providing social interaction and restoring social links is indisputable.
(Speech abbreviated in accordance with Rule 120(7) of the Rules of Procedure)
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0344/2002) by Mr Medina Ortega, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to the advertising and sponsorship of tobacco products (COM(2001) 283 - C5-0274/2001 - 2001/0119(COD))
I hope the Members who were still on their way here will be able to attend.
Mr President, I wish to begin by saying that I am pleased to be here today to present the Commission's proposal for a directive on tobacco advertising and sponsorship.
It has been a long time since the Commission adopted this proposal - 18 months to be precise.
It would be an understatement to say that I am disappointed with the slow progress on this proposal so far.
There have been delaying tactics, misinformation and, very often, misleading statements.
It is a great pity that the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market was unable to work more quickly, in contrast to the much quicker response from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, whose members are the true experts in the European Parliament on public health and consumer protection.
They at least clearly understood the importance and urgency of this proposal.
Worldwide, almost 5 million people die every year from tobacco-related diseases.
This is two and a half times the number of deaths from AIDS.
Of those 5 million half a million are European - the equivalent of the population of Copenhagen.
Advertising plays a major role in promoting tobacco use, especially amongst young people.
The tobacco industry needs new recruits to replace those whose consumption of the deadly product has caused their early deaths.
It is against this background that I invite you to look at the present proposal.
This directive is important for the operation of the single market.
Without it the single market for print media, radio and the Internet cannot be guaranteed on account of variations in national legislation on tobacco advertising across the Member States.
The proposal is intended to replace the previous directive on tobacco advertising and sponsorship, annulled by the European Court of Justice two years ago.
The previous directive included a ban on all forms of tobacco advertising and sponsorship.
The Court considered that this general ban did not have the legal support of the Treaty.
However, the Court was not entirely negative in its ruling.
Far from it.
It helpfully confirmed that a directive prohibiting certain forms of advertising and sponsorship could be adopted on the basis of Article 95 of the Treaty.
The new proposal therefore follows very closely the guidelines set out in the Court's ruling.
The logic behind the present proposal is clear: all Member States have adopted national rules to regulate the advertising and sponsorship of tobacco products.
These regulations, unsurprisingly, vary considerably between Member States.
This divergence has, ironically you might say, been exacerbated by the annulment of the previous directive.
This gives rise to increasing barriers to the free movement between Member States of products and services that serve as support for such advertising and sponsorship.
We aim to eliminate these barriers by harmonising the rules relating to the advertising of tobacco products and related sponsorship to the extent possible in the light of the Court's ruling.
The proposal foresees a general ban on tobacco advertising in the press.
This is an important vector for tobacco promotion, and one that has strong cross-border implications.
The proposal also includes a ban on tobacco advertising on the Internet.
Advertising of tobacco products via radio and the sponsorship of radio programmes by tobacco companies would also be banned on the same lines as television advertising under the television without frontiers directive.
Finally, the proposal deals with sponsorship - banning this for events or activities with cross-border implications.
Overall, the proposal has a much more limited scope than the previous directive.
I know that many of you regret this and I sympathise with this view.
I make no secret of the fact that I would have preferred to present a proposal for a complete ban on advertising for tobacco products.
But, unfortunately, the legal framework does not allow us to go that far.
We have to live in the real world. We have to recognise the legal constraints.
Our common concern must be to ensure that this new directive can and will stand its ground against any possible future court challenge and to eliminate the market distortion by harmonising current national rules, whilst at the same time promoting public health.
A final thought for now.
This proposal has been very carefully constructed.
Any weakening of its legal position would open the door to challenge which, if successful, would play directly into the hands of the tobacco industry.
We simply cannot afford to let that happen.
Mr President, Commissioner Byrne has made an enormous effort to bring forward a proposal for a directive in a field in which the Court of Justice had rescinded the previous directive on the complete prohibition of tobacco advertising.
In terms of health, I believe that the Community is in a situation worthy of Kafka, because, although we have competence in the field of animal health - from stabling to feedingstuffs and transport - in contrast, in practice our competences in the field of health are minimal. In other words, the European Union has hardly any competences in the field of human health.
It is able to adopt certain measures, certain recommendations, certain promotional initiatives, such as cooperation between States and with international organisations, but when it comes to legislative harmonisation, in practice we are faced with deadlock.
The Commission has been intelligent enough to try to take maximum advantage of the conclusions of the Court of Justice, what I would call the obiter dicta of the Court of Justice, in the judgment which rescinded the previous Directive on tobacco advertising.
And from the point of view of the Committee on Legal Affairs, the rapporteur in particular has had the greatest sympathy for the efforts of the Commission and Commissioner Byrne to bring forward this proposal for a directive which, as he has said, is much more modest than the previous one.
Nevertheless, the rapporteur must acknowledge that there have been enormous difficulties within the Committee on Legal Affairs and, in order to make the negotiation of this directive possible, has had to accept a series of compromise amendments that make up the current text, which has been adopted by the Committee on Legal Affairs.
We do not yet know what the result of the votes next Wednesday on this issue will be.
My impression is that, at the moment, this House is very much divided, since, as some Members claim, certain amendments may even weaken the legal basis proposed by the Commission and, at this moment, specifically, the opinion, for example, of the rapporteur for the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy - who I believe we will hear next - is, of course, opposed to the introduction of amendments.
I have the impression that certain of the amendments, at least, are justified, since they are intended to correct some of the aspects of the directive which would benefit from improvements.
For example, a generalised extension of the prohibition of the use of certain trade marks could prejudice companies which, in reality, do not produce tobacco; all that happens is that some of the trade marks coincide with those of other companies who do produce it.
I believe that each of these amendments will have to be studied carefully.
I share Mr Byrne's concern at the delay which has taken place within the Committee on Legal Affairs.
We felt obliged to hold a hearing as a result of the enormous disparity in opinions which had been expressed in committee and, at that hearing, I must acknowledge and point out that the majority of the members of the Committee on Legal Affairs were critical of the Commission's proposals.
The rapporteur has therefore felt obliged to do some rather deft work, trying to bring together positions in order to produce a first text that would reach the plenum in this House.
It will therefore be this House which really decides next Wednesday on the fate of each of these amendments.
Certain subsequent amendments have been presented, which the rapporteur considers to be acceptable in principle - the amendment by Mrs Hautala, which is intended to strengthen the Commission's legal basis by means of a recital.
I hope that, next Wednesday, regardless of what happens with each of the amendments in the different votes, the text of the directive as a whole can be approved.
In other words, I hope that the report is adopted so that the negotiation may continue.
Since we are undergoing a co-decision procedure, we all have the opportunity to carry on correcting the deficiencies which may be contrary to the objective of being sure that this new proposal for a directive may pass the test of a further hearing before the Court of Justice, which will undoubtedly take place, because in the field of tobacco there are always hearings before the Court of Justice.
The Commission can rest assured that I have an entirely constructive approach towards the object of achieving a final result in relation to this.
But I will say again that this is a democratic House and the opinions of the Members vary widely.
I even have the impression that there are significant differences between the national delegations within the various parties.
The task of the rapporteur in this case must therefore be one of coordination, of good will, if you like, and above all of coordinating the results obtained next Wednesday in this House with the good intention of the Commission and the Commissioner of adopting a Community regulation in the field of health.
In any event, it should be remembered that the inclusion of a clause on health in the forthcoming European Constitution is still to be dealt with, and I have the impression that the work of the Convention is not moving in that direction at the moment, which is rather worrying.
Mr President, our draftsperson, Mrs ?alliori, has been held up by fog at Strasbourg airport and has asked me, with your permission, to stand in for her.
Every second, someone dies as a direct result of smoking.
This adds up to over 3 million victims a year worldwide, 500 000 of whom are European citizens.
Forty-two per cent of the Community population smokes and they are starting younger and younger.
Sixty per cent of smokers start smoking at 13 and 90% start before they are 18.
The gender gap between smokers is narrowing, with an increase in the number of girls smoking and 500 000 babies are born prematurely and underweight because their mothers smoke.
Children in homes in which both parents smoke run a 72% greater risk of respiratory diseases such as asthma.
These are just some of the reasons why legislators in the Member States of the European Union have felt compelled to restrict tobacco product advertising rights, in order to protect public interests in general and the health of European citizens and young people in particular.
The World Health Organisation framework convention currently being negotiated, which should be completed within the next few months, takes the same approach, stressing that a tobacco advertising and sponsorship ban is one of the most urgent political rules which needs to be applied internationally.
As the House knows, this Commission proposal replaces Directive 43, the directive which, albeit after ten years' negotiations, was finally passed by the European Parliament and adopted by the Council in 1998 but, unfortunately, annulled by the Court of Justice in October 2000.
The purpose of the directive being debated today, eighteen months after the Commission submitted its proposal, is to approximate the various laws, regulations and administrative provisions adopted by the Member States, in order to remove obstacles to the internal market and safeguard the free movement of goods and services and this is in keeping with the rules set out in the directive.
The present directive, which takes account of current legislation in the Member States and the case law of the Court of Justice, adopts parts of the previous directive and bans advertising in printed media, on the Internet and on the radio, together with sponsorship of events with cross-border effects.
It also bans the free distribution of tobacco products, but does not cover indirect advertising.
However, unlike the previous directive, it is not based on the principle of a total ban on all forms of advertising and sponsorship.
I should point out here, however, that the Commission has submitted this more restricted proposal, which takes account of the legal framework set by the Court of Justice, in tandem with a proposal for a recommendation containing the elements which, as I said, have been excluded from this directive.
Unfortunately, the Committee on Legal Affairs has adopted 25 amendments which could lead to further annulment by the Court of Justice and which restrict the scope of the directive still further.
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the other hand, agreed with my proposal not to submit any proposed amendments and voted unanimously in favour of the Commission proposal.
Ladies and gentlemen, our decision on Wednesday will have tremendous political implications because it concerns an issue on which the European Parliament and the Council have already expressed a view and taken a decision.
I therefore call on you to vote against all the amendments by the Committee on Legal Affairs.
This is the only way to guarantee a fast procedure and, more importantly, to ensure that we take a decisive, firm, legally tenable step towards a Community policy to control smoking.
According to the scientific data available, this will promote high health standards, especially among the young, who are not just the main target group; they are the very future of Europe.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want to try, in these three minutes, to set out, at least fragmentarily, my view of this problem.
The protection of health and the curbing of tobacco use are certainly important political commitments.
It is right that their significance should have been so extensively set out today, but every political level has its own specific responsibility.
Now it is the case that there is no legislative function specifically applicable to this at European level.
Rather, Article 95 must always be applied, as it has been here today, which means that it must first be considered whether the internal market is affected, be it by such things as distortions of competition, trade barriers and similar.
Only when this has been found to be the case can - and must - the protection of health be taken into account in this context, and, if these conditions are fulfilled, there is no dispute about it.
It is well known that it was because of breaches of these principles that the ECJ suspended the former directive that banned advertising.
Venues are in competition with each other for large-scale events with a cross-border impact, so there should be rules on this, and, as that is where distortions occur, we agree with this part of the proposal.
Rules on radio broadcasts across borders are also acceptable. The same goes for the Internet, although it is not clear to me how this can in practice be made to work where the material is input in third countries.
Such a ban on newspapers and magazines would, however, not be permissible.
As we have heard in the consultations, the proportion of copies sold across borders is small to the point of invisibility in relation to the total print run, and these copies sold across borders are, moreover, not in cross-border competition.
This means that there is no conflict affecting the internal market, and that such a regulation would not be successful.
The Committee on Legal Affairs' proposal therefore provides for this part of the Commission proposal not to be accepted.
Reference is constantly made - the Commissioner has just done so - to the ECJ's comments on newspapers.
To put it very briefly, my view is that the ECJ distinguishes between, on the one hand, advertising media that are strictly immobile - billboards would be a typical example of this - where the very nature of the thing excludes the possibility of cross-border competition, and then explains that, on the other hand, something else might apply to other media such as newspapers, and that this does not have to be excluded as a matter of principle.
That is right, but one must add what the ECJ said at another point in its ruling, that distortions actually have to exist, that they have to be perceptible, that they may not merely be alleged to exist - and that is simply not the case with newspapers.
To say this is not to take a formalistic approach towards jurisdiction and certainly not to indulge in any sort of legal nitpicking.
I believe this question of law to be eminently political in nature, and would simply remind you of the importance that the Convention attaches to the question of the division of powers, and of the discussions about the possibility of members of national parliaments making their views on these questions known in a forum set up for them.
We should be putting down a marker and, as legislators ourselves, respecting the powers of our counterparts in the national parliaments, rather than again leaving this matter to the ECJ.
This will also enable us to dismantle prejudices against Brussels' centralism and dirigisme.
I cannot end without warmly thanking Mr Medina Ortega for his efforts at reaching a compromise, and, in particular, expressing my congratulations on the legislative quality of his text.
Mr President, measures taken by the European Union to combat the spread of smoking go back a long way, as do the legal wrangling and the case law of the Court of Justice and I think we should make sure we learn from these experiences.
The proposed directive seeks to protect public health but takes the ban on the distortion of competition as its legal basis.
This ambivalent situation needs to be borne in mind by everyone championing more effective ways of protecting health from the spread in the use of tobacco which, unfortunately, does not have its own article in the Treaty.
It is therefore only logical that the new proposal should be more modest when it comes to protecting public health than the annulled directive, which also included indirect advertising.
The Committee on Legal Affairs felt the ban needed a cross-border dimension, not just for sponsorship, but also for the press, in order to strengthen its validity.
By definition, national advertising and sponsorships do not affect the internal market.
The legal basis selected only allows advertising to be regulated where it impacts on the internal market.
Consequently, printed matter circulating solely within the territory of one Member State has no cross-border effects and cannot create any obstacle to the internal market or serious distortion of competition.
This is clear both from the proposed arrangements for event sponsorships and from the fact that the proposal for a directive makes no reference whatsoever to outside advertising of tobacco products or advertising in cinemas.
We know that the Committee on Legal Affairs has expressed reservations about certain amendments from the purely legal standpoint.
Mrs Hautala, on the other hand, is operating on a different wavelength altogether and has called for health protection arrangements to be strengthened.
Given that no one here is against health protection measures, the bottom line is that the two sides have to calmly decide which amendments are needed in order to rescue this as a valid directive.
Mr President, there are mainly two elements of relevance here: one is content and the other is procedure.
Let us focus on content first, because it is obviously all too easy to overlook this aspect in a legal discussion of this kind.
Is a ban on tobacco advertising effective if the aim is to prevent its use?
Yes, of course it is.
Hardly anyone takes up smoking because they like it.
They do so for other reasons.
They may take it up because of peer pressure in the playground, children of parents who smoke take up smoking, and people take up smoking because they associate it with a certain image.
They want to emulate the man making his way through the jungle in a rowing boat, for example, or that other man on horseback somewhere in the wild west with pleasant music playing in the background.
This is why people take up smoking.
Image has everything to do with it.
This is why a ban on tobacco advertising is good.
It is a legitimate product, so why should you ban it?
Last month, an overwhelming majority of people in this House voted in favour of banning advertising for pharmaceutical products, but, unlike tobacco, these are produced to make people better.
I am in favour of legalising cannabis, but I would not dream of allowing this product to be advertised.
So the problem is more complex than at first sight.
As it happens, there was already an opinion from the European Parliament - and also from the Council, in fact.
In 1998 we stated that we were in favour of a ban on tobacco advertising.
In this connection, the Court said that we had gone too far, with good reason, in my view.
This was completely unrelated to tobacco but had everything to do with the question how far we, as a Union, could go in respect of the Member States.
I believe that the Commission was right to say: okay, this is what Parliament and the Council wanted, they wanted to go as far as possible.
The Commission subsequently consulted the judgment by the Court, and also the opinion of the Advocate General, and copied almost verbatim what was suggested.
I therefore believe that the Commission has done a sterling job, and I shall therefore advise the majority of my group to reject the amendments tabled by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
These do not appear to be essential in order to make the directive more acceptable.
I should like to make two final observations.
First of all, I do think we ought to be careful not to start a smear campaign against the use of tobacco, for example by introducing a complete ban on smoking in public places, or by banning children's toys, chocolate cigarettes, liquorice pipes and suchlike. This is taking matters too far, and by doing so we would also lose our allies in the fight against tobacco.
Finally, I should like to take this opportunity to once again draw your attention to an unacceptable anomaly, namely that we are discouraging the use of tobacco products on the one hand and are continuing to heavily subsidise tobacco production in Europe on the other.
Mr President, the problem we have when we talk about tobacco is that we in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy speak from the point of view of public health and not from the point of view of the possible disadvantages of banning tobacco advertising for the internal market.
We therefore prefer the directive which was approved in 1998.
As the Commissioner has already said, five million people die each year from diseases related to smoking.
Other Members have said thousands of young people start smoking every year, with all the consequences that addiction has in store for them.
Several studies have demonstrated very clearly the effects of this advertising and the sponsorship of certain sporting events in terms of young people starting to smoke earlier.
In fact, 60% of smokers, according to the statistics, begin before they reach 13 years of age and around 90% before 18 years.
We therefore much preferred the 1998 Directive, which unfortunately was rescinded by the European Court.
In the case in hand, various Members in the Environment Committee have decided that they are not going to present amendments to the Commission's proposal because it is better to have a limited directive than no directive at all.
We are therefore only presenting one amendment, which proposes that, in accordance with the Treaty, the Member States should retain competences and be able to regulate this type of issue and even go further.
Furthermore, the draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment points out very clearly that this is one step and that surely, in the future, the European Commission will be able to present proposals on indirect advertising, on the control of expenditure on advertising and on tobacco vending machines.
In short, Mr President, it is better to have a limited directive in this area than no directive at all.
Mr President, it was mentioned here that the previous attempt to achieve a wholesale ban on tobacco advertising at European Union level was overturned by the Court of Justice and it is indeed interesting to read that when this decision was given Advocate General Fenelli said that there was good reason to suppose that a ban on advertising would save around 38 000 lives in the European Union every year.
We might also say that there are very good grounds for bringing in this directive now, even though it is rather less comprehensive in its legal scope than before.
We must proceed in such a way that the Commission's original proposal is approved in its entirety as far as is possible, and I was very glad that the Commission has shown its support for the cross-party amendment to Recital 1 which we have proposed in this House.
Its purpose is to clarify the fact that indirect advertising remains within the competence of the Member States and that they may enact advertising bans in this area.
In general we want to protect the national bans on tobacco advertising.
It is with great sorrow that it has to be said that the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market have watered the Commission proposal down totally.
It is also to be hoped that every single amendment accepted by the Committee on Legal Affairs will be rejected in this House, because they complicate the issue in many ways.
They obscure the proposal's legal basis.
They completely rule out the possibility of restricting tobacco advertising in the press and on the radio.
They hamper global efforts to achieve a ban on tobacco advertising, and they also allow the possibility of the indirect advertising of tobacco.
I would especially like to focus attention on Amendments Nos 17 and 24, which are extremely dangerous.
Hopefully, too, the rapporteur will return to his original position and reject these amendments, which were accepted as compromises by the Committee on Legal Affairs, as they are not compromises at all: they just make this directive utterly pointless.
Mr President, this new directive outlaws tobacco advertising in the printed media in the whole of Europe and will also prohibit the advertising of tobacco products on radio and on the internet.
Equally, sponsorship by tobacco companies of events or activities involving several Member States will be outlawed.
As EU legislators we must bring forward proposals which will help to protect the health of our citizens and I believe that the dangers for our health from cigarette smoking must be vigorously highlighted at every opportunity.
In fact we have a moral obligation to do more than to warn young people, in particular teenagers, of the acute dangers of cigarette smoking for our health.
A recent survey has suggested that child smoking in Germany alone has increased by up to 50%.
The cigarette industry claimed that their cigarette products are for adults, yet every piece of practical evidence suggests that clever marketing and advertising only results in recruiting the next generation of smokers, who are teenagers.
The budget for the European Commission to highlight the dangers of cigarette smoking is only EUR 6 million and this pales into insignificance when one looks at the staggering levels of money available to the tobacco lobby to put in place innovative pro-tobacco marketing and advertising campaigns.
We need to do more to spell out clearly to young people the brutal consequences for one's health from cigarette smoking - that three thousand people in Europe die every day from cigarette smoking.
This means that a half a million citizens die needlessly in Europe each year because of an addiction to tobacco products.
Cigarette smoking is the single biggest cause of premature death and illness in the whole of the European Union.
A recent study shows that American male smokers lose 13 years of life to the habit of cigarette smoking and that woman smokers lose 14 and a half years of life from smoking.
If we are going to put in place comprehensive marketing campaigns to warn young people of the dangers of smoking, we need the necessary financial resources to oversee such a programme.
The Commission, Parliament and the EU governments must substantially increase the financial budget for public health campaigns which highlight to teenagers the real dangers of smoking.
Preventing tobacco-related illnesses would do more to help the citizens of the Union than any other life-saving measure, and tobacco companies are wrong to claim that advertising does not promote smoking but only promotes brand loyalty for a legal product.
Advertising does have an influence in promoting smoking; that is why all Member States in Europe have rules which restrict or ban tobacco advertising in some shape or form.
Advertising for other legally sold products including pharmaceuticals and alcohol is similarly restricted.
This directive does not mean that Member States cannot bring in more stringent measures to curb cigarette smoking if they so wish.
Matters falling outside the remit of directives, such as indirect advertising or billboards and cinema advertising, remain within the competence of the individual Member States.
Mr President, it is a fact that tobacco advertising encourages young people to take up smoking and stops people who already smoke from giving up.
Customer relations of this kind do, however, take their toll.
Given the harmful effects smoking has on health, including for non-smokers due to passive smoking, our group is in favour of a total ban on advertising for tobacco products.
These products are dangerous and can, upon lighting up and inhalation, cause serious diseases which can even prove fatal.
We are therefore very disappointed with the Commission's new proposal.
Although we realise that, given the judgment by the Court of Justice, the Commission's options are very limited, this proposal largely overshoots its goal, namely to protect public health.
I shall thus reluctantly endorse the Commission proposal without any further amendments.
This is at present the most viable option in the fight against tobacco advertising.
Six months ago, we in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy held an extensive discussion on this topic.
It is therefore beyond me why the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market should still be tabling all kinds of amendments which will ultimately frustrate the coming into being of this legislation.
If these amendments are adopted, the chances are that the Court will once again declare the directive invalid.
I should, however, like to urge the European Commission to continue its search for ways of reducing the use of tobacco, particularly where young people are concerned.
It is incomprehensible that we should remove all kinds of less dangerous products from the market, but not tobacco.
Once again, the use of tobacco is a euphemism for the injudicious incineration of dangerous carcinogenic substances.
If this involved other products, we would have banned them a long time ago.
I cannot imagine that we would bring toys into circulation which claim 5 million victims annually.
Or that we would accept other products in food which result in 5 million deaths annually, but we do turn a blind eye where tobacco products are concerned.
This is an example of extreme inconsistency.
This is nothing to do with the precautionary principle.
We know that smoking has harmful effects such as these, and this is why we should simply introduce a complete ban on this advertising.
Mr President , Mr Medina Ortega's report, although insufficient, does in fact review the decision to cancel the 1997 directive on tobacco, and we welcome this.
Tobacco, which kills hundreds of Europeans every day, is a scourge that we must combat in the name of protecting the health of our fellow citizens.
We will not be satisfied with half measures.
Either tobacco is a deadly poison and everything must be done to reduce its use, even eradicate it totally, or tobacco is - mistakenly - believed to be like any other ordinary consumer item and so, there are no grounds to legislate.
In fact, because of the persistence of these opposing views, which Mr Maaten pointed out, people are now beginning to say that Parliament is supporting the growth of a product that it is repressing in other ways.
The text presented by Mr Medina Ortega is heading in the right direction, but the proposed amendments weaken it considerably and we reject them.
It is heading in the right direction because it has been proven that the ban on advertising helped to cut smoking and that there is indeed a link between advertising and excessive consumption.
Strangely enough, the amendments give cross-border problems more attention than is their due.
Thus, some Members seem to think that the existence of borders can have positive economic effects, whereas in many cases, it is the same individuals who are recommending the same borders be broadly opened up, regardless of the consequences.
Today, given our extensive knowledge about the damaging effects of tobacco, it would be criminal to make no attempt to deter increasingly young consumers from becoming addicted to a product the advertisements for which boast of its benefits.
Negligence, indifference and a lack of political courage in the area of public health sow the seeds of crimes against humanity.
It is this irresponsibly lax approach that caused the contaminated blood scandal in France and the mad cow disease scandal in Great Britain.
Today, no one can say that they are not aware and this means that everyone is to be held responsible.
That is why we shall support Mr Medina Ortega's report.
Mr President, Commissioner, every time we discuss tobacco in this Chamber all hell is let loose. There are divisions within groups, relations between committees are soured and Members who are usually friends treat each other with mistrust.
Tobacco is a divisive subject for debate because of the many different sides there are to the argument.
There is the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, which, it would seem, is not particularly concerned with public health and gives more importance to the internal market rules. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy would appear not to be aware of the fact that there is no legal basis for proposing a public health policy.
It is all a pretence. In actual fact, both committees are quite aware of all the facts, but this has now degenerated into role playing.
In any case, whatever line we take, we cannot disregard the fact that Directive 98/43 was annulled by the Court of Justice because it lacked an appropriate legal basis.
Therefore, we now have the chance to remedy the situation, if only in part.
Indeed, as the Commissioner himself admitted with great frankness a few minutes ago, the Commission's latest proposal is decidedly inadequate to provide the kind of protection of public health demanded by the Committee on the Environment.
In any case, as it stands, it seems to be limiting its demands, to be prepared to settle for very little in order to avoid another rejection by the Court of Justice because of the innovations it proposes, although they are very well balanced.
As others have said and I want to reiterate, it would still be an appreciable result if we were to go home with the Commission's proposal.
As on past occasions, a little is better than nothing.
As shadow rapporteur, I too have recommended that my group vote for the Commission's proposal without amendments.
We will see what happens tomorrow.
The important thing is that we do not start proposing once again to cut Community aid to tobacco growers on the pretext of protecting their health or, now, to ban advertising.
It is the smokers - and I stress, the smokers - not the growers who must be the targets of these measures to persuade people to give up smoking.
