Traceability is a facilitating measure, but it is not based on risk assessment.
To go further than the current wording of the recital is not appropriate and the Commission cannot support these amendments.
Amendment Nos 11 and 12 refer to traceability and labelling requirements for processed products and acceptance would again impinge on the agreement reached under the proposal on GM food and feed which covers such products.
The second parts of Amendment Nos 8 and 13 seek to extend the time-period for the holding of traceability information from five years to ten years.
Even if traceability were still possible after ten years this information would be of no practical value.
Amendment No 20 addresses the reporting obligations of the Commission, which are duplicated in Amendment No 3.
Reporting obligations are already reflected in Article 12 of the common position and further requirements are not necessary.
In terms of coexistence, Amendment No 16 in a similar manner to an amendment on the proposal GM food and feed, seeks to introduce text to address this issue into a new Article 26a of Directive 2001/18/EC.
However, the text of Amendment No 16 is not in line with that proposed for this new Article under the political agreement for the proposal on GM food and feed and therefore we cannot accept it.
Finally, Amendment No 21 refers to the date of application of the regulation.
It should be noted that the applicability of the regulation was referred to in the Council and Commission statement, accompanying the common position.
In this regard the Commission points out that Member States have already endorsed a Community format for attribution of unique codes to GMOs based on the OECD format.
Of course the Commission will make sure that this system is accounted for in terms of new authorisations as required under Directive 2001/18/EC.
To conclude, it has been a very intensive debate on the whole issue of how the European Union should handle GMOs.
With some difficulty we have put together a system which will offer security and choice to our citizens.
I hope that the vote tomorrow will give us a workable compromise and I thank you all for the discussions we have had and for finding a good solution.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the swift entry into force of these proposals for a regulation is a precondition for the final lifting of the de facto moratorium on green genetic engineering, which has been in place for several years.
It is the current ban on growing and importing GMOs that for years has cut off Europe's scientific community, its consumers and farmers from the positive developments in the field of green genetic engineering.
Moreover we are facing complaints before the WTO from countries that wish to export genetically modified products to the EU, but may not do so because of the moratorium.
The USA has already filed a complaint.
What escapes all of those who want - often for purely ideological reasons - to prevent GMOs from being used here is the fact that genetically modified food and feed have been a reality throughout the world for some considerable time already.
And particularly where protein feed is concerned we are dependent on imports from third countries, where the growing of genetically modified plants is the order of the day.
In 2001 the EU imported over 16 million tonnes of soya from the USA and South America: in the USA the proportion of the total soya crop that is GM is 68%; in Argentina it is 100%.
This is the reality that is facing uncertain consumers and farmers in Europe, as well as a research sector that is unable to plan ahead.
Consumers and farmers treat green genetic engineering here with suspicion because they do not know what the issues are.
This is due to a policy of insufficient information, which - at least in my home country of Germany - is entirely intentional.
We are not making policy to order here.
Through these draft regulations we need to secure freedom of choice for consumers, and my group as much as any other, Mrs Scheele, is in favour of protecting human health and therefore also in favour of robust consumer protection.
But with this legislation we also need to cater for agriculture, the environment, small and medium-sized seed producers, industry, the retail food trade and many other branches of industry.
And we need a labelling requirement so as to be able at long last to assess imports from third countries properly.
To do so we need to employ reasonable, realistic thresholds, admittedly political thresholds, which are based on what is technically feasible and workable.
It is a great success, particularly for our group, that all of the other groups are now supporting the Council's common position on the limit values: 0.9% for authorised GMOs and 0.5% for GMOs that are ready for authorisation and in a backlog because of the moratorium.
The same applies to the decision that this regulation should not include provisions on seed.
Seed needs its own rules and we cannot have the coexistence issue, that is, the coexistence of genetically modified and conventional plants on agricultural land, being used as a vehicle to place a general blockade on green genetic engineering.
It was only on this condition that my group agreed to the compromise.
The Commission is now under an obligation to ensure that the de facto moratorium is not artificially prolonged by some Member States.
Madam President, I think there is cause for saying a big thank-you to Mrs Scheele for the huge efforts she has made in order to obtain a package and arrive at a compromise.
It has, I know, in large part been an uphill struggle, with a Council and a large number of Members of this Parliament not having been interested in what might be regarded as the ideal legislation.
There are still three problems with the outcome, which lead me to think that it cannot be characterised as ideal.
Firstly, I think that the limit value for labelling in the case of adventitious pollution by GMOs is still too high and, secondly, we are coming, over a period, also to accept adventitious pollution by non-authorised and unlabelled GMOs.
The third point to which I would draw attention and which I still think is a defect is that we have not obtained the best rules concerning the co-existence of GMOs and other crops.
There will now most certainly be many instances of GMO pollution, with lengthy compensation cases in their wake.
If we are not very careful, we are in danger of actually destroying the basis of ecological production and of general agricultural production throughout Europe.
In spite of these defects, we are in the position of not having any choice, and I too shall therefore support the outcome with which we have been presented, including Mrs Scheele's report.
The alternative would be far more frightening, namely that of not obtaining any rules at all.
I believe we are obtaining some sensible rules on traceability.
In that connection, I hope that Parliament will decide that data concerning transactions involving these products must be kept for ten years, and I also think it important that the results of inspections and controls carried out by the Member States should be kept in a central register so that the best possible data is always available.
Only time and the first cases of matters going wrong can reveal whether the rules on traceability have been secure enough.
It is quite crucial for me that the de facto moratorium should only be lifted when the system for developing and assigning unambiguous identifications of GMOs has been fully implemented, that is to say when the rules are in place and there is full traceability from day one. In that connection, I should like to thank Mrs WallstrÃ¶m for the assurances she gave in her speech.
I hope that European consumers who are as critical and aware as the majority of them appear to be will demand the necessary rules on co-existence from their governments, leading to action being taken nationally and the correct rules on co-existence put in place.
I also hope, moreover, that this large group of critical consumers will exert a natural restraint upon the demand for these artificially modified foods which consumers have not of course asked for but which chemicals groups and certain European governments definitely want us also to consume.
Madam President, this issue divides our Member States as it does people across the world, sometimes with an intensity comparable to religious conviction.
I confess to having no such absolute certainties.
I am a sceptic rather than an opponent of genetically modified crops.
I acknowledge that they may bring about benefits in terms of the reduced use of pesticides and herbicides, that there are no proven health risks - or none yet established - and that GM crops could, across the world, be grown in circumstances which would not permit the growth of conventional crops.
However, I see no certain gains from growing GM products in Europe.
I believe changes in European and American trade policies are likely to prove of greater benefit to developing nations, and I have fears that we could be making mistakes that will have unforeseen consequences for our environment.
A common framework of policies is needed if we are to avoid the risk of a trade war with the United States, with appeals to the WTO, and to curb the risk of divisions amongst ourselves across the European Union.
I await with interest the result of the field trials currently being carried out in my own country, to see whether they provide any evidence on the effects of biodiversity.
I am pleased to hear that the Commission's proposals for guidelines on the subject of coexistence are on schedule.
It is vital that these ensure that conventional and organic growers should not lose out as a result of this technology.
They must be protected from the risk of financial loss, and the proposals here should allow individual Member States to take significant steps to prevent cross-contamination - at least that is the hope.
There is a strong sense that we are all being driven too fast by narrow commercial interests, mainly concentrated in the United States.
As a result, I have no doubt that this is an imperfect package and we will have to return to this subject.
In the meantime consumers must be given the information to make their own choices and, if this ultimately slows the development of this technology while more research is undertaken, then that may be no bad thing.
Madam President, as we all know, this technique is deeply controversial.
We also all know that the majority of consumers do not want genetically modified food or the large-scale cultivation of genetically modified crops.
Nor is there any getting away from the fact that there is a link between the de facto moratorium and these proposals concerning labelling and traceability.
We think there are good reasons for scepticism.
The cultivation of genetically modified crops presents well documented risks to biodiversity.
There are possible health risks if sufficiently careful tests are not carried out.
There are quite clear power relations between large and multinational businesses in these industries and the farmers in various countries affected by this technology.
It is no coincidence that most GM crops cultivated around the world are resistant to a specific pesticide.
We therefore see them as having few advantages; we see cause for great caution; and we support the de facto moratorium.
Now, it is, however, a question of labelling and traceability.
We therefore choose to support making the rules as strict and as tough as possible.
It is also on this basis that we shall vote.
In that way, we can give consumers the best opportunity of choosing what they want to purchase and of opting out of what they do not want to purchase.
What is quite clear is that the European Parliament's proposals will improve these legislative proposals.
In particular, I think that the compromise reached on Mrs Scheele's report is a clear step forward.
I should also like to thank the rapporteur for the open way in which she has worked on these issues and which has given other groups the opportunity to exert some influence.
What are important in the compromise are, in particular, the wording on co-existence and the possible measures proposed to enable the Member States to avoid contamination by GMOs.
Our group would like, however, to go still further.
We are therefore going to vote in favour of the amendments by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, designed to prune the threshold values for authorised GMOs back to 0.5%.
We also find it unacceptable that, during a transitional period, genetically modified organisms otherwise not in actual fact permitted in the EU should be permitted.
It might be wondered whether these new rules are sufficient to justify lifting the moratorium.
Our answer is an emphatic no, for a lot more is required if consideration is to be given to doing so.
The rules need to be implemented in the Member States.
Clear rules on co-existence are required, and rules are also required concerning environmental liability in relation to genetically modified crops.
Only then do we think that a start can be made on the debate.
In that context, the relationship with the United States is also used as an argument, but we can never satisfy the United States in this area.
That is an illusion.
Our task is to embrace a more responsible position, both globally and in the European Union.
It is not, then, acceptable to begin by yielding ground. Instead, we must assert our right to put consumers and the environment first and to set rules as strict as we like.
Madam President, the labelling of genetically manipulated food and feed is a milestone for consumer protection.
At long last, consumers will no longer be able to be sold genetically manipulated food under false pretences.
When, as was the case in Germany, 90% of all genetically manipulated soya products were not labelled, this was tantamount to saying that consumers were incapable of making their own decisions.
Now, at long last, they are getting freedom of choice.
Foods such as oil and sugar, up to 100% of which consisted of genetically modified raw materials, finally have to be labelled.
The products of gene technology must be transparent from the field to the fork.
The threshold is admittedly too high for our liking, but it counts as a huge success that we are enabling the Member States to take measures to ensure that GM, traditional and organic farming are able to coexist.
We have also very clearly enshrined the 'polluter pays' principle here; otherwise in the long term freedom of choice would not be guaranteed at all.
Unfortunately, we in the European Parliament have no influence on the lifting of the moratorium on genetic engineering.
If the Commission lifts the moratorium under pressure from the USA, labelling will enable consumers to respond with a moratorium on purchases.
We will move from a political moratorium to a practical moratorium on purchases imposed by consumers.
The litmus test for the genetic engineering industry is not authorisation but sales.
Genetically manipulated products will have to maintain their hold on the market.
I am sure that at the moment no manufacturer will dare to bank on genetic engineering.
Manufacturers are as afraid of labelling as the devil is of holy water.
They also know that more than 90% of consumers reject genetically manipulated food.
We regret the fact that products of animals that have been fed genetically modified feed will not be subject to the labelling requirements, but we are relying on the labelling requirement for animal feed and on the fact that farmers know what consumers want.
Where seed is concerned too I expect the Commission - and I would ask them to comment on this - not to play any tricks; we really need EU seed legislation with a zero detection limit value.
Anything else would amount to deceiving the consumer. Otherwise, these two regulations would quickly become wastepaper.
Our expectations here are quite clear: that the Commission should implement this zero detection limit value for seed, because we know that it is possible to have seed with a zero limit value as it is already on the market in Austria and other countries.
This is not about unavoidable technical uncertainty.
I would therefore ask you, Commissioner, to give your views on this once more.
My final point is that we all know that Bush's claim that the EU is responsible for hunger in Africa was cynical.
The problem there is not one of technology, but of distribution.
We also know that these countries are certainly in no position to buy expensive seed from the US genetic engineering industry.
I therefore hope that tomorrow will indeed mark a milestone for consumers and that consumers will indeed respond to the lifting of the moratorium with a moratorium on purchases.
Madam President, I would like to start by expressing my appreciation of the wearisome work carried out by the rapporteurs, and I am completely serious in saying this, for it has certainly been no mean feat to reconcile positions which were initially so very far apart and achieve the present position, which has backing across the board.
However, I have to mention the fact that today's consensus is the result of a compromise which is not really particularly satisfactory, adopted purely because of the unyielding reluctance of the Commission and, in particular, the Council, to build a better basis.
Indeed, the resulting framework certainly cannot be said to be complete. That is not so much because the issue continues to be addressed by 35 different reports without even the slightest attempt being made to link them, nor because, for the present phase, it has been decided to split the matter into three different regulations - one of which is not to be debated in this part-session, moreover - as because the framework which emerges is in itself highly dysfunctional, a fact which has been purposefully disregarded in the name of the urgent need to regulate the matter.
I could cite many examples, such as, for instance, the fact that authorisations are to be valid for ten years and the obligation to keep correspondence and the results of tests carried out for only 15 years.
In addition, it will be a long time before we have identification codes and the sampling techniques are random, with no standardised procedures, while, what is more, there is the recommendation to monitor the life of GMOs and products produced from GMOs closely, without, however, it being possible to require additional risk assessments.
There is one example, in particular, which I feel is absurd: so-called co-existence.
I know there is no point in going back over the arguments raised in the debate on this matter, but the fact is that the path chosen - the decision to require the Member States to produce rules governing the area before the Commission has had time to give its opinion - is surely highly unusual.
I hope I am wrong when I say that it will not be the benchmarking techniques which stop pollution, in addition to which there is no mention of the 'polluter pays' principle, while, moreover, the acceptability criteria of 0.5 - 0.9, which caused so much debate, are completely invalidated.
In conclusion, we certainly needed to move on from the current derogations, but that could have been achieved with more meaningful and, above all, more coherent provisions.
The regulations on GMOs ought to be a major advance in terms of bio-security, freedom of choice and freedom of information for consumers.
However, in the two texts in our debate today, there is no indication of any progress having been made.
The most critical point is still the thresholds for the presence of GMOs permitted when such a presence is technically unavoidable.
The Council is proposing 0.9%.
This is too much!
We should go back to the position adopted by Parliament at first reading, which envisaged a maximum of 0.5%.
As for unauthorised GMOs, how can the Council make them legal in the food chain by proposing a threshold of 0.5% when these are GMOs that are prohibited in the EU?
A response is also required to the issue of crop contamination.
The Commission has shifted responsibility onto the Member States, while reserving for itself the right to draw up, at a later date, guidelines on the coexistence of conventional and genetically modified crops.
In the immediate future, Member States must be able to take sovereign measures as a matter of urgency, for example by suspending authorisations when there is a risk to public health or a risk of contaminating the environment.
It is also necessary, in my opinion, to exclude seeds from the regulation, by making a distinction between living GMOs that should fall within the scope of Directive 2001/18/CE, thereby making their traceability compulsory, and genetically modified foods.
It will also be necessary to define a real system of liability for the introduction of GMOs into agriculture and the environment.
In my opinion, the 'polluter pays' principle should apply here, so that a farmer who uses GMOs will have to pay compensation for any damage caused to conventional farming.
Finally, I am fully in support of maintaining the European moratorium despite the complaint that the United States has submitted to the WTO.
Madam President, we must be fully aware of the extent of the problems raised by GMOs, and above all we must not reduce them to the single issue of how the costly research carried out by certain multinational seed companies may be made to yield a quick profit.
First of all, the GMO issue raises a major sovereignty problem: the sovereignty of the public over the commercial exploitation of scientific discoveries, the sovereignty of farmers over what they sow, the sovereignty of consumers over what they eat, and the sovereignty of States over what they control.
Secondly, GMOs pose two major risks.
The first of these concerns human health: there is a risk that the transgene introduced into the plant may code for the synthesis of a toxic protein.
The mad cow disease prion has demonstrated that certain undesirable proteins may have very long-term toxic effects.
The second risk concerns the environment: this is the risk that undesirable genes will be spread to the wild flora and to the rhizosphere.
On this point, one can only deplore the extremely unwise conduct of the Americans, who have spread GMOs over millions of hectares without having taken the precaution of accurately evaluating this risk.
Thirdly, we must ask ourselves who actually benefits from GMOs.
For the consumer, the benefit is non-existent at the present time, as it is for the environment, because we are still waiting for the reduction in the consumption of pesticides that GMOs were supposed to make possible.
For farmers, the benefits are slight: a few savings in relation to seed preparation, treatments and weed control, but at the cost of increased dependence on seed companies and the manufacturers of crop protection products.
For developing countries the benefits are only theoretical, because the companies in question have been working only for markets that are solvent, which means that we cannot accept the American criticism of European countries on this point.
It is therefore the seed companies who are the ones receiving the real benefits, and that means the American multinationals, who are most advanced in this field.
What should we do?
Certainly we should continue with the research.
We should explore both the potential and the risks of transgenesis, even though this technology is extremely costly and appears better suited to crops grown on a very large scale with very little diversity, which are not a feature of European farming, or at least of European farming before the Fischler plan.
We should continue the research in a way that protects our complete freedom, and without allowing anything to be imposed upon us; we should act with extreme caution, not giving way to pressure, and should take a more rigorous approach to consumer information. These, Madam President, seem to me to be the broad lines that we should be following on this essential issue.
Madam President, Mr Byrne reminded us just now about the fact that we are meeting today after two years of emotional and controversial work on this important issue of GMOs, an issue on which Parliament needs to decide without delay.
We should show that we are rational, consistent and coordinated on what represents, in spite of everything, considerable progress.
However, our debates here today show that opinion remains very divided.
While ensuring the proper functioning of the internal market, we should assist our farmers in making their choices and, above all, we should ensure a high level of protection for the consumer.
Even more importantly, we must convince the consumer that our decisions are well-founded.
This means that we shall have to adopt strict rules governing authorisation and control procedures - which means that the scientific criteria for authorisation must be harmonised at European level - and there must be total traceability of products in order to guarantee the safety of animal feeds and foods for human consumption.
It also means communication without ideology.
Consumers are often worried because they do not have accurate information.
The need for credible information for the public at large is consequently even more important.
Labelling must be clear and legible, so as to allow consumers to be free to make the right choices.
Consumers must be able to be certain that all the GMOs that are present in the products that they buy will have been strictly evaluated from the point of view of safety.
They will then be able to choose to buy the products that they want.
These texts propose lifting the moratorium.
As soon as all the safety and traceability guarantees exist, the lifting of the moratorium must follow.
If we do not lift it, we run the risk of holding back research in Europe yet again, and of causing our best research scientists to leave and go to the United States or Asia.
Madam President, it is high time that the European Union opened up more to biotechnologies and genetic engineering in the food sector as well.
Since the 1980s, plant-transgenesis technology has been making progress everywhere except in Europe.
Last year, about 60 million hectares outside Europe were growing genetically improved crops.
The European Union is having difficulty in protecting about 10 000 hectares for the experimental cultivation of certain transgenic plants.
Allow me to quote the French AcadÃ©mie des Sciences, which says, 'Transgenic varieties have been rejected in Europe, although there has never been a health problem regarding consumers or damage to the environment'.
The AcadÃ©mie goes on to explain that almost all the plants cultivated today are the result of thousands of years of genetic selection from wild plants.
Gene exchanges between varieties or species have very often led to profound changes in the morphology of the original wild plant.
Many species have been domesticated by man by the addition of different genomes; examples of this include tobacco, wheat and rape.
Ever since human beings have tilled the soil, they have been practising genetic engineering without knowing it.
While cross-breeding and selective breeding carried out on a hit-and-miss basis by human hands have been accepted, more precisely targeted interventions involving the production of genes are regarded as the work of the devil.
As far as the AcadÃ©mie des Sciences is concerned, transgenic foods are not intrinsically any more dangerous than other foods, and this has been recognised by the Codex Alimentarius.
Why, then, is there all this fuss, all these vague fears about GMOs?
The dogma of the precautionary principle is leading to precautions without any scientific principles at all.
I shall be voting in favour of the compromise negotiated with the Council, even though the compromise is too timid.
I urge the Commission to do away with the illegal moratorium on GMOs and to ensure that Europe does not miss out in the biotechnology revolution.
Is it necessary, Madam President, to remind the House that, at the present time, 95% of people with a doctorate in biology are working on the American continent?
That is a disgrace for Europe!
Madam President, on the issue of GMOs, what can be said in one minute, except that the precautionary principle is not, and should not be, an excuse for doing nothing?
This is why we should welcome the imminent entry into force of these European rules concerning the labelling and traceability of GMOs.
The exacting provisions contained in the reports by Mr Trakatellis and Mrs Scheele will enable us to ascertain the composition of foods, to follow their distribution route and to know whether or not animals have eaten GMO-based feeds.
Subject to these strict conditions, the lifting of the moratorium is a welcome development.
For all that, though, will consumers be reassured?
The truth will only become apparent at a later date, but it can be summed up in just a few words, namely free choice for consumers as to what they put on their plates.
This has already been pointed out at great length by the two rapporteurs and by the Commissioner.
Yet in order to convince people, and to reassure them, we will have to get it right.
Labelling errors for products that are certified as being GMO-free will not be permitted, just as there is no question of making traditional and organic farmers pick up the tab for the crop contamination that is an inevitable risk.
To conclude, therefore, let me say that we should continue with research, remain rational, and convince, communicate with and inform the public even more, explaining to them that transgenic crops involve not just soya, maize or rape, but also gene therapy, the kind of treatment which, for example, has enabled children with primary immunodeficiency to live a normal life outside their 'bubble'.
Madam President, in approving proposals on traceability limits for genetically modified organisms in raw materials, all we are doing is to open the floodgates to the gradual but constant release and movement of genetically modified food and feed.
Our fears are not unfounded, if account is taken of the increasingly suffocating pressure from the USA to import genetically modified products.
The arrangement setting upper permissible contamination limits creates a de facto situation with which we radically disagree, first because it shifts the responsibility to the consumer, who is not, however, in a position to evaluate the risks inherent in food produced from or containing GMOs and, secondly, because it paves the way for the suffocating dependence of farmers on the mainly American multinational biotechnology companies, which have sole rights to produce and sell genetically modified seed and the agrochemicals that accompany them.
Apart from anything else, the use of GMOs will result in the genetic erosion of non-genetically modified varieties, with unforeseeable consequences for biodiversity.
We must fight to ban imports of products made either from genetically modified raw materials or containing GMOs, not for limits on how these products are moved and traced.
Finally, we disapprove overall of the use of GMOs and the 'could be worse' philosophy.
Any concession on this position cannot but be at the expense of farming, the equilibrium of the ecosystem and consumer health, which is why we shall abstain from the vote.
Madam President, I wish to begin by congratulating the rapporteurs, but in particular Mrs Scheele, whose report I followed, for her excellent work and the way she has brought about this compromise agreement on what is a very important report for all our constituents concerning human and animal health and the environment.
The labelling of all genetically modified food and animal feed will give consumers in Europe what 93% of them are asking for: the choice of whether or not to buy GM products.
Meat producers, for example, will be able to avoid using GM feed for the first time through labelling.
It is not complete choice, because of the threshold levels for authorised - and temporarily for unauthorised - GMOs if their presence is adventitious or technically unavoidable.
These levels are too high, but they can be reviewed in the light of developments in technology.
Under the new regulations GM food and animal feed will have to go through a strict authorisation procedure - not just a notification process - and once on the market they can be monitored for effects on the environment.
However, as other colleagues have mentioned, of central importance are the measures which can now be taken by Member States to avoid the contamination of other products by GMOs.
Coexistence has become a major issue since we started discussions on these reports, and conventional and organic farmers, and food producers, as well as consumers, will welcome the proposals before us today.
I represent Wales, a country where the National Assembly tried to implement separation distances between GM and non-GM crops, only to be informed by the Commission that this action was not legally sustainable.
About a quarter of agricultural land in Wales is under agri-environmental schemes, or registered as organic, so this is of crucial importance to the economy as well as to the environment.
I am sure that my constituents will be very pleased that action can now be taken on coexistence.
I particularly welcome the fact that it is clear here that producers and users of GMOs must take all necessary measures to prevent contamination of other products so the burden is not on the conventional farmer.
These new regulations will defend the fundamental principle of consumer choice and we will see people exercising that choice by not growing GM crops and by not buying GM food.
Madam President, following the approval of the two GMO reports we are debating today, we unfortunately face the imminent cancellation of the moratorium, which is something I deeply regret.
The EU should not be turned into one large biological exploratorium, as is happening now.
That being said, 'there is nothing so bad that it is not good for something', as an old Danish proverb would have it.
Now, there is a further argument for promoting organic farming.
It is a clear signal to consumers that the only way in which they can be certain of steering clear of GMOs is by buying organic products, especially when you think of all the animal products whose labels will not state whether GMOs were used in the animals' feed.
The political system has abandoned all responsibility.
From now on, it is crucial for the GMO-free areas of Europe to be extended through organic farming and for other farmers voluntarily to refrain from using GMOs.
Madam President, Commissioner, with these two reports by Mr Trakatellis and Mrs Scheele, we are once again looking at GMOs, but through the wrong end of the telescope.
We are talking, in effect, about traceability, labelling, zero tolerance, maximum thresholds, freedom of choice for the consumer, health, the environment and precautions.
While all this is going on, who is looking at GMOs in Washington?
The answer is, President Bush himself, who is urging the European Union to put an end to its moratorium and has even brought the matter before a panel of the World Trade Organization.
Likewise, who, in President Bush's entourage, is looking at GMOs?
I can give you a list.
There is John Ashcroft, the US Attorney General. His senatorial election campaign in Missouri was partly funded by Monsanto, a GMO multinational.
Then there is Donald Rumsfeld, US Secretary of Defence, the President of a laboratory that Monsanto bought in 1985.
There is Ann Vaneman, US Secretary of Agriculture, a member of the Board of Directors of Calgene, the multinational which created Flower, the first transgenic tomato.
There is also Linda Fisher, Deputy Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, formerly responsible for the Monsanto lobbying bureau in Washington, and finally there is Clarence Thomas, a judge of the US Supreme Court, who was nominated to his position by Bush Senior and who used to be a lawyer at Monsanto.
I could go on; the list is a long one.
What does this mean?
It means that the Bush administration is treating the GMO issue as a matter of sovereignty, in economic, industrial, scientific and agrifood terms.
Just as it did in the case of bananas, hormones in meat, oilseeds, cereals and chickens, the United States is turning GMOs into yet another battle in the transatlantic agriculture wars.
Meanwhile, what are we doing?
Our legalism is up against their imperialism.
Yet the real question, Madam President, is not a scientific one concerning health or the environment.
It is the same question as it has been for forty years. Does Europe, with its 450 million inhabitants, want to be independent?
In the Persian Gulf, it said 'no' while, at the same time, accepting the American war.
In the Gulf of Mexico, at Cancun, on 14 September, if it says no it will be an agricultural and tropical Munich, but then Europe is female and loves to be dominated.
Madam President, that was a very good example of a French expression of an inferiority complex vis-Ã -vis America!
I, along with the majority of the British Conservative MEPs and the majority of members of my group, see genetic modification as an interesting and potentially very useful development for mankind and for our environment.
Genetic modification of plants and seeds holds out the possibility of better food production in harsh climates and of assuring future food supplies to a fast-growing world population.
It also holds out the possibility of reducing artificial agricultural inputs, notably pesticides and herbicides, whose use can cause collateral environmental damage.
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has heard no convincing evidence that GM foods are a threat to human health or to biological diversity.
If we had, we would have been very reluctant to see these proposals adopted at all.
As it is, this debate has been remarkable for the chorus of Greens, Liberal Democrats and Socialists hymning the prospects of GM foods subject to safeguards.
Some MEPs may still want to differ from the Council over the question of the thresholds but we should remember here that we are talking about very tiny amounts.
The text we adopt will specify that GM presence of more than 0.9% of any ingredient will trigger the labelling requirement.
That is a tiny amount.
Let us be honest. The 0.9% tolerance level is, in itself, on the very margin of detectibility.
There is something bizarre about Europeans putting in place such requirements when consumers in other parts of the world do not insist on them, when there is no health evidence that supports them, and when we are probably legislating for the technically impossible.
I have one question for the Commission.
If this legislation is adopted, and if some countries are reluctant to lift their moratorium on genetically modified foods, what action will it take?
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are not debating today whether gene technology has a right to exist in this world.
Neither are we discussing whether it is right for there to be genetically modified food in the USA, Mexico, Canada or Europe.
There already is.
Had we not wanted this, we would have had to take action around twenty years ago and conclude a worldwide agreement.
We did not do so.
This means that we now have to ensure that we put a legal framework in place.
What should the legal framework contain?
It needs to state that there is research and that a product shall be completely safe and harmless according to current scientific knowledge.
What we expect of any food colouring and any emulsifier in yoghurt is also what we expect of genetically modified food and seed, no more and no less.
We have repeatedly said that it will take a package of measures to assemble a reasonable body of legislation in the European Union.
The first part was Mr Bowe's report on the release directive several years ago.
It was always, however, clear to us that this was not enough, that something more was needed in addition to the release of food, seed or plants.
What is actually needed is for the processed plants to be labelled so that the people of the European Union have freedom of choice, which incidentally they also have in respect of any other foodstuff, for example with the fat content of milk or with other foods.
They should be able to exercise their right to choose.
No one has countered what has been said here by saying that genetically modified food is the work of the devil and no one is scaremongering.
We simply say always that products have to be safe according to current scientific knowledge.
We are trying to ensure that this is the case.
And we are trying to ensure that food is comprehensively labelled.
We have heard that a threshold is arbitrary and we know that this is the case.
Whether it is 0.5% or 0.9% I really do not care.
I would like us to have comprehensive legislation as quickly as possible and the reports by Mrs Scheele and Mr Trakatellis are valuable and necessary contributions to achieving this.
Then we will also have the security in the European Union of being able to say to the Americans and all of the others: yes, you can produce and export to the European Union, but on our conditions and in accordance with our legislation!
We owe this to the people of the European Union; that is our job as their elected representatives.
Madam President, the labelling of food products containing genetically modified organisms is, of course, to be welcomed, because consumers can make up their own minds.
Whether or not these consumers are right in having doubts about GMOs, the customer is ultimately always right.
Legislation on labelling, however, to my mind, misses the mark on at least two fundamental counts.
First of all, the consumer does not get what he wants.
A consumer who wants GMO-free products does not want less than 0.9% or 0.5% GMOs in them. No, he does not want any GMOs at all.
A non-GMO label would therefore have been much better.
It is unfortunate that this can no longer be on the agenda, as we rejected it at first reading.
Moreover, a label of that kind would have made superfluous the whole debate we are now having about co-existence.
The second problem is that this is about political labelling which goes much further than information of potential relevance to public health.
As far as I am concerned, paper traceability instead of factual traceability is a mistake.
It is asking for fraud, and so the next food scandal is already in the making.
Finally, it is to be hoped that this proposal will lead to a lifting of the GMO moratorium.
This is what matters most; it means that Europe's lack of knowledge compared to the United States is only growing.
I should therefore like to ask the same question which Mrs Jackson raised a moment ago, namely whether this proposal will lead to the moratorium actually being lifted, because this is still shrouded in uncertainty.
Madam President, the frantic lobbying by the seed companies in order to convince Members to reject the amendments adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy was enough to make us vote in favour of those amendments, despite the limitations of the texts concerned.
We are in favour of maximum traceability and labelling for GMOs intended for human and animal consumption, so that consumers can make judgments and choices.
It is not genetic modification itself that causes problems, nor is it the research carried out for this purpose.
What causes problems is the fact that the use of these products is entirely in the hands of the agrifood giants, in whom society can have no confidence at all, because they are not researching genetic modification in the interests of human beings or society, but on the basis of what profits they can make from it.
I shall also take this opportunity to protest about the imprisonment, in France, of JosÃ© BovÃ©.
At least JosÃ© BovÃ© has the merit of having fuelled suspicion with regard to the use that can be made of GMOs.
He has been condemned because of his opinions and because of his militant activities.
He must be released.
At a time when JosÃ© BovÃ© has just been imprisoned in scandalous conditions for having uprooted a few genetically modified plants, we must not lose sight of the political background to this second reading. What we have in this background is the feverish desire of the Commission and the Member States, especially since the complaint lodged by the United States in the WTO on this matter, to lift the 1999 moratorium on GMOs.
The most positive aspect of this compromise is that it allows Member States to adopt any measures they wish in order to prevent the contamination of traditional and organic crops by GMOs.
These States would simply need to demonstrate the necessary political will to achieve this.
Even if these directives, which are to be voted on tomorrow, provide a barrage of arguments against 'any GMOs', the problem of genetic contamination, of seeds in particular, still remains to be resolved.
Tolerance of the adventitious presence of GMOs varies from 0.3 to 0.5 % depending on the species, whereas the same threshold of 0.1% should apply to all species.
Such a threshold is crucial in order to guarantee the purity of the variety and the traceability and labelling of all seeds throughout the production chain; and to keep some sectors truly GMO-free.
The liability of those who introduce GMOs into the environment, and I am thinking in particular here of the seed industry, including European companies, must be clearly established in accordance with the 'polluter pays' principle. In other words, the cost of remedying the damage must be borne by GMO farming.
Since it is impossible to determine the precise contamination range of pollen produced by a genetically modified plant, it will be in the interest of the producers of these plants to have good insurance, unless they are able to train bees to gather pollen very selectively.
Madam President, I am pleased that all the parties and all the groups in this House - including the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance - agree on the political compromise that has been reached.
After all, today's legislation means that the moratorium will be lifted. Member States can therefore no longer prescribe their own requirements and ban products off their own bat if GMOs have been tested and approved at European level and meet all safety standards.
I am also pleased that the Commission will be tabling a proposal shortly in which it will indicate how GMO farming, organic farming and traditional farming can continue to exist side by side.
I wonder what the proposal will be like, but I assume that sufficient guarantees will be given for traditional and organic farming.
Madam President, Consumers have the right to know what they eat and to be certain that their food is safe.
Consumers must be able to choose, and labelling is crucial to this.
I am not at all happy with the rules that have been laid down, not only in the Environment Council and in the Agriculture Council, but also in our own group.
After all, traceability has not been factored in as the guiding principle: as modified DNA can be present unintentionally, a margin is provided for.
We will therefore never be able to say again that something is completely free of modified DNA, which, to my mind, turns freedom of choice into a farce.
Let me give you two examples: foodstuffs made of GMOs, such as sugar, starch and vegetable oils, fall within the scope of the labelling obligation, while sugar, oil and starch do not contain any protein or DNA.
Other foodstuffs, however, that have been prepared with a GMO do not fall within the scope of the labelling obligation; these are cheese, wine, beer, soft drinks and last but not least, our daily bread, while bread improvers used to prepare bread contain yeasts or fungi with a GMO.
These do contain residues of modified DNA in a verifiable manner.
The distinction drawn is therefore hypocritical and I can understand very easily that industry has difficulty with it.
I regret it and I hope that in two years' time, thanks to the amendment clause, something better will turn up.
Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, according to a recent poll conducted by Eurobarometer, over 70% of Europeans do not want to eat GMOs.
There was, therefore, a need to provide European consumers with a response, by adopting legislation on labelling, which should enable everyone to choose what they eat.
I do, however, have several reservations.
The first concerns the 0.9% threshold.
Why, when a lower presence is technically detectable - with a threshold of 0.5% being accepted for non-authorised GMOs - are we refusing to be less demanding?
The situation would be different if a 0.9% presence becomes a reality before the moratorium is even lifted.
My second reservation concerns consumer choice.
Will this choice be guaranteed in future, when we do not envisage any binding legislation on the subject of coexistence and instead leave it to Member States to adopt appropriate measures?
Perhaps we already know that coexistence is impossible, that we can regulate neither the flight of the bumblebees nor the direction or strength of the wind and that planting GMOs is irreversible?
If this is the case, we are taking a considerable risk for Europeans, because we cannot make the issue of GMOs solely one of consumer choice, turning a blind eye to public health and environmental problems.
Lastly, no one has to date been able to produce powerful, irrefutable and convincing arguments that prove the benefit and the harmless nature of GMOs.
GMO crops and biotechnologies are too frequently lumped together, but GMOs are only one of biotechnology's many applications.
Refusing to extend the use of GMOs in Europe does not mean that we are against progress, or against gene therapies; it simply means that we are choosing the precautionary principle over the trial and error of the sorcerer's apprentice.
Everyone is well aware that what still counts the most in this field is economic and financial interests and that the EU's agricultural and environmental future will be shaped by pressure from the United States and from WTO negotiations.
This is most regrettable, because it should not be forgotten that the United States has still not ratified the Cartagena protocol.
I have the feeling that all of these debates and our votes tomorrow are preparing us for agreeing to raise the moratorium without too much argument.
Our vote will, therefore, be much more political than it appears to be and we would be failing the citizens if we did not demand, before any decision is taken, to be better informed about the real risks that GMO crops will entail for the environment and for people's health.
Madam President, the proposals in the Scheele report, together with the Trakatellis report, mean that consumers do not have to use GMOs.
If the amendments of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy are approved, EU legislation will be the strictest in the world.
Despite this, the situation is still far from ideal, because it is still possible for traditionally or organically grown plants, and animals, to be adventitiously contaminated by GMO materials.
We are still waiting for effective criteria for co-existence in the field and also for the environmental liability system that the Commission promised us during the negotiations about Directive 2001/18/EC two years ago.
Until such time as these criteria have begun to take adequate effect, the ban should not be lifted.
We must make it clear that European consumers are entitled to decide for themselves whether they want to buy GMOs or not.
For the protection of this right, we should not have to rely on the World Trade Organisation or the United States administration.
This is exclusively the responsibility of Europe's own parliamentarians, both here and in the national parliaments.
If we are to move ahead, we have to support all the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
I regret that the Commission has assumed a rather negative position towards a number of these amendments.
Madam President, I very much agree with what Mrs Ferreira has just said.
Demand for GM food is not driven by consumers.
On the contrary, it is driven by - and is only for the benefit of - multinational GM companies.
The United States' concern for the starving populations of the world is as genuine as George Bush's concern for the Iraqi people's rights.
By the way, Iraq currently has a GM ban.
The United States should not be allowed to force this to be changed.
If the United States and GM multinationals are so concerned about world hunger why do they not put the resources spent on research and PR for GM into helping them fend for themselves, not into forcing them to become even more reliant on multinational companies to grow their own food?
They should also stop exploiting them.
In relation to the coexistence issue, this is a myth.
Unless crops are grown, harvested, processed, eaten, and even the waste disposed of in laboratories, it is inevitable that there will be contamination.
What are we going to do in Europe?
Are we going to start introducing Schengen agreements for bees, birds and the wind and also ensure that we do not have any kind of cross-pollination?
It is absolutely impossible!
When we talk about the polluter-pays principle, the multinationals must be held accountable for the fact that conventional farmers, and in particular organic farmers, are not going to be allowed to do what they have done in the past.
This is all about profit and greed.
The consumers do not want GM food, so why are we being forced into it just for the benefit of multinational companies?
What we have agreed in Parliament, in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, does not go far enough.
The threshold is far too high, since a lower one could be achieved.
Personally, I believe a zero threshold is the only one acceptable.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, what is at issue today is not the profits made by enterprises or conglomerates, but our gaining, at last, the length and breadth of Europe, a single legal framework which will enable genetically-modified foods and feedingstuffs to be authorised, labelled, and traced.
This will give all participants in the market - including consumers - a guarantee of legal certainty; it may have come very late in the day, but I hope it is not too late.
In terms of the practical implementation of this technology, we Europeans are over ten years behind developments in other countries, while our researchers are without doubt equal to the best in the world.
To put it another way, what this amounts to is that research findings have been left unused for ten years, and research in Europe has been scrapped, especially into green genetic engineering, even though the usefulness of this is not a matter of dispute.
As Mr Davies has given a number of examples of this, I do not need to do likewise.
Over recent years, however, public discussion has not been about the pros and cons of genetic engineering, but has instead been a campaign mounted along ideological lines, aimed at obstructing a modern and forward-looking technology, so it is not to be wondered at that the results of surveys show the majority regarding genetic engineering as the work of the devil and abominating it.
A number of interventions in this House today gave me the feeling that the plague was on its way back to Europe.
We have to be very careful here.
This situation means that it is perfectly reasonable that the regulations should contain very stringent rules on authorisation, labelling, and traceability, even though these threaten to break the bounds of practical feasibility.
The reason why I say this is that I think that we, simply by applying very stringent measures, are guaranteeing the absolute maximum of safety that is practically feasible - and this is something that we also need to tell the public over and over again in the information campaign.
Although the information requirements provided for in the regulations are certainly an important means towards this end, I would like to appeal also to the Commission and say that I too regard Europe-wide information campaigns as necessary, as Mrs Breyer has announced a campaign for a moratorium on buying GM products.
If the labelling of these products results only in their being rejected, we will certainly not be able to catch up on the rest of the world.
Whilst this compromise motion is certainly an intelligent solution, I do have my doubts - and a number of interventions seem to justify them - as to whether it will succeed.
When it comes to drawing up guidelines - and I can tell the Commission that I am agog to see what will happen when they do - there will be a lot of hard work to be done; it will not be easy, and I hope it does not turn out to be a bureaucratic monster.
Madam President, we have to recognise that this is another step in the process of making sure that, when we deal with this new technology, it works for the benefit of human beings and not against them.
We have seen already other pieces of legislation come before this House, for one of which I was the rapporteur, which were part of the jigsaw creating the total picture of control over genetically modified organisms.
With this particular piece of legislation we have to recognise a number of things.
The main objective of this legislation and the agreements around it is to give people the right to make a genuine choice about GM products.
We have listened to the concerns of people across Europe calling for the right to make an informed choice about GM food.
We are trying to put in place a labelling and information scheme that makes the choice a reality.
I have some sympathy with the remarks made by Mr Maaten about the imperfections of this scheme; nevertheless we have to work within the boundaries of what is scientifically provable and practically possible to implement.
We live in an imperfect world, and the use of thresholds reflects the reality.
Organic regulations allow for the presence of up to 5% non-organic ingredients.
In practical terms that means that an organic readymeal could contain minor ingredients like herbs and spices which are not readily available in organic form.
We do not label very low levels of residues of pesticides or chemical contaminates in foodstuffs although we know they are present.
In any labelling regime there are bound to be imperfections.
There has to be a cut-off point where the practical and the scientific reality cuts in.
That is the best we can do with the science we have.
One of the ingredients in the pizza that you might eat tonight might be a salami sausage but not every constituent ingredient of that sausage will appear on the pizza-box label.
Our job is to make the best deal that science allows.
Our priority has to be to give the consumer real choice.
Madam President, in France, JosÃ© BovÃ© is paying for his opposition to GMOs and for his commitment to the precautionary principle with his freedom.
This penalty is completely unacceptable, particularly if we compare the threat to society that he represents and the threat to our future health posed by GMOs.
We are more aware in Europe than elsewhere that this is unacceptable, because we are obliged to guarantee our fellow citizens the real choice of whether to eat or whether to refuse to eat GMOs.
Let us not be intimidated by the lies and pressure piled on by President Bush, who is supported by the pro-GMO agri-food industry and who is denying his own consumers a choice.
Let us take the lead, let us dare to close the loopholes in our regulations.
We must very clearly refuse to allow non-authorised GMOs onto the market.
With regard to the labelling of authorised GMOs, we know that the food industry can detect the presence of even 0.1% of GMOs.
This is the approach that we should follow, but having said that, unless there is a guarantee that GMO and non-GMO crops can coexist with one another, the best regulations in the world will be useless if GMOs are present everywhere in nature.
This is absolutely crucial if we are to give consumers freedom of choice and protect the environment, maintain GMO-free crops and guarantee that they remain GMO-free.
This is the real challenge we face.
Let us not be fooled: unless coexistence is guaranteed, there will no longer be any choice.
Madam President, tomorrow, I will be voting in favour of both reports.
Nonetheless, labelling will be difficult for industry and will provide no honest information for the consumer.
In its Common Position, the Council gives it as its opinion that the reports are aimed at preventing the consumer from being misled. How kind!
The only problem is that it will not work like that.
The fact is that labels do not have to show any adventitious or technically unavoidable contamination that might be present, at any rate not below a certain threshold value.
Mrs Roth-Behrendt deserves our thanks for making that so marvellously clear.
Whether the figure is 0.9%, 0.5%, or perhaps we will hit on the idea of 0.1% or even 0.01% - the whole thing is nothing but a load of eyewash.
If there is no danger to health - and there is none - then what is all the song and dance about?
Pity the consumer who will eat GMOs without knowing it, whom we will quite deliberately be misleading.
Read item 12 of the Scheele report and you realise how worthy of a comedy turn the whole thing is, for it says that, in order for the requirement of labelling to be dispensed with, the operator must certify to the competent authorities that he has done everything possible to prevent genetically modified organisms from being present.
The good fellow has made such an effort, so we will not put the labels on and keep the consumer informed!
The consumer will never discover what he has eaten.
Never will it dawn on him that he has eaten GM food.
In the committee, I attempted to prevent this, and put the case for doing away with negative labelling and saying yes to positive labelling.
That would have been honest, and big firms like NestlÃ©, Unilever, and others would have gone along with it.
No doubt it was too late for that.
Let us treat the whole business as a didactic drama.
Let us be glad that we have made co-existence possible, let us hope that someone will assume liability for it, and let us take this as a lesson in what political dishonesty can be like!
I should like to start by extending warm congratulations to Mrs Scheele, who has handled this difficult dossier with great care.
I have to say that I have quite a few reservations about this report.
First of all, I think that labels should tell the whole truth, and not be 0.9% removed from the truth.
It is regrettable, in my opinion, that we have not decided to introduce a GMO-free label, because that would have made matters much clearer for the consumer.
I also regret that we have remained caught up in the small-print mentality; it would, in fact, be much better if a label could indicate in an open and clear manner right from the outset whether a product is GMO-free, contains GMO or may contain GMO.
This would at any rate have provided consumers with the clarity for which many are waiting.
Despite this, I can agree to this legislation, because I think it is about time the ban was lifted, and I should therefore like to hear from the Commission what steps it intends to take to bring this about.
For the Member States, it is time to closely examine not only co-existence in agriculture, in transport and in ports, but also how this is to be monitored.
It should not be made too easy to get round this directive, and the Member States should really ensure that it is observed in any event.
Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking both rapporteurs for the work they have done, but I have to say that I am very uneasy about the decision we have to take.
The fact is, I feel as if I am in a kind of hostage situation.
On the one hand, I want to reject GMO technology, which is far from being problem-free.
It is no panacea.
On the contrary, it exposes us to risks because it is impossible to predict the characteristics to which a modified gene may give rise in its new environment.
Co-existence sounds good, but we also know that GMOs are infectious.
We do not therefore know what situation we are facing.
There is also a concentration of power, and the big multinational companies exercise incredible pressure, especially upon the African countries.
On the other hand, if we cannot put a stop to GMOs, strict rules are naturally needed.
We must minimise the risk.
I am therefore going to vote tomorrow in favour of the amendments by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
I want, however, to say once and for all that there are so many issues left to solve, for example in connection with environmental liability, that there can be no question of lifting the moratorium.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Trakatellis and Mrs Scheele have produced a comprehensive piece of work, which should make for better information and greater transparency, as well as helping European consumers to enjoy freedom of choice.
Consumers have to know what they are buying and what they are eating.
Effective, reliable legal framework conditions for authorising, labelling and tracing GMOs need to be created as soon as possible.
Both regulations, along with the lifting of the de facto moratorium on authorisation, are crucial to the implementation of a forward-looking strategy for European biotechnology, demands for which Parliament endorsed at the beginning of this year.
The moratorium impedes the progress of green biotechnology in the European Union, and, in particular, both damages Europe's innovative SMEs and stands in contradiction to the Lisbon objectives.
The room for action set out in compromise motion No 1 on the Scheele report is desirable.
We must, however, ensure that, if individual Member States decide to go their own way, this does not frustrate the aims of this regulation by interfering with the common internal market.
When it comes to the adventitious and technically unavoidable presence of GMOs in non-genetically-modified products, we need rules that work in practice.
In the final analysis, as we all know, every threshold value we set is arbitrary, but the 0.9% threshold value provided for in the Common Position is reasonable and helps to guide manufacturers and consumers.
The threshold value is important in terms of different types of cultivation being able to coexist, as, in the natural world, there are no techniques for preventing such things as cross-pollination.
The most important yardstick by which the new legislation must be judged must be the practicability of its framework conditions, which must, in particular, be in line with WTO rules and must not allow excessive bureaucracy to hamper the development of biotechnology in Europe.
Above all, they must help to inform consumers and protect them.
Mr President, although a lot has been said in today's debate about threshold values, and about their being politically arbitrary, I would like to emphasise how important it was for this House, at first reading, to specify a figure of 0.5%, even though many were not happy about it.
The fact is that, if this figure of 0.5% had not been hammered out and adopted in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, we would not have such a rigorous Common Position and also the present basis for negotiating an acceptable compromise on co-existence.
The second point I would like to address is that I do not think it is very fair for us to be now acting as if we were about to vote 'yes' or 'no' to genetically modified organisms.
We know for a fact that we do not have the option of saying 'no', whether to GMOs or to many chemicals and other products.
That is one reason why I campaigned for the most stringent conditions in the authorisation process and for comprehensive labelling.
Mrs Flemming's criticism was that the method of labelling was politically dishonest.
I would ask her - although she is no longer here - whether not labelling something that was 100% composed of GMOs would mean that we were being more politically honest with consumers.
I believe that the European public are perfectly grown-up enough to come to their own opinions on this, and also that biotechnology cannot but become more credible and be taken more seriously if it does not hide behind badly-framed rules on labelling.
To those who draw attention to their energetic campaigning for labelling as 'GMO-free', I have always said that the fact that products are 'GMO-free' can be indicated by additional labelling.
We cannot conceal from consumers the fact that genetically-modified organisms are everywhere.
I believe that we have to stress the fact, and bring it to people's attention, that this stance was friendly only to industry and not to the consumer.
Mr President, we need new regulation on labelling and traceability and it must be as rigorous as possible.
But my key point is that even if tough new rules are adopted tomorrow, as we hope, this should not be seen as a green light to lift the de facto moratorium.
These directives do not address properly the very real risk of contamination of non-GM and organic agriculture with GM varieties.
Nor do they provide for liability rules to cover farmers who are victims of such contamination.
Research by the Commission, by the European Environment Agency and by the Department for Environment in my own country all conclude that licensing GM crops will almost inevitably lead to widespread contamination of non-GM crops.
If we are to ensure that the public has the right to choose to reject GM we must ensure not only that GM is labelled, but also that non-GM continues to exist.
Unless we can address the problem of contamination, that cannot be guaranteed.
I do not believe Mr Fischler's guidelines will be adequate.
The moratorium therefore must stay in place.
Finally, there are a number of national consultation processes going on in the Member States on GM crops.
It is vital that those processes are taken seriously.
It is therefore a matter of much regret that the UK Government's process has been under-funded and badly publicised.
Its deadline must be extended if we are not to conclude that government ministers have already decided in favour of GM cultivation.
.
Mr President, we have now come to the end of this debate that has lasted for very nearly two years at this level of intensity.
The evidence of the cooperation that has taken place between our institutions is in the presentation of the legislation before you for voting on tomorrow.
Of course there have been expressions of different views by many sides during the course of the debate over the last two years and, indeed, in this Chamber this afternoon.
There are some inevitably who will not be satisfied with the legislation that is put forward.
Some for instance say that we go too far in achieving the balance that we have tried to achieve and that this will put off and set back the development of biotechnology in Europe in the future; that we are losing our good scientists to the United States.
That may be true but, nonetheless, we have to ensure that we have in place good legislation that gives valuable information to the consumer so that the consumer can make the choice of whether or not to consume GM foods.
We have put in place in this legislation - the best legislation in the world on this issue - providing free market authorisation, monitoring, labelling and labelling supported by traceability to give it the appropriate level and full credibility.
Others reject GMOs and I suspect some of them would reject GMOs at any cost.
I have to tell them that they will never be satisfied and there is no legislation that will satisfy them.
In those circumstances, have they placed themselves in a situation where their views cannot be fully taken into account?
Perhaps that is the case.
Those who have worked hard on this issue - Mrs Scheele, my own staff and I hope myself - have attempted to achieve a balance so that we get in the legislation the best solution for all points of view, having taken into account views expressed right across the spectrum to achieve the result which is before you this afternoon and for voting on tomorrow.
I have to say to those who are very sceptical about this technology that all the scientific evidence available to us indicates that GM food is as safe as conventional food.
There is no scientific evidence going in a contrary direction.
We have said time and time again that our decisions here in Parliament and in the Commission must be science-based.
If we move away from that we are in peril.
I have been asked to deal with the question of the moratorium.
A number of Member States and a number of others asked for the de facto moratorium to be put in place to enable legislation to be brought forward to achieve what we have in this draft legislation at the moment.
I cannot believe that it was the intention of those who wanted this work to be done to then say that, despite all this hard work, effort, expense and debate, they nonetheless believe that the moratorium should remain in place.
In those circumstances, reflecting the views of those who asked us to engage in this exercise and provide this legislation, we have now come to the stage when we must lift the de facto moratorium.
Legislation is in place which gives adequate protection and information for consumers.
It is a sophisticated piece of legislation - the best in the world, as I have said - to enable consumers to make the choice for themselves of whether or not to consume GM foods.
The choice is for them.
In those circumstances it is appropriate to move now to the beginnings of the lifting of the de facto moratorium on food and feed.
I do not believe we should be doing this in the face of any threat of WTO proceedings or anything of that nature.
The work I have been doing - and I am sure it is the same for you - has been done on the basis of trying to achieve what is right, trying to achieve a result that provides the kind of choice for consumers that we believe is necessary and provides the choice for them in a meaningful way and in an informed manner.
We do this work because we believe it is right.
We do not do this work because other people believe we ought to speed it up and do what they believe.
I do not do this work under threat of WTO proceedings.
To those of you who have expressed scepticism and still have some worries about this legislation, within a period of two years after the adoption of this legislation and it becomes law, there is specific provision in the legislation for a review.
Therefore, it is possible - and it is intended - for us to return to this issue in that timescale so that we can, with the experience of the operation of the legislation, determine whether there is any need for adjustment and for amendments.
In my opinion that is an important part of the legislation which will assuage the concerns of those who are expressing anxiety about it.
Will I take infringement proceedings or do I believe the Commission should take infringement proceedings if there is a failure to comply with the law?
It is the Commission's function and role to look to the legislation, ensure that the laws of the European Union are properly applied and implemented and if there is a failure to apply any legislation - including this legislation - then we must take our responsibility and move in the way that we are required to do under the Treaties.
Finally, I thank Mrs Scheele for her hard work and for the cooperation she has afforded to me in meetings personally and with my staff, and compliment her on the outcome of some difficult work over a long period of time.
I also enjoyed working with her during that period.
.
Mr President, firstly I should like to thank you all for a very useful and comprehensive debate.
It confirms at the same time how difficult it is to reach some sort of consensus on this complex issue.
This adds to the merit of the two rapporteurs, Mrs Scheele and Mr Trakatellis, who have managed to approach very distinct positions and to work out some viable compromise solutions.
In this debate I can trace a wish to be in a different debate about saying 'yes' or 'no' to GMOs.
This is not the situation.
We are not discussing whether to say 'yes' or 'no' to GMOs.
Maybe this would have been easier, but we have passed that stage.
We already import into the European Union 35 million tonnes of soya every year.
This is a fact.
It is not fair to say that we have not tried to act according to the situation.
We have revised Directive 2001/18/EC about placing live GMOs on the market.
We have proposed traceability labelling.
We have looked at food and feed proposals. We have added this.
We have written a new text into the environmental liability proposal.
We are always discussing ways to complement the existing legislation in order to meet the concerns of citizens in the European Union.
What we have proposed reflects these concerns and, at the same time, the potential of this new technology.
This is exactly what it addresses.
We see that there is probably a lot of potential in using GM techniques, but we also see that there are risks.
That is why we now have much stricter legislation in place.
That is why we are tracing and labelling these products.
That is why we have added a text in the environmental liability proposal.
This is exactly what we have taken into consideration.
We are trying to do our part and to take our responsibility.
That is the only way to address such a complex and difficult issue.
Is it enough to restart authorisations?
This debate also reminds me of a boy I know who, when he was five or six years old, was served small green peas as part of his dinner by his grandmother.
He assured his grandmother that 'yes, I love green peas, but I don't eat them'.
The same will apply if we now put in place completely revised legislation but are not willing to apply it.
What kind of signal are we sending to the rest of the world?
A signal that our legislation, which ensures this balance of looking at both the potential benefits and the risks, does not work - we are not ready to apply it.
That is the main point for me.
We should be able to start to implement the legislation that we have now worked on for such a long time, trying to ensure an informed choice for the European consumers and farmers.
We must demonstrate to the rest of the world, including the US, that it works.
This is how we do it.
We make a risk assessment, we trace it, we label it and we make sure that we have this correct balance.
That is why, as my colleague, Mr Byrne, has said, the Commission will take its responsibility.
As you know, the process also leaves it very much up to Member States to demonstrate that they can work with this issue, but if they are not willing to do it the Commission will certainly take responsibility.
Once again my thanks go to the rapporteurs and to all in the House for a very exciting debate.
Mrs Breyer has asked leave to make a personal statement in accordance with Rule 122.
Mrs Breyer, I would like to point out to you that you may refer only to statements made concerning yourself in the course of the debate. In other words, please can we not have a new debate?
Mr President, Mr Schnellhardt has stated that I am organising a campaign for a moratorium on buying GM products.
That is utter nonsense.
Consumers are making it clear - and saying so in every survey - that they do not want GM products.
So far, industry has been able to slip GM foods past the consumers on the quiet; now, the food manufacturers have to tell them the truth about their products, so if the de-facto moratorium is lifted, we will be in a completely new situation.
Labelling has now arrived, so that consumers can make known their feelings - whether for or against - about this type of food.
For the GM industry, the litmus test is not to do with whether or not they get authorisation from the EU, nor is it the procedural hurdles; it is whether or not consumers will buy these products.
It is the market that is the litmus test; it is the market that will decide.
I do not fear the end of this moratorium - far from it.
You have to ask yourselves why it is that not one single manufacturer has, so far, put these products on the market labelled as such.
Manufacturers will watch as these products do an economic nosedive.
If these products have to be labelled, the manufacturers will have to tell the truth about them.
It is the consumers themselves who will bring in a moratorium on buying them.
The Commission has also accepted responsibility when it comes to lifting the moratorium.
Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m, at the time of the directive on release into the environment, you told us that liability would be incorporated in the environmental liability directive, but it was not.
My final point is that, earlier in the debate, I asked the Commissioner to say something about the rules on seeds.
My fear is that this House is being tricked.
I urge the Commission to make a statement about this, because Parliament's voice is not being heard on the subject.
Will there be a limit value of zero for seeds as is already the practice in a number of states?
Is it not technically avoidable?
I ask you to speak and account for this.
Mrs Breyer, I regret that I have to tell you that what you have said bears little relation to a personal statement, but was more like a contribution to the debate.
I had reasons for saying what I said earlier.
I would therefore urge you to keep to the rules in future.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
WRITTEN DECLARATION (RULE 120)
Mr President, both these regulations are meant to establish a single new, Europe-wide, legal framework for the authorisation, labelling and traceability of genetically modified food and feedingstuffs.
Consumers have minds of their own and want to be informed - about ingredients, composition, and additives; some of them want information about methods of production.
We have to meet this need for information, especially in those areas where ignorance gives rise to fears.
Consumers want to use choice as a means of getting rid of uncertainty.
People are afraid of anything that is new.
As we have no long-term experience of GMOs, information is urgently needed if there is to be freedom of choice.
I support the compromise.
If we are to put this important regulation into effect, we now have to avoid a conciliation procedure.
Only if it is adopted soon will it be possible to end the moratorium, thus avoiding trade disputes with the USA, Canada and Argentina.
I hope that the EU will shortly abandon its reservations about GMOs.
If people had opposed the wheel when it was invented, we would still be going everywhere on foot.
The next item should be the joint debate on a number of reports on food safety, but we would have only three minutes available for it before the start of the debate on the Commission communication.
There is no point in starting the debate right now.
The next item is the Commission communication on proposals for action for strengthening the European pharmaceutical industry in the interest of patients.
.
Mr President, I am delighted to be able to announce to you that, earlier today, the Commission adopted a communication on the G10 Medicines initiative.
For those of you who are not familiar with G10, I would like to briefly explain the background to this initiative.
In recent years there has been growing evidence that the European-based pharmaceutical industry was losing competitiveness compared with its American-based counterparts. This is not only serious for our economy but of vital importance to public health and, especially, European patients.
Millions of Europeans use medicines everyday.
Achieving real and long-lasting benefits to patients is a key objective of pharmaceutical policy.
We must support Member States to make authorised medicines, especially the newer and more innovative ones, available and affordable to all those who need them as quickly as possible.
However, some of the statistics concerning the industry make difficult reading; those pertaining to research and development, for example: critical to our industry, to our science base and to our patients.
In 1990 Europe was the world leader in pharmaceutical research and development and innovation.
Now the US has overtaken Europe in the discovery of new chemical or biological entities.
This has not happened by chance.
Since 1990, research and development expenditure in the US has grown at a dramatic rate.
Between 1990 and 2000, research and development expenditure grew at twice the rate in the US compared with Europe.
By 1997 America had overtaken Europe in terms of total research and development expenditure.
G10 medicines were born out of this background.
In recognition of the critical role the industry plays in both the industrial and health sectors, Commissioner Byrne and I established the High Level Group on Innovation and the Provision of Medicines - G10 Medicines.
It is a small Group of high-level representatives from Member States, industry, mutual health funds and patients.
The group was given the challenging remit of reaching consensus on ways of improving the competitiveness of the pharmaceutical industry in the context of achieving social and public health objectives.
To many people's surprise, the group was able to report back in May last year, with 14 wide-ranging recommendations.
In the communication adopted today we set out how we plan to take these recommendations forward.
There are five broad themes we pursue in the communication which we intend to take forward in parallel.
Benefits to patients are at the heart of G10.
We will look at ways of improving patient information on medicines, strengthening the role of patients in public health decision-making and so forth. I am sure that in that area my colleague Mr Byrne will say more.
Developing a competitive European-based industry takes us back to the origins of G10.
We examine ways of improving access to innovative medicines and the need to speed up national negotiations on reimbursement and pricing, greater price competition for medicines that are not part of the state sector and measures to develop competitive generic and non-prescription markets.
With regard to strengthening the EU Science Base: if we fail to support innovation we will pay a heavy economic, social and public health price.
We look at ways we can develop incentives for research, including the use of virtual institutes for health to stimulate and organise health and biotechnology research and development.
We also link in to the many initiatives under the Commission's existing Sixth Framework Programme.
As for medicines in an enlarged Union, with the forthcoming enlargement the Union is facing one of its greatest challenges and opportunities.
We look at ways of meeting the challenge through providing a level playing field for intellectual property protection and providing support for the new Member States to implement the new legislative framework.
As regards Member States learning from each other, benchmarking will provide a practical mechanism for monitoring the implementation of the recommendations, as well as providing a forum for Member States to share best practice.
So, what is the driving force for implementing the proposals in the communication?
The main driving force will be the pharmaceutical review supported by the Life Sciences and Biotechnology Action Plan and the Public Health Programme.
You will be well aware of these, and the Pharmaceutical Review will obviously have its second reading in the autumn.
However, the unique aspect of G10 is the vehicle it provided to look at areas of national competence that have an impact on competitiveness and public health.
There is only so much we can achieve at European level.
In the communication we set out areas where we believe that a European reflection could benefit Member States as well as helping to achieve our G10 goals.
In particular, we propose an examination of national pricing and reimbursement systems.
Although this is clearly within the competence of Member States we believe that the injection of more market measures, while ensuring national safeguards to control expenditure on pharmaceuticals, could bring benefits to patients and the industry in terms of quicker access to the markets.
Overall, I believe the communication, together with the other initiatives I have mentioned, provides a framework for turning around the competitiveness of our pharmaceutical industry while reinforcing European public health.
.
Mr President, in the G10 communication adopted today by the Commission we see patients and public health placed at the centre of the debate on the future direction of European pharmaceuticals policy.
This rebalancing of policy-making between legitimate industrial innovation and health needs is an important step in the right direction.
You have previously heard me say here that our health is our wealth.
The development of rising public health standards, the extension of disease-free life-years and the increase in life expectancy are shaping features of modern economic development, and pharmaceutical innovation has played a significant role in all of this.
Similarly, from a patient point of view, innovation has yielded dramatic improvements in the dignity and quality of life of patients in recent decades.
Now patients are taking a more active role in seeking out information and products.
But at a point where health expenditure is rising, the population is ageing and patients' expectations are increasing, we need to have a strategic vision of how to move forward in this complex field.
There are a number of interlinked issues here.
For patients, there is a desire to have more effective, more humane products, brought to market more quickly.
There is a desire to have better information on the comparative advantages of products and early warning of adverse reactions.
For patients, the availability of clear and authoritative information from the leaflet inside the package, to online at the level of a European health portal, is essential.
For those who finance the health system, there is a need for sustainable budgeting, affordable medicines, manageable demand and responsible behaviour from patients, prescribers and producers alike.
From a public health point of view there is a need to ensure that medicines maintain high quality and safety standards and that adverse reactions are quickly identified and tackled.
There is a need to work towards more rational prescribing and consumption patterns, to ensure that we can tackle anti-microbial resistance.
In addition there is a need to ensure that research develops products which tackle health requirements as distinct from lifestyle issues.
For example, more must be done to develop products that tackle rare diseases and childhood illnesses.
And, in an ageing society, medicines will play an important role in ensuring active and healthy ageing - with all its attendant economic and human benefits.
For the industries involved, there are a range of specific issues which are being presented to you today.
But we need to be aware that an increasingly global industry is less likely to prioritise investment in research for the treatments which Europeans will need in 10-20 years' time if they are dealing with a fragmented and unpredictable market.
In other words, whilst there will be no shortage of sure-fire lifestyle wonder drugs like Viagra, how can we be sure that the medicines needed to tackle arthritis, Alzheimer's and obesity, to name but a few, will be developed?
It is only by moving towards a more predictable market environment across Europe that we will be in a position to convince industry to take the needs of Europeans seriously in the years ahead.
The High Level Committee on Health has stated that the public health goal of pharmaceuticals policy is 'to make readily accessible, efficacious, high quality and safe medicines, including their most recent innovative ones, to all those who need them, regardless of income or social status'.
Each of these issues has been addressed in this communication.
We have effectively highlighted patients' needs for better information and their need for a stronger voice to influence policy.
Efforts in both these areas will support their growing role as important decision-makers for health care.
The establishment of an EU-funded European Patients' Platform in February this year is an important step.
We have also targeted the medicines themselves, to build up systems that ensure their safety, quality and efficacy.
Here the G10 put the need for stronger systems of pharmacovigilance and relative effectiveness firmly on the agenda.
In this way we aim to improve the rational use of medicines.
This is a public health goal that underpins our vision for the pharmaceuticals sector.
Relative effectiveness is a very important issue for the European Union.
In June 2000 the Council underlined the importance of added therapeutic value both in terms of health protection and from an industrial policy perspective.
Effective medicines must get quickly to the people who need them.
This means identifying which medicines are genuinely effective, not just in the controlled environment of a clinical trial, but in general use amongst the wider population.
This is the critical issue at stake here.
Relative effectiveness is one key tool towards rational use.
But, clearly, we have to consider the role of other actors too.
How can we improve rational use of pharmaceuticals at the level of the health care prescriber and the consumer?
A parallel question might be: how can we know if we have improved the rational use of pharmaceuticals?
This brings me to the issue of benchmarking.
The recommendation to develop indicators for public health has set us a big challenge. For example, to investigate indicators that could monitor what is happening at the health-care prescriber level.
Ultimately, the intention is to have a set of indicators that can shed light on what is happening in the pharmaceuticals sector of Member States in terms of the extent to which public health needs are being met and in this way to inform policy development at national and European level.
Finally, the discussion on enlargement is particularly timely.
The accession treaties have been signed.
Although enlargement is one specific recommendation of the G10, clearly our responses to each recommendation need to adequately reflect the changing environment within the European Union.
The G10 is a first important step to developing a strategic vision of the future health needs of Europeans which is affordable, effective, transparent, inclusive and safe.
Properly pursued it will be good for the health of all concerned.
Thank you, Commissioner Liikanen.
This debate will be conducted according to what we call the catch-the-eye procedure.
Mrs Roth-Behrendt has succeeded in catching my eye, and she has the floor.
Mr President, it is a pleasure for me to be able to catch your eye.
I have just one question for the Commissioners.
Do you not think that there is a certain contradiction inherent in the recommendations?
If you are in favour of more incentives for research in order to get better medicines to the patients more quickly, and if all the G10 countries have said so too, then why does it appear from the policy agreement on the pharmaceuticals package as if the provision being made for data protection, as regards the creation of a return on innovations, is insufficiently long-term, so that research is not being driven forward?
Do you not also think that the safest and best way of providing patients quickly with better medicines would, in principle, be a fast and simple central procedure, and that it would be better if the Commission and the Member States were to hand out more money for research projects and at last get round to submitting the new legislation on children's medicines to Parliament?
That would enable us to do something more quickly about getting people better medicines.
.
Mr President, I must emphasise that the two proposals are separate as far as the review is concerned.
The review is supported by G10 and now has the support of the Member States.
The G10 process goes further, and so far there has not been any broad discussion in the Member States about that.
There is, firstly, a proposal from the Group and today there are the recommendations from the Commission.
Next week the Italian Presidency is organising a conference on G10 on the basis of the Commission recommendations.
We hope that the dissemination of these messages goes forward.
As I said, it is now important to get the review through. That is important for research-based industries because it strengthens their position; it accelerates the access to markets for new products; it acts as a counterbalance; and it also means that generics will be more competitive when the patents expire.
Mr President, having worked for over thirty years for one of the major international pharmaceutical companies, I can tell you that the main concern of this industry, whether European or otherwise, is neither people's health - and especially not the health of people who cannot afford to pay for their medicines - nor the well-being of its employees, whom it does not hesitate to make redundant by the thousand whenever a merger or concentration takes place in the sector or to drive hard, day and night, even the women, in manufacturing and packing medicines.
These practices are all the more scandalous because the pharmaceuticals industry is one of the most profitable of all.
The sole concern of this industry is the financial well-being of its shareholders.
Before bringing out a new medicine, the major companies first undertake marketing studies, which determine whether research in the field is continued or stopped.
This means that companies are only interested in illnesses that generate money.
Too bad if a growing number of men and women find it harder and harder to look after themselves; too bad if in Africa and elsewhere, children are still dying in this day and age of easily curable diseases such as measles, and too bad for those people suffering from malaria or other diseases that affect the populations of poor countries.
The only decision that could satisfy both the employees of these companies and patients - in rich countries and in the developing world - would be for this industry no longer to be a private industry in which only the interests of a minority count, and for it to be placed under the control of the people, for the benefit of everyone.
Thank you, Mrs Bordes.
Let me just point out that, in a debate of the sort we are having at the moment, the idea is to put questions rather than just make speeches.
I would ask you to again read the Rules of Procedure in order to see just how this works.
That way, there will be no misunderstandings between us next time.
Mr President, I must admit that I am pleased to hear Mr Byrne side with consumers against the pharmaceutical industry.
We had the feeling, when addressing the pharmaceutical industry dossier and pharmaceutical legislation at the same time, that it was actually the European Parliament that was defending consumers, through far-reaching amendments, in particular on marketing authorisations, on centralised procedure and on consumer protection.
The Commission's answers to these questions, let us remember, were not what the European Parliament had hoped to hear.
Fortunately, I have the impression today that the Council has reintroduced a number of items, such as the five-year renewal, marketing authorisations, the centralised procedure and stopping direct advertising to patients.
All of this leads me to ask you whether your communication will accept a good number of the amendments to pharmaceutical legislation that Parliament has adopted by a large majority, particularly in the fields of direct advertising, consumer participation in the EMEA, centralised procedure and modifying marketing authorisation dossiers, as real proof of your concern to protect consumers and patients?
.
Mr President, that discussion has already been held in a different context when I commented on Parliament's amendments, but I would like to say briefly that the Commission welcomes Parliament's support for the centralised procedure.
We now we propose that it be applied for all active substances and Parliament supported this.
Now the Council has reached a political agreement which goes in the same direction, but in a rather narrower fashion.
It will limit the application of the centralised procedure to four illnesses, but within the legislation, in the Council's opinion, there should be a particular Article which would allow for the enlargement of the scope of the centralised procedure.
Regarding information for patients in that area, discussions continue but it seems to be that the majority in the Council and the majority in Parliament are not so far from each other.
This is not the same as the Commission's position, but I respect the outcome of the legislative procedure.
The Commission has never proposed direct-to-consumer advertising.
It only supports the provision of controlled information for patients, patient groups and so on. Anyone who today has access to the Internet sees a massive amount of direct spam advertising on medicines, which is growing every day.
It would be better for consumers if they knew which websites were trustworthy, where there is scrutiny by the authorities or whether they could trust the quality of the information.
On that issue, it seems that Parliament and Council are on the same wavelength in being very prudent on the issue of information for patients.
We will of course return to this in second reading.
Commissioners, among your numerous proposals, you referred to the added value of medicines.
I believe that this is a crucial point.
A large number of new medicines now coming onto the market are, unfortunately, rarely innovative.
What practical measures do you envisage for encouraging industry to produce not only new but also innovative medicines?
You also raised the issue of the European computer portal.
New Zealand, for whom I have appointed myself spokesperson, is currently working on just such a system and wonders whether our contribution to this system will be medicine-centred or disease-centred and, in the latter case, whether the answers provided will revolve around medicinal therapy or whether other, replacement therapies will be proposed on these sites.
.
Mr President, in reply to the first question, if there is real work on the new indications, which really means new innovations, then supplementary protection data exclusivity can be guaranteed.
As far as efficiency factors are concerned, our position is that authorisation should be science-based but of course, once the authorities of the Member States decide which medicines they reimburse by public funds, they can reinforce that by different studies of their efficiency and that is supported also by G10.
In that area G10 is proposing, and the Commission is supporting that proposal, that more exchanges of information on best practice and these kinds of efficiency studies could be undertaken in future.
Regarding the second question, of course it is very much in the hands of Member States.
There is very different legislation in Member States, whereby patients are being directed to use different solutions, either only the product which traditionally has been under patent or at the same time generics, when generics are inside the market.
On the European level perhaps the emphasis is not there; it should be more on the national level.
Mr President, Commissioner, the pharmaceutical industry is not doing all that well.
There is a lack of innovation.
That is why there is the temptation to provide better protection for existing products or produce minor variations on them, and prices remain unacceptably high.
Your communication is therefore very well-timed.
You were both right in saying that the patient must be placed at the centre of the debate, but the question is, of course, who that patient is.
As one of the previous speakers already remarked, patients in developing countries are still faced with a shortage of medicines.
In actual fact, no, or hardly any, research is being done into diseases of the developing countries.
I would therefore want to ask you what initiatives you intend to take in order to give research into the neglected diseases a shot in the arm, so much so that the pharmaceutical industry as a whole will also enjoy the benefits.
. Mr President, as far as the developing countries are concerned, there are three main possibilities in terms of action: firstly, to create a legislative framework that encourages research on orphan drugs to treat what are on our territories rare diseases.
There, we have a directive that was adopted by Parliament some time ago, and that framework is in place.
Secondly, the question is that if that is not enough to provide an incentive for research work, the question of public research funding can be raised.
I am sorry that Mr Busquin, the Commissioner for Research, is not here.
I am sure he would be in a position to provide a more detailed reply to that.
Thirdly, there are the issues of the needs of developing countries, which are based on the low level of income and lower purchasing power of the citizens.
In that area, there has been some progress in recent years.
The issue is still being discussed in the WTO context on the one hand.
On the other, there have been schemes which have allowed developing countries to purchase certain medicines at a lower price than in Europe.
Things are moving, but I am sure that the situation today is far from satisfactory.
. Mr President, I would like to add briefly to what Commissioner Liikanen has just said in answer to that question.
There is a group of Commissioners which includes myself, the Commissioner for Development, the Commissioner for Trade and the Commissioner for Research.
This group is concerned with the very issue you are talking about, that is, to focus on diseases in the developing world.
This group is focusing in particular on the diseases of malaria, HIV and tuberculosis.
I expect that more information will be made available on that issue as time passes.
I would also mention that one of the objectives that has been stated by the Italian Presidency, by the incoming minister for health, is to make progress on the disease of malaria.
That is one of the objectives of the Italian Presidency.
Mr President, Commissioners, I wish to take up the thrust of the speech by Mrs Corbey, with whom I worked on drawing up a programme under Article 169 of the EC Treaty relating to the Sixth Framework Programme, for Research and Development on diseases prevalent in the countries of the southern hemisphere.
She asked you about the difficulty of attracting researchers to this field.
You replied that Commissioner Busquin could have given us further answers on the matter.
Without wishing to put words into the Commissioner's mouth, I simply wish to say that there appears to be very little enthusiasm in the private sector for contributing to the amount of appropriations earmarked for the programme I have just referred to, under Article 169.
Since you work together, you might perhaps know about this: could you confirm or deny the information that I have in this field concerning the lack of private funds raised to implement this programme to combat Aids, malaria and tuberculosis?
Do you also have information about whether States have agreed to this programme and consequently whether public funds are being harnessed?
Since the European Parliament voted for this report at first reading, we have not had much news.
This question stretches the scope of today's debate, but it involves the same issues and, this being the case, I would be extremely grateful for any answer you might be able to give me.
. Mr President, the work that is being undertaken on this issue, by the Commissioners involved, is ongoing, as I indicated earlier.
It is hoped that there will be greater involvement of the private sector in this issue, because we have ambitions to make some progress on that.
I also know from the work that has been undertaken by Commissioner Lamy in relation to the provision of drugs to developing countries that this is an issue that is being discussed in the context of the Doha Round.
He has expectations that there will be progress on this issue because it was one of the undertakings that was given in Doha at the commencement of the discussions.
The expectation is that developing countries will insist on some progress before there is any finality.
I expect and hope there will be some outcome on this before Cancun.
Mr President, Commissioners, I congratulate you on the speech you have just given.
I will confine myself merely to asking Commissioner Liikanen a few questions.
At the start of his speech, he drew our attention to the state of the European pharmaceutical industry, pointing out that it is less competitive than it once was and that, although it is one of the most important industries in Europe, it has now lost its pre-eminence to the United States.
I would like, then, to make a short comment to the effect that the future of Europe - Europe's destiny - is being determined today above all in its laboratories and research centres.
That is why Commissioner Liikanen's observation left me troubled, more troubled than I already was.
So I would ask him this: might the legislative framework under development in Europe and the inflexible system of research regulations in the field of biotechnology, for example, not constitute a major obstacle to European industry's acquiring or recovering competitiveness?
I know that this is not what many of my fellow Members wish to hear, who, for philosophical or ideological reasons, are imposing a virtual veto on biotech development, but I felt obliged to put this question to you, Commissioner.
. I should just like to say a word about the pending research.
Public research is very important but it is very clear that, even in the EU, objectives of devoting 3% of GDP to research by 2010 is based on the concept that 1% of GDP would come from public sources, 2% of GDP would come from the private sector.
Whatever happens in public spending, we never will have enough resources to achieve 3%.
For that reason, the regulatory framework has to be judged so that intellectual property rights are protected in such a way that private money will go to the sector.
Whether you like it or not, that is very simple, clear economic logic.
On biotechnology, I am sure you are at least partly right.
In the Commission we have accepted the biotechnology action plan, which we follow in a strict way.
In general in the field of so-called 'red biotechnology', which is connected to pharmaceutical industries, perhaps the situation is slightly better.
When you go to the other branches of biotechnological research we have a lot of work to do.
Today my colleagues Mr Byrne and Mrs WallstrÃ¶m talked about the GMO area. There are also other issues in this field.
If we want to lead in the field of pharmaceutical research we cannot separate different chapters of biotechnological research.
We need intellectual property rights, we need sufficient financing.
We also need public opinion that supports novelties and innovation in the market.
At the end of the day that is always critical.
No research can have financing unless there is a market.
There is no market unless consumers have confidence in the products that come out of research and manufacturing.
Mr President, I wanted to ask a brief question about the European Patients' Platform and to ask the two Commissioners whether they are happy about the degree of independence of those who represent patients.
I do so against the background of articles published in the British Medical Journal in the United Kingdom.
If the Commissioners have not had sight of these articles I would be happy to let them have them.
We all understand that without the support of the pharmaceuticals industry there would be very few patients' voices, but that voice does not come without a price.
I would be interested in your views on that.
. Mr President, as Mrs Read said, it is of absolute critical importance that the platform is seen to be, and is, independent and does its work in a manner that is going to add value to this entire issue.
I have not heard any suggestions that there is any infirmity in this area.
I take note of what you say in relation to that issue and will enquire about it personally when I leave the Chamber.
However, I have to assure you that I have not heard this, I do not have those apprehensions and I have confidence in the platform.
Question No 31 by Carlos Lage (H-0393/03):
Subject: Reform of the common fisheries policy and the stability principle
During the European Parliament's debate and vote on the reform of the common fisheries policy, much support was expressed for the principle of relative stability in the management of fisheries resources - a principle which is doubly advantageous since, on the one hand, it will help to ensure that resources are better managed and conserved (which is one of the main objectives of the reform) and, on the other, it will prevent undesirable conflicts which impede the development of harmonious relations between fishing peoples and communities.
This is what is happening today, for example, all along the Portuguese coast, where people are becoming increasingly concerned and are rebelling against the EU authorities.
What action is the Commission intending to take in order to secure acceptance of the above principle and thereby reassure fishermen and the general public?
.
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Lage's question addresses the issue of access to Portuguese continental waters, which features in the Council's consideration of the new regime applicable to Western waters.
The Commission's task in this is to ensure that two principles are maintained, the first being the principle of relative stability, which is laid down in Article 20 of the new framework regulation for the common fisheries policy.
This principle, according to which fishing opportunities are to be shared out among the Member States, applies, of course, to Portugal and to Portuguese waters.
Another principle in the common fisheries policy, in addition to this one, is that of free access to waters outside the twelve-mile-zone, which is laid down in Article 17 of the new framework regulation, and which is of fundamental importance.
When dealing with the issue of access to Portuguese continental waters, the Commission clearly has to adopt the same approach as it does to all other Community waters.
Although all Member States have to have access to waters outside the twelve-mile-zone, this access can be restricted on biological grounds, but restrictions of this sort must not be discriminatory in their effects.
For that reason, it is not possible in law to protect fish stocks by denying fishermen from a neighbouring country access to these waters.
There is a solution, however, and the right one is to have relative stability, together with total allowable catches, quotas for stocks of economic importance, and any further technical measures that may prove necessary.
Thank you for your response, Commissioner.
That was a formal response based on principles, the principle of relative stability and the principle of freedom of access.
There is a certain contradiction implied between these principles, although commenting on this is irrelevant at present.
This formal and abstract framework does, however, conflict with a situation that cannot be ignored at either the political or ethical levels.
I am referring to the fact that Portuguese territorial waters have the misfortune to lie next to the territorial waters of Spain, which owns the largest fishing fleet in Europe, one which hungers to find new fishing grounds and shows a ravenous appetite, not always adhering strictly to the rules.
This is causing fury among Portuguese fishermen, as well as great anxiety and indignation in Portuguese public opinion, so much so that all the reactionaries and nationalists in the country, who have been keeping quiet because the European project is a success for both Europe and Portugal, are taking advantage of the situation.
They are making irate speeches against a Europe which wants to deprive Portuguese fishermen of their fish and allow uncontrolled and alien fishing in Portuguese waters.
This is a political problem which the Commissioner and the Union have to face.
.
(DE) Mr President, I am aware that various sections of Portuguese society have reacted in this way, but you will also understand that the only option open to us is that of acting within the legal framework available to us.
I have told you that there is a solution in practical terms, above all if the Spanish and the Portuguese are willing to meet each other halfway when quotas are laid down.
What is actually at issue, and of the essence, here is sardine fishery, for which, in this stretch of sea, no quota has been set up until now.
We are, however, prepared to set such a quota, and it stands to reason that, when this is done, it will be possible to specify how much of this quota is to be fished by Portuguese and Spanish fishermen respectively.
We would then have a solution that would, I believe, be acceptable to everyone.
Question No 32 by Proinsias De Rossa (H-0405/03):
Subject: EU support for the ILO's International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour
On 13 June 2002, the European Parliament adopted a resolution on child labour in the production of sports equipment which, inter alia, called for more funds to be made available to the ILO's International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour (Paragraph 9).
In the light of this resolution and of the Commission's answer to my Oral Question (H-0515/02
.
Mr President, the European Commission shares the concerns expressed about the use of child labour in general and, particularly, in the production of sports equipment.
The Commission is establishing a strategic partnership with the ILO as a follow-up to the communication on building an effective partnership with the United Nations in the fields of development and humanitarian affairs and the communication on promoting core labour standards and social governance.
In that context, careful attention will be given to possible support for the ILO's International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour.
Annual high-level meetings between the Commission and the ILO are held in the framework of the cooperation between the two organisations agreed in May 2001.
The next high-level meeting will take place on 8 July 2003 - a week from now.
The Community is increasing its support for universal and compulsory primary education in all developing countries.
It sees this as one of the most efficient means currently at its disposal to draw children out of the vicious circle of exploitation.
We place great emphasis on working with the ILO on this issue, both because of the problem of child labour as such, and because this is an area in which most people understand the whole rationale of strengthening governance and the rights that the ILO is working for.
I wish to thank Commissioner Nielson for his reply.
I am pleased that steps are being taken by the Commissioner to follow up on the commitments already made, and look forward to the outcome of the meeting on 8 July.
The global statistics for the involvement of children in labour are really astonishing, particularly when you see the breakdown, where it is estimated that something like two million children globally are involved in prostitution and pornography and approximately six million children are in bonded or forced labour.
The global figure is something close to 200 million for child labour.
Could the Commissioner indicate in what way we can hope to measure the success of the ILO and the European Union's efforts in this area?
In addition, could he indicate how we can discourage the major sports companies which sell sports shoes and clothing at inflated prices in European stores?
How can we avoid the situation that, when they come under pressure in India, they move to China to carry on exactly the same trade?
.
This has to be focused on in all parts of the world.
The main side here is as criminal as the production side.
Very little is decided in these activities without being defined by the market in our rich part of the world.
There is the 'Red Card to Child Labour' action being taken by FIFA and the ILO to jointly combat child labour, a very good campaign that directly addresses exactly the problem we are talking about here.
Matching this with the broader work of increasing respect for the basic principles that the ILO stands for will, I hope, make a difference.
The measurement of progress here can be made in many ways.
One is to see how many countries actually sign up to the legal instruments.
This debate is one that we are pushing quite vigorously with our development partners.
Question No 33 by Camilo Nogueira RomÃ¡n (H-0356/03):
Subject: The association between Mercosur and the European Union in the light of the new political situation in Brazil and Argentina. Economic relations with both countries
What stage has been reached in the planned association between the European Union and Mercosur six months after the election of LuÃ­s InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva as President of Brazil and now that Argentina has elected Nestor Kirchner as its new President, bearing in mind that both leaders have clearly signalled their intention to develop relations between the two countries further and to give Mercosur a fresh impetus?
In this context, can it say what the state of economic relations between the Union and these two countries is?
Mr President, Mr Nogueira RomÃ¡n's question raises three points.
First, the state of the negotiations between the Union and Mercosur; secondly, the effect of Mr Kirchner's election as President of Argentina and, lastly, issues of economic cooperation between the Union and Mercosur to facilitate integration in that region.
Let us look first at the state of the negotiations.
As you know, we relaunched the process last year and, since then, negotiators on both sides have been working relentlessly to make progress on its various aspects.
These are complex negotiations, which address services and regulations and the trade in goods.
Last year in Rio, we therefore adopted a schedule and we are sticking to it.
Proposals on tariffs, which were furthermore of a high quality, were exchanged.
Since March of this year, the pace has been relaxed.
Some progress has also been made on rules of origin, investments, tenders, dispute settlement, trade facilitation, standardisation and technical regulation.
This all bodes well.
The March negotiations also enabled us to prepare an exchange of ideas on services, investment and on procurement contracts, which took place at the end of May, although we were rather disappointed with the proposals put forward by our Mercosur partners.
As you see, we are still actively pursuing these negotiations and we have confidence in our partners' desire to get there.
One negotiating round was concluded last week in AsunciÃ³n.
We must continue to make progress because much remains to be done, not least because our friends in Mercosur are anxious for the Union to make a gesture.
We will only make such a gesture, should this prove necessary, in the context of an overall balance, which has not yet been fully achieved.
Optimism about the state of the negotiations must, therefore, be relative.
It is probably premature at this stage to take the decision on launching the final phase of negotiations - always an important time - because there are many issues involved and this takes time.
We are considering this step, particularly because these negotiations - especially in the field of agriculture - cannot be separated, in terms of a bargaining chip for the EU, from what is happening in the multilateral context of the World Trade Organisation.
We look favourably on Mr Kirchner's election as President of Argentina and on the various statements by Presidents Lula and Kirchner on the future of Mercosur.
Both of these undoubtedly wanted to convey to Mercosur, in other words Paraguay and Uruguay, to Latin America and more generally, to the entire world, their desire and their will to strengthen the process of integrating Mercosur.
We can only welcome these statements.
Latin American integration is one of the European Union's political priorities and this is why we initially felt that we should negotiate with Mercosur as a whole.
We therefore wish to hold 'one-on-one' negotiations and not 'one-on-four' as is done in other areas such as the North-South America free trade zone.
I have also said, moreover, and have said so publicly to our partners in Mercosur, that the EU's trade ambitions towards Mercosur are in line with Mercosur's own ambition in the field of political, economic and commercial integration.
What means, then, are we making available to Mercosur under economic cooperation?
There is first of all our action at regional level: we have a regional Mercosur/European Union strategy on contributing to the completion of Mercosur's internal market and, for the 2000-2006 period, this amounts to just over EUR one million.
We are committing more than EUR 10 million in the same period to Mercosur's institutionalisation and there is a third chapter of assistance for civil society.
Our experience as Europeans enables us to contribute to the completion of the internal market, of commercial integration, of the statistical system, of the system of veterinary and phytosanitary standards and to harmonising technical regulations; in short, to anything that requires cross-border instruments.
We are familiar with these issues because we have faced them ourselves in the recent past.
Furthermore, we have also developed cooperation strategies with a number of Mercosur countries involving sums of around EUR 200 million for the period that I have just mentioned.
These strategies can also contribute to supporting regional integration, economic reform and social development.
Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay have a real need to pursue thoroughgoing reform.
We shall continue to support this course of action at economic, social and political levels.
Commissioner, your speech took the words right out of my mouth, since I was actually going to say that Commissioner Lamy has always answered my questions fully.
I am very grateful to you for that, as I am always grateful to you for your answers to my questions during Parliamentary Question Time.
In any event, I would like to say, before asking one last question, that the members of the Delegation for relations with the countries of South America and Mercosur have just returned from Brasilia.
We held meetings with members of the Brazilian Government, with parliamentary leaders, with the President of Congress, and with President Lula's principal advisors, and we realised once again that we are dealing here with an extraordinary country, which is setting in motion an exemplary social inclusion programme, which will be crucial to its future.
As the Commissioner knows, this country also enjoys privileged economic relations with Europe, in addition to the traditional relations of cultural kinship.
In addition, I myself have just spent a month and a half in Argentina, on political business, and have seen the progress that the country has made.
Mercosur sees its connections with the European Union as a historical relationship between sister states, as a partnership which is essential in order to avoid subordination to the United States.
That is why I ask whether the Commission is prepared to give special priority in future to its relations with Mercosur, and perhaps with the whole of South America, which may possibly join Mercosur.
Mr President, my response to what the honourable Member has just suggested is broadly 'yes', in that we have clearly made Latin America's southern cone region one of our priorities, because these countries themselves have decided to work on integrating with one another.
Our idea is that these efforts will be reproduced in other places, in the future, perhaps with the Andean community, perhaps with the communities of Central America.
This concept of regional integration that we wish to encourage is therefore positive, not because it systematically converts everyone to the European model, but because we believe that, since these countries themselves have decided that integration is in their interest, they deserve our full and unremitting support.
Question No 34 by Bernd Posselt (H-0380/03):
Subject: Foreign trade with southern Africa
What is the Commission's view of foreign trade developments between the EU and the countries in sub-Saharan Africa?
I shall try to answer Mr Posselt's question about trade relations between Africa and the European Union as briefly as I can.
In trading matters, we are clearly Africa's main partner, with bilateral trade worth around EUR 150 billion, according to the figures for 2000, in other words, just under half of all Africa's external trade.
This being the case, if we look at the matter in terms of trends, and more particularly of the trend to which the question refers, that is, trade between the Union and countries located south of the Sahara, the rate of change is clearly slow. If we look at the ACP countries in the sub-Saharan zone, the trend is for slight average growth, with some slumps, and I shall return to this.
It is, in any event, lower than the growth in world trade.
In the long term, the trend is for a slight increase, with total exports to Europe to the tune of EUR 30 billion.
And, as I said, within this trend for a slow average increase there are occasional slumps.
This was the case, for example, between 2001 and 2002, despite the 'Everything but arms' initiative which, in that period, provided around EUR 90 million for the whole of 2002, which was the first full year in which the system was implemented.
The 'Everything but arms' initiative, therefore, to some extent offset the slump observed in 2001 and 2002.
Beyond the figures, the main problem lies in the make-up of trade and exports from those countries, which still contains structural weaknesses because it is essentially dominated by some basic products, such as oil, diamonds and cocoa.
Furthermore, around one third of exports from African countries to Europe consist of farm produce, which also makes our market the major outlet for African exports.
How can we improve the situation?
I think that the concept involves trying to improve these countries' abilities to export to us and to diversify their economies.
In order to achieve this we have a policy that has now stabilised and is one with which the European Parliament is familiar, because we discuss it often: first of all, stepping up regional integration amongst African countries themselves; second, strengthening economic and trade links between these countries and the EU; and lastly, gradually integrating African countries into the world economy, because we cannot lay claim to an exclusive relationship with them and nor would this be in their interests.
To help us achieve this aim we also have a framework - the Cotonou framework - as well as negotiations on economic partnership agreements, which are making progress.
At multilateral level, we have the framework of the WTO.
This is why we are now in continuous discussion, if I may put it this way, with our African colleagues, not only in the context of regional relations - and I am here talking about the negotiations on economic partnership agreements - but also multilaterally, given the topicality of the Doha round of negotiations.
In this context, we Europeans clearly have a partial responsibility to ensure that all these negotiations meet Africa's needs because, in my opinion, our African friends now have the means, which they did not have in the past, themselves to identify how this type of negotiation can best meet their needs.
Mr President, I am obliged to the Commissioner for his reply.
As we know, we tend to see Africa as very largely characterised by single industries; on the other hand, though, Africans see Europe as very much made up of conglomerates.
What I want to ask you is what the Commission is doing in order - and I do know that this is in practice very difficult - to build up cooperation between sub-Saharan Africa and the European Union as regards small and medium-sized enterprises.
There is virtually nothing moving on that front.
I would like to know what is being done in the area of cooperation between small and medium-sized enterprises.
Although most small businesses still do not dare to venture into the region, I do believe that they would make very important partners for Africa, if it is not to be dominated by single industries and conglomerates to the exclusion of all else.
Your question is most pertinent.
From the African point of view, constructing the economic fabric must clearly entail creating small businesses.
It is also true that such businesses generally have less access than larger ones to international finance procedures.
Having said that, with what we are doing in the field of development aid and technical assistance for training, with what we are doing to encourage trade and with what the European Investment Bank is now doing - and God knows it is putting enough effort into it! - in this region, the volume and the number of instruments available to the entrepreneurial initiative are, I believe, experiencing rapid growth.
Investment is necessary even if it only pays off in the medium and long term and even if we have to wait until a reasonably sophisticated level of development has been achieved to ensure that small businesses - which are by definition much more reticent about taking risks than large companies - participate actively in the type of trade that we want to promote.
I would like to ask the Commissioner whether he agrees with the President of the United States of America that perhaps Europe's position on trade in genetically modified crops is having an effect on our trade with the southern African countries in agricultural products, thereby affecting their ability to feed themselves?
The answer to Mr Purvis's question is no.
We do not agree with these statements and I have furthermore discussed the matter with the President, in a frank and direct way, as recently as last week at the EU-US Summit, which was held in Washington.
Mr Purvis, we do not agree with this position and we sought to ensure that the President of the United States was informed of the matter, as they say in English, 'straight from the horse's mouth'.
One of the reasons we do not agree is that we consider this to be an argument of dubious merit, used in an entirely justified cause and which is intended to promote the interests of GMO agri-food exports by the United States.
There are other ways of proceeding, however, such as reducing food aid in kind, as we have done, in order to provide food aid in cash.
In Africa in particular, we have funded food aid at regional level.
Consequently, every country has choices to make, for or against GMOs, and we must not impose these choices on them.
We simply hope that these countries retain their freedom to decide and their sovereignty.
In order to ensure this, we simply have to reduce food aid in kind and increase financial aid for food, in line, furthermore, with the regulations of the various United Nations food programmes.
You are quite right.
In many cases I, like you, have noted that our joint efforts in the fields of promoting development, trade and human rights on this continent come up against political problems.
I also believe that African leaders and the governments of these countries are more aware now than in the past of the need to address, both on their own and with one another, a number of political obstacles of this type.
Programmes such as NEPAD - which we support because our work on regional integration in Africa closely mirrors the strategy adopted by this new partnership - are, in my opinion, moving in the same direction.
I repeat; you are quite right.
This being the case, what we have is a chicken and egg situation, in which the chicken is probably political and the egg is probably economic.
Nevertheless, given the state of the world, we cannot refrain from using the eggs available to us in order to take things forward.
This is a daily chore that requires patience.
If we manage to convince a number of economic operators to work towards an environment that is more stable, less conflict-ridden and less disjointed, we could perhaps, here and there, create pressure for peace.
If, on the other hand, communities and those who appoint their leaders are not interested, we will find it much more difficult to achieve our aim.
Politicians certainly have a responsibility to free up some of these economic resources, but let us not stop working from the bottom up. This, I believe, would be a mistake.
Question No 35 by Glenys Kinnock (H-0392/03):
Subject: WTO - TRIPS
What is the Commission's response to the concerns from the ACP about lack of agreement on the implementation of Paragraph 6 of the Declaration on TRIPS and public health?
Whilst the Declaration as a whole is an important step forward in the campaign for access to medicines, would the Commission agree that any attempt to restrict the agreement to a set list of diseases would be damaging?
Mrs Kinnock, the Commission shares your concern and your disquiet about the lack of an agreement that should have been concluded under the Doha declaration on the links between the TRIPs agreement on intellectual property and public health.
As you probably know, the current blockage is the result of the US refusal to accept a compromise proposal which has been on the table in Geneva since December 2002 and which has been accepted by all Members of the World Trade Organisation except the United States and this is precisely wherein the problem lies.
Our position on this matter is simple: Doha, and nothing but Doha.
The compromise text of last December and nothing but the compromise text.
Recently, furthermore - last month, to be precise - we submitted a written communication to the TRIPs Council and thus to the WTO, to remind them of our proposals and to insist that technical assistance is provided. This will enable us, once the problem is resolved, to implement the acquis of the Doha declaration.
We also agree with the ACP countries' view on the need to maintain the scope of the Doha declaration.
We believe that the Doha mandate is a broad one and this is acknowledged in the text that has been on the table since last December.
We have always maintained this position, and this is why we proposed, at the beginning of the year, to call on the World Health Organisation to re-establish confidence and to find a way out of the current impasse.
Our strategy remains the same.
We want the Americans to accept the compromise text that has been on the table since December, without diminishing the scope of the text, where diseases are concerned.
We will continue to make every effort to find a solution before the Cancun ministerial conference.
