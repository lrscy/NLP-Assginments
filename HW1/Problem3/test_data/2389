I would like to mention a few issues regarding foreign policy in the Convention.
The new document presented to us here defines the objectives of the European Union's foreign policy.
It goes without saying that we wish to use our foreign policy to promote human rights, democracy and environmental protection.
But there is one thing that is rather skimmed over here.
For me, it is self-evident that the first and most important objective of the European Union must be the Common Foreign and Security Policy, in other words effectively representing the interests of the EU's citizens and the interests of the European Union itself on the world stage, and in particular our citizens' desire to live in peace and security.
There are some things in this field that should not be allowed to happen again.
We as the European Union should not be left without a voice, as happened on Iraq.
Hence our demand that we should introduce majority voting in this area, because only in that way can the European Union act effectively in the field of foreign policy.
What we also need is an EU security strategy as a counterpart to the security strategy published by the American administration in September last year.
We as Europeans need to adopt a clear position on a number of issues here - first the United States' claim to leadership and second the statements made here about a preventive war.
We know that Mr Solana has been charged with the task of presenting a proposal to the Heads of State and Government for Thessaloniki.
However, that can only be a first step in this debate.
The debate needs to be an open one and it needs to be held in the European Parliament, because we Europeans must, on the basis of a wide-ranging debate, reach a common position on these important issues.
We have to ask ourselves what the position on a division of labour with the United States is.
Do we want a situation in which we leave military intervention to the United States, with Europe looking after the financial mopping up, as people sometimes call it?
Or do we want to agree that Europe should play a regional role here, for example the task of guaranteeing peace and security in its own geographical region?
These are important and vital decisions in which Parliament, too, should be involved.
Above all, we Europeans should make it clear that the EUR 160 billion spent by the 15 EU Member States on defence need to be spent more efficiently in future, and if we want to be up there with the United States we will also need to spend more money, hard though that may be!
Now, what is Parliament's role in all this?
For example, the Military Committee in Brussels is discussing intervention in the Congo.
That should not happen without Parliament being consulted.
We should be kept informed about that; we should have an opportunity to deliver an opinion on it.
If war and peace are at stake, things like this cannot be decided without consulting a directly elected parliament, and in this case that is this House.
As a consequence this House needs to adopt an opinion on this important subject at the very least next week and beyond that, because careful consideration is needed as to whether with its present organisation the European Union is in a position to take on such a role.
Mr President, I would first of all like to join in warmly congratulating the Greek Presidency.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Thessaloniki offers you the opportunity to strengthen the Union's immigration policies and to improve the measures for offering security to European citizens.
These are two essential, but different, objectives.
You must confront the new threats resulting from organised crime, whose tentacles stretch throughout and beyond the European Union, and you have instruments for doing so, such as the European arrest warrant and Europol.
Strengthen them and use them to combat large-scale international crime and also small-scale crime, the crime which fills our streets with beggars, children and prostitutes, victims of human trafficking, but please do so using the instruments necessary for each issue.
A member of Al Qaeda is not an illegal immigrant who indulges in terrorism, but an international criminal.
And you must manage immigration, which is a different thing, a complex social phenomenon which should be dealt with from different angles.
Do that, please. Return to the global and integrated vision laid down at Tampere.
Return to the map drawn up by the Commission, adopt the legislative framework envisaged, apply the measures proposed by the Commission with regard to third countries, integration, employment, with regard to all the issues relating to this field.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the majority of illegal immigrants enter the Union legally.
The majority of illegal immigrants are domestic employees working in our homes.
A danger to the European Union?
To whom?
And above all, please, please call things by their real name.
If the leaders of the European Union are going to persist in mixing international organised crime with immigration we are going to have a problem.
If we tell the citizens that immigration, even if the adjective illegal is added, is one of the new dangers to be confronted by the Union, we should not be surprised if it leads to excessive reactions, we should not be surprised if it creates a problem with the citizens of the Union and their perception of immigration.
Mr President, there is a fundamental requirement that should always be made of a constitution, irrespective of whether it is a national constitution or the constitution of the European Union. That requirement is clarity: clarity when it comes both to the distribution of power and to well-defined competences.
As a Swede, I have an unhappy experience of the devising of constitutions.
When the Swedish constitution - our fundamental law - was adopted, far too many questions were left unanswered.
The Swedish Parliament - the Riksdag - was given more or less unlimited power to take decisions on just about every issue on the basis of a simple majority.
Thanks to a unique Swedish tradition, freedom of expression and freedom of the press retained their strong position, but the political authorities were given the go-ahead to put their fingers into every pie.
This mistake of Sweden's must not be repeated in a constitution for the European Union.
The most important thing must be to devise a clear catalogue of competences explaining which tasks are to be carried out by the EU and which are to be carried out at national, or some other, level.
There are proposals to make social issues with shared competence matters for the EU.
As I see it, that would be an historic mistake.
Such issues are best dealt with by each individual Member State.
Moreover, I see no other way of proceeding in an enlarged EU with a huge range of economic conditions from one country to the next.
In the same way, all essential aspects of economic policy must remain the responsibility of the Member States.
The euro is the Member States' common responsibility, implying budgetary discipline.
Taxes and decisions on expenditure must, however, remain the responsibility of the individual nations.
There are large differences between one country and another, and flexibility is required.
Low taxes will be the new Member States' only chance of gradually catching up economically with the current Member States.
On the issue of the distribution of power, it is important for us not to provide the EU with several presidents or institutional chairmen.
That would scarcely contribute to a more effective EU.
The rotating Presidency of the Council is also important if the Member States are to be able to feel they belong together.
It is also a unique opportunity for small Member States too to influence the work of the EU.
I therefore want to urge the Convention and the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference to be very careful in establishing the shape of the future EU and the way in which it is to operate.
Mr President, the Convention has made progress in many issues of political content.
Of particular importance is the fact that the fundamental rights of EU citizens are to be determined as a binding component of the work of the Union.
There are still shortcomings, however, in the organisation of the division of duties and responsibilities among the institutions.
It was the task of the Convention to put forward proposals to make decision-making more effective, clearer, more democratic and more transparent than before.
This mandate cannot include the setting up of new institutions.
The work of the Council does indeed need reforming, decisions must be taken openly and its work must have continuity.
This cannot happen, however, with a permanent president who is beyond democratic control, or by reducing the Commission's power of initiative and its executive power.
Public support is absolutely essential for the future of the EU.
One very conspicuous institution in all Member States is the Commission.
In the name of equality, therefore, there must also be a Commissioner from all the Member States in the future.
The work of the Convention has gone in the right direction with regard to the development of EU legislation.
I support the appeal made today by President of the European Commission, Romano Prodi, that the right of veto should be relinquished when the EU is making a decision.
Using the right of veto does not achieve anything worthwhile as it only hampers and prolongs the decision-making process.
One EU priority this term has been food safety.
We have not succeeded in deciding where to locate the Food Agency, however, because the right of veto has been used.
At Thessaloniki it will be necessary to sort this out and decide that the permanent home for the Food Safety Agency should be Helsinki.
Helsinki is already totally equipped for the Agency to be able to start its work immediately after the decision has been taken.
Finally, I wish to say a special thank you to Greece, the country to hold the presidency, for the way it has helped the progress of matters to do with safety at sea.
Mr President, to the dithyrambic comments by my honourable friends about the ability, sensitivity and efficiency of the Greek Presidency, I should just like to add the satisfaction of those of us with first hand experience of what President Prodi referred to as passion and ingenuity.
The agenda for Thessaloniki includes a series of burning issues which divide both the Member States and public opinion.
The draft Constitutional Treaty is of primary importance and we hope the Convention will arrive at an integrated proposal which will get the European Union out of its identity crisis, rather than merely at a list of alternative solutions.
I also hope, together with thousands of women's organisations throughout Europe, that the Constitutional Treaty will fully consolidate equality of the sexes in all sectors, abolish any exclusion on the basis of gender and safeguard the balanced participation of men and women in the European democratic institutions.
Women will never accept a constitution which excludes equality of the sexes from the Union's values and objectives.
Women will never accept that the escalating violence against them and the outbreak of trafficking and sexual exploitation cannot be dealt with due to a lack of clear legal basis in the Treaty.
On the question of asylum and immigration, the thinking behind the United Kingdom draft on asylum reform, which literally leaves the 1951 Geneva Convention in tatters, should be rejected.
Any political decisions in Thessaloniki will need to take serious account of the proposals of the UN High Commissioner for refugees.
As Mrs TerrÃ³n i CusÃ­ also said, most immigrants in the European Union come in through legal channels.
We therefore need to manage immigration flows better, not to further reinforce our borders, apply repressive measures and/or link immigration with the activities of criminal networks.
Finally, I think the agenda of the EU-USA summit should include: first, the abolition of the death penalty in the United States, secondly, the treatment of the prisoners in Guantanamo and, thirdly, what we called here in this House the lie of the century, by which I mean the existence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.
Mr President-in-Office, Thessaloniki must give the countries of the western Balkans a clear prospect of accession and we must start pre-accession preparations, which are the sine qua non for peace and stability in the region.
Mr Vice-President of the European Parliament, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, first I should like to thank the President of the European Parliament, President Prodi and a great many of the speakers for the kind terms in which they referred to the efforts made by the Presidency over the past six months in order to deal with a series of very important issues, and also to thank you for your personal comments.
This is the last day the Greek Presidency and I personally shall attend the European Parliament.
We still have about three weeks, which covers our programme, and I have also noted the points in which there is particular interest in our making a last effort, so that we can see if we can resolve matters which have been outstanding for some time.
As far as issues relating to the Presidency's review and developments on a series of issues which are not so closely connected with Thessaloniki are concerned, that is the job of the Prime Minister, Mr Simitis, and is scheduled for 1 July.
Ladies and gentlemen, I shall refer briefly to the three issues - and perhaps a few others - to which I referred in connection with Thessaloniki.
First of all, the issue of the western Balkans.
Yes, indeed, it is very important to the Balkans to receive a political message from the European Union, that there is support for their European prospects, that they will be assisted in their European prospects, that they too must make a series of efforts and reforms if they are to move forward successfully, and that we are close by and we have their course towards integration in prospect.
Our Presidency considers that the Balkans are not some far off place.
They are in Europe, which is why it is very important for the European Union to treat this fragile region with care.
Consequently, we want the outcome of the meeting to give impetus to the integration procedure, to signal policies and, of course, for there to be appropriate funding to support the efforts of these countries in moving forward.
We all know about the tragic incident involving the prime minister of Serbia, Mr Djindjic, a few months ago.
At least one might say that one positive element to come out of this tragic development was that it woke people up.
There is greater understanding and effort on numerous sides.
As far as the issues of immigration are concerned, this is a huge problem for Europe which, if not overshadowed by political developments concerning Iraq over the last six months, will continue to be a heavyweight issue, as it was at the end of the last Presidency.
Nonetheless, we believe that it is a major issue, irrespective of political developments.
Efforts must be made.
We are also expecting initiatives from the Commission and Council this month, so that we can see what else can be done.
We must strike a balance between immigrants living in the European area legally and our societies.
We must find ways of dealing with the problem of illegal immigration and fears in society.
However, we must also find funding methods for dealing with these problems.
Of course, major reference was made, and logically so, to the issue of the Convention, which will be a top issue at the summit.
Indeed, Thessaloniki will be important for this issue and we, the Greek Presidency, want it to be a success.
Laeken signalled the prospects and terms within which the Convention must act.
In Thessaloniki, if we act appropriately, we will achieve a satisfactory result, which is important to the future of Europe and European integration and we hope that the time left until then will be used by all players so that we can safeguard this productive result.
I should like to close by saying that, a few months after the start of the Greek Presidency, Europe was at a very important and different stage.
We are an area with 25 Member States.
We are an area which, for the last two or three years, has a single currency.
We are a union which has progressed and realised the need for institutional changes, which sees it needs a stronger presence in the field of foreign policy and defence.
What has happened in the meantime, during these months, has been catalytic for these issues.
We are a Europe which is now discussing new policies, such as the so-called Wider Europe New Neighbourhood policy, the issues of the Balkans, of the Mediterranean, of the Middle East, the issues of economic intergovernmentalism and immigration.
All these mark ... or rather give a different bearing for the course of Europe.
We are an area which, I believe, within all this, must create conditions for confidence in the future of this area in its citizens, conditions for confidence in democracy and human rights, conditions for confidence in social achievements, employment, growth and, in general, conditions for confidence in our ability to respond to the serious problems of our societies.
I can see, within this philosophy, the answers which must be given by us by the end of this month and, of course, by subsequent Presidencies from next month onwards.
. (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this has been a very heated, highly interesting debate; I have noted all the issues raised, vital issues for our future: from the Balkans question to equality of the Union's citizens, to safeguarding the Institutions.
During this brief reply, I will restrict myself simply to making an appeal, which I consider absolutely necessary and indispensable today when, at Thessaloniki, we will have to take fundamental decisions for our whole future.
I would like to appeal to the Convention to give us the response that many of you - starting with Mr Wurtz - have said that the Convention has not yet provided.
There is a very simple reason for this.
We decided to form the Convention during our institutions' deepest crisis; we decided on it all together after the night of debate at Nice, when we saw that the intergovernmental method of negotiations between States - precisely, during the intergovernmental nights of talks - did not provide satisfactory results; we decided to take that path in order to restore to our people and our parliaments the sovereignty which befits them.
Now the Convention has got down to business: it was to be a finite process; the Convention was to give the Intergovernmental Conference a finished product.
Instead, a parallel process has emerged: a kind of Intergovernmental Conference parallel to the Convention has come about, which has divided into various fragments and which is in danger, at this time, of further fragmentation.
I repeat what Mrs Frassoni said: currently a false impression is being given, a false message that the Convention is split on everything.
Therefore, my appeal is very simple: we want the Convention to carry out the Convention's work fully, autonomously; we want it to produce, as you have all requested, a clear, systematic draft, because the Convention Assembly represents all the citizens, all the countries, all the institutions of Europe.
We need its voice, we need it to carry out its role in full.
Over recent months, we have been divided over basic policy points and we have also suffered humiliation in our foreign policy.
Do we wish to deny ourselves the instruments we need to restore our dignity?
Do we wish to deny ourselves the courage to advance proposals which are becoming instruments necessary for our survival?
I can summarise with great satisfaction the contribution of all the leaders of the main political groups - whom I have the pleasure of seeing here before me - who, as one, have put forward coherent, courageous proposals on the coalition rules, on Parliament's role, on the future dynamics of the Institutions.
They have put forward courageous proposals for both today and tomorrow, such as combining the President of the Commission and the President of the Council.
They have given us, all working together, a single framework of what they want for the Europe of the future.
And so, just as I am calling on the Convention to express a single, strong opinion and to present it to the Intergovernmental Conference,
I am calling on you, chairmen of the largest European parliamentary groups, to tell our friends and fellow Members in plenary to speak out loud and clear, to make clear the conditions under which they will agree to sign the new agreement upon which Europe must be built.
This is my appeal to you, because, at this time, we all need the Convention's voice for the new Europe.
(Loud applause)
Thank you, Mr President of the Commission.
I have received six motions for resolutions on this issue in accordance with Rule 37 of the Rules of Procedure.
Mr President, all morning we have been distressed by the news reaching us of a terrible rail accident which has taken place in my country, in my region of Castilla-La Mancha, in the town of Chinchilla.
Many people have been killed, but what is even more serious is that apparently 21 people have disappeared, burnt to death inside the train's carriages.
In view of the anguish we are feeling in my country, and more specifically in my region, I would like to inform my fellow Members of this tragedy and ask the President to send a message of condolence and solidarity to the families and the regional government of Castilla-La Mancha, who are so seriously affected by this tragedy.
Mr MartÃ­nez, of course I shall convey the condolences and sympathy of this House through the appropriate channels.
It is very sad to hear of this horrific accident after so much recent bad news in Spain.
I have received from Mr Turco a letter dated 29 April 2003 requesting Parliament to defend the Parliamentary immunity of Mr Marco Pannella, following the sentencing of the latter to imprisonment, commuted to restricted freedom, for events occurring in Italy.
Mr Pannella is able to attend the plenary, but not the committees or the other work of Parliament.
In accordance with Rule 6(3) of the Rules of Procedure, that request is hereby referred to the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market which will pursue the matter.
Mr President, I fully agree with your decision, under these circumstances, to refer the request to the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
I do not believe that parliamentary immunity places Members above the law, but that it is a guarantee against unjustified proceedings that the executive powers, through the intermediary of prosecutors, could instigate.
The problem is this, Mr President: what happens when a State, abusing the concept of in flagrante delicto, clearly violates the parliamentary immunity of a Member of this Parliament and eventually, through a series of criminal proceedings, deprives them of their mandate?
That is the case of Mr Le Pen: whatever we might think of Mr Le Pen's opinions, the fact remains that the French Government did not ask for his immunity to be lifted before instigating criminal proceedings, which initially were against the law and were then artificially corrected in order to be able to deprive him of his mandate.
I believe that, in such cases, our Parliament should refuse to give legal effect to these criminal sanctions and their indirect consequences, which are achieved illegitimately in such circumstances.
I would like to inform the House that written declaration No 4/2003 submitted by Mr Tannock, Mrs Villiers, Mr Helmer, Mrs McKenna and Mr de Roo on the live transport of animals from Member States and EU candidate countries had, by 3 June 2003, been signed by the majority of Parliament's component Members. Consequently it will be forwarded to the addressees and published together with the names of the signatories.
Mr President, I just wish to thank all those Members of the House, across all nationalities, delegations and groups, who signed my written declaration.
It is a mark of a civilised society how it treats its animals.
This is a wake-up call to the Commission and in particular Commissioner Byrne, whom I now call upon to come before the House to make a statement on this issue.
It is dear to our hearts that we uphold high welfare standards in animal transport, in particular in the acceding countries, where there is no tradition of high welfare standards for animals.
I would also like to make the point that I am delighted that my amendment to the Corbett report, taking written declarations outside of the plenary, has now come of age.
I have seen a lot of interest today in both the piracy issue and Rugby League.
Let us hope that the Members of this House will sign declarations in future.
The next item is the vote.
Report (A5-0162/2003) by Giovanni Claudio Fava, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the Commission communication to the European Parliament and the Council on the Action plan to counter the social, economic and regional consequences of the restructuring of the EU fishing industry (COM(2002) 600 - 2003/2039(INI))
(Parliament adopted the text)
Proposal from the Conference of Presidents complementing the decision taken by the European Parliament on 9 April 2003 on the Calendar of the European Parliament, 2004
(Following the rejection of Amendment No 1, the President declared the proposal of the Conference of Presidents approved)
Report (A5-0193/2003) by Willi Rothley, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the adoption of a Statute for Members of the European Parliament
Before the vote:
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have all read the Commission position.
There are currently two options and I do not know whether, for once in this House, common sense might prevail.
(Mixed reactions)
Calm down!
It is very amusing.
Every time Parliament takes a position, we ask the Commission to give it serious consideration.
When the Commission takes a position, I ask that we give serious consideration to what the Commission has written, because we always ask this of the Council and the Commission.
That is why.
It is simple.
The Commission has written in black and white that what we voted on was the request for referral back to committee.
(The President asks the speaker to come to the point of order for which he requested the floor)
This is not a point of order, Mr President, it is a request for referral back to committee pursuant to Article 144.
As I was about to say, therefore, let it not be said in future that we did not have all the facts.
The Council, which finds it difficult to come to any agreement, will choose the very argument of the Commission to say no to a single Statute, because some countries do not want a single Statute for Members.
That is why I am requesting a referral back to committee, for the article on immunity to be amended, so that we might have a chance of achieving a single Statute.
All those who wish to present this text to the Council, which can only say yes or no, since the procedure is for Council assent, must take responsibility before European public opinion for not wanting a European Statute!
(Mixed reactions and applause)
I would therefore request a referral back to committee to re-examine the matter.
Under the Rules of Procedure Mr Cohn-Bendit is perfectly entitled to make that request.
He has spoken in favour.
Mr President, I propose that we should reject that suggestion, for the simple reason that in its opinion the Commission clearly spelt out that this is a very serious proposal.
We have now been discussing this subject for five years, and it would not make any sense at all to re-run all those discussions.
It is high time we made a decision on this subject, and I can only call on the House to reach a decision now and not to perpetuate this never-ending debate.
I therefore call on you to reject the proposal for referral back to committee.
(Applause)
I do not want to reopen the debate.
We have had a speaker 'for' and a speaker 'against'.
Procedurally, now is the time to vote on the suggestion.
The proposal is that this should be referred back to committee.
(Parliament rejected the proposal for referral back to committee)
I hope that in the last 24 hours you will have received a copy of the Commission's opinion.
Before the vote I should like to invite the Commission to make a brief statement on this matter, the rapporteur to make a brief response and then we will proceed with the vote.
.
Mr President, I am not sure in following the penultimate speaker whether I am inserting myself into a rational dialogue or hurling myself onto the spears, but it says here ...
...
I have pleasure ...
(Laughter and applause)
... in announcing to the House that following its vote on the draft statute for MEPs, the Commission adopted the opinion required by Article 190(5) of the Treaty at its meeting yesterday and this has been communicated to Parliament.
It is our hope that our opinion can make a positive contribution to concluding the procedure between the three institutions and enable, at long last, a statute for MEPs to enter into force for the next legislature.
This would be an important step forward for Parliament, which the Commission would very much welcome.
We have sought to be as constructive and positive as possible to assist the conclusion of this difficult matter.
We hope that there will be no further obstacles to the adoption of the Statute.
So there!
(Laughter and applause)
Mr President, the Commission has certainly made a positive contribution here, for which I offer my sincere thanks.
Its support for the Parliament's position is welcome.
There has, incidentally, been a misunderstanding about Article 33 that would not have arisen if we had based our discussion on the German text.
On the subject of misunderstandings, I would like to point out that the amendment tabled by my group to delete Article 5 of the resolution simply means that, as the Bureau has agreed the reform, it no longer makes any sense of course to call on the Bureau to adopt this particular reform.
That has been settled, and there is nothing more to it than that.
Perhaps you will permit me, Mr President, to make a further point. We are voting on the Statute today; it is to be adopted today.
This is a decision under Article 190(5) of the Treaty.
We are not voting on whether we want the reform or not, as some newspapers have suggested.
That is not the case at all.
We all want the reform.
But I would be grateful to those who are highlighting this aspect in particular if they would finally stop denigrating the majority of this House by suggesting that we wanted to block this reform by linking it with other, legitimate political objectives.
This is therefore a decision under Article 190(5).
Nevertheless, as far as taxes are concerned, we are open to the Council's proposal that an additional national tax should be introduced for a limited number of Member States.
We are quite open to that suggestion.
Mr President, your speech yesterday following the vote was a very worthy one.
It was a fine speech that was a testament to your political wisdom.
It was also courageous, and I hope that this House will summon up the courage to accept its political responsibility.
There is a great deal at stake here today.
I implore you, ladies and gentlemen, in the interests of the peoples of Europe, those whom we serve, to summon up that political courage!
(Applause)
I would ask, for a quite specific reason, to take the floor under the rules of procedure.
I shall not, like Mr Rothley, talk in very elevated terms, but explain to him that the reason why the Group of the Party of European Socialists wishes to omit paragraph 5 of the resolution is simply that the Praesidium has already made a decision.
At the same time, however, there are some important principles contained in this demand that changes to the reimbursement of travel costs enter into force at the same time as the new Statute, if it ever sees the light of day.
There is one particular point, however, that ought to be clarified, and I should therefore like to table an oral amendment to paragraph 5.
Instead of calling upon the Praesidium to take a decision, the wording might be in terms of taking note of the Praesidium's decision.
At the same time, an important addition should be made: namely, where the words 'enter into force together with the Statute' appear, I wish to propose adding the words 'and with the same validity as the latter'.
It may perhaps be a little difficult to grasp in translation, but the principle is that decisions taken on the reimbursement of travel costs must have the same legal validity as the Statute.
That is what I should like to propose.
Amendment No 7, if adopted, would delete the paragraph, in which case the oral amendment would not stand because the paragraph it refers to would have been deleted.
In the event that Amendment No 7 is rejected, then I will ask the House if it wishes to accept Mr Krarup's oral amendment.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Mr President, with the next three reports this House is voting on the package negotiated with the Council on the decision to create an internal energy market in Europe.
As acting chairman of the committee responsible, the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, I am obliged to make a statement here before we continue.
The House is voting on 50 amendments in three reports.
This compromise document is accompanied by two statements. One is the statement by the Commission, which the Vice-President of the Commission presented to the House during Monday's debate, and that is recorded in the Minutes.
It is also accompanied by an interinstitutional statement by Parliament, Council and Commission, and it has been agreed that this statement should be read into the Minutes of Parliament, that both statements should be published in the Official Journal of the European Union with the legislative text and that this arrangement should also be recorded in Parliament's Minutes now.
I am therefore obliged to read out the interinstitutional statement here.
I can reassure you that it is not very long.
It reads as follows: 'The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission underline the need for Member States to ensure that adequate financial resources for decommissioning and waste management activities, which are audited in Member States, are actually available for the purpose for which they have been established and are managed in a transparent way, thus avoiding obstacles to fair competition in the energy market'.
Mr President, I ask you to sign this statement on behalf of this House and to arrange for its publication in the Official Journal.
Mr Mombaur, I would be happy to sign that and ensure that it is duly published as a document of record.
Through you I congratulate your committee and the rapporteurs on what is an extraordinary piece of work and an example of politics at its very best.
Recommendation for second reading (A5-0136/2003) on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council directive on common rules for the internal market in electricity and repealing Directive 96/92/EC (15528/2/2002 - C5-0034/2003 - 2001/0077(COD)) (rapporteur: Claude Turmes)
Before the vote:
Mr President, Commissioner, within the context of votes on the directive at first reading, the Commission promised Parliament that it would submit two related directives: one on cogeneration, on which the Commission has kept its promise, and another on energy efficiency services, which is highly important in order to provide a framework for the market in this regard.
This directive was promised us, first of all, after summer 2002, then for the end of 2002.
It has still not arrived and today there is a faint possibility that this important directive might not be adopted during the current Parliamentary term.
Can the Commission assure us that this directive will be presented as soon as possible, preferably before the summer?
.
Mr President, I know about the honourable Member's concern on this matter and I know what has been said in the past.
I am advised that the directive will be tabled by the Commission later in the year and I fully take the point that the honourable Member has made, that Parliament should have the opportunity of voting on it during the course of its life, that is before next summer.
I will make sure that my colleagues in the Commission are apprised of what the honourable Member has said.

Mr President, since the Commission has altered its statement on decommissioning funds so that there is now no doubt that the Union Treaty's competition policy, under the aegis of the Directorate-General for Competition, applies fully to the decommissioning funds and the nuclear sector, I congratulate the Commission, in my capacity as rapporteur, for adopting this position, and I think the great majority of Parliament would support me: a single market requires a single competition policy.
I can now therefore withdraw the amendment.
Mr President, I would just make my fellow MEPs aware of the conditions governing this vote.
There is a political agreement between ourselves in Parliament, the Council of Ministers and the Commission whereby, through adoption, we can avoid conciliation.
We therefore have to vote in favour of the first block and against blocks 2 and 3.
I would therefore urge Members to do just that.
We should in that way obtain most of what Parliament has wanted, at the same time as being able to avoid conciliation.
. (DE) Mr President, this report is about the phasing out as quickly as possible of old oil tankers, which have been responsible, for example, for the Prestige disaster.
We have reached an agreement with the Council and the Commission that what the committee has agreed is also a common decision, and that we can complete the first reading today.
I therefore urge all honourable Members to vote in favour of the committee's proposals; otherwise we will put the timetable at risk.
If we can complete the first reading, this regulation would come into force in the summer, allowing us to achieve a major improvement in maritime safety in our European waters.
Amendments Nos 33 and 34 have been withdrawn by the Group of the European Liberal, Democratic and Reform Party, and I therefore hope that other Members will only wish to vote on the committee's amendments.
Mr Vermeer, can you confirm that the Group of the European Liberal, Democratic and Reform Party withdraws those amendments?
Mr President, it is extremely important not only that we phase out the single-hull oil tankers, but also that we realise there will then be 200 to 300 ships out there somewhere.
Not only does Parliament have to accept responsibility for promoting the phasing out of these tankers, it must also accept responsibility for waste management, for the correct disposal and scrapping of ships.
I did try to incorporate this in this resolution, but I think that we will have every opportunity to include our need to accept responsibility for the dismantlement of these ships as well in the Sterckx report.
I feel that we must follow the fast-track procedure Mr Piecyk is proposing and I shall therefore withdraw my amendments.
Mr President, I should simply like to point out that there is a slight error in the Portuguese version of Amendment No 20: there is a missing semicolon!
A missing semicolon in Portugal is an extremely serious matter and I would draw this to the attention of the services.
(Laughter)
Thank you for that, rapporteur!
I should like to point out to the House that the Portuguese version has already been corrected.
The semicolon, and order, have been restored!
Mr President, I wished to speak on a point of order in accordance with Rule 142, observance of the Rules of Procedure, with regard to Rule 140 b) and c), which relate to the admissibility of amendments.
Rule 140 b) and c) prohibits the presentation of an amendment aimed at replacing or deleting the whole of a text or which proposes amending more than one of the articles or paragraphs of the text it refers to.
According to the services, if Amendment No 20 is approved, all the amendments presented to Parliament will lapse and so will all those that have been presented in committee, and its approval would also mean that the legislative text of the Commission's proposal in its entirety would lapse as well.
The Commission told us yesterday, through Commissioner Fischler, during the evening debate, that it was against Amendment No 20, that it was against the other amendments by the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, from No 21 to No 29, and said that they were contrary to the Treaty on the accession of Spain and Portugal.
Mr President, Amendment No 20 intends to extend the Treaty on the accession of Spain and Portugal, which I believe to be legally unacceptable since it contravenes the Community acquis.
Mr President, I would like the services to tell me what the admissibility of this amendment is based on.
I would like them please to speak to me directly, or, if not, write to me, because I believe we are violating Community law and taking a step backwards in terms of European integration.
I do not want to open a general debate at this point.
I will hear the rapporteur, I will make a ruling and then we will proceed.
Mr President, I can understand the frustration of Mr Varela and our other Spanish colleagues about this amendment, but what this amendment seeks to do, and I do not wish to reopen the debate, is to protect a key conservation zone, one of the most significant conservation zones in European waters.
If we are to be taken seriously as a House, if our Common Fisheries Policy is to be taken seriously, then we must insist that this policy is about preserving fish stocks, allowing fish stocks to recover.
That is what support for Amendment 20 would mean.
Trying to use the Rules of Procedure to stop this House having its democratic say on this amendment would be a serious error.
I would suggest to you, Mr President, if you are inclined to rule that this amendment is inadmissible, that the whole report be referred back to committee.
But I hope you do not rule that it is inadmissible and that we can go ahead with the vote.
(Applause)
Mr President, as a Portuguese Member of this Parliament, I simply wish to say the following: whatever opinion one has of Amendment No 20, it is totally wrong and dishonest to claim that it has anything to do with the Accession Treaty, which has expired.
This was made perfectly clear in yesterday's debate in speeches by some of my Portuguese colleagues, such as Arlindo Cunha, Ilda Figueiredo and, in particular, some very lively speeches by Paulo Casaca.
The comment that Mr Varela has just made on this point is, therefore, completely untrue.
The ruling I wish to make on this matter is that I believe Amendment No 20 to be admissible.
It seeks to insert text.
It is true that the effect of the insertion would cause the deletion of other parts of the text, but it is not an amendment that simply calls for deletion.
We have precedents for this.
I am not making an arbitrary choice.
I am following the Rules of Procedure and therefore rule this admissible.
The wisdom of the House will decide the matter.
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
President.
That concludes the vote.
The Action Plan proposed by the Commission does not take account of the impact of the decisions taken by the Fisheries Council between 16 and 20 December 2002 and does not provide a response to the problems facing the sector or to the consequences of the restructuring (scrapping) measures and recovery plans which, according to the Commission, would entail the loss of 3 000 jobs per year until the end of 2006, on top of the foreseen loss of 8 000 jobs per year resulting from the crisis in the sector and from fleet renewal.
The Commission's proposal to fund the action plan by reprogramming Structural Funds under the FIFG and its suggestion that it might use the mid-term review of the Structural Funds to try to obtain further resources from other Structural Funds are unacceptable.
We agree with the rapporteur on the need for additional funds to compensate for the socio-economic consequences of the reform and the recovery plans, and the Commission must make use of the flexibility instrument or undertake a review of the financial perspective.
We agree with the rapporteur's observation that attention must be paid to small-scale coastal fishing.
The Commission admits that 'financial aid measures in favour of small-scale fisheries have not had the desired effect of protecting the sector'.
Hence our insistence, in the 2003 budget procedure, on creating a specific support programme.
. (EL) The report is correct in its comments on the dangers which will be faced by small-scale fishing (which accounts for 75% of Community fishing vessels) with the application of the new common fisheries policy, which will result in a loss of 28 000 jobs, economic stagnation and the abandonment of coastal areas.
The report does not, however, dispute the policy which produces the hardships, which it confines itself to describing.
On the contrary, it takes them as given and is merely interested in moderating the consequences, in slowing down the rate at which they emerge and in 'countering' the losses.
The rapporteur harbours delusions about the intentions of the Commission which he calls on to ? consider its options.
We do not harbour any such delusions.
The applied fisheries policy and the proposed policy, as it stands or with a few amendments, prove that the EU is heading straight in the direction of handing the exploitation of fisheries resources over to big business.
This is the direction being taken by the funding measures to scrap small and medium-sized fishing vessels in order to wipe out small and medium-sized fishermen and further reinforce the fishing capabilities of large vessels.
No reversal in the situation can be achieved with wish lists and appeals to the Commission's better nature.
Only fishermen themselves and their fight can reverse these policies and prevent their extermination.
The fisheries sector appears to be sailing through calm seas at present.
As the fishery reform negotiations draw to a close, the professionals are drawing up the balance sheet for the next 18 months.
With regard to public aid: while the Commission was pushing for an end to public aid from December 2002, the negotiations have led to the current scheme being prolonged until December 2004.
Although the fishermen have been warned, the difficulties have not abated.
In Brittany, nearly 75% of the fleet needs replacing.
The use of safe, new boats, equipped with the latest technology to make sailors' work easier, should be widespread.
While hostilities in the public aid battle at Community level have been broken off for the moment, however, they will soon be resumed on the world stage.
The Commission has presented a proposal to the World Trade Organisation asking for a ban on all subsidies in order to prevent overfishing, on the pretext of maintaining the sustainability of the fishing industry.
With regard to restructuring plans, we have the example of the Scottish cod restructuring plan, whose consequences we know: the collapse of those fisheries which can no longer operate, increased pressure on other fishing grounds and stocks of other fish species, and more considerable pressure on markets.
(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Article 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
The failure frequently ascribed to the previous common fisheries policy (CFP) should make the Union as a whole realise how crucial it is to have a carefully considered assessment, potentially forming the basis of a new approach, and for this approach to be reflected, if possible, in the new CFP.
For this to happen, the desire to preserve fishery resources must be set against the repercussions that each CFP option has for tens of thousands of people, for their jobs and for their families.
This report focuses precisely on this issue and the action plan to compensate for the consequences triggered by the negative effects of restructuring in the fisheries sector is the appropriate basis on which this study should be undertaken.
With this in mind, I support the rapporteur when he:
considers the Commission's assessment of the socio-economic impact of the CFP reform to be extremely theoretical and does not provide sufficiently concrete answers to the problems currently facing the sector;
argues that the economically weakest fisheries, which might be hardest hit by the reform, warrant the European Union's solidarity and support;
insists on the need for a serious and in-depth debate on the fisheries model that the European Union should adopt and reiterates the importance of maintaining a positive approach.
I have therefore voted in favour of the report.
The vote of 9 April was nothing less than an attempted coup against Community law.
By illegally reducing the number of sessions for 2004 from 12 to 10, a coalition of honourable Members, whose antipathy to the notion of Strasbourg as seat of the European Parliament has long been known, has seriously undermined the treaties. These honourable Members have also, and no less importantly, undermined this town's status as a symbol of Franco-German reconciliation.
The time has now come to redress the harm done by what can only be called an anti-Strasbourg plot.
To this end, my group has supported the proposal before the Conference of Presidents, calling for an extra week to be added to the draft calendar for 2004.
This is the only course of action in keeping with the letter and spirit of the treaties.
Furthermore, however, as we approach the crucial moment of enlargement, the European Parliament should bring to bear the full weight of its vote in order to make a political statement of its desire to remain in Strasbourg.
Mr President, I voted against the Rothley report for the following reasons.
I would in principle have been in favour of the Statute for Members, but I find it unacceptable that we have not succeeded in introducing a proper scheme for travel costs or in aligning the pensionable age with that which is customary in the Member States.
I believe that we have undermined our credibility as a parliament.
I myself have never had any problems, for example, with the fact that our Italian colleagues have more money than we do.
We have to accept that a lot of work in the EU Member States is not uniformly remunerated.
I believe that a statute of this kind only makes sense if the arrangements that have been adopted up to now in the guise of a travel scheme are appropriately modified by means of that statute.
Another point is that I feel I should be subject to the same taxation as my constituents.
We represent our constituents in our Member States, and I believe that our pensionable age and tax status should be the same as for those who elect us.
Otherwise we are creating special rights for Members that are inappropriate, especially at a time when the cultural crisis means that ordinary citizens are struggling to make ends meet.
That is why I voted against this report despite being in favour of the statute in principle.
But I do not think it is acceptable, because it creates too many unjustifiable privileges, and because we have unfortunately not succeeded in changing the travel arrangements.
Mr President, like Mrs Breyer I voted against this report.
I also think that there is a lot of hypocrisy and double-speak in this House.
As regards travel expenses, ever since I came here it has been an issue that has been raised by many people, especially people in my own group.
The system should be changed.
We need a system where we get back what we spend, but this should not be tied in with a lot of other matters.
There were some controversial proposals in the Rothley report, particularly as regards EU tax.
As an Irish citizen, I find it hard to justify to my voters at home why I should be paying a different rate of tax to them or why I should be privileged to pay a lower tax.
By tying the two together - salary and expenses - we are avoiding the fact that the system needs to be changed.
This issue is going to go on and on.
The voters and the media in the various Member States will be highlighting it.
It is questionable whether it is acceptable that a Member of this Parliament be paid more than, for example, the president of his own country, which could happen in certain cases.
The system needs to be reformed, and in such a way that we can take a credible stand and show that we are not getting extra privileges that our own voters are not entitled to.
.
(EL) I voted in favour of the Rothley report, despite the fact that the amendments proposed by the GUE/NGL, Greens and Liberals were rejected yesterday, for the reasons mentioned by President Cox.
It is one naturally inadequate, step towards transparency and the settlement of an issue which insults the European Parliament.
The amendment proposed by the Socialist group to delete paragraph 5 referring to the Bureau's decision on travel expenses etc. throws up questions about the real intentions of the European Parliament and confusion at the very least.
.
(NL) One of the reasons why the Dutch Labour Party delegation voted against this report is the absence of a tax compromise.
The Dutch Labour Party delegation hopes that the Council will soon be prepared to negotiate and to examine the willingness in the EP to incorporate a facility for additional national taxes and to regulate with effect from 2004.
The Dutch Labour Party delegation hopes that a Statute for Members for which it can vote does nonetheless come about.

As might have been expected, the Commission has just expressed a favourable opinion of the draft Statute for Members of the European Parliament, approved yesterday. It even proposed taking one point further, demanding that all honourable Members be subject to a single Community rate of tax, in accordance with a principle of equal pay which is irrelevant in this situation.
On the contrary, the honourable Members are representatives of their respective countries. Our position is that they should be subject to the same taxes as their fellow countrymen.
I have thus voted against this proposal being passed on to the Council.
I would argue that the Statute for Members of the European Parliament should take account of disparities between countries. That rule should apply even if it means that each country delegates to the European Parliament decisions on certain well-defined matters which may arise in relation to the internal workings of the Assembly.
Thus far, the French Government has not responded to us.
We hope that it may yet react, in order to avoid another Nice scenario. At Nice, despite our warnings, the previous government accepted a dramatic reduction in the number of French Members of this Parliament, a decision decried by all today.
It would have been better to have foreseen this problem.
. (DA) I consider Parliament's adoption of the proposals in the Rothley report to be unlawful, since they would alter primary law.
Their adoption is particularly unwise, since it rejects the national taxation of European Parliament salaries and fails to put the travel scheme in order.
I have not been able to take part in the vote today, since I am to participate in the meeting of the European Convention in Brussels.
Unlike the rest of my group, I have decided to abstain from voting on this report.
The main reason for this stems from the decision to raise the honourable Members' salaries by a considerable amount.
In the current social and political climate, not just in France but throughout Europe, this decision is unacceptable and unjustifiable.
We are, first and foremost, representatives of the people. As such, our priorities are to promote the interests of our citizens and give concrete form to their expectations in Europe, especially in terms of increased democracy.
I have decided to abstain rather than vote against the report because I believe that adopting a single statute for Members is a positive step towards a more united Europe, towards a truly shared destiny, and towards achieving equality for all.
I would, however, have preferred to see the goal of equal pay, which this report attempts to impose from the top down, become a priority for European legislators through the adoption of a minimum European wage. It would thus affect our fellow citizens first and foremost.
Taking advantage of the fact that decision-making in the Council on the 'Statute for Members of the EP' has changed from unanimity to qualified majority as a result of the Treaty of Nice, the EP is once again insisting on a proposal that contains aspects with which we disagree.
One such aspect is that of establishing the same monthly parliamentary allowance for all Members, whichever country they represent.
Members of the EP are elected in national constituencies.
Consequently they are, and must remain bound to these constituencies.
Establishing a single monthly rate of payment forms part of a federalist view of a Member of the European Parliament's mandate, seeking to transform today's national Members of the EP into future 'European MPs'. This is a vision that we do not share.
Furthermore, as we have emphasised, the social realities in the countries of the EU differ greatly, making it inevitable that implementing this measure will lead to profound inequalities and differences between the salary level of workers and that of representatives and public office-holders in various countries, such as Portugal. This would be quite incomprehensible.
Accordingly, the salary of a Member of the EP must be based on the salary of Members of the national parliament of the country in which they have been elected.
Hence our vote against the report.
.
(FI) Ulpu Iivari, Reino Paasilinna and Riitta Myller, members of the Finnish Social Democratic Party delegation, voted in favour of the Members' Statute, as we believe it is essential to have one, and voting against it would mean the present system would continue.
It has been our aim all along to have a system where travel expenses are reimbursed where actual costs are incurred.
A condition of final acceptance is, however, that the compromise allowing Finland the right to tax the pay of its Members of the European Parliament which arose during the Belgian Presidency be applied to the Statute.
We also hope that Parliament will be prepared in negotiations with the Council to abandon any designs it might have concerning parliamentary immunity that it is impossible for the Council to accept.
.
British Conservative MEPs anticipate the adopted Statute, which does not meet our approval, will equally not meet the approval of the Council.
In such circumstances the Council and Parliament must negotiate a Statute which meets both of their requirements.
Nothing should remain outside the scope of these legitimate negotiations.
.
(NL) The reimbursement of Members' travel expenses must be based on the expenses actually incurred and all Members must receive the same salary.
Many of the things that Parliament is adopting with the Rothley report on the Statute for Members of the European Parliament, such as the late entry into force in 2009 and the subordination of future fellow Members from the accession countries, I do not like.
I would also have liked to see the majority of this House show a greater readiness to compromise.
It will now be very difficult to bring the governments and MEPs into line with one another.
We in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, however, are prepared to make compromises, because in the end statutory provision has to be made for these things.
Moreover, it is the last chance before enlargement to regulate the Statute for Members and with it a better travel expenses scheme.
All things considered I have therefore voted for the Rothley report because keeping things as they are is not acceptable.
.
President Pat Cox at the opening of today's session indicated that MEPs obliged to depart for Brussels on Convention business might lodge a statement of their position on the Member's Statute despite their necessary absence from the vote.
Here is mine:
With regret, I am unable to support the draft Statute of Members in the form in which Parliament adopted it on 3 June.
I would therefore have voted against today's legislative resolution, and as shadow rapporteur I advised my Group in this sense.
I am unable to go along with the rejection of the 'Belgium compromise' amendment that would have allowed national income tax on an MEP's salary, and the rejection of a strong statement on a revised and transparent expenses system.
I also have grave reservations about the sweeping provisions suggested for Members' immunity.
.
The EPLP cannot vote for the Rothley report on the Members' Statute.
After yesterday's adoption of taxation at Community level, a salary at 50% of a European Court Judge's, an implementation date after 2004 and immunities which would involve primary legislation, we believe this has gone too far.
The adoption of these measures will only further alienate Members of the European Parliament from the electorate at a time when we are trying to connect with the European public through the simplification and clarification of our rules.
This Statute will not be seen as a step in that direction.
The EPLP welcomes the reform of the expenses regime to travel at cost and will now work to have that implemented independently of the Statute.
In line with the explanation of vote I gave yesterday, I could not vote otherwise in this final vote, because my reservations are a matter of principle and are fundamental, since they are closely bound to the global nature of the European institutions.
I have therefore voted against the report once again.
I wish, however, to add my surprise at - and disagreement with - the fact that, on the pretext of establishing a system of equality for all Members and a single statute, the possibility of separate arrangements, as well as privileged different situations for some Members, is still being pursued.
One only has to look, for example, at the fact that for at least one more legislature some re-elected Members can keep open the option of enjoying a different system of remuneration.
Now, apart from the fact that this approach is completely unsustainable in the political context of the new Statute, this could lead to a situation that is quite negative and completely unmanageable, since it would constitute a dual form of discrimination: firstly, it is a different system to that of Members from other Member States; and, secondly, it is also a different system to that applying to other Members of the EP elected in the same Member State.
I do not know what is more surprising: the fact that this absurd system has been adopted or the fact that even the European Commission has agreed...
(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
No, this statute is not perfect.
Yes, this text is only a compromise.
No, this project does not provide a complete response to the lengthy battle fought over the best part of the last five years by the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party; but yes, I voted in favour: in favour of reform, in favour of the future, and in favour of setting the truly European aspects of this House in stone.
For that is what is at stake: finding an end to the odyssey on which we embarked in 1979, in search of a common statute, a statute to do away with inequality and injustice. How on earth can we continue to justify the fact that German and Italian Members earn four times the wages of their Portuguese and Spanish colleagues?
That is why I congratulate myself on the agreement reached on Articles 16 and 18. The former establishes the principle of equal pay for all, and the latter confirms Community tax as the benchmark.
For all that, I regret the fact that this House did not, yesterday, state the rights and responsibilities of its honourable Members loud and clear. Neither did it adopt a totally transparent system for the refund of expenses, particularly travel expenses.
The repeal of the effective compromise negotiated during the Belgian Presidency in October 2001 is also a bad sign. That compromise gave Member States the right to impose an additional national tax, should they desire to do so.
These are all highly controversial questions, which threaten to delay the adoption of the Statute for Members until the twelfth of never.
.
(SV) I have today voted against the European Parliament's report on a new Statute for Members now that the Commission has issued its opinion following yesterday's vote in plenary.
The proposal was nonetheless approved by 323 votes, with 167 against and 39 abstentions.
The new Statute would not lead to increased openness unless, instead of the current system involving flat-rate payments, there were a system for the reimbursement of travel costs whereby it was the actual costs that were reimbursed.
Certainly, Parliament's Praesidium decided on 29 May 2003 to investigate how a new system for the reimbursement of travel costs could be designed, but that does not solve the problem.
A decision to refund actual costs should enter into force automatically at the same time as a new Statute for Members is brought into operation.
A new Statute for Members must aim at fairness, transparency and efficiency.
In the future too, I should ideally like to see the salary level of Members of the European Parliament set in relation to the levels applicable in the national parliaments.
Because MEPs live in, and represent, their Member States, tax should, in the future too, be deducted on a national basis so that account might be taken of different countries' costs of living and social insurance systems.
.
(SV) I have not taken part in the vote because I find it absurd that we ourselves must decide on our salaries and other financial conditions.
Mr President, I voted in favour of the Turmes report.
I think it was an excellent report, and I would like to praise Mr Turmes very highly once again.
Without his commitment this report would not have been so outstanding.
The main achievement in this report is the introduction of electricity 'labelling', so that consumers will in future know where their electricity comes from and how it is produced, so that they will finally be able to decide if they want to buy nuclear electricity or electricity generated from renewables.
This also gives consumers an opportunity to participate in decisions about environmental policy, and that is a tremendous achievement.
Because we know that only freedom of choice creates responsible citizens capable of mature judgment, and such responsible citizens conversely want that freedom of choice so that they can take part in decision-making.
I hope that it will be possible to implement this in the Member States in a practical way so that consumers really are given this opportunity.
Otherwise, I am also very happy of course that we have finally found a means of ensuring that competition law also applies to nuclear energy.
It is time we finally stripped nuclear energy of its privileges.
It should not be possible, in a liberalised internal market, for nuclear energy to have a special status and not to be subject to competition law.
.
(NL) For a century, the generation and distribution of electricity was largely kept out of the hands of commerce.
It is not a product that you are free to choose whether or not to buy.
Every household needs electricity and no one can run the risk of its non-availability.
Distribution takes place along lines under the public highway.
The public services too, such as hospitals, schools and trams, use a lot of electricity.
You cannot leave all this to a company whose primary interest is to make a profit; it is best left to local or regional government monopolies, on condition that they are subject to democratic control by a chosen parliamentary body that watches over environmental and consumer interests.
In the Netherlands we now have wide experience of the transfer of the electricity supply to the private sector.
Environmentally friendly investments for the small-scale generation of electricity have been neglected or ruled out in favour of the importation of nuclear power.
Now all that counts is which electricity can be produced or purchased cheapest.
Payment for green power, which consumers are allowed to buy from a different producer from their traditional regional supplier, usually leads to chaos.
I support Mr Turmes, our rapporteur, in his attempt to counteract false information about green power or misuse of money for termination of nuclear energy, but that is insufficient.
Once again, the majority of EP Members are choosing to call for the total liberalisation of the natural gas sector and also accepting the positions put forward by the UNICE in relation to this aim of the so-called 'Lisbon Strategy'.
One example is the EP's proposal for the role of national regulatory authorities (NRAs) and of a 'European' regulatory authority, which shall have the task of completing the internal market and of ensuring effective competition.
This proves that the intention is to transfer to supposedly 'independent' authorities an entire set of competences that should fall to national democratically elected institutions.
In other words, the EP feels that not even national States would have a regulatory role, with this being given to these so-called regulatory authorities and the European Commission.
This intention is so outrageous that it has met with the Council's resistance.
In general terms, this is an attempt to impose competition rules on all sectors that involve public service, providing incentives for privatisation, calling into question the guarantee of security of supply, investment capacity, equal access to the best prices and to a high-quality service and will lead to the deterioration of employees' rights in the sectors in question.
Hence our group's motion to reject the common position.
It is significant that our motion was rejected by the majority of EP Members, including those from the PS, the PSD and the CDS-PP.
Liberalising the electricity sector is another of the aims set out under what is known as the Lisbon Strategy.
As for the gas sector, the EP has acted as the spokesperson for the interests of the European employers' confederation, UNICE.
Energy is a strategic sector that is crucial to the sovereignty of any state.
Guarantees of its integrity will be called into question as a result of the current liberalisation.
In a few years, the EU's electricity sector - as the rapporteur states - will be dominated by between five and eight companies, obviously from the countries with the most highly developed economies.
This is an attempt to impose rules of competition and to encourage privatisations, calling into question the security of supply, investment capacity, equal access to the best prices and to a high-quality service and will lead to the deterioration of employees' rights in the sectors in question.
This is why our parliamentary group tabled a motion rejecting the common position and various proposals for amendments seeking to mitigate the negative aspects of the recommendation, not least with regard to ensuring respect for public service obligations, for the environment, for the specific characteristics of the outermost regions, and for protection for domestic consumers and small consumers.
Significantly, the majority of EP Members, including those from the PES, the PSD and the CDS-PP, has rejected the motion to reject the common position.
. (PT) Some amendments that have been tabled suggest that the increase in installed nuclear energy capacity in Europe is crucial to compliance with the Kyoto Protocol.
This argument is irrational and lacks objectivity.
All the information available suggests that the opposite is true.
The European Union already reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by 4% between 1990 and 1999, and will be able to fulfil the remaining reduction quota by 2012 (4%) through low-cost measures.
According to data provided by the European Commission, it is possible to comply with the Kyoto Protocol by implementing measures costing less than EUR 20 per tonne of CO2.
The measures proposed by the European Commission (the European Programme for Climate Change and the Framework Directive on Emissions Trading) contain no reference to promoting nuclear energy.
Unlike my political group, I have voted in favour of the amendments to block 3.
I thought it was vital to support Amendment No 1, as it introduces a reference to the precautionary principle.
Even though I understand the rapporteur's desire to bring this legislative procedure to a close after the second reading (and I would like to draw attention to his hard work and great receptiveness of mind), I am unable to vote against the reference to the precautionary principle.
I believe this principle to be essential and necessary for a debate as sensitive, and as far from a resolution, as the one on genetically modified organisms.
The Council has refused to incorporate this reference to the precautionary principle fully into its Common Position, mentioning it in the preamble. That is the Council's decision and I respect it.
I do feel, however, that the European Parliament should not assume the Council's old stance against the reference to the precautionary principle. The principle is, in any case, covered by Community legislation.
To reject it accords GMO a privileged status. It sets a precedent which other occupational sectors might exploit in order to challenge future political proposals and guidelines.
It is a retreat via the negation of a principle, but it masquerades as progress all the same.
We are aware that this regulation, in conjunction with others, such as the regulation on traceability and labelling, constitute steps towards lifting the moratorium on GMOs.
The pressure exerted by the US, which has now lodged a complaint against the European Union at the WTO, and by the huge biotechnology multinationals seeking to remove the moratorium and to achieve free trade in GMOs, is becoming increasingly clear.
The proposals contained in this report, however, as at first reading, make significant improvements to the text.
An agreement in this field could be important to speeding up the process of ratifying the Cartagena Protocol on biological safety and biodiversity.
Furthermore, the proposals suggest that GMO imports cannot take place without the prior written consent of the importing country and that the signing of agreements and conventions cannot lead to a level of protection lower than that provided by the current regulation and by the protocol.
These proposals also require the exporter to comply with national regulatory frameworks and to guarantee the public right to information. These proposals consequently warrant our support.
As the report suggests, the precautionary principle must be observed, rejecting the subordination of this principle to commercial considerations, given the potential impact of GMOs.
Because there is no strong and integrated legislation on genetically modified organisms (GMOs) that is able to provide guarantees for consumers and industry, the process of granting marketing authorisations at EU level has been suspended for the last three years.
I welcome the legislation on the traceability and labelling of GMOs, because it makes it possible to register and monitor GMO movements on the market and the movements of food for human and animal consumption produced from them.
This will help consumers to make their choices and will facilitate the process of withdrawing a product, should this be deemed necessary.
As everyone knows, the overall aim of the Cartagena Protocol on Biological Safety adopted on 29 January 2000, consists of contributing to ensuring an adequate level of protection in the field of the safe transfer, handling and use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) produced by modern biotechnology, that may have adverse effects on the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity, taking also into account risks to human health, including cross-border movements in particular.
In line with the position of the Portuguese Government, however, I believe it is important that we now undertake this exercise at European level, in order to ensure the most important factor in this matter, which is a high degree of consumer protection.
I therefore welcomed the adoption of the Council's common position - and the approximation of positions that avoided the need for us to continue with a conciliation procedure - and, as such, the forthcoming entry into force of a regulation that is clear, technically secure and able to put the EU in a different position to the one that culminated, as a result of the diffuse nature of regulations, in the anti-GMO moratorium that led the USA to lodge a complaint with the World Trade Organisation.
I voted in favour because, following the shipwreck of the Prestige off the coast of Spain and the huge ecological disaster, immediate protection is required from single hull tankers by imposing an immediate timetable for withdrawing them from circulation.
The governments of the 15 should support these measures and ignore the pressure from any shipowners who are opposed out of self-interest to a necessary regulation to protect seas and shores.

We voted squarely in favour of the Piecyk report. We also supported the Commission's new proposal to speed up the introduction of double hull oil tankers and withdraw single hull tankers, as well as toughening safety restrictions.
This report should have been adopted a long time ago, as Philippe de Villiers indeed requested.
After the wreck of the Erika in 1999, the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) drove the Commission to cut corners, however. The Council and Parliament were weak enough to follow suit.
It took another wreck, the Prestige, to wake everyone up.
Today's text is sounder.
Its scope should nevertheless be broadened. It should apply not only to ships sailing under the flag of a Member State or putting in at one of our ports, but also to any oil tanker sailing in our economic area.
It will also be necessary to monitor the performance of double hulls closely over time.
Moreover, as I said last part-session during the debate on environmental liability, we must remedy the International Oil Pollution Compensation Fund's inability to provide adequate compensation. It is also urgent that we put in place a compulsory insurance scheme operating on the polluter pays principle.
.
(EL) Our position in the final vote on the Piecyk report was to abstain.
We do, of course, realise that the aim of withdrawing single hull tankers is to protect the environment by preventing other tragic accidents at sea.
We are without doubt in favour of this aim, as we have demonstrated by voting in favour of all the previous reports on the subject.
These final arrangements, however, appear to be the result of political reaction in the heat of the moment to the shipwreck of the Prestige.
This also explains the eagerness for the EU to proceed this time independently of the IMO, while it is a known fact that for shipping, which goes beyond European borders, international solutions are preferable.
Especially as the previous withdrawal timetable has not yet started to apply.
We do not believe, therefore, that serious account has been taken of the consequences that these arrangements will have on the competitiveness of the economy.
More specifically, Greek shipping is being hard hit, harming the workers in the shipping industry.
In abstaining, we are expressing our acute scepticism about the stand of the Council of Ministers and, more importantly, the Greek Presidency, which should deal with the issue with greater sangfroid, especially as we Greeks have more experience of these issues and our economy is affected more by these arrangements.
.
I welcome Parliament's initiative, which seeks to speed up the introduction of double hull tankers.
The measures contained in the report are important both in enhancing maritime safety and in preventing the type of environmental disaster which the Galician coast recently suffered.
In my constituency, Scotland, we are bordered by some of the most dangerous waters of Europe and have sadly experienced the environmental effects of oil tankers shedding their cargoes at sea.
Sympathy for those whose livelihood suffered as a result of the Prestige disaster was expressed by residents of the Shetland islands of Scotland who suffered a similar fate in 1993, when the Braer sank off the Shetland coast.
In the aftermath of last year's disaster, we questioned why lessons appeared not to have been learned from Scotland's experiences ten years ago.
It is for this reason that I particularly welcome Parliament's aim to seek a swift agreement with the Council in order to prevent other coastal communities suffering the fate of Galicia or Shetland and would like to record my hope that Member States will afford this legislation the priority it deserves.
The safety of ships, crews and the environment cannot be effectively addressed with fragmentary measures, however important they are, such as the mandatory precondition of double hulls for tankers using ports in the Member States.
A real safety policy needs to combat the unaccountability of shipowners, apply substantive measures against infringements of the law, adjust operating positions to today's enhanced requirements and help improve crews' living and working conditions by safeguarding their rights and giving their trades union the power to intervene decisively.
Any arrangements must be introduced within the framework of the IMO and the ILO, which should play an essential role in international shipping, without accepting the philosophy of compromise with shipping interests.
A typical example of how such interests are served at the expense of the environment are the long transitional periods, without any real justification in terms of security of supply, and the exemption from the double hull requirement for ships over 500 - 600 tonnes.
The ?U is serving the unaccountability of shipowners in the best possible way.
One example is that the ship repair industry in Greece, a country with one of the biggest fleets in the world, has almost been wiped out.
Positive results against this policy will only be obtained by decisive fighting on the part of workers, seamen and interested regions, especially coastal regions.
. (PT) There is no shortage of substantial reasons and even imperatives for us to adopt increasingly stringent measures in the field of maritime navigation safety.
The occurrence, in a very short space of time, of two major disasters, the Erika and the Prestige and having to deal with the variety and gravity of their consequences showed us all how crucial it is for decisions to be taken in this field.
We have all become aware of the intolerable conditions under which many vessels still sail with dangerous and highly polluting loads.
For this reason, this new proposal is particularly appropriate given the much-vaunted requirement for double hulls.
Furthermore, and as the European Commission study was charged with demonstrating, rapidly eliminating single hull tankers, as is proposed, will not lead to a substantial reduction in capacity for oil and, as the rapporteur states, the capacity and international recognition of European shipyards could even benefit by having new vessels to build.
I also agree with the rapporteur's assertion that we must extend the implementation of the proposals now proposed by the European Commission to the International Maritime Organisation, firmly promoting the necessary negotiations in this field.
I have therefore voted in favour of the report.
About time!
We have known since December 1999, since the Erika disaster and its tragic economic, social and environmental consequences, that withdrawing single hull oil tankers was an inescapable and urgent priority.
Shortly before the Erika disaster, I requested the introduction of a timetable for scrapping all single hull oil tankers by 2010.
At the time, I was told that was impossible.
All of a sudden, though, it has become possible, in the wake of the Prestige disaster?
If it is to be effective, however, this measure should not be confined to the European Union. Rather, the International Maritime Organisation should intervene to make it international law.
The Member States most threatened by oil spills, especially France, should make every effort to achieve this from now on. They should not hesitate to exert unilateral pressure either, as France and Spain did so judiciously at Malaga.
I share the rapporteur's concern to improve the fleet of ships carrying dangerous cargoes.
According to the Commission's own figures, more than 4 000 ships are classed as hazardous.
We must oblige shipowners to withdraw these floating dustbins as a matter of urgency, and compel them to adhere to stricter technical and social codes of practice.
Nevertheless, in the light of the recent Erika and Prestige disasters, I think that the European Union is still shrinking back too much from the unavoidable battle for maritime safety.
The proposed waiting times are still unsatisfactory: the seaworthy age limit for Prestige-type (category one) oil tankers has been fixed at 23 years from 2005; for category two and three ships (mostly built between 1982 and 1986), the age limit is 28 years from 2010.
Even with these provisions, the risk of disaster is still with us.
It would have been better if all dangerous ships had been prevented from putting to sea, and shipyard production shifted by public policy towards the construction and development of safe, modern ships.
The European Union should have been given new tools in its struggle against the laxity of the system.
Above all, the Member States should make genuine commitments to implementing existing legislation.
This is the minimum required to stop all the restrictions from sounding like a wish list.
Mr President, I would like to speak on both the Hudghton report and the Stevenson report.
On the Hudghton report the position taken by the EPLP relates to our political support for regional advisory councils, subsidiarity and scope for some decentralised management measures.
On the Stevenson report - formerly the Ã Neachtain report - on western waters concerning the Irish Box, the position has been taken on conservation grounds relating to a vulnerable spawning area and in line with longstanding regional support for the Irish Box.
Amendment No 20, which effectively gives a 10-year derogation to the Irish Box, is a vital conservation measure and we support it.
That is why I am delighted that Amendment No 20 was adopted with such a majority today.
All other amendments fall, as Amendment No 20 was adopted, allowing us to support the report as amended.
The protection of juveniles is a priority for guaranteeing the conservation of fish stocks and their long-term sustainability.
Improving technical catch measures must therefore be seen as an essential component of the common fisheries policy and must be considered in conjunction with the other instruments for the fisheries sector.
We therefore agree with the rapporteur's proposals, specifically when he states that, since it is fishermen who are the interested parties in these measures, and since no one knows these matters better than they do, they should be fully involved in the process of defining these measures.
In fact, we have always called for social dialogue with the sector to be improved, as demonstrated by our proposals in the opinion that we delivered under the 2003 budget procedure.
We still believe, however, that Regional Advisory Councils might not be the most appropriate instruments for guaranteeing this participation.
What is really needed is for the common fisheries policy to be properly decentralised.
We agree with the rapporteur's assertion that technical mistakes in the drafting of this Commission proposal, particularly in a regulation for legislative consolidation involving extremely technical and sensitive matters, call into question the Commission's technical competence in these matters and heighten the lack of confidence fishermen have in the Commission.
This proposal by the European Commission, consolidating existing regulations and to some extent introducing new measures, specifically with regard to cod and whiting, is important.
I think that we were on the right track when, in the technical regulation in force, Member States were authorised to adopt measures in certain emergency situations and in relation to their own vessels, with the proviso that they could not be less stringent than the requirements laid down in Community law.
Like the rapporteur, I regret the fact that this proposal does not retain these provisions.
Like the rapporteur, I also hope that this omission will be rapidly rectified by the Commission, as well as the omission of any reference to the Regional Advisory Councils (RACs).
The Commission must understand that a sustainable and viable fisheries sector is only possible if it has the trust and cooperation of the fishermen and pays attention to the points of view of the parties concerned.
In fact, this omission would run counter to what Commissioner Fischler promised fishermen in a speech in London, when he urged them to 'come and participate and make sure that they become full players in the fisheries management process'.
The report would have been better if more of the amendments tabled in plenary had been adopted, but, for the reasons I have briefly summarised, I too ultimately voted in favour of it.
Mr President, I am very disappointed at the outcome of the original Ã Neachtain/Stevenson report because of the adoption of Amendment No 20.
It was an irresponsible amendment which seeks to maintain Regulations (EC) Nos 2847/93 and 685/95 for a period of 10 years.
Everyone recognises that there is a problem in the Irish Box and that there is a problem with stocks.
It is completely unjustifiable that this Parliament should vote to allow that situation to remain for 10 years.
What is going to be left for Irish fishermen?
The Irish are saying here today that this is a great victory as the Spanish have been kept out!
It is no great victory for Irish fishermen, because there will be no fish to catch!
This nationalistic approach in Parliament towards fisheries is extremely hard to accept from an ecological point of view.
We need to look at the state of stocks and what is there for fishermen.
We need to take scientific advice, not the advice of fishermen only, who take a very short-term view.
They only see as far as the ends of their noses.
We need to ensure that stocks are maintained and, if there is a crisis, that measures are taken to reduce the fishing effort.
What we have done here today is regrettable.
Mr Ã Neachtain's report in committee was very good, but, unfortunately, it was voted down by a few votes because Spanish Members voted for their own interests - just like the Irish.
However, there was a very good compromise, and I cannot understand why Mr Ã Neachtain did not retable just his committee proposals and allow them to go through.
The vast majority of Parliament would have supported that position because it was a very fair and reasonable compromise.
We are in a situation which sends a very bad signal from an ecological and sustainable fisheries point of view.
The situation in the Irish Box will remain unchanged for 10 years, despite the fact that it is recognised that there is a crisis.
This Parliament should take its role seriously in protecting fish stocks and not just protect basic selfish national interests.
It is time we realised that we have to maintain fish stocks.
The Commission and the Council should also take this advice, that it is time we sought to ensure that fish stocks remain, and not just the industry, which will have nothing to fish for in the future if it does not realise that there is a problem.
Mr President, on the issue of fishing, there is a constant tendency in this Parliament to confuse privileges with conservation.
I agree that there must be areas in which special conservation measures must be taken, and even that there must be no fishing in them for many years.
But this conservation has nothing to do with the fact that in certain areas there are States who enjoy the privilege of fishing and others for whom it is banned.
In this regard, the case of the Irish Box for example, or other areas in European Community waters, that is, continental waters, is not the same as the case of the Azores.
In the Azores, the problem is that they do not have a continental shelf, and those islands must be granted a privilege so that they can survive by means of fishing.
In the Irish Box or other areas, we are talking about a privilege granted to several States in violation of Community law.
In this regard, this confusion has been exploited to achieve a vote whose result I believe to be profoundly wrong.
A clear sign needed to be sent to the Council Presidency, because the proposal for a compromise, supported by the Commission and promoted by Spain, intended to create a single Atlantic zone to manage the fishing effort without dividing up the current conservation areas, not only fails to contribute to a sustainable policy in the field of fisheries, but would also have harmful effects, not least for Portugal, in terms of the conservation measures already in place and in socio-economic terms, both for the fleet and for regions that are dependent on the sector.
We therefore helped to ensure that Amendment No 20 to this report was adopted, and we are fully behind it, since it proposes to continue with the current regulations for a period of ten years, after which, the arrangements will be assessed once again.
I wish to state, despite the fact that all of the other proposals for amendments to the regulation have been rejected, that the Committee on Fisheries adopted our proposal to extend the limit of access to the exclusive economic area of the Azores and Madeira to 200 miles.
The Council must also take account of this proposal in its negotiations for a compromise.
.
The proposals before us are sensitive and emotive in more ways than one.
I do not believe the Commission can, on the one hand, say we must open up access to the Irish Box and, on the other, preach conservation and protection of fish in other areas.
I believe the Commission has lost control of the Common Fisheries Policy and is simply becoming the poodle of the Spanish Government and the industry in Spain.
You cannot face both ways at the same time, no matter how hard you try.
Many of us who have served loyally on the European Parliament's Committee on Fisheries for many years have found ourselves sidelined in the interests of expediency.
I warn you clearly, this will not work, will not survive and will ultimately flounder.
The approval by a very large majority of Amendment No 20 was crucial, since it sends a powerful message from the European Parliament about respect for previously established basic principles and valid agreements.
It is also crucial because it vigorously rejects murky political manoeuvres, disguised as clever legal tricks and clearly based on a false assumption, in order to serve the interests of one Member State - Spain.
This would clearly damage the conservation of fisheries resources in particularly sensitive areas of the European coast.
Incidentally, it would be completely unacceptable if, through a revision of the Regulation, the great efforts to preserve resources made in these sensitive areas by some Member States, Portugal and Ireland, to be specific, were ignored.
It is, therefore, hard to understand the restrictions that have for a long time been imposed on the fishermen of these countries, paradoxically paving the way to the further depletion of fisheries resources.
I also strongly support Amendments Nos 8 and 13, which gave appropriate treatment to specific problems facing the sea around the Azores, which are of interest to Europe in general and to the Azores in particular.
In the end, however, it was not necessary to vote for them.
I hope that the Commission and the Council heed - and respect in substance - the extremely clear sign given by Parliament and respect the voice of those who are elected by Europe's citizens.
.
(NL) Following the accession of Spain and Portugal to the European Union, a period of seven years was laid down in 1995 in which the fleets of these countries were denied access to, for example, the North Sea and the Irish Box.
Last December this restrictive measure lapsed.
In this report the Commission is coming forward with a new regulation to regulate the access of, for example, Spanish fishing vessels to the Irish Box.
The attempt by the Commission to eliminate discrimination between the Member States in fleet access is laudable, but it is the fish stocks that lose out.
On the accession of Spain and Portugal it was impossible to foresee what disastrous changes would overtake fish stocks.
Since 1996 the opportunities to catch fish in the area in question have fallen sharply.
The Commission is itself - please note - of the opinion that the maximum level of fishing in these areas requires urgent revision or reduction.
None of this is consistent.
Equal opportunities for all Member States is a fine starting point, but better still is a full sea in which there is enough to fish.
That must be our first priority.
A revision of the allocation formula can therefore only be considered when fish stocks have been restored to sufficient levels of abundance.
It is not acceptable either legally, morally or politically that an amendment in the European Parliament or a report during a consultation procedure can extend the provisions of a Treaty on accession to the EU such as the one relating to Spain and Portugal, as is the case with Amendment No 20 from the UEN Group or Amendments Nos 21 to 30.
Furthermore, I believe that Amendment No 20 is inadmissible within the meaning of Rule 140(1)a) and b) of the EP's Rules of Procedure.
It is unjust, discriminatory and I believe illegal.
I have therefore had to vote against the report bearing the name of the Chairman of the Committee on Fisheries, Mr Stevenson, but in reality produced by Mr Ã Neachtain.
If the Council does not remedy it, it will be the Court of Justice of the European Communities that has to declare the report approved today contrary to Community law, and it will thereby be making the final decision, in the event that the opinion issued today by the EP is followed.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
(The session was suspended at 1.15 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
The next item is the report by Mr Oostlander on Turkey's application for membership of the European Union.
Mr President, as far as Turkey as a candidate Member State is concerned, the door is open, but the road is hard.
That is the message of my report.
For the other candidate Member States that was really self-evident.
They and their citizens have had a lot of trouble in reaching the finishing line and up to the last committee meetings comments were still being made about them in clear tones urging completion of the work.
Turkey is no exception.
There is no reason therefore to give this country special treatment on account of its size or its strategic position.
Turkey does of course have quite different problems from the other candidates.
These problems are mainly in the area of the Copenhagen political criteria.
More than ever perhaps the emphasis in this report is placed on the background to or deeper causes of the political shortcomings which usually manifest themselves in violations of classical freedom rights and of fundamental human rights.
It is also to do with the fact that the Turkish State is based on a philosophy that was developed in the 1920s, a period in which Europe did not provide many pleasant examples from which to draw your ideas.
The criticism of Turkey concerns the structures of the State, the dominant political position of the army, the National Security Council, which is dominated by the military, the nationalism that leads to suppression of ethnic, religious and cultural minorities and the priority for collective security and collective interests over individual human rights, which again and again gives cause for complaint.
The army also has a very strong influence in education, broadcasting and the business community and it is very important that this is also recognised in part in Turkey's latest reform packages.
In the contact with Turkey it is always a question of who are we talking to?
Are we talking to the government and the majority in the parliament or are we in fact talking to the representatives of what people call the 'deep State', the high generals and the high established bureaucracy?
Apart from these problems we also mention those on the borders, with both Cyprus and Armenia and possibly with Iraq.
The lack of a functioning social midfield is also apparent.
There is little room for the trade union movement.
Religious communities, even the Islamic, are under strict state control or are having a hard time.
Other candidates had leeway to make up here too.
The idea of candidate membership is that the country concerned develops into a Member State like the others.
It must not for example make any difference in legal position whether you live in Diyarbakir or in Rotterdam.
If that is the case, then it is impossible to sell membership to our citizens.
A directly elected parliament may see this more readily and with greater concern than a council of ministers.
We therefore invite the Council to be just as clear in its policy towards Turkey as this Parliament and not to cling to symbols and symbolic dates.
Clarity has been the express concern of this report.
It is not honest out of a need for appreciation to remain silent about a series of objections only to conjure them up again at a later date.
Turkey has to know where it stands now.
That means radical changes, as other candidates have also experienced.
Which is why we warmly applaud the plan to draw up a new Constitution, while expressing the wish that the political values that are supported in other Member States will be taken as a starting point.
Furthermore, the army must relinquish its present dominant position and be brought back to a form and function that is usual in other Member States.
This has consequences for the National Security Council and for the state security courts.
Amendments to the law that have in mind the conversion from a military nation, as people write to me, into a civil nation, must prove that their objectives are being achieved in practice.
This is a question of mentality and culture.
The Union must therefore focus its support on actual fulfilment of the political criteria, that is, on retraining and exchange programmes for government officials, especially those in the police, and of lawyers who are involved in courts of justice, and so on. Torture, for example, must now really be over and the return of the expelled and refugees to their villages must not be obstructed by the so-called village guards.
Freedom of religion must not be a dead letter.
Numerous frustrating government measures can in fact be abolished in a short time and it is a constant source of amazement that this does not happen.
Cultural rights must not be recognised in dribs and drabs, but convincingly and generously.
For a while it seemed that the government would indeed be able to establish its authority and we had also hoped that it would, for example, be able to make good its intention to resolve the Cyprus issue on the basis of the UN plan.
That unfortunately proved not to be the case.
A renewed successful attempt will show whether the army is indeed finding its normal role.
Mr President, I am pleased with the broad support for the report that exists in this Parliament.
I have also cast a generous eye over the amendments and where possible given them a plus.
We have agreed with Mr Swoboda that we can accept an amendment from the radical and green corner, concerning the willingness of Turkey to fulfil its tasks under the reforms, as an addition, not as a replacement.
If it is not wanted as an addition, we shall vote against.
But if it is presented as an addition, then we can say, 'yes' to it.
I otherwise hope that the open talk of the debate about religion, culture and politics is not smothered by deletions in paragraph 3, as that is a paragraph that could simply bring this discussion to a tremendously good end.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to take the opportunity of the adoption of the O?stlander report today in order to refer to relations between the European Union and Turkey and developments in the accession strategy for Turkey.
As you know, Turkey is an important partner of the Union, with which we have maintained contractual relations for a very long time.
You can go back as far as 1963.
However, the turning point in this 30-year period was the European Council in Helsinki, when Turkey was acknowledged as a candidate country for accession to the Union on the basis of the same criteria that apply to the other candidate countries.
In Helsinki, the aim of the accession strategy adopted was to help Turkey on its course towards integration and included reinforced political dialogue, pre-accession aid and a procedure for analytical examination of the application of the acquis.
The cornerstone of this pre-accession strategy was the partnership of March 2001, with principles, priorities and interim objectives which would allow Turkey to meet the Copenhagen criteria.
Within this framework, it is necessary to emphasise that important elements are not only the adaptation of legislation in relation to the Copenhagen criteria, but also its material application.
And the Commission has clearly underlined this point, mainly in the annual progress reports.
We have recently monitored certain important internal developments in Turkey.
A new government has taken over power, with strong support from the people.
The new prime minister, Mr Erdogan, has clearly stated that he intends to continue and strengthen the reform process, so that Turkey meets the Copenhagen criteria.
Recent surveys have also shown that this objective is shared by an important majority of public opinion in Turkey.
And I think that this political will is, you might say, reflected in actions and not just words.
At the Copenhagen Council, the Union itself recognised that the new Turkish Government was resolved to proceed with further reform and it urged it in particular to deal quickly with all the weaknesses which continue to exist in the field of political criteria, in relation both to legislation and to the application of legislation.
Within this framework, the Union encouraged Turkey to actively continue the reform process.
If the European Council in December 2004, based on the Commission's report and recommendation, decides that Turkey meets the political criteria of Copenhagen, the Union will renew accession negotiations with Turkey without delay.
That was, as you all know, a very weighty decision for the future of relations between the European Union and Turkey.
We hope that this prospect will act as a catalyst and encourage Turkey to adopt and apply the necessary reforms.
However, I should like at this point for us to see what the situation looks likes six months after Copenhagen.
Ladies and gentlemen, during the Greek Presidency, we have worked systematically to implement the elements of the accession strategy in accordance with the decisions taken in Copenhagen.
The revised partnership adopted by the General Affairs and External Relations Council in April 2003 is of particular importance in helping Turkey to deal with the main issues in its attempt to meet the political criteria.
A revised national programme for the adoption of the acquis, with clearly defined targets, is expected to constitute Turkey's planned response to the new partnership.
Similarly, we have held three political dialogue meetings, one of which at ministerial level, when we had an opportunity to see exactly what is expected of Turkey up to the end of 2004.
The Presidency and the Commission have planned another two meetings in the more specific aim of examining progress in meeting the political criteria.
The Association Council was convened in April at ministerial level and evaluated the progress both of the pre-accession strategy and the status of the partnership.
At this point, I should like, guided by the recently adopted revised partnership, to refer with greater clarity to the main issues that we expect Turkey to deal with up to its evaluation in 2004.
Of course, this is not intended either to discount the Commission evaluation within the framework of this year's, and more importantly, next year's progress report, nor does it have to do with any other criteria over and above the Copenhagen criteria.
The partnership was the product of valuable experience from two years of helping Turkey to adopt political reforms.
This means that efficient account was taken of lessons from recent years, following discussion, both by the Commission and by the Council, which adopted it with slight changes.
What I want to say is that, as we see it, there are two basic issues for promoting Turkey's essential candidature status.
First, democracy has to operate in this country without the obstacles of the past and, secondly, the institutional changes voted through by parliament need to be translated into real administrative and judicial practice.
Political control by the parliament and via a democratically controlled government of all the institutions and bodies of state is, therefore, a basic issue which Turkey will need to address effectively.
This also involves the simple legal adaptation of the rules and raises telling and very material issues in connection with relations between the elected government and the army.
The Union has also publicly referred to this issue and emphasised that there cannot be practices that result in deviations from the Copenhagen criteria and we have noticed that there have recently also been corresponding examples with reference to internal and/or external policy.
On the question of human rights and the rule of law, there has undoubtedly been progress, even in sectors which a short time ago were considered prohibited.
We must not forget that the abolition of the death penalty and the introduction of the right to use and teach minority languages are a big step forward.
And Turkey itself appears to wish to proceed at a fast pace and to achieve the start of accession negotiations by set deadlines.
It is important that we know this ambition, for the realisation of which quite a lot still needs to be done.
At the Association Council last April, the Union clarified the fact that basic outstanding issues in the field of political criteria require Turkey's immediate attention.
These issues mainly include, by way of example, numerous accusations of torture chambers in the country, references to arbitrary arrests and practices of detaining people without judicial proceedings in south-eastern Turkey, contradictory judgments in relation to the punishment of those guilty of torture, court cases which demonstrate that there is still no uniform interpretation and application of provisions relating to the freedom of expression, and the regime concerning religious foundations and communities, which remains particularly restrictive.
We have already expressed our concern about the way in which religious foundations are treated and we continue to hope that the Turkish side will keep its promises, so that, with the necessary additional reforms, the problems that have arisen can be dealt with in accordance with international norms.
Nor has the right been safeguarded for all Turkish citizens, irrespective of their ethnic origin, to enjoy full cultural rights.
The restrictive nature of the recent regulations in the field of radio and television broadcasting and teaching in languages other than Turkish appears to be hampering the application of the August 2002 reforms.
There are also additional elements in relation to the human rights situation.
These are the recent attack by the security forces on the Turkish Human Rights Association, continuing deaths from hunger strikes in high security gaols and the uncertain outcome of the case pending against Leila Zana, which we have also discussed here in Parliament.
All these issues are elements in an imperfect reform process in which reforms formally adopted have not always resulted in practice in the improvement to the situation which had been hoped for.
I could also refer to the report by Amnesty International on Turkey, which paints a picture of a human rights situation with numerous problems, but there is no reason now to go into that in detail.
In addition, however, I wish to mention that there are important priorities which are reflected in the text of the revised partnership and which we expect Turkey to take into serious account.
They cover important sectors of the economic criteria and I think that they also correspond to the stated intention of the Turkish Government to improve the economic situation in the country.
They also cover the important chapter of justice and internal affairs, in which we are looking forward to improved cooperation from the Turkish side and are promoting the conclusion of a Community readmission agreement.
Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to point out that there are another two basic priorities which also have an important position in the partnership.
They relate to Cyprus and Greek-Turkish relations.
Despite the fact that efforts by the United Nations Secretary-General to resolve the Cyprus problem ended in an impasse in the Hague, his plan is still on the table.
The Secretary-General has pointed out that, if a solution is to be found, there must be genuine political commitment to his proposals and a clear timetable for completing negotiations.
The spring Council expressed its regret that efforts by the Secretary-General had failed.
The Union vigorously supports the continuation of the good offices of the Secretary-General and of the negotiations on the basis of his proposals.
We have called on all the interested parties to spare no effort in finding a fair, operational and viable solution and, more specifically, we have called on the Turkish Cypriot leadership to re-examine its position.
Within this framework, the priority of the Turkish partnership to support efforts to find an overall solution to the Cyprus question through the good offices of the Secretary-General and negotiations based on his proposals continues to be of decisive importance.
The President of the European Council also referred to this matter in recent public statements.
The government of the Republic of Cyprus has demonstrated in practice its will to facilitate such a solution.
The protocol on Cyprus attached to the Association Agreement also allows a margin for this development.
But our common will is to achieve something along these lines by 1 May 2004.
The recent opening of the green line constitutes material proof that the two communities on the island can and will live and progress together.
However, practical changes imposed from below, by society, are no substitute for institutional solutions.
These must come about and only thus will Cyprus safeguard the new horizon to which it is entitled after so many years.
The Union and we, as the Presidency and as a Member State, support the need to find a solution on the basis of the Annan plan.
As far, then, as the question of a peaceful solution to the differences is concerned, a change in the atmosphere of Greek-Turkish relations has already been noted in various sectors.
Exploratory contacts between the two ministries of foreign affairs started in March 2002.
Discussions are continuing between senior officials.
The improved climate has resulted in increased bilateral exchanges and a series of agreements.
However, on the other side, the Turkish side, certain practices are being observed, such as by the Turkish air force, which are out of keeping with the aim of deeper relations between Turkey and the Union.
We are looking forward to further progress in this sector on the basis of the principle of a peaceful solution to the differences in accordance with the Helsinki conclusions and the relative priority of the partnership.
As decided in Helsinki, the Council will examine the situation in relation to the outstanding differences and, more importantly, their repercussions on the integration process, with a view to promoting their settlement through the International Court in the Hague by the end of 2004 at the latest.
In closing, allow me to welcome once again Parliament's acute interest in the integration strategy for Turkey.
We shall continue to cooperate with a view to repeating here the clear success which accompanied the political message of enlargement: extension of the area of peace, stability and prosperity and the abolition of the dividing lines of the past.
We especially welcome the fact that the policy for the enlargement of the Union is continuing and is a basic incentive for countries, especially candidate countries such as Turkey, prompting them to further reforms in order to safeguard the values and principles I referred to earlier.
We also welcome the fact that this objective is also the stated wish of the Turkish people and the policy of its elected government.
We are looking forward to the necessary progress being achieved by the deadlines set, so that we can safeguard a positive and auspicious future for relations between the Union and Turkey.
.
(DE) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, today's debate on Mr Oostlander's report comes at an important stage in the development of our policy towards Turkey.
In recent weeks and months Turkey has often been in the limelight, and the most recent international developments have once again highlighted Turkey's importance for peace and stability in a region directly bordering the European Union and which is simultaneously one of the most crisis-prone regions of the world.
At the same time the advantages for the European Union of having a Muslim country standing firmly by its side are becoming ever clearer, providing living proof that it is perfectly possible for such a country to share our values.
One of the great questions of the twenty-first century will be how we shape the relationship between the West and the Islamic world.
Turkey has a key role to play here.
The Copenhagen European Council gave Turkey a clear political road map.
Turkey now has less than 18 months to implement an intensive programme of reforms before the Commission delivers an opinion on whether Turkey meets the Copenhagen political criteria.
In order to support Turkey on the road to EU membership, the Commission has started to implement an enhanced pre-accession strategy.
Firstly, cooperation will be strengthened in a whole raft of areas, such as political and economic dialogue, justice and home affairs, and safety at sea.
The screening of legislation will be intensified, the scope of the customs union will be extended, and trade relations will be strengthened.
Secondly, the Commission has proposed a substantial increase in financial support. It is proposing allocating resources of EUR 1.05 billion for the period 2004-2006.
Part of this support is to be used to foster initiatives aimed at consolidating and developing democratic practices, constitutionality, human rights, equal rights for men and women, and the protection of minorities.
Thirdly, a revised Accession Partnership for Turkey was adopted on 14 April.
Its aim is to support Turkey in meeting the accession criteria.
This of course involves very close attention being paid to the political criteria.
The Accession Partnership provides a framework for assessing Turkey's compliance with the political criteria, and thus for the next steps in dealing with its membership application.
We expect the Turkish Government to react to the Accession Partnership by rapidly adopting a new version of the National Programme for the Adoption of the Acquis, including a clear and timetabled legislative programme.
The reforms adopted in Turkey over the last 18 months are extremely impressive.
Turkey has tackled many of the as yet unsolved problems identified in the Regular Reports.
It is clear that the decision taken in Helsinki to grant Turkey the status of a candidate country has acted as an effective incentive for Turkey to set a series of reforms in train.
We support Turkey's firm intention to make all the remaining legislative changes required in the course of this year.
This will enable Turkey to focus completely on implementation next year.
We have carefully noted the announcement by Prime Minister Erdogan's government that it intends to draw up a new constitution.
Furthermore, we are aware of Turkey's intention to adopt a further package of political reforms in the very new future.
I am delighted to note that just in the last few days leading representatives of Turkey's armed forces have declared their full support for Turkey's European orientation and the associated reforms.
We have clearly identified the remaining shortcomings in relation to these issues in the Accession Partnership.
These concern the abolition of the practice of torture, the elimination of human rights limitations such as restrictions on the freedom of opinion, freedom of association and religious freedom; they also relate to problems with the political role of the military and to respect for cultural rights and compliance with rulings of the European Court of Human Rights.
As mentioned in the 2002 Regular Report, if they are to be effective these reports must also be implemented by Turkey's executive and judiciary.
I would like to stress very firmly that our assessment will not only be based on what legislation has come into force, but also on compliance in practice with the Copenhagen political criteria.
When it comes to respect for human rights and basic freedoms, the picture is rather uneven.
Despite the political reforms it seems that the behaviour of at least some parts of the judiciary, security forces and prison staff has not changed in practice.
There are still many examples of repressive behaviour.
It is evident that concerns about security and the alleged threats to secularisation and to the indivisibility of the state are continuing to play a key role in the behaviour of implementing bodies and of the judiciary.
Most recently, the closure of the HADEP party and the initiation of proceedings against the DEHAP party are examples of this kind of behaviour.
This is why, despite the reforms that have been adopted, it is not yet possible to make a definitive judgment.
Nor do I wish to conceal my concern about certain very recent events that are not in the spirit of the reforms introduced.
That featured in our debate in the last plenary.
It is on the basis of the most recent changes in legislation that Leyla Zana's retrial has been initiated.
It is now extremely important that the new verdict should reflect the spirit of the democratic and constitutional reforms that Turkey has introduced in recent months.
If Turkey wishes to enhance the credibility of its reform process, it must bridge the gap between the spirit of the political reforms and their practical implementation.
I know that because of resistance in some camps this is not easy, but I am sure that Turkey has the strength and the ability to achieve this goal.
As regards the Cyprus question, it remains our top priority to find a comprehensive solution on the basis of the UN plan, so that a united Cyprus can join the EU on 1 May 2004.
So it is now a question of maintaining the political momentum of the Cyprus process.
Against this background, Turkey's support is more important than ever, for two reasons: firstly to allow the Turkish Cypriots, like their Greek Cypriot compatriots, to become fully integrated into the EU, and secondly so as to settle a question which otherwise could act as a brake on achieving Turkey's own aims once the accession negotiations start.
Yesterday, as a sign of good will and with a view to maintaining political momentum, the Commission adopted a package of measures for the Turkish Cypriot community, comprising extensive financial support for economic development and further strengthening links with the European Union, combined with measures to promote trade.
In the area of trade, we are proposing to give goods from the northern part of Cyprus access to the European Union.
I very much hope that all the parties involved will be able to act with sufficient flexibility to allow this to become a reality.
Turkey has only limited time left in which to comply with the Copenhagen political criteria.
The Turkish Government is aware of that and I know that the Turkish Government is determined to make this goal a reality, and I am convinced that it is capable of achieving that.
To this end, the Commission will continue to offer Turkey further encouragement and all the support it needs.
Turkey's reformers need clear and reliable signals from us too, whereas mixed messages will hinder the acceptance of reforms in Turkish society.
I would therefore like to stress once again that the Heads of State and Government of the 15 Member States - all 15 - have in recent years repeatedly and firmly committed themselves to the fundamental principle that Turkey should become a member of the European Union.
No one has said 'no' on principle to possible Turkish membership on strategic, geographical, cultural or religious grounds.
Turkey is a candidate for accession, and it has the right to expect its application for membership to be dealt with honestly, fairly and objectively.
This will be a guiding principle for the Commission in its cooperation with Turkey and in its ultimate assessment of Turkey's readiness for membership.
We would all benefit from a democratic, constitutional, tolerant and internally peaceful Turkey.
(Applause)
Mr President, we all recognise that many reforms need to take place in Turkey in order that its candidacy for the European Union can be taken forward as rapidly as possible.
Turkey does not expect to be treated any more or any less favourably than any other candidate country, but it does expect to be treated fairly.
I have long argued for the need to send a strong, positive signal to Turkey that will sustain the commitment to modernisation and westernisation that has been a feature of that country for 80 years or more.
With the threat to us all from international terrorism and the continuing instability in the Middle East, it is vitally important that Turkey should remain firmly anchored within the alliance of the democracies.
Parliament's report should therefore be upbeat and encouraging, recognising the enormous progress that has been made and the willingness of the Turkish authorities to carry out radical change, while emphasising the steps that still need to be taken to overcome difficulties and obstacles.
Instead, the Oostlander report, even improved as it has been by amendment, is unsympathetic.
It emphasises the negative, places undue weight on the often unverified allegations and views of extremists and minorities, and there is no warmth or friendship.
It rather implies that Turkey is not very welcome.
I am the most ardent campaigner for respect for human rights, but not where this is a cover for subversion or where extremists masquerade under a human rights placard.
Of course we condemn torture - it is inexcusable wherever it takes place - but we should also recognise the political exploitation of torture allegations by opponents of the Turkish regime.
I do not believe it is helpful for any country to institutionalise minorities.
Every effort should be made to integrate minorities into the mainstream of a nation's life without denying them the right to express their own language or culture.
In the name of democracy and human rights the report calls for measures that, without care, would merely serve to empower essentially undemocratic elements, giving greater influence and visibility to fundamental Islamists and extremists who wish to unravel any attachment to western values.
On Cyprus there is a one-sided interpretation of events with no recognition of the positive steps taken by the Turkish Cypriot authorities, no call for generosity by both sides.
I welcome the measures taken by the Commission in the last few days to help lift the embargo.
It is most important that in December 2004 the European Union gives an early date for the opening of negotiations on Turkey's membership.
I am afraid this report quite deliberately sends the opposite signal.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I warmly congratulate Mr Oostlander on producing this very balanced report.
I can offer him some words of consolation: even if the official spokesperson of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats does not support his report, the official spokesperson of the Social Democrats is genuinely 99% behind him.
This can sometimes be comforting in this House.
As Mr Oostlander rightly says, the report shows that the door is open, but the path is arduous.
Now there are some people who tend to emphasise the open door, while others stress the arduous path.
I personally, and the majority of my group, believe that both aspects should be supported equally.
The starting point was the state philosophy of Kemalism, which Mr Oostlander criticised, and we no longer use this term in the report.
I also think that Kemalism has two sides, a positive side, which supports a republican, secular state and rejects religious domination, in this case that of Islam over the civil authorities.
Over the years, however, in the shadow of Kemalism - though not as a result of Kemalism itself - the army has risen to dominance.
Now the new government, as the Commissioner already mentioned, has a somewhat different philosophy.
For this reason, the army is keeping a watchful eye on it, although - and here too I am behind Commissioner Verheugen - there are, thank goodness, some members of the military who recognise the path to democracy, because they know that is also the path to Europe.
I also consider the initiatives of the Turkish Government gradually to remove the military from areas not directly connected to security, such as the media and education, to be the right way forward.
The road ahead is still a long and arduous one, and there will continue to be some resistance, but I believe that the path Turkey has chosen is the right one.
This includes the question of minorities too.
Now, on the subject of minorities, Mr Van Orden, we are not talking about a small minority of 2 to 3 per cent here.
We are talking in some instances about very large minorities, especially if we are referring to the Kurdish minority.
But there are of course other minorities, Greek, Armenian, and Syrian minorities, which must likewise be given due consideration.
May I remind you that Turkey until recently disputed that it had any minorities at all.
It no longer spoke of minorities at all, other than religious minorities.
It was precisely due to the insistence of this Parliament, together with the Commission, but probably especially this Parliament, that we have managed to change these things.
If we had always been as soft in our demands as Mr Van Orden wants, then we would not be where we are now.
I know, too, that Commissioner Verheugen has often been criticised in Turkey for his tough but clear words.
Only in this way can we also help Turkey to continue on this path of change and progress with reform, which is the right path.
My final remarks concern the issue of Cyprus. I visited Cyprus recently - the Greek part of the island, I hasten to add.
I saw how delighted people were to be able to visit their old villages and homes.
I also heard many Greek Cypriots say that they were given a very warm welcome by the Turkish Cypriots, which cannot be easy when you suddenly invite someone to your home, knowing that you were actually the person who occupied the house.
And yet these friendly contacts have resulted.
I do not know how long this will last.
Messrs Denktash senior and junior probably even conceived this measure of opening the border as a way of forcing the international community to recognise the Republic of Northern Cyprus.
I only recall what it was like with the GDR, although of course the two things are not entirely comparable.
What one side wants is one thing, but the reality is quite another.
And the reality is that, sooner or later, Cyprus will be a united Cyprus, because this unnatural border, this last border of walls and barbed wire, can no longer be sustained.
If we can help - and Cyprus' accession and our positive, critical stance towards Turkey will help - then it would be a great success for this Europe to see this last barbed-wire border disappear from Europe.
(Applause)
Mr President, Turkey has won the Eurovision Song Contest, but has not yet scored enough points for the integration festival.
Our Turkish friends have undeniably made progress on very many fronts in recent years.
If the country meets the Copenhagen criteria, the European Union will have to keep to the promises it has made.
I am pleased that, in his well thought-out and sympathetic report, the Christian Democrat Mr Oostlander recognises that the universal values of democracy, constitutional state and human rights can very well be accepted and defended in a country with a clear Muslim majority.
It is crucially important for us that Turkey develops quickly into a fully-fledged democracy, in which the armed forces are subordinate to elected politicians.
It is for this reason that the Turkish National Security Council with its present powers and in its present form must be dissolved.
Many quarters point to the important role of the military in guarding the secular State.
It is said to act as a bulwark against rising Muslim fundamentalism.
I should like to point out however that it is not only the task of the military to keep Muslim radicalism at bay, but of all responsible leaders.
As far as necessary the structure of the State must be adapted to anchor all the democratic requirements.
We therefore support the reforms of the political and legal system the Erdogan government has in mind.
We are naturally very curious about the precise details of the new Constitution.
This is not a matter of more or less Kemalism, but simply of the compatibility with universal standards and the demands of EU membership.
We are glad that the Erdogan government has now tabled legislative proposals to strengthen freedom of speech and to permit the use of Kurdish in audiovisual resources and election campaigns.
Nonetheless I would, with Mr Oostlander, point to the fact that a successful legislative process is not sufficient in itself.
It comes down above all to its application in practice.
While the police remain free to torture prisoners and human rights continue to be violated, there is no way, as far as I am concerned, that the negotiations can begin.
A drastic softening of Turkey's attitude to the Cyprus problem is also needed.
The failure of the Hague conference was attributable in no small part to the rigidity of the Turkish position.
Ankara should allow itself to be led more by the positive attitude of the Turks who live in Cyprus than by the negative pronouncements of their leader there.
Finally, Turkey will have to develop a policy of good neighbourliness with Armenia, which can then in due course lead to a political gesture of which the Armenians have such incredibly great need.
In December 2004 we are going to take stock, but there cannot yet be any question of accession in the near future.
There is still a very long way to go before the whole of Europe, away from the song festival, votes for Turkey.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the efforts of Mr Oostlander's report to do justice to developments in Turkey.
The many amendments have clearly improved the report.
The problem areas have now been stated in more concrete terms and the criticism has generally been couched in more objective language than before.
There nevertheless remains one anomaly that cannot be overlooked.
Although religious minorities are discussed at quite some length, it is somewhat surprising that the concerns of the Kurdish population - some 20 million people - are dealt with rather briefly.
In view of the multifarious harassments and threats they have been exposed to, it is an intolerable trivialisation of the issue to call upon the Turkish Government to create a more relaxed and constructive relationship with its own citizens of Kurdish origin.
I would certainly have preferred to see clear words of criticism here.
Ultimately, the problems are many and varied.
The precarious situation of the human rights organisation EHD, for example, is given no mention at all.
Its premises were searched only recently.
Threats are commonplace, and some reference to the difficult position of human rights activists in Turkey would have been appropriate.
Criticism regarding the case of Leyla Zana and the other DEP party MPs could have been expressed more clearly.
Three days of negotiations have already taken place, but they are still in prison.
The negotiations process resembles a farce, and seems far from likely that the court will lift its sentence violating human rights and set them free.
The report makes absolutely no mention of the case of ÃÃ§alan.
His trial, too, was classified as unfair by the European Court of Human Rights.
It would therefore also be appropriate to reopen his case.
It is evidently too delicate an issue, however, for the name of ÃÃ§alan to bear mention in a report of the European Parliament.
The report rightly condemns the banning of HADEP and the threat of court action to ban DEHAP.
There is no mention, however, of the order prohibiting leading members of HADEP from engaging in political activity.
Why not?
A clear stand should have been taken on this issue.
On the other hand, in other places the report would have benefited from being less arrogant.
I find it unspeakable that the report refers to the humanist and Judeo-Christian culture of Europe, making out that Europe has always been a stronghold of democracy, the rule of law, human and minority rights, and freedom of religion and conscience.
It patronisingly adds that an Islamic country too can accept and defend these values.
Completely aside from the fact that Islam too has always played a part in Europe, I would like to recall, as a German especially, that the values that are allegedly so typically European are not quite so deeply rooted in Europe.
European history ranges across the Christian Crusades to the crimes of the colonial era - not to mention the horrors of fascism.
Moreover, the reference to religion is utterly superfluous.
The EU is a political and economic union.
For a country to accede to it, there are clear criteria that must be fulfilled.
Whether they are fulfilled against a Christian, Muslim, Jewish or atheist background is irrelevant.
The main thing is that they are fulfilled.
In Turkey at the moment, this is unfortunately not the case.
The report, despite all its shortcomings, demonstrates this and makes it clear that there are no plans to open accession negotiations at the present time.
It is to the report's credit, however, that it also clearly states that accession in general for Turkey remains a possibility.
Let us hope that the report will contribute to changing the policy of the Turkish Government in such a way that enables Turkey to accede to the European Union.
Mr President, the most important work on Mr Oostlander's report has already been done.
It was in fact done in committee.
Here what was - I have to say - an unbalanced report, whose tone was not always exactly upbeat, was transformed by radical amendments into one that is critical yet balanced, one in which a clear distinction is made between on the one hand what has been achieved and on the other the undoubtedly long, but concrete list of points that have still to happen.
Just three brief remarks about the text.
Mrs Uca, I am afraid that - if you listen - you have still not understood the precise implications of paragraph 3.
In it the rapporteur in my view rightly makes a distinction between the Judaeo-Christian and humanist roots on the one hand, the universal values to which they have led on the other hand, and the fact that this is no barrier to the accession of an Islamic majority country - a formulation that I can share with all my heart.
My second remark is directed towards the Members from the GUE/NGL Group, whom I urge to stop doing the dirty work of the Armenia lobby.
In my eyes there is a carefully considered compromise on this question in the text and I honestly find the constant attempts to tighten the thumbscrews on this point increasingly irritating.
Finally, a third remark in response to the rapporteur's proposal.
On behalf of my group I can agree to the addition to the text of Amendment No 11 instead of an improvement of the text.
Fellow Members, it is crucial in the debate to keep an eye on the background against which we are doing this now, the background against which this debate about the EU-Turkey relationship is taking place.
It is in fact one of a constant struggle between, on the one hand, the reformers - strong in the government and in Parliament - and on the other, the conservatives - strong in the army, the police and the judiciary.
In this struggle it is the task of the European Union, but also of the European Parliament, to - naturally - criticise the conservatives.
We are very good at this and we must carry on with it above all.
For example, if it is a question of banning the HADEP - unacceptable.
For example, if it is a question of descending on human rights organisations - indefensible.
For example, if it is a question of the refusal to give Layla Zana and her colleagues a really fair new trial.
An inseparable part of this criticism as far as I am concerned however is the support for the reformers and this we are occasionally inclined to forget.
For example, if it is a question of the new package of reform proposals that is now before the Turkish Parliament and in which, after long urging by the European Parliament, for example Article 8 of the Anti-Terrorism Act is actually deleted and in which Kurdish private media are actually being given the opportunity to broadcast.
We must take care to retain this balance and what I very much wish to avoid is to create the impression that in Turkey it was nothing, is nothing and never will be anything.
I believe that Turkey can implement the reforms, I think that they deserve our support.
Finally, Mr President, we will all have to answer the question of whether we want it to be successful.
