- the report by Mr Valdis Dombrovskis, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the draft general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2006 (Section I, European Parliament; Section II, Council; Section IV, Court of Justice; Section V, Court of Auditors; Section VI, European Economic and Social Committee; Section VII, Committee of the Regions; Section VIII (A), European Ombudsman; Section VIII (B), European Data Protection Supervisor) [C6-0300/2005 2005/2002(BUD)] (A6-0307/2005).
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, two questions have often sprung to my mind during this long process that has brought us to the vote at first reading.
First, what is the budget?
Is it a dull accounting exercise or a key political act?
Secondly, do the decisions â or rather âcodecisionsâ â that we make actually correspond to our citizensâ priorities, and is it really our job to fund these priorities or would it be fairer if they were funded out of national or regional budgets?
I believe these two questions, which apply both to the annual budget and to the financial perspectives, come before any analysis of budget lines and spending categories.
They form the crux of a debate that has to rise above arid technicalities, because it is an altogether political debate.
Whether the European Union should take certain measures and not others is not something that should be decided behind closed doors, fuelling a stale, vacuous dialectic between proponents of stringent and attitudes.
This is a central theme of the European political agenda: I have to say to the Council representatives that I am astounded that there is no place for such questions at tomorrowâs Summit of Heads of State or Government.
How can the Unionâs social agenda be drafted without also linking it to the decisions made in the annual and multiannual budgets?
That is a mystery that I hope will be answered today in the speech by President-in-Office Blair.
The financial resources needed to carry out our work are a key issue.
The time has come to take the bull by the horns.
The issue is this: are there responsibilities that have to be met at a supranational level?
Is there European added value in respect of national public spending?
What are these policies and programmes and where do they fit into the European budget?
I shall give you some examples.
First, cohesion policy: is it a necessary policy and who should make it?
There is no doubt that the Union is still marked by social, economic and regional imbalances.
It is therefore imperative to promote economic development by addressing structural shortcomings, stimulating sustainable growth and significantly boosting employment and competitiveness.
This policy needs to be made at European level because that is the only level at which it can be effective in terms of costs, procedure rationalisation and standardisation, resource sharing, objective setting and exchange of good practice.
My second example is research.
Does research policy need to be made at European level?
In other words, looking beyond the individual Member States and private players, should there also be a direct research commitment at European level?
The competitive gap that has opened up in recent years, leaving our continent lagging behind both emerging and established economies, is plain for all to see.
Can we close the gap just with protective measures, or do we instead need to enhance European research efforts by creating centres of excellence, adding value to industry and small and medium-sized enterprises, promoting cooperation between the public and private sectors especially through research infrastructure and public-private partnerships, disseminating knowledge, and networking our researchers working around the world?
As you know, the European Union trains more science and engineering PhDs than the United States, but many of them decide to emigrate or switch to different careers.
There are currently some 85Â 000 to 90Â 000 European researchers working in the scientific research sector in the United States.
Increasing investment at European level can surely help to improve this situation.
In this respect, a look at data from around the world shows that the European Union has a long way to go to catch up with its main competitors.
In 2001, the European Union spent 1.9% of its GDP on research, whereas Japan earmarked 3.1% and the United States 2.8%.
The key programme for our actions in this area, as we all know, is the sixth framework programme, and the seventh framework programme is currently nearing completion.
Can we leave these instruments without adequate funding?
My third example is education, training, culture and youth policies.
MrÂ Blair is right to remind us â as he did in his passionate and well-received inaugural speech for the UK Presidency here in this House â that we have to modernise our social model and drastically cut the dreadful figure of 20 million unemployed by raising productivity, training more workers in the sciences and making human capital our top priority.
His position is likely to become less effective, however, unless it is accompanied by consistent decisions on the financial means to implement it.
We have made some specific choices by increasing the amounts for youth-oriented programmes.
Before this budget there had perhaps never been such a large increase for the three fundamental youth programmes: Socrates, Leonardo and YOUTH.
We must send out a strong message to the young people of Europe and remain consistent with the Youth Pact, which the Governments themselves launched a few months ago.
We must set up new pilot schemes, such as Erasmus for young entrepreneurs and Erasmus for upper secondary school students (16- to 18-year-olds).
Lastly, external actions.
We have seen a paradoxical situation arise in recent years.
On the one hand, the European Union has rightly been called upon to play a more united and incisive role in world affairs, yet on the other there has also been a demand, particularly from the Member States, to retain the power of veto on external policy as well as an utterly inadequate level of funding.
The people of Europe are thus all the more justified in lamenting the Unionâs substantial lack of influence on the broader international stage.
The Community budget, roughly amounting to a mere EUR 5Â billion, is now expected to cover reconstruction in Iraq, reconstruction in Afghanistan, the tsunami emergency, humanitarian aid, strengthening democracy, protecting human rights in crisis regions, fighting poverty and destitution, cooperation programmes in the Mediterranean and the Balkans, and dozens and dozens of other major initiatives.
On top of that, it has just been announced â and rightly so â that we need to increase our aid for the reconstruction of Pakistan in the post-earthquake emergency there.
Then it has also been announced that we will make a more substantial contribution to assist the Middle East peace process.
All that means that we are caught in an untenable position between these political statements, commitments and â I venture to say â duties, and the heading 4 appropriation, which is only EUR 5Â billion.
This contradictory position leads our fellow citizens to see us all â the European Parliament, the Commission and the European Council â as classic cases of ineffectual leaders.
Those, then, are the issues that I believe concern our budget.
I regard the strategy adopted by the Committee on Budgets as being based on the following principles: remaining consistent with previous yearsâ approaches; leaving all possible strategic options open to Parliament, so that a final decision can be made during conciliation in November, without nullifying the interinstitutional agreement at this juncture, but making maximum use of the flexibility instrument to stand by all our priorities; guaranteeing an adequate general level of payments; ensuring an adequate general level of Structural Fund payments; providing maximum support to achieve the Lisbon goals by increasing funding for small and medium-sized enterprises, research, the environment and above all youth policies; increasing the financial commitment under heading 4 (external actions), where the ceiling does not allow funding for the new emergencies that every year are added to the existing ones â Afghanistan, Iraq, the tsunami â at the same time as Parliamentâs traditional priorities.
I shall spare you the figures, which you know at least as well as I do, and move on to the political conclusion.
Representatives of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, that is our position.
It is a strong and reasonable position for an ambitious yet unpretentious budget. It is a position on which we are united, thanks to responsible contributions by all the political groups.
I should like to thank all the group coordinators in the Committee on Budgets and all those Members who have contributed to our work and enabled us to examine the 900 or more amendments, and who thus far have ensured a very broad consensus for our platform.
I am grateful to the Commissioner for the cooperation that has been established, which has grown stronger and stronger and become invaluable, to the extent that our positions have become very broadly convergent.
I thank MrÂ Lewis, the Council representative: I thank him today for the perfect courtesy with which he has conducted his dialogue with Parliament; I should like to thank him tomorrow for the positive responses that I hope the Council will give us during conciliation.
My thanks also go to Chairman Lewandowski and the staff and secretaries that have assisted me, particularly my peerless assistant â please excuse this personal note, but it is sincere and well-deserved â in the gruelling work of recent months; I am sure she will continue to do it.
My final message is again addressed directly to the Council.
We often say that there is bound to be a terrible tug-of-war between Parliament and the Council between first and second reading.
However, I ask the Council: is that really the case?
Is it inevitable that blood will run in Charlemagneâs golden halls?
Do we have to come armed with Article 272 hidden up our sleeve?
Is it so very difficult to understand that what is at stake is not a collection of crazy corporative demands but, more simply and dramatically, the future and the fate of Europe, of our institutions, and of the relationship of trust between us and our fellow citizens â a relationship that has worn very thin but can still be mended and revived?
This budget is a bridge to the new programming period.
It comes at a terrible time in the life and history of the Union.
It cannot escape you, MrÂ Lewis, your representatives who are here today, or even MrÂ Blair, that there are challenges that no one can face alone, no matter how faithful you are to the British tradition, from Churchill onwards, whereby you are more partners than part of united Europe.
These challenges, from cohesion to competitiveness to external actions, can only be faced by the Union if it has sufficient financial means to do so.
The new global scenarios, which could not even be foreseen when the current financial perspectives were decided in 1999, place pressing demands on us to which we must respond appropriately.
I think very few people are asking for less Europe, while many are demanding more Europe.
My hope is that the second half of the UK Presidency will present us with two shining, decisive outcomes to get us back on our feet.
Together we can deliver a good budget for 2006, and together we can deliver the new financial perspectives by the end of this year, ushering in a new period of confidence in the European project.
Â Â  Mr Pittella, thank you for your explanations and for adhering so strictly to your speaking time.
The advantage of the European Union is that we can be sure that we may have anything running through the rooms of the building but blood.
Thank you for your image, which reminds us of our current situation.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow the European Parliament is to vote on the European Unionâs budget for 2006.
The significance of this vote will be greater than just the setting of an annual allocation of EU finances.
2006 is the last year of the existing Financial Perspective.
Therefore, the 2006 budget will also serve as a point of reference in taking decisions for the next Financial Perspective, that for 2007â2013.
With regard to the 2006 budget for the other EU institutions, the main priorities are EU enlargement and the effective and highly targeted use of EU budget resources.
The first priority is connected with the successful completion of the 2004 round of EU enlargement, by fully integrating representatives from the new EU Member States into the EU institutions, as well as preparations for the next round of EU enlargement, when Bulgaria and Romania will join.
We have an unacceptable situation where, despite more than a year having already passed since EU enlargement, many permanent staff posts set aside for the new Member States still remain vacant.
One of the problems to be emphasised in this connection is the excessive red-tape and slow procedures for taking on staff.
In order to ensure that the next round of EU enlargement is successful, it is proposed that support should be given to all the permanent staff posts requested by the other institutions in connection with enlargement, and also other additional expenditure connected with EU enlargement.
The second priority is effective and highly targeted use of EU budget resources.
This priority encompasses such matters as: focusing EU institutional expenditure on fundamental tasks; giving support to requests for new budget requests and permanent staff posts only after having assessed the possibility of redistributing resources and staff within the framework of the existing budget; giving support to new initiatives only after having assessed their impact on the budget and interinstitutional cooperation with a view to economical and effective use of budget resources.
Both institutions with budgetary decision-making powers â the European Parliament and the Council â endorse the principles of budgetary discipline and the rational use of EU taxpayersâ money.
The Council is proposing to reduce the administrative expenditure of the other institutions by 15Â million euro as compared with the institutionsâ original requests.
It must be said, however, that in many cases this reduction has been implemented in an ill-considered manner, without thorough examination of the specific nature and problems of the institutionsâ work.
Following a careful review of the requests in the budget for the other institutions it is proposed to restore part of the reductions made by the European Council to the budget â a total amount of 7.5Â million euro.
With regard to the European Parliament budget, firstly I should like to emphasise the issue of the ceiling on joint expenditure.
After a wide-ranging discussion within the Committee on Budgets, taking into account the experience of last year with inflated budget votes and the resulting failure to achieve Parliamentâs budgeted expenditure, it is proposed to reduce Parliamentâs budgeted expenditure by 20Â million euro as compared with the administrationâs requests.
I believe that the European Parliament budget ought to be set on the basis of needs that have been established following careful evaluation.
Achieving a ceiling of 20% of total administrative expenditure is not an end in itself.
Of course, the issue of the sum of over 200 million euro per year which is spent additionally in order to provide the European Parliament with a seat in Strasbourg is still a topical one.
The main problem is the maintenance of two European Parliament buildings in parallel, in Brussels and Strasbourg.
It must be acknowledged that this matter falls within the jurisdiction of the European Council.
Considerable attention has been paid in the European Parliamentâs budget for 2006 to information and communication policy, to ensure that information is accessible and that the work of the European Parliament is better explained to EU citizens.
The European Parliamentâs role as the representative of the EU Member States should be especially stressed in this connection.
Various measures have already been taken.
I can mention, for instance, the launch of the new European Parliament home page, where much more emphasis has been placed on current information about the work of the European Parliament in all the official EU languages.
It is proposed that in 2006 the European Parliamentâs visitorsâ programme should be improved, and that a special reserve should be established for information and communication.
Finally, I should like to return to the issue I emphasised at the beginning of my speech.
In view of the fact that 2006 is the final year of the current Financial Perspective, it is important for the total amount of commitment and payment appropriations for the 2006 budget to correspond with the commitments which the European Union has undertaken, including those connected with EU enlargement.
I fully agree with what Mr Pittella said, that in 2006 it is necessary to provide an adequate amount of payment appropriations, including for the Structural Funds.
The attitude adopted by the European Council in connection with the EU budget for 2005, where it artificially blocked the amount of payment appropriations, was unacceptable.
Now the unjustified nature of the European Councilâs stance has become obvious.
The European Commission is preparing amendments to the 2005 budget, providing a larger sum of payment appropriations for the Structural Funds.
If the European Council tries once more to block the amount of payment appropriations for the 2006 budget, that will prove the Councilâs unwillingness to fully finance those commitments which the EU has undertaken within the framework of the existing Financial Perspective.
It must be said that this indulging in empty promises without backing them up with deeds increases the alienation and scepticism that citizens feel towards the EU.
In conclusion, I would also like particularly to draw the attention of Commissioner GrybauskaitÄ to the poor quality of the Latvian translation of the budget prepared by the European Commission.
For example, budget lines 02030202 and 02030203, which deal with medicines for treating rare diseases. The Commissionâs Latvian translation talks about resources for treating orphans and medicines for orphans.
Therefore, the Commissioner should not be surprised: she is going to receive requests from Latviaâs orphans to fund their medicines, since that is what it actually says in the translation prepared by the European Commission.
Thank you for your attention.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mr Dombrovskis.
Amongst all of us we will try to improve our multilingual communication procedures.
Â Â  .
I would like to thank Parliament for its evaluation of the draft budget for 2006, Mr Pittella for his appraisal of our growing understanding and the cooperation of the Commission and Parliament as well as the manner in which all discussions and preparations for budget acceptance have taken place.
In order to avoid translation-related problems, I will continue in English.
To avoid interpreting problems, I would like to give my more technical presentation in English.
Mr Pitella has set us a fine example with his presentation.
I shall go through the various headings.
On agricultural expenditure, under heading 1a, the Commission will, in a weekâs time, present its new estimates in accordance with the new market tendencies which, according to our information, will mean a reduction in the estimates that the Commission proposed for agricultural expenditure.
As regards the second heading â structural actions â the PDB proposed by the Commission was presented and established on the basis of observed trends and our revised estimates, which do not exactly correspond with those of the Member States.
The Commission will submit an amending letter at the beginning of November, bearing in mind that we will be receiving the final data from the Member States at the end of this month, so we will be coming to you in the first weeks of November with the final level, which will have to be determined in trialogue in November.
On internal policies, Parliament has tabled a lot of amendments, mainly on co-decided programmes.
So, as usual, the Commission confirms that it will support any proposals in the co-decided envelope, if this is agreed between two budgetary authorities.
External action is the most difficult heading for all of us, especially because it entails pressure as regards the use of the Flexibility Instrument.
Next year we will need expenditure at least for the tsunami and for sugar reform, and it is becoming clear that two further items of expenditure will be needed: support for Gaza and the earthquake in Pakistan.
This defines and distinguishes clearly how we should reflect or understand the Flexibility Instrumentâs usage in future, and I would like to re-confirm what I said recently in COBU: the Commission and its Legal Service understand that, for 2006, up to EUR 493 million are available under the Flexibility Instrument.
On administrative expenditure and posts, I welcome the reinstatement of all the PDB requests we presented.
I also welcome the reaction from Council and Parliament to our message sent in September about recruitment, and I would like to correct a point in Mr Dombrovskisâ presentation.
All 1480 posts for new Member States have been filled as at present.
There are no vacant posts left.
We are doing our best.
So, if EUR 16 million is to be reserved in the way proposed today, subject to very demanding conditions, which cannot be met promptly next year, we will be confronted with recruitment problems in respect of about half of the new posts proposed, some 200 to 300 posts.
Nonetheless, the Commission will take the opportunity to comment on the amendments as a whole, especially those to be tabled â and which are indeed of great importance to Parliament â in our letter on implementability.
I will send this to you in advance of the second reading.
We would like to wish the rapporteur and Parliament a very constructive debate and successful vote tomorrow.
The Commission will be on your side, helping to reach a deal for 2006 in November or, at the latest, in December.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, in my capacity as deputy for the draftsman, MrsÂ De Keyser, I should like to highlight three points raised by the Committee on Foreign Affairs.
The first point concerns the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights, for which we do not accept the 25% cut proposed by the Commission and we call for at least the 2005 budget figure to be restored.
The second point concerns aid for reconstruction in Iraq.
We should like the Communityâs money to be spent transparently by entrusting it to the United Nations agencies operating in Iraq.
Lastly, we call on the Council for greater clarity when mentioning the use of funds for the European Union special representatives.
Pending explanations from the Council, the Committee on Foreign Affairs has proposed cutting the payment appropriations ascribed to the budget line in question by EURÂ 1.5 million.
Â Â  . Mr President, I want to congratulate Mr Pittella, the rapporteur, on having produced an excellent budget statement, and the Commissioner.
Mr Pittella has very kindly accepted about 80% of the Committee on Developmentâs amendments to the budget.
We all know that this budget is very stretched.
Mr Pittella has himself explained how external actions have been very difficult: Afghanistan, Iraq, the tsunami, Gaza, and the earthquake.
The earthquake represents a challenge.
Three million people are stranded on mountainsides freezing to death.
They have no tents, food or water.
Logistically it is impossible to supply them with food, water and heat, etc. We do not know how much it is going to cost this year.
The response to the tsunami was magnificent â I was caught up in the middle of it.
USDÂ 5.3 billion was raised globally, of which the European Union committed EURÂ 160 million and then further sums under the flexibility instrument.
However, I am conscious that the UK Presidency is very concerned about the earthquake and Pakistan.
To feed and look after three million people over the winter will be difficult.
Do we adopt a family and ask the Pakistani people in Karachi, Lahore or Rawalpindi to look after these people over the six-month period and help them with coupons, ration cards and provide them with food so that we do not allow them to starve and die on mountain tops?
I do not know.
I am also very grateful that much of what the Committee on Development has asked for has been given.
I only regret that the handwashing programme â which we talked about in my committee â was not accepted by the budget rapporteur.
I would like that to be noted.
Â Â  . Mr President, I think we are all agreed that trade can do more for development than all the aid and debt relief we give.
In other words, Hong Kong in December can be more important for development than the Gleneagles summit in the summer was.
However, there is more to trade than simple liberalisation: we have to give developing countries assistance in getting their goods to the market and we have to give them assistance in terms of meeting our technical and health standards.
That is why the Committee on International Trade is proposing a new budget line called 'aid for trade'.
It is not that we do not already have trade assistance in our budget, but at the moment it is spread over two hundred different budget lines.
The Trade Committee would like this to be unified into one single budget line.
We would like a clear budget line so that aid for trade is more easily mobilised, more visible and more accessible to the developing countries.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner very much indeed for coming today.
I would also like to start by thanking the rapporteur of the Committee on Budgets for coming to a couple of meetings of the Committee on Budgetary Control and listening to the concerns and queries of the Committee.
It is a very healthy process for us all to be involved in.
The process by which the Budgetary Control Committee operates is as follows: we go through our discharge reports and look at conclusions and points that we have raised with which the House has concurred and which the Commission has not completely implemented, and then draw up amendments to try to ensure implementation in the future.
We also look at the OLAF budget in great detail because it is one of the areas where we have many concerns and will have many concerns in the future.
This year, OLAF asked for a great deal more staff, in fact 25 new staff and an increase in its budget of 10Â %, which our committee, the committee that should be the most proactive and supportive of OLAF (as I believe it probably is), was concerned that this level of new staff was not actually required.
One of the amendments in the budget this year has details on that.
We are seeking a satisfactory explanation, which I am not sure we have properly received.
We also called on the European Court of Justice and the European Court of Auditors to amend their respective administrative decisions by 1 November of this year in such a way as to rule out the private use of official cars, and there are amendments in the budget for that.
Finally, and completely off track and on a personal note, there is an amendment signed by all Members across this House to allow funding of Europe-wide events to encourage the social inclusion of young people and mentally disabled people through sporting activities, which I hope the rapporteur will pick up.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I should like to outline our budgetary priorities.
Firstly, we need appropriate resources to ensure high quality and coherent economic analyses enabling accurate economic prospects to be established for the Union.
You know that we are committed to the PRINCE Programme âThe euro, a currency for Europeâ because, as we also know, a second wave of euros is due to be introduced and we therefore need to continue to keep citizens in all of our countries interested in the currency.
Finally, we are very keen to help SMEs by promoting both a viable economic environment for microenterprises and ethical financing instruments.
As for giving support to the Fiscalis Programme, which is aimed at improving the functioning of the indirect taxation systems of the internal market, we are training the officials required in each country because, as far as we are concerned, doing so will guarantee that the Union has a future and is secure and prosperous.
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to thank Mr Pittella for his outstanding work throughout the 2006 budgetary procedure.
The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, for whose opinion I was the draftsperson, welcomes the fact that the Committee on Budgets has acknowledged and accepted the need to increase certain headings, and, moreover, to reinstate the amounts laid down in the preliminary draft budget with regard to the European Social Fund, the EQUAL programme, EURES, measures to fight and prevent social exclusion and the Leonardo programme.
Nonetheless, some of our suggestions fell by the wayside, some of which are very close to our hearts, and I should like to bring them to your attention.
For example, Europass is an instrument for promoting the transparency of qualifications, a key factor in achieving the Lisbon goals and was presented within a package along with the Leonardo programme.
We believe that the allocations to Europass should be increased, yet these aspects were not taken into account.
I should also like to draw your attention to the situation of the Bilbao agency, which, without any budgetary adjustment since 2004, either in terms of inflation, or in terms of meeting the needs of the enlargement, will soon be entirely unable to continue functioning.
Lastly, I should like to pay tribute to Mr Pitellaâs efforts on behalf of the European Year of Workersâ Mobility; firstly in including it as a special annual event, given that it could not be envisaged as a pilot project; and secondly given its importance and, objectively speaking, its effectiveness in meeting the aims of making the European economy competitive.
Â Â  .Â Â Â MrÂ President, the Committee on Transport and Tourism has examined this budget in the light of the cuts that have already been made under the current Financial Perspective, which will soon enter its final year.
We should therefore like to register our protest at the proposal to reduce spending on the trans-European networks by EURÂ 120Â million.
We believe that the trans-European networks are a key tool for implementing the vision of a cohesive Europe and that of regional development.
Furthermore, we cannot consent to the Councilâs amendments aimed at reducing expenditure on transport safety bodies.
In particular, we are opposed to the cuts made to spending on the prevention of marine pollution.
In view of these two key issues, we should like to make it quite clear that an efficient transport system is in the interests of the citizens of the EU and of its economy, and I would ask all the political groups and Members of this House to lend us their support.
I should like to pay tribute to MrÂ Pittella, who has contributed so much to work on this draft budget.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee for Regional Development has, in its opinion on the budget, agreed to the Commissionâs proposals and reinstated the preliminary draft, with particular reference to the payments.
The rapporteur took the needs of the Member States into account by again increasing the payments by 40%, and so there are two things I ask of them.
One is that they should actually spend this money properly and in accordance with up-to-date knowledge, and the other is that, in the debate on the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective, they take that into account and budget accordingly for cohesion policy in future.
I would like to ask the House to endorse two more proposals from the Regional Committee, one being for a project on the European networking of SMEs, and the other for a study on the particular needs of the new Member States as regards the reconstruction of panel-built housing estates â a problem we have frequently discussed in this House without any exact knowledge of the challenges with which these present the Member States in question.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I too wish to thank the rapporteur, Mr Pittella, who has set both the political vision of this budget and the technical vision, which is direct and functional.
The credibility of the European Parliament will also be judged on this budget.
Up to now, the Commission has told us that agricultural spending will be improved or will be determined on the basis of a corrective letter.
I consider that it is not a sign of credibility for us to debate this issue of agricultural spending, of a large section, under the influence of a corrective letter.
However, nor will the European Parliament be credible if it votes for the amendment by the Committee on Budgets, on the basis of which Community subsidies are being put in reserve, by which we mean frozen, at a time when the reform of the COM in tobacco is here and has been voted on by all the governments of the Member States.
I should like to ask the Commission why it has not also included tobacco in the new draft budget, together with all the products which it has included in the subdivisions of category 1.
As far as gender equality is concerned, the amendment already adopted by the Committee on Budgets on strengthening the Daphne programme and programmes to subsidise and help fund women's organisations, especially the European women's lobby, should be supported.
Â Â  . Mr President, I speak as a replacement for Mr Mulder, who drafted the opinion of the Committee on Fisheries.
Our committee has more confidence in the figures advanced by the Commission in the PDB than in the Council's estimates.
Accordingly, we propose restoration of the Commission's figures.
These are already cautious ones and there are a number of priorities for us.
They include supporting the newer Member States in making adjustments to their fisheries sector, investment in environmentally friendly fishing methods, adequate funding for the development of regional advisory councils, economic aid to assist those whose livelihood is affected by reductions in fishing effort, more consistent allocation of appropriations for research, greater account of the needs of remote regions and better implementation of control instruments so as to ensure respect for both substantive and financial rules.
We look to all the appropriate institutions for their endorsement of this approach.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the amendments adopted by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs to the draft general budget for 2006 were mainly centred around three objectives: the fight against terrorism, the control of the EUâs external borders and the protection of citizensâ personal data.
Generally speaking â and, at this point, I should like to thank our general rapporteur and my fellow Members from the Committee on Budgets â these amendments have been accepted by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and will, I hope, be adopted tomorrow by plenary.
Turning more specifically to the fight against terrorism, we are proposing a substantial increase in the operational resources given to Eurojust, at the same time as increasing by nearly 30% the appropriations allocated to the pilot project, which our Parliament wanted in order to coordinate more effectively the resources for anticipating and confronting the terrorist threat.
Moreover, we are in favour of allocating the resources requested by the Commission in order to have a real crisis management capacity and we are proposing to extend the appropriations designed to help the victims of terrorist acts in such a way as to include legal aid.
As regards controlling the EUâs external borders, we are proposing a substantial increase in the resources dedicated to the new Frontex Agency and we are bringing back the payment appropriations initially included in the PDB for the Schengen Information System and for the Visa Information System. These payment appropriations had been, rather stupidly, reduced by the Council.
As regards data protection, we are keeping back part of the appropriations requested by the Commission for passenger rights with the aim of forcing the Commission to respect the commitments it made before Parliament on changing the system for transmitting passenger name records to the US authorities.
Furthermore â and this will be my final point â in the motion for a resolution, we are emphasising the need to implement a mechanism aimed at protecting personal data in the third pillar.
Â Â  . Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating my friend, Mr Pittella, for a job well done.
I should like to make three points.
The first is that the Committee on Constitutional Affairs made five proposals: we wanted more money for the Jean Monnet Chairs, more money for cultural organisations, more money for organisations advancing the idea of Europe, more money for European think-tanks and more money to debate the future of the European Union.
What happened?
We got nothing!
The five proposals were all rejected.
I am sure Mr Heaton-Harris is really happy about it, but I hate to tell him that I am very happy with his proposal, because he gave a lot of money to the PRINCE programme.
We asked for EURÂ 9Â million and we were given commitments of over EURÂ 4Â million.
That is a great thing, and, therefore, I am pleased about the changes the Committee on Budgetary Control made.
My second point was more of a question: what do we need the money for?
We all know that the French and the Dutch rejected the Constitution in referenda, and that we need to start debating the future of the Union.
That is in all our interests.
The Constitution is not dead, it will continue to live on and we need to restart the debate on it.
For that we need money.
My third and final point is also a question: can we buy the debate with money?
The answer, of course, is no.
However, I think, personally and as a member of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, that it is very important to get that debate going, and the fact that the Commission has put down a plan B â sorry, a plan D â and is receiving over EURÂ 4Â million in commitments from the Committee on Budgets is a good thing, and also good for the future of the Union.
Â Â  . â Mr President, as regards Community policy on gender equality, I should like to start by thanking MrÂ Pittella, who accepted the amendments relating to the integration of equality in all chapters on Community policy.
I should also like the amendment to be supported which has already been adopted in the budget, strengthening financing for the Daphne II programme, a programme which aims to address the phenomenon of violence against women and children.
In addition, I consider it important for the amendments by the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality on greater financing for women's organisations, especially the European women's lobby, to be supported.
That is because the action by these organisations is essential to promoting gender equality in social, economic and political life and to achieving the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy of better and stronger participation by women in the labour market.
Â Â  . â Firstly I would like to congratulate rapporteur Giovanni Pittella for his excellent report and would like to thank him for his constructive cooperation during the first reading of the budget in the European Parliament.
I am satisfied that we in the Budget Committee succeeded in making decisions on the most important priorities: the European Union's competitiveness and unionâs improved funding, support for small and medium business, other measures for implementing the Lisbon Strategy, improvement in the security of citizens, consolidation of the recent expansion of the European Union and the growth of the European Union's role as a world partner.
These priorities ought to be the focus of our efforts in 2006.
If the Council approves the European Parliament's proposal on a flexible instrument, we will have sufficient funds to finance reconstruction in Iraq and Afghanistan and the necessary aid to carry out post-tsunami reconstruction work in several Asian countries.
2006 is an exceptional year from the budgetary point of view.
It is the last year of this financial period and the Council has been unable to reach a consensus on the new financial perspective.
Since preparations must be made for the next wave of European Union enlargement, I believe that the Council's behaviour is irresponsible, as enlargement is being discussed without an agreement on how it is to be funded.
Therefore, the European Parliament is being forced to consider very different alternatives, including worst case scenarios.
I trust that tomorrow the European Parliament will support the Budget Committee's most important proposals and we will be ready for the second conciliation meeting with the Council, which will take place in November.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, Commissioner, allow me to make an introductory remark.
It seems to me that we ought to change these procedures relating to a so-called budgetary debate, because it is absurd to restrict each committee to one minuteâs speaking time.
A new procedure really ought to be drawn up.
I should like to say to you that our rapporteurs and all of the members of the Committee on Budgets have adopted a strategic approach with regard to this budget.
On the one hand, the EU has needs, and it has a very large number of them: traditional policies, agricultural policy, Structural Fund policy.
These needs are extensive and they certainly cost a lot of money.
However, we must not forget that the EU has an ever increasing number of new needs: in terms of employment, sustainable development and everything the Lisbon Strategy entails for research, networks, information for citizens, training and security in every sense of the word, whether security against terrorism, border security or security, for example, in the current context of avian influenza.
On the other hand, the EU also has duties to fulfil, as regards, for example, helping the poorest people and those countries awaiting membership of the European Union, not to mention helping other countries in which the death toll is constantly rising in terms of victims of natural disasters, be they the tsunami, typhoons or the earthquake in Pakistan, of countries and regions that have been caught up in conflict â the Balkans, Afghanistan, Iraq, Gaza â and of the sugar reform.
The burden on Europeâs budget is constantly increasing at exactly the same time that we are facing a shortage in revenue.
We are faced with an impossible and, therefore, absurd task.
This situation cannot continue.
Hence our budgetary strategy, which was to allocate substantial, but by no means excessive, amounts of expenditure.
However, we have not even been able to allocate all of this expenditure.
We are therefore coming up against some great difficulties.
I am, however, obliged to recognise that our relationship with the Commission is improving: that is why it seems to me that, this year, we have made further progress in our method of working, precisely in order to execute the budget more effectively.
This improved situation will have to continue.
As regards the pilot projects, we need to strengthen our action, including our preparatory actions.
Our action will have to focus not only on the pilot projects we hold most dear, but on all the other pilot projects: for example, relating to SMEs, to youth assistance â particularly as part of the Erasmus programme â and to aid for the poorest countries to promote vaccinations throughout the world.
My final point is that, above all, we must continue to disseminate more information around us.
However, the problem is that, despite a very reasonable budget, which requires EURÂ 115 billion in payment appropriations â a figure corresponding to 1.04% of our GDP â we will find ourselves confronted with an imperturbable and stoic Council, which has only one thing to say: hands off my national budgets!
I call on the Council to cooperate more effectively with us.
We are aware that there are some internal difficulties, but you also need to know that Europe will not be able to move forwards without genuine new resources.
In the context of our budget, we have used nothing more than what we were entitled to within the current financial perspectives, which enable us to call for a large degree of flexibility.
That is what we have done because, if we truly want to have a common future, this requirement for flexibility is crucial so that we can carry out the minimum policies sought by the European Union.
Finally, we want you to understand that Parliament cannot continue doing the impossible: doing more with less.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, I think that the draft 2006 budget, which is now before us following the vote in the Committee on Budgets, is well balanced, and I hope that, during tomorrowâs vote, we can continue to sing from the same hymn sheet regarding not only the general lines of the budget but also the details of the compromise established between a broad majority here in the Committee on Budgets.
I also wish to say a big thank you to MrÂ Pittella for his major efforts in bringing about a compromise and for his readiness to listen and his considerable patience.
MrÂ Pittella has made the youth and education programmes his main priority, and that is to his credit, I think.
Precisely by investing in this area, we shall be achieving very considerable results with very few resources.
Thanks should also go to MrÂ Dombrovskis for his work involving the other institutions.
Those points in the compromise that we in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe would particularly emphasise involve increased appropriations to the Lisbon Process, especially to research and to the programme for developing credit facilities for small enterprises in the new Member States.
We should also very much like to emphasise that we have put our faith in more realistic appropriations to the area of foreign policy, in which the foreign ministers apparently think that it is the poor countries that should suffer privation so that we can fund the reconstruction following the tsunami and that it is the poor countries that, following the sugar reform, should fund the compensation paid to those countries that are deprived of their quotas.
That is, of course, quite unacceptable, and that is why it is right to do what we are going to do, namely use the flexibility instrument.
When it comes to the Structural Funds, adequate payment appropriations are of course required, and we can see how, in recent years, there has been better implementation of our projects.
For two years, the payment appropriations in the budget have in actual fact been too low, and that is the situation we are remedying.
Under the budget heading, âPilot projects and preparatory actionsâ, which is a small item, more is of course desired than there are resources for, and I am pleased that resources have been successfully earmarked for a pilot project to build safe lay-bys on European motorways, enabling us to make active efforts to prevent attacks on long-distance lorry drivers and to guarantee greater security.
It is a small thing, but a very important one.
In Parliamentâs budget, we wish to support the compromise whereby we set aside reserves for information policy, including Web TV, as well as for continuing to purchase buildings so that we save rent in the future.
We have been reluctant to go below the 20%, but we support the compromise.
It is important for us not to set aside larger reserves than necessary in the budget.
The overall budget we now have is larger than that offered by the Council, but not so large that we cannot defend it.
Clearly, this budgetary debate is influenced by the lack of agreement on the financial perspective for 2007-2013.
My group comes out, then, in clear support of the proposal before us.
The appropriations are realistic and necessary.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner GrybauskaitÄ, Mr Lewis, today, again, you stand before a self-confident parliament, one that spells out how Europeâs tasks have become greater and how we consequently need more resources if we are to face these challenges.
The Commissionâs draft budget, with its 1.02%, is a prudent one.
We regard the cuts that the Council has proposed as utterly unacceptable.
We must be bold enough to fund specifically targeted tasks if we are to respond adequately to the challenges of the future.
I am much obliged to Mr Pittella, the rapporteur.
Although he and I have moved closer together on essentials, there are a number of points that I would like to take up, where my group believes that there must be changes.
We believe that the agricultural export subsidies in their present form are unjustifiable; for vegetables from Europe to be cheaper in countries such as Senegal than those produced locally is an intolerable state of affairs, and, by perpetuating it, we in the European Union are giving people cause to become refugees.
This policy cannot be allowed to continue.
The tobacco subsidies must also be cut back; that would offer us the chance to free up funds that could be invested elsewhere, particularly in research policy or in education, culture and young people.
Mr Pittella takes the line â and on this I agree with him â that this is where we need to spend more on enabling students to become more mobile in Europe.
Real cultural provision reaches people where they are, and in making it available we should return at least to the 2004 figures.
We also have to spend more on renewable energies if we really want an âaway from oilâ strategy as an adequate response to the challenges of climate change.
We need to do this not only for environmental reasons, but also for reasons of economic policy.
Any strategy of this kind must form part of the Lisbon strategy, for it is environmental technologies that will give us an edge on the world market.
This is something in which we, as Europeans, must have a particular interest, and we must be ambitious enough to make headway here.
Turning to foreign policy, the Council keeps delivering itself of pious utterances about how we need to do more: more in Iraq, more in Afghanistan, more for the victims of the tsunami.
Then it goes and cuts the expenditure on day-to-day policy.
In so doing it is irresponsibly undermining the European Unionâs credibility.
The present budget estimates will do nothing to enable us to achieve the objectives we set ourselves in the year 2000, which involved such things as a more determined war on poverty.
Like some of those Members who have already spoken, I would like again to say loud and clear to the Council that we have to make full use of this flexibility â in the shape of these EURÂ 493Â million â if the European Union is to be able to hold its head up in the world next year and really be able to do things we have promised to various parts of the world.
We therefore urge the Council not to take a rigid line on this, but to change position and join with the Commission in bringing into being a really good budget for the European Union â one that shows a commitment to its future.
Â Â  . Mr President, it could be claimed that the EU budgetary economy thrives in a world of plenty.
For years the European Parliamentâs own budget has been 10% air.
This being the case, the Bureau of the European Parliament has had enormous difficulties spending the 20% share of the Unionâs administrative expenditure that the other institutions give Parliament without questioning what the money is to be used for.
Not all the uses for the money which our Bureau quickly dreams up are acceptable, however.
In the drafting of the budget, a very stringent policy has been followed with regard to Section IV, whose ceiling for expenditure Parliament wishes to raise through maximum use of the flexibility instrument.
The budget implementation figures proposed by the Commission for 2005 show that there is, and has been for a long time now, a lot of air in this Section; either that or the Commission is not implementing the wishes of Parliament with regard to the budget.
The strangest aspect of the budget has to do with the budgeting of Structural Funds payments.
The Council, in its own draft budget, has cut EUR 8 billion from the payment requirements put forward by the Member States.
The same ministers who, on behalf of their countries, sent the Commission their countryâs estimate of the amount of money needed to make payments for structural action have, in the Council, pruned back by a fifth the very requirements that they themselves put forward.
Parliament has gone some way towards meeting the wishes of the Member States by taking 40% of the deficit for financing structural action into account in the budget, as advised by the Member States to the Commission.
I would like to say on behalf of my group that next yearâs budget will not meet the targets we have prioritised for developing the Unionâs social dimension.
Â Â  .Â Â Â MrÂ President, I should like to pay tribute to MrÂ Pittella and to the Committee on Budgets for the work they have done.
The challenges facing the European Union are as follows.
Firstly, economic growth is slowing.
Secondly, EU businesses are becoming less competitive.
Thirdly, unemployment is high and the gap between the rich and the poor is widening.
Fourthly, there is a lack of political will and initiative to stimulate the economies of the new Member States, with the result that the post-Communist countries remain backward and dependent in economic terms.
Fifthly, the EU leaders have pushed though the decision on Turkeyâs accession to the EU, despite the opposition of the majority of citizens to this decision, and despite the fact that there is a concurrent lack of political will, vision or strategy as regards Ukraineâs accession.
The 2006 budget makes no attempt to solve any of the above-mentioned problems, and in fact the opposite is the case.
It is a continuation of the strategy that has been applied in previous years, which means that it will result in further economic slow-down and even more deep-rooted social and economic problems.
The structure of spending is almost identical to previous years, which makes it inevitable that large sums will be spent on headings that have little effect in economic terms.
At the same time, there will not be enough money to fund research and development, large infrastructure projects or aid for backward regions and countries.
The scope and structure of the 2006 budget will make it impossible to meet the challenges posed by the enlargement of the EU to include 10Â new Member States.
The draft budget also fails to take sufficient account of the future accession of Bulgaria and Romania.
Worse yet, the 2006 budget contains a long list of superfluous expenses for a wide range of consultancy and promotional services, as well as increased spending on administration and bureaucracy.
To sum up, we believe that the 2006 budget is flawed, and that it runs counter to the ideals of a united Europe. These include rapid economic growth, social peace and solidarity with backward regions and countries.
Â Â  .Â Â Â MrÂ President, I should like to thank both the rapporteurs for the huge amount of effort they have put into drafting the budget reports, and to congratulate them on having dealt with the huge number of amendments that have been tabled.
Once again, Parliament is faced with the difficult task of adopting a draft budget that not only meets our expectations, but at the same time can be agreed on with the Council.
The Commission only increased commitments and payments by 4% and 5.9% respectively in the draft 2006 budget, in the expectation that the Council would otherwise raise objections.
Yet the Council still made substantial cuts, eventually reducing the draft budget from 1.02% to 1.01% of gross national income.
Constant cuts to EU spending by the Council pose a threat to the principles of cohesion and solidarity upon which the concept of European integration is founded.
I need hardly add that this is a source of great concern to the new Member States, including Poland.
Such cuts also place a question mark over the implementation, however minimal, of the principles of the Lisbon Strategy, in which the new Member States also take a great interest.
The Polish delegation in the Union for Europe of the Nations Group is celebrating a victory in the parliamentary and presidential elections held recently in Poland.
We have read press reports from many EU Member States that wrongly state that the Law and Justice Party and the President-elect, Lech KaczyÅski, are opposed to the EU.
Some even go so far as to describe the imaginary threats that Poland and the European Union will face as a result of these elections.
I should like to take this opportunity to state most emphatically that these threats are fictitious.
We are in favour of the EU, even if we criticise its lack of cohesion and solidarity.
The question I would ask is whether European integration is put more at risk by one of the many parties in Europe that voice criticism of some of the EUâs more questionable practices, or by those who are in favour of budget cuts.
The position adopted by Parliamentâs Committee on Budgets, and, we hope, by Parliament as a whole, may appear modest.
We are quite sure, however, that it could guarantee at least a minimum level of expenditure, and one that we would find acceptable if it meant that an even smaller budget would be avoided.
Â Â  â There is an old saying that goes: âIt's hard to tell whom to want and whom to forgetâ.
This is doubly true with regard to the avalanche of amendment motions proposing increases in the budget.
I would like to express my appreciation for the skilful manner in which the distinguished rapporteurs MrÂ Pittella and Mr Dombrovskis from Parliamentâs Budget Committee have succeeded in coping with a virtual âpandemicâ of proposals for the 2006 EU budget.
Although the Budget Committee has made every effort to consider thoroughly all of the proposed items, the resulting budget expenditure exceeds the European Councilâs proposal by EUR 4 billion, amounting to an increase of nearly 4%.
In my view, this shifting and strengthening of budgetary resources is not self-serving.
The increase is intended mostly for areas such as structural funds, science, research and education.
These are the areas that can really become the powerhouse of the European Union, and an influx of greater funding, if put to effective use, may have a kind of âViagra effectâ on the sluggish European economy.
However, getting support for this increase will call for considerable effort and a united stance during Parliamentâs negotiations with the Council and the Commission.
I would like to emphasise specifically the need for MEPs to exert some political influence in their parent countries in order to make their national governments adopt a positive position on the budget so that Parliament will approve it tomorrow.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the Commission for being here and I profoundly regret that the President-in-Office of the Council is absent, since he has been with us throughout the budgetary procedure, but just when we have a debate at first reading and we have to hold a trialogue, he has decided not to attend.
I would like to thank both rapporteurs for being here today and for the work they have done.
I hope that we can still find a consensus today on some of the amendments and some of the separate votes.
It is important that we have a homogenous first reading, because we must go into the conciliation on the 24th all united and certain of the support of the political groups and the Members of this House.
Our negotiating position is very hard this year due to two exceptional circumstances.
Firstly, we have stretched category 4 for external actions to the maximum.
Three such important priorities as Iraq, Afghanistan or the tsunami did not exist in 1999, when the current financial perspective started; category 4 has been badly financed from the outset and we have never been able to budget normally.
Unfortunately this year has been no exception.
Secondly, there appears to be no end to the deadlock amongst the Member States with regard to the financial perspective; we are at risk of reaching 2006 with no viable financial plan.
The European Parliament must take precautions, because the application of Article 272 of the Treaty is, for the first time â I repeat, for the first time â a real possibility.
For all of these reasons, we are presenting a draft budget which does not exceed the ceiling of the financial perspective, but which does get very close to it.
And we are calling for an increase in payments and a use of the flexibility instrument that goes much further than the Council would like.
My group supports Mr Pittella and Mr Dombrovskis, who have presented a very courageous and innovative draft budget to the European Parliament, and I would ask them to maintain their positions at second reading and conciliation.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to thank Mr Pittella and Mr Dombrovskis for their very good work.
Mr Dombrovskis, as rapporteur for other institutions, has incorporated most of our groupâs priorities into his final resolution.
One such priority was the retention of Parliamentâs budget at the 20% level of heading 5.
If used effectively, this benchmark provides us with the stability and rigour necessary for any budget.
Moreover, we have increased the reserve allocated to property investment and we reserve the right to utilise the EURÂ 20 million reduction in the contingency reserve as a capital injection for any eventual purchase of new parliamentary buildings.
The policy on acquisition of property was very successful and made much financial sense.
In contrast, the policy on communication and information was disappointing, since we have failed to convince European citizens that the European Parliament is representing their aspirations and their interests.
In this yearâs budget we have made available enough funds to start implementing, hopefully, an effective and citizen-friendly information strategy.
Naturally, more needs to be done to improve the streamlining of an activity-based budget and to improve the efficiency of our operations.
If we had to evaluate critically and objectively the impact of the âraising the gameâ exercise, one has to acknowledge that a few of these objectives have actually been achieved.
Realistically, however, there is no reason why, in the coming year, the administration should not achieve most of its stated targets.
There is very little room for complacency.
Bottlenecks should be eliminated and we have to sharpen our focus on the core operations, ensuring a more efficient use of our resources and cutting down on waste and duplication.
Proper manpower planning, including redeployment, recruitment harmonisation and training services improvement should also be considered priorities in 2006.
We need to initiate a prioritised plan catering for our future needs, bearing in mind that, with effect from 2009, we would have to budget over EURÂ 100 million per annum resulting from the Membersâ Statute.
These changes and reforms should improve the quality and performance of our institutions.
However, in the final analysis, one has to review this in terms of the impact on the new citizens, offering them a product with added value that meets their expectations and, in so doing, strengthens the image and credibility of the European Parliament and other institutions.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is by money that we show what things are worth to us.
A look at the EU Budget, though, gives us the impression â astonishingly enough â that agriculture is some seven times more valuable to us than research and education.
Such an outlook is false on two counts, for, if there is something that the EU regards as politically desirable, it should use the budget to provide the groundwork for it, and Europe should be investing in the future rather than subsidising outdated structures.
It does make a difference whether, for example, one invests in nanotechnology or guarantees a farmer his income â yes, I know, the CSU is living in another era.
That is why it is a good thing that Parliament has increased expenditure on the Lisbon agenda and slashed the tobacco subsidies.
We need to carry on further down this road.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, like all of my fellow Members, I shall begin by paying tribute to the rapporteur, MrÂ Pittella, who had a tough job to do with regard to the Commission.
MrÂ Dombrovskisâ task was perhaps even more complicated, for he had a tough job to do within Parliament itself, there always being a difficult trial of strength between the Committee on Budgets and the Bureau, and I believe that he has thoroughly fulfilled this task, even if it was sometimes difficult to do so.
Since my colleague, MrsÂ TrÃŒpel, has focused her speech on the general budget, I should like to focus mine on Parliamentâs budget so as to put down a marker because, in my opinion, we are preparing to vote in favour of a rather absurd provision.
For the first time in its history, Parliament is abandoning the theoretical threshold of 20% administrative expenditure.
I am not abnormally attached to this figure but, nonetheless, I am going to make two or three remarks.
Firstly, I do not wish to let it be said in this Chamber that, at the end of the year, the Bureau might urgently contrive an injection of the capital that we were unable to use.
That is not the case.
What we are really talking about is a long term policy, in accordance with which our Parliament wanted systematically to inject capital in order to buy property.
Doing so has enabled taxpayers to make a saving of hundreds â and I mean hundreds â of millions of euros, because we bought our buildings at just the right time, instead of paying absolutely absurd rates of interest.
In its resolution, our Parliament says that we are giving up EURÂ 20Â million.
On the other hand, it is also saying that it is ready to lay claim once again to this money from the Council if the money is required for buying property.
I am going to leave this Chamber in exactly four minutes to go and negotiate the sale of some new buildings for Parliament.
It is therefore already clear that we are going to need that money.
Consequently, I can picture the Council laughing when it sees our request for an amended budget arrive, in which we lay claim to what we are rather hastily giving back to the Council today in order to make an outward gesture.
Making an outward gesture is a very nice idea but, in truth, this EURÂ 20 million would enable us to inject capital and to make substantial savings.
EURÂ 20 million divided up among Europeâs citizens â I calculated how much that came to â is a good four cents that we are giving back to every citizen.
I believe that each citizen would be very pleased to receive these four cents.
However, we could have used those EURÂ 20 million to carry out another policy.
EURÂ 20 million is either too much or too little.
As it happens, this is a particularly exceptional example of a situation not making sense.
Â Â  Mr President, in order to fund EU military operations, the Council and the Commission set up shadow budgets that are not capable of being officially scrutinised.
Using what is termed the âATHENA Mechanismâ, the EU Member States pay the money for the EUâs military operations into a separate fund that is specifically not defined as a heading in the EUâs budget.
In so doing, they leave Parliament on the outside looking in and make scrutiny almost impossible.
I have asked the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Security and Defence Sub-Committee how much money there is in this fund, but have been given no answers.
Now, therefore, I put that same question directly to the Council and the Commission.
This procedure is currently being used for EUFOR Althea in Bosnia, and it is intended that it should in future be used specifically to finance what the EU calls its crisis management operations, which amount to waging war.
It is evident that the development aid budget was used to fund the EUâs questionable military and policing operations in the Congo and in the Sudan â or so, at any rate, it would appear from what the representatives of the Commission told the Foreign Affairs Committee.
It was also stated at this meeting that the Treaty of Nice as it stands at present proscribes any independent military budget for the EU.
Quite right too!
Stop using financial trickery to fund military operations by the EU!
Â Â  Mr President, I find it very difficult to take seriously a debate about voluminous documents that only a real euro-nerd would be able to read, let alone understand.
Furthermore, what is the point of a debate about a 2006 budget which we all know will bear no relationship to the way the money will actually have been spent?
The European Court of Auditors has, for good reason, refused to sign off the EUâs accounts for the last 10 years and said, in its last report, that 95% of the EUâs budget was open to fraud.
Yet every year this House just shrugs its shoulders, sighs and looks the other way.
That is a shameful indictment of this institution and demonstrates how pitifully useless it really is.
Before we start debating ways to spend next yearâs money, I believe we should sort out the mess that has been left behind in previous years.
Until the disgusting state of the EUâs finances has been sorted out, this House has no business debating further expenditure.
I call upon you all, in good conscience, to reject the 2006 budget.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to take this opportunity to comment on two specific aspects of budgetary policy: the common agricultural policy and the peace initiative.
After what I have heard in this House this morning, I want to state a very basic fact: we cannot, in any way, go back on our word as regards the common agricultural policy, in relation to the budget or to the WTO talks.
We have signed off the common agricultural policy.
We gave our word in Berlin in 2002 and we must keep our word.
Our word should be our bond.
To amend that in any way would mean to lose all credibility.
That we cannot do in the context of development in rural Europe, which is as important as developing any other aspects of European policy.
I should like say, as did my colleague, the Irish Minister for Agriculture, Mrs Coughlan, and others, that we must keep the promise we made.
Our promise on the CAP should not be in any way reneged on until 2013, as we said in Berlin.
I should also like to comment on the Peace II initiative.
As Members of this House will know, the Peace II programme supports a range of political initiatives in Northern Ireland and in the border county region of Ireland.
That peace programme has been vitally important to developments in my country.
I want that to continue, along with the good work that this House and, indeed, the European Union have done for the peace programme, into the next round of structural funds between 2007 and 2013.
I thank the rapporteurs for their good work and hope that the continuation of the promises made will enhance the Union and the programmes that it has initiated.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what makes our discussion, at European level, of the 2006 budget so exciting is the fact that it is the last budget under the current Financial Perspective, and so, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we are determining what the fundamentals of the 2007 will be like in the absence of a Financial Perspective.
That is something of which I would like to take this opportunity to remind the House, lest we completely lose sight of that fact.
Here in this House, we will also have to embark on something of a rethinking process.
I take the line that we can no longer give more support across the board, but must concentrate on what really has to be done at European level and on the question of how much money can be made available for it.
To Mrs Koch-Mehrin I would say, further to her calculations of how much goes on research and how much on agriculture, that she should take a look at all public budgets, and then she will see what an infinitesimal amount expenditure on agriculture represents in comparison with what is spent on research.
The German Federal budget spends far more on research than it does on agriculture.
When the figures are added up, these all cancel each other out.
In this case, it is we who are responsible, and this budget must reflect that.
The Member States have more responsibilities where research is concerned, and that is why their budgets reflect that.
These calculations do not come out like that.
Let me make it perfectly clear, though, that if we require the Member States to keep to the stability criteria â which means making savings â that means that we in this House cannot go throwing money around all over the place.
Not all Europeâs problems need a line in the European Budget to deal with them.
Parliament will, in future, have to get used to making the sort of financial proposals that are the norm in national parliaments.
If we manage to learn that lesson from the 2006 budget, then we will have achieved a great deal.
Â Â  Mr President, I also wish to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Pittella, on his excellent report.
It is a radical report, but one to be commended for the timely emphasis it places on achieving the Lisbon goals and the need to improve the structural funds and external actions.
I just want to make four points.
Firstly, on information and communication: it is quite clear we need greater focus and direction.
Therefore, I welcome Commissioner WallstrÃ¶mâs initiative to regenerate communication tools through the use of plan D, but stress that this will only be a success if adequate resources are made available.
Therefore, I call on the Council to do so.
Secondly, the biggest challenge for this yearâs budget and for future financing is in heading 4: External actions.
Given the number of new regions where the EU has had to intervene recently, combined with the frequency and the destructive enormity of the natural disasters affecting largely poor countries and not least the recent earthquake in Pakistan and India, for which it is essential we increase resources next year, I believe there is a dire need for the Council and the Commission to have a thorough rethink on how these new areas are to be funded and, at the same time, how we are going to meet our obligations in achieving the Millennium Development Goals.
The situation as regards this heading is further exacerbated by an unwillingness to be more flexible vis-Ã -vis the sugar regime, where it is very important for us to help poor farmers, but, at the same time, it will add more pressure in heading 4.
Whilst on agriculture, this brings me to my third point.
I am extremely pleased that my amendment on reducing tobacco subsidies was adopted in the Committee on Budgets.
This is a major step forward in finally putting an end to a hypocrisy within the European Union whereby, on the one hand, we have been funding health programmes warning of the ill effects of tobacco use and, on the other hand, subsidising tobacco production.
This totally undermines the credibility of the EU and, adding insult to injury, a vast amount of the tobacco is burnt and destroyed because it is not good enough to be used.
Therefore, I am calling on all colleagues to support this particular amendment.
Finally, on Parliamentâs budget, I must admit that I am somewhat perplexed by our strategy â or the lack of it â as it really is a shame that ...
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, MrÂ Dombrovskis, MrÂ Pittella, Europe is currently going through a major institutional crisis, combined with economic problems which are often on a very large-scale in some EU countries and which entail, as we all know, shortcomings in their political prospects.
Now, more than ever, our fellow citizens need to have their faith in the future, and their confidence in Europe, restored.
Europeans need to believe in â and even want to believe in â great political projects, such as cannot be implemented if we do not provide ourselves with sufficient and ambitious budgetary resources.
Everyone â or nearly everyone â in this House believes that the draft general budget proposed by the Council corresponds neither to the level of powers that our fellow citizens want to entrust to the European Union nor to the new tasks that the Union wants to undertake today.
As permanent rapporteur for the Structural Funds within the Committee on Budgets, I should like to highlight the importance of these funds and the need for us to emphasise them, not only to make our action clearer to our fellow European citizens but also to bring the territories in this Europe of 450 million people more in line with one another.
Finally, although I am delighted that we are strongly emphasising our support for research, development and youth, I should like, on the other hand, to protest against the totally inadequate sum allocated to the External actions heading: there lies the key to our credibility in Europe and to the strength of the European dream.
Â Â  â Although Parliamentâs proposal improves on the Councilâs proposal in terms of volume of payments, it fails to meet the economic, social and environmental needs and challenges presented by an enlarged EU.
Let us not forget that this proposal falls short of what was envisaged in the financial framework for 2006, which was 1.08% of gross national income.
Bearing in mind that the final figure will be between 1.04% and 1.01%, we hope that Parliament is not putting in jeopardy the already inadequate proposal that it had submitted for the 2007-2013 financial perspective.
In spite of our broadly critical stance, we call on Members to adopt the amendments to which we put our name, which were aimed at setting up a pilot project for actions in the textiles and clothing sector, in turn leading to a Community programme for the sector, as proposed by Parliament; at setting up recovery plans for fisheries resources, in light of the social and economic impact of the closed seasons; and at promoting multilingualism, not least in the ACP-EU parliamentary assemblies.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Parliamentâs draft budget for 2006 implies an increase of 1.04% in the Member Statesâ average gross national income.
I regret that Parliament is trying to increase expenditure on a large number of items without proposing corresponding and adequate economies in other areas.
The Council, by which I mean the Member Statesâ governments, proposes that expenditure be limited to 1.01% of gross national income for 2006.
I support that proposal.
It is the various Member States that should establish the framework for expenditure.
The Member States and the net contributors have felt able to accept that it be done at that level.
My basic attitude is that Parliament should have significant influence over the prioritising within this framework but that political responsibility in the various countries for how much tax should be collected lies with the national governments.
Parliament should not constantly try to increase the budget. That is going too far.
Parliament should confine itself to the main task of prioritising within the framework established by the Member States.
Â Â  Mr President, one gets the feeling, when listening to Mr Ferber, that it is very unfortunate that he has not yet been summoned to Berlin to take charge of the Germansâ financial arrangements in Brussels, for then a few things would change.
It is also regrettable, Mr Ferber, that you are in a minority in your own group, and what is even worse is if, as a former lead candidate for the Social Democrats â which is what I am â you have to listen to this gentleman with his unending âmore, more, moreâ and nothing else, with no sign of comprehension that times have changed and that less might often mean more.
As long as its current financial arrangements are as they are, this House is a living example of how to waste money.
The fact is that, taken as a whole, the 2006 budget is yet another example of greed, incomprehension and missed opportunities: greed because of the emphasis on âmoreâ; incomprehension because nobody has worked out how to do anything useful with the 90Â million we had already, and as for the missed opportunity, well, that is it.
It is becoming ever more clear to us that this Europe of ours needs real alternatives.
We need alliances â alliances that cross Europe, alliances that are democratic, alliances that have transparency as their objective and will at last bring pressure to bear to get what is currently being done badly changed right across Europe and for the good of its citizens.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, the first reading of the European Unionâs 2006 budget serves as evidence that the European Parliament, which is a symbol of diversity and provides a forum for all views, even those as radical as the ones we heard a few moments ago, is capable of reaching a compromise on complex budgetary issues.
Even though over 900Â amendments were initially tabled, we have now agreed on a strategy that should be endorsed during tomorrowâs vote.
We have succeeded in reaching this compromise despite the fact that 2006 is a challenging year from a budgetary point of view, for reasons that have already been mentioned.
Expenditure has increased as a result of circumstances that could not have been foreseen at the start of the current Financial Perspective.
Much credit is due to the rapporteurs, MrÂ Pittella and MrÂ Dombrovskis, to the voluntary coordinators of the political groups, to the advisors of these groups and, of course, to the secretariat, headed by MrsÂ Fialho.
The European Parliament has thus adopted a position, both on the 2006 annual budget and on the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective.
Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the EU governments acting through the Council.
We expect them to reach a position on the multi-annual financial perspective, and we also expect them to ensure that the conciliation meetings to be held in November on the 2006 budget will not be wasted opportunities.
A clear government mandate is required if these goals are to be achieved, and this will be a real test of the British Presidency. The mandate for conciliation on the 2006 budget is a test that the Presidency will face in November of this year.
Parliament has already sketched out its strategy.
It is noteworthy that it includes confirmation of Parliamentâs right to participate in 20% of administrative expenditure, while at the same time starting the search for ways in which Parliament itself could make savings.
We respect the Interinstitutional Agreement, and we are taking full advantage of its legal force.
We are also making good use of the flexibility instrument, in accordance with CommissionerÂ GrybauskaitÄâs understanding of this mechanism.
We are well aware that consensus on budgetary issues is the good news for which the European Unionâs citizens are waiting.
Â Â  â Mr President, I too should like to start by congratulating our rapporteur, Giovanni Pittella, on his excellent and â if I may say so â bold work.
The budget for 2006 is being debated in the middle of a serious crisis of political orientation in the European Union, which was reflected in the impasse on the new financial perspectives.
Unfortunately, the Council of Ministers â now with the draft budget â has demonstrated huge political weakness once again.
A serious question of credibility arises now, when political priorities are being set at European level and adequate funding is not then being safeguarded for them.
The Ministers for Finance again thought predominantly like accountants.
We saw this in the linear reduction of appropriations with no political thought or criteria.
Unfortunately, there was only one objective: for the overall budget not to exceed 1.01%.
The drastically blinkered Council is addressing the budget as a lowest denominator for compromise rather than as a means of development, redistribution and solidarity and as a tool for implementing European policies.
The question which arises, therefore, is political.
Are the Council and the European governments getting the message from our peoples, from the citizens?
Do they realise that it is only by strengthening policies which target development, employment, solidarity and cohesion â especially now following enlargement â that they will respond to the needs of European society?
We here in the European Parliament shall vote for the amendments which strengthen the Community budget and the policies which Europe and its peoples need today.
However, that is not enough.
Today, Europe needs a new progressive strategy and the corresponding budget to implement it.
Today Europe needs to break away from conservative, managerial and neo-liberal perceptions.
We need to project a new plan for Europe and to express the real political will to implement it.
Â Â  Mr President, I would first like to congratulate MrÂ Pittella, the general rapporteur, and MrÂ Dombrovskis, rapporteur for the other institutions.
Likewise, I wish to thank MrÂ Lewandovski, Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, and Commissioner GrybauskaitÄ for the excellent level of cooperation she has shown.
The Committeeâs draft budget reflects a strong desire to improve employment and competitiveness in the EU.
The Committee has increased Structural Policy funding by EUR 3.7 billion and funds for research and information society, education and culture by a total of EUR 243 billion.
This is a logical continuation of the priorities in the financial frameworks approved by Parliament.
This budget will be the last one to be drawn up under the current financial frameworks.
The new frameworks have not yet been agreed upon, a situation for which, among others, the state currently holding the Presidency bears great responsibility.
The main objective in the immediate future will be to establish the new financial perspective; otherwise, the work of the EU will be paralysed.
Â Â  Mr President, the 2006 budget is important because it is the last budget in the current Financial Perspective.
This budget will also be a bridge to the next financial perspective, on which there is no agreement at present.
Parliament, of course, adopted its own negotiating position in its adoption of MrÂ BÃ¶geâs creditable report last spring.
It is particularly important to secure funding for the EUâs future from the point of view of the major priorities, which are improved competitiveness in the Union, investment in research and development, and improvements in public safety.
By investing in research and development, we are at the same time investing in the Unionâs future.
We should not, however, completely forget the Unionâs other policy areas.
Agriculture will need a structural change in the future, but these changes must be made in such a way that agriculture can be practised in the future throughout the Union as a whole, including the peripheral regions.
Recent times have unfortunately shown that natural disasters are becoming more common.
The Union budget should in future make better provision for this, so that we can react quickly both within the Unionâs borders and outside them.
Mr Dombrovskis, Parliamentâs own rapporteur for the budget, should be congratulated for ensuring that Parliament sets a good example by budgeting according to real needs and not according to how much money might possibly have been spent on developing various more or less appropriate new schemes and projects.
It is absolutely intolerable that the budget should be drawn up in such a way that 20%, by a âgentlemenâs agreementâ, should be spent every year, up to the last cent.
An accountable Parliament inspiring public confidence drafts its budget with reference to real costs, not percentages.
Â Â  Mr President, I too should like to start by expressing my disappointment at the fact that the British Presidency is conspicuous by its absence.
I wonder if Mr Lewis could afford to adopt a similar attitude in the British House of Commons.
Secondly, I should like to congratulate both rapporteurs, and in the one minute that has been allocated to me, I would mainly like to talk about democracy.
In 2004, we reached an agreement with the Council about the common foreign and security policy, in which we undertook to hold high-level consultations on the content of that policy on a regular basis.
The Council has never kept to that undertaking; never has there been any consultation at a high political level.
The Council now takes the view that we have breached the gentlemen's agreement, because we have put a certain amount of that money in reserve, but I would beg to differ.
I think it is the Council that has breached the gentlemen's agreement.
This agreement is about both Parliamentâs and the Councilâs administrative expenses.
I really fail to see how one could consider the expenses of the common foreign and security policy as administrative expenses.
That is why democracy should verify these.
Â Â  Mr President, in this cycle we have set ourselves significant targets: improved employment opportunities, better traffic, a knowledge-based society, strong cohesion, our visible presence in the world.
The budget for next year does not support the achievement of these targets, but I truly appreciate the fact that the Council exceeded, even if only slightly, the notorious 1%.
Therefore the Committee on Budgets, under the direction of the rapporteur, would increase next yearâs payments by four billion, and we would be able to spend an extra 3.7 billion euros on cohesion policy.
Even after the acceptance of our proposal we are still well below the earmarked amounts specified in the applicable medium range draft general budget.
If in the second round the Council does not support this merely symbolic extra expenditure, it acknowledges that it does not take national development plans seriously, that the new Member States have failed to learn from the mistakes of the first years and that governments who believe they are able to solve their own problems by holding back on the Union are still in the majority.
This is a big mistake.
The economy of Europe cannot be revived by cutting down on funds spent on the Union, but by a better utilisation of the opportunities provided by the Union.
The solution is not less, but more Europe.
Therefore I urge you, my fellow Members of the House, to support the proposal presented to us!
Â Â  Mr President, first of all I, too, would like to congratulate Giovanni Pitella for his excellent work and wonderful report.
The current budget is hugely significant to Hungary and the other newly joined states.
On the one hand, because it represents a transition to the 2007-2013 financial plan which will be defined within the framework developed by the European Parliament and will hopefully be accepted as soon as possible, and on the other hand because the representatives of all Member States have participated as equal members in the creation of this budget, from the preliminary work to completion.
At long last, here we did not see the fifteen plus ten differentiation.
In light of yesterdayâs debates I do not think I need to emphasise the significance of this fact.
Close cooperation was evident not only during Commission meetings, but also during conciliation sessions in the course of developing the 2006 budget and the 2007-2013 financial perspective.
For the first time we were able to say that the 25 Member States are equal parties, that there are no differences between them.
This is extremely important, as we can only build a common Europe if we work together.
The main figures of the 2006 budget in respect of Hungary have been known, they had already been determined through the Copenhagen Agreement.
However, we were able to effect certain changes in these figures within the framework of the Agreement through the amendment proposals in order to reach our common European values.
We are particularly pleased that following a Hungarian proposal we wish to ensure a larger allocation to Serbia, demonstrating that the EU does not only impose conditions, but also rewards their implementation.
Â Â  â Mr President, I wish to make three brief political comments.
Firstly, deleting all the appropriations from one sector, such as tobacco, does not reflect the sensitivity which our Parliament has traditionally shown to the weakest groups of society.
Secondly, this slender budget, with a 1% limit, does not allow us to exercise policy which is worthy of the ambitions of the Europe we want.
Major Community objectives such as competitiveness, economic cohesion, sustainable development, small and medium-sized enterprises, research and innovation â basically, in other words, all the Lisbon objectives â have fallen victim to across-the-board cuts to the budget by the Council.
At the same time, however, there have been cuts to the authority of the leaders of Europe themselves, who got everyone's expectations up and then capitulated unconditionally to the philosophy of austerity or, to be precise, to the philosophy of miserliness, not austerity, because austerity is when you cut the excess, when you cut the waste; but when you cut back on investments in the future and in hope, that is not called austerity, it is called miserliness.
Thirdly, we have arrived at the point today where we have just EUR 13 million in our emergency fund.
When?
When all around us nature is avenging itself on man, when the frequency of earthquakes and fatal hurricanes has become the new global nightmare, we have tied our hands together instead of promoting the humanitarian solidarity of Europe internationally.
Instead of leading, we are bringing up the rear.
The British Presidency may finally agree with the French by the end of the year.
With a few painful compromises, it may perhaps close the financial perspectives.
However, the idea of Europe will have gone bankrupt, in that, unfortunately, all our ambitious objectives for Europe will have been abandoned.
Â Â  . Mr President, I rise to speak in place of my colleague and fellow member of the Petitions Committee Mr Schwab, who is, regrettably, unable to be present.
I refer to the budget estimate for the European Ombudsman, which is the Petitions Committeeâs responsibility.
The Ombudsmanâs functions are of fundamental importance, involving as they do communication with the Communityâs citizens and bringing its institutions closer to them.
By examining the growing number of complaints relating to maladministration in the Community, and, where necessary, carrying out inquiries, he ensures that the rights and obligations of our fellow citizens are secured.
His work helps to make the services rendered by the European authorities more transparent and of higher quality.
It is therefore of fundamental importance that the European Ombudsman should be allocated sufficient funds to enable him to perform his functions as efficiently as possible.
The Petitions Committee regards the increase in funding of 3% over against the 2005 budget as appropriate and defensible, particularly in terms of the increase in work across the board resulting from a rise in complaints and communications activity.
The main reason why additional funding is needed, though, is in order to prepare appropriately for the accession to the Community of Romania and Bulgaria, and so we also endorse the call for additional staff to deal with enlargement.
The budget line does also, however, make it possible for the petitioners, that is to say the members of the public to claim, under certain circumstances, the partial reimbursement of up to 80% of their travel costs from Parliamentâs budget, subject to the prior approval of the Chairman of the Committee.
Subsistence costs for hotels and other expenses can also be reimbursed.
The Committee believes it to be necessary that such safeguards be put in place, as they have already had a beneficial effect on the Committeeâs own capacities and improved its response to European citizensâ needs.
We must not, therefore, be in any doubt about the fact that you cannot have more Europe for less money.
Â Â  Â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 11.30Â a.m.
Â Â  â The next item is Voting Time.
Â Â  Mr President, I just want to propose that we change the word âmutationâ to ârecombinationâ in the amendment.
The PSE Group has indicated that it would be in favour of this.
This is essentially just a technical change, but, scientifically speaking, you cannot prevent mutation of H5N1, much as we would like to and powerful though we might think we are.
We might, however, have a chance of preventing recombination, so I would like to have the word âmutationâ changed please.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted for the Doyle report on reducing harmful emissions into the environment in order to safeguard the climate.
Today, 26Â October 2005, however, the weather in Strasbourg is wonderful, spring-like and warm, and it is the same in Bergamo, my home town, as well as in Athens.
I wonder, then, whether we should really consider climate change to be bad, because instead I think it is very pleasant.
Above all, if China carries on polluting and thus having a negative effect on the climate, do we not want to do anything to stop imports of Chinese products if they are produced non-ecologically?
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to point out that I followed the rapporteurâs line on the Doyle report and regard Article 175 as the right legal basis, on the grounds that Austria and Denmark have already adopted wholesale bans on the use of these f-gases, and their experiences show that alternatives to them are, in principle, technically and economically workable and that these have a far less damaging effect on the environment.
If HFCs continue to be used in practically all new air-conditioning equipment, it is to be feared that these f-gases will become even more widespread, with a 5% increase to be reckoned with by 2010, which is not justifiable.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of the recommendation for second reading by Mrs Doyle on âEmissions from air conditioning systems in motor vehiclesâ, for the following reasons:
1. It honours the commitments under the Kyoto Protocol to reduce greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere;
2. Environmentally-friendly technologies must be used if we are to prevent climate change and the increasing numbers of natural disasters.
Â Â  . I will be voting in favour of the report despite reservations.
The legal base is an important issue.
The proposal for a split legal base of Article 175 and Article 95 for Articles 7, 8 and 9 seemed the best solution, rather than Article 175 on its own, to maintain vital elements of a single market approach rather than renationalising the industry.
Arguments for allowing higher standards in those Member States that want them are seductive.
But just how far can we follow such a route without endangering wider interests?
I welcome the moves to limit the further enlargement of the list of prohibited gases.
Technically it is possible, but it may be expensive, both for the consumers and for the environment, with sharp rises in energy consumption of up to 40%.
At this stage we should leave these further bans for assessment by the Commission as to the overall impact they would have on the economy and environment.
Â Â  .As regards the regulation, I voted in favour of keeping a dual legal base.
I believe, in actual fact, that this text simultaneously pursues the objectives of protecting the environment and of harmonising the regulations to ensure the smooth functioning of the internal market.
Using Article 175 as the sole legal base would have had a negative impact on the operation of the internal market, without having any real merits in terms of the environment.
I was opposed to expanding the list of prohibited products and equipment, in particular because of the impact assessments carried out by the Commission and because of the absence of alternative solutions in the medium term.
As regards the directive, I was opposed to changing the dates on which the bans on the use of fluorinated gases enter into force.
In actual fact, setting the implementation deadlines 2011 for new types of vehicles and 2017 for all brand new vehicles is a necessary step, because changing over from refrigerants involves not only developing new types of air conditioning systems, but also making structural changes to the way in which the various parts are fitted under the bonnet.
Â Â  . Labour MEPs strongly support the Doyle report which seeks to contain and ensure safe use and proper recovery of F-gases which contribute to global warming.
Cuts in F-gases will help Member States meet the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol.
However, we cannot support those amendments to the legislation which seek to impose bans on certain F-gases without a proper impact assessment.
The legislation provides for a review clause in article 10 and this is the proper mechanism to deal with any possible prohibitions.
Â Â  .The three fluorinated gases concerned here â HFC, PFC and sulphur hexafluoride â contribute to the phenomenon of global warming.
It is therefore important for the European Union to endeavour to reduce the use of these gases, and even to ban their use under certain conditions, which include having efficient alternatives and a specific timeframe.
I voted in favour of the Doyle report for two reasons:
Firstly, as a result of the efforts already made by industry.
In the 1990s, todayâs much maligned HFC gases replaced CFC gases, which were destroying the ozone layer.
This goes to show that the principle of substituting dangerous substances with safer ones is already a reality.
Secondly, the use of these three gases for such varied purposes as refrigeration and air conditioning systems, fire extinguishers or pharmaceutical aerosols for treating asthma justifies a balanced approach between guaranteeing peopleâs well being and protecting the climate.
Finally, I should like to point out that we can fight effectively against greenhouse gases without making a âpurely legalâ show of the matter.
That is why I rejected the having the âenvironmentâ as the sole legal base, which would have had only one effect: that of splintering the single market into 25 different sets of legislation.
Our businesses, our employees and our citizens do not want a nitpicking Europe.
Â Â  .Â Â My comments will relate to the regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on certain fluorinated greenhouse gases and the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on emissions from air conditioning systems in motor vehicles and amending Council Directive 70/156/EEC.
MrÂ President, the regulation on F-gases is yet another example of overregulation, and it bears no relation to reality.
What is the point of adopting another environmental regulation when statistical analysis shows that F-gases are virtually harmless, and that any negative effect is hard to distinguish from statistical error?
The regulation demonstrates a completely unbalanced approach to environmental and industrial development.
The fact that it is founded on a single legal basis, namely Article 95 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, means that the functioning of the common market could be disrupted, which is an alarming prospect.
Poland and the other Member States that have not imposed restrictions on the use of F-gases are firmly opposed to this decision.
They believe that the regulation should be founded on two legal bases, namely ArticlesÂ 95 and 175 of the Treaty establishing the European Community.
This would allow identical requirements to be applied throughout the European Union regarding restrictions and bans on the placing on the single market of certain products containing F-gases, and would mean that the principle of the common market would not be violated.
There can be no question that for the majority of new Member States restrictions on emissions of fluorinated gases would result in economic losses that would be out of all proportion to their environmental benefits.
Â Â  . These proposals are intended to provide continuity to the negotiations on the Commissionâs fresh proposal to make a significant contribution towards meeting the EUâs target under the Kyoto Protocol, as the rapporteur says, by cost-effective mitigation methods.
Whilst these measures are insufficient in themselves, they do constitute a contribution, especially the new directive and the regulation currently under discussion.
The old models will be phased out gradually and the Member States may promote the installation of air conditioning systems using a gas, such as CO2, that is efficient and has a low global warming potential, as stated in one of the proposals adopted in Parliament and which we supported.
We trust that the Commission and the Council will accept it.
Â Â  . I welcome this Commission proposal aimed at reducing emissions from motor vehicle air conditioning systems which are covered by the Kyoto protocol.
I am in favour of an accelerated timetable for the implementation of this proposal overall but with a longer timetable for small-scale car producers.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted for the report by MrÂ Florenz, whom I congratulate, because his report aims at reducing environmentally harmful noise emissions.
In the resulting silence, governments will, I hope, be able to hear the voices of pensioners calling for higher pensions, for they have not been heard so far.
Â Â  . The Florenz report will enable the Commissionâs proposal relating to the noise emission in the environment by equipment for use outdoors to be adopted at the earliest opportunity.
It would appear that the technical know-how available five years ago and the progress made since have brought new data to light that will enable us to make fresh changes to the limit values.
The potential impact on the internal market for this equipment of a delay in amending the legislation must not be overlooked.
We cannot allow the equipment to be forced out of the European market.
Accordingly, the limit values of the stage beginning on 3Â JanuaryÂ 2006 should merely be viewed as a guideline.
If the directive is published before the end of the year in the Official Journal, the manufacturers concerned will have the necessary legal certainty for their products.
I therefore voted in favour of the Florenz report.
Â Â  .
I and my British Conservative colleagues are broadly supportive of the TENs projects but have abstained on the final vote because of our concerns that the increased amounts being suggested are excessive and would breach Member States' financial contributions of 1% GNI.
Â Â  . This report concerns Community cofinancing for planned transport and energy networks, as part of the âLisbon Strategyâ objectives, or, in other words, the completion of the internal market â with priority given to the internal marketâs eastward enlargement â in which privatisation and competition are encouraged in the fields of transport and energy.
The report suggests, for example, that so-called public-private partnerships should be encouraged.
This is an instrument that has led to numerous public services being handed over to private capital, âby means of legal guarantees which are compatible with competition law and the internal marketâ, in other words, the primacy of capitalist competition in the EU, at the expense of what is known as âsocial and economic cohesionâ.
We welcome the reportâs proposal to increase the level of Community cofinancing for these projects, yet the report does not say that the global financing package needs to be increased for this purpose.
This is a contradiction in terms, as the number of projects subject to funding would decrease.
Â Â  . I should like to congratulate Mr Mauro on his important and timely report on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council determining the general rules for the granting of Community financial aid in the field of the trans-European transport networks and energy and amending Council Regulation (EC) No 2236/95, which I wholeheartedly support.
I especially welcome the establishment of provisions promoting the investment required for the Lisbon goals to be achieved.
Europe must invest in transport and energy infrastructure.
Nevertheless, when minimum financing rates for this proposal are determined, the financial perspective for 2007-2013 must be taken into account.
Â Â  . The recommendations contained in this report should give a welcome boost to trans european networks in the field of energy and transport.
The proposal is for a 10% increase in the budget and allowing up to 50% of cross border projects to be financed through Community aid.
I welcome this.
Â Â  . Today, another attempt has been made to misuse funds and rules that exist to solve cross-border problems.
Trans-European Networks were intended to compensate for past shortcomings.
State borders often appeared to hinder the construction and maintenance of fast, long-distance through connections.
Old railway lines and roads were mainly intended for domestic travel.
European cooperation could make a useful contribution to connections between two neighbouring countries, or across the territory of a third country between two non-neighbouring countries.
The original cofinancing plan of not more than 10% was intended for that purpose alone.
The contributions have now increased to 30% or 50%, and, according to MrÂ Mauroâs amendments, natural boundaries have been exceeded within one Member State as well.
Were these amendments by any chance intended in his country to cover half the cost of a non-earthquake-proof car bridge to Sicily before long?
I should have voted against when this proposal was adopted.
I object to the EUâs increasing interference in national administrative deliberations and prestige projects.
If funds are available for the TENs, these could be better invested in cross-border railway connections, particularly the previously neglected connections between east and west.
Â Â  . The trans-European networks are a very important instrument in creating and developing the infrastructure of the transport, telecommunications and energy sectors in Europe.
The Commissionâs proposal is to review the general rules for the granting of Community financial aid in the field of the trans-European transport and energy networks for 2007-2013.
I feel that, in view of the list of 30 transport priority projects, we must establish clear rules for the granting of financial aid, in such a way that these projects can develop in compliance with other Community policy, on the basis of effectiveness criteria and transparency rules as regards the financing of projects.
Lastly, nobody is in any doubt that this report will help us to implement measures aimed at promoting the investments required to achieve the Lisbon objectives.
I therefore voted in favour of the Mauro report.
Â Â  We share the view that a continuous overhaul of existing legislation is necessary.
What, however, is at issue is the political level at which legislation is to be passed.
In terms of basic principle, we are of the view that it is the Member Statesâ respective national food authorities that should in the first place decide which food additives are to be permitted.
If the food authority in a particular country judges that certain specific additives are to be permitted in connection with the preparation and sale of a food item, we see no reason why an EU directive should affect this judgment.
Food safety and public health are extremely important issues, and EU authorities should therefore only deal with them when there are practical benefits of their doing so that also extend beyond national borders.
There are good reasons for assuming that this report, as well as similar legislative proposals, will further strengthen EU authorities such as the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA).
We have voted in favour of those amendments that emphasise that this is a minimal directive and that thus make it clear that national flexibility is to be permitted.
We have voted against the report as a whole.
We have confidence that the Member Statesâ national food authorities are fully competent to deal with this important issue in a satisfactory way.
Our attitude naturally presupposes that goods are to be labelled with their country of origin so that consumers will be able to make active and informed choices.
Â Â  Mr President, it is quite clear that we have, since 11Â September 2001, devoted most of our attention to anti-terrorism and have neglected the combating of crime.
This misguided change of emphasis has made it possible for criminal organisations, most of them originating in non-European foreign countries, to extend their influence and become decentralised.
Criminal activities are a source of funding â albeit not the only one â for terrorism, and so it is essential that we should again devote our attention â and to a greater degree â to fighting criminal activity and organised crime.
Temporary cooperation by the state authorities with criminals in order to be able to combat these later on is of but little use; it is a positive invitation to more corruption and more mismanagement.
There is, I believe, a need for shared communications structures for the police and the judiciary, with more cooperation between both individual organisations and states, along with better protection for witnesses â although support for the victims of crime must not be forgotten.
Â Â  . On behalf of the Danish Social Democratic delegation, Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, Mr Henrik Dam Christensen, Mrs. Britta Thomsen, Mr Ole Christensen and Mr Dan Joergensen.
The delegation has voted in favour of the bloc vote on 28 amendments. We are aware though, that amendment 15, point F includes the possibility for member states to use disqualification from and ineligibility for political and public office against convicted criminals.
We are against this particular point.
The Danish Social Democrats are aware, that the proposal concerns an issue withinÂ section IV in the TEU, on which Denmark has an opt-out.
Â Â  The June List is in favour of increased cooperation and greater exchange of information between the Member States with a view to combating organised cross-border crime.
Decisions concerning the harmonisation of criminal and procedural laws should, however, only be taken with the agreement of the Member States and should be subject to supervision by the national parliaments.
It must not be for the European Parliament to establish what constitute crimes, mitigating circumstances and degrees of culpability.
Â Â  . We feel that organised crime, its multiple networks and trafficking activities, money laundering and tax havens, must be combated as a matter of priority.
We nonetheless share the concerns expressed by members of our Group regarding certain aspects of this report, including the following:
- the extension of the definition of a criminal organisation, in the context of the fight against organised crime, to cover groups of people whose purpose is not that of financial or other material gain, circumventing the definition in the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime, which classifies organisations whose purpose is financial or material gain under the heading of organised crime â thereby excluding political or social motivations;
- the increased possibility of incriminating people in a way that may lead to ambiguity; in other words, people not involved in criminal activities could be incriminated;
- much remains to be done to combat organised crime, given the resources currently available, and the report advocates the creation of a âEuropean Union police forceâ, while sidestepping the underlying causes of organised crime.
We wish to highlight our disappointment that amendments tabled by our Group were rejected.
We particularly regret the rejection of the amendment aimed at guaranteeing parliamentary control over Europolâs activities.
Â Â  .Europe wants to fight against serious organised crime, the international ramifications of which strike at the heart of Europe.
That is all well and good.
It is indeed high time to become concerned about the damage caused by the deplorable Schengen Agreement.
Although I am opposed to setting up a European police force â a real European FBI â it is, in actual fact, necessary to strengthen cooperation between the Member States, but to do so by fully respecting national sovereignties where the police, justice and the fight against cross-border organised crime are concerned.
Europe does not need to provide itself with scores of Theodule-style committees whose ultimate aim is completely to strip the nation States of their sovereign prerogatives: the ability to say what the law is and to enforce it.
Today, the majority of police information is transferred, and handled by, Interpol.
Our Eurocratsâ obsession with superimposing a European agency on Interpol generates, over and above the inherent costs of funding any organisation, a great deal of complications, particularly in relation to the absolute desire to harmonise the definitions of punishable crimes and offences or, furthermore, the scale of their penalties.
Let us abandon this pipe dream of standardisation and finally concentrate our efforts on a coherent fight against all types of crime, and let us begin to do so by re-establishing our national borders.
Â Â  . International organised crime is a huge, and growing, phenomenon.
How is this growth measured?
Which data actually reflect what is happening?
Nobody has a clear, coherent picture of how far organised crime actually extends.
Things cannot be allowed to continue in this vein.
As politicians, can we tolerate this situation?
No.
There is an urgent need to step up the fight against international crime on European territory, for the sake of our societies in the years ahead.
The new text on the table seeks to improve the effectiveness of the fight against organised crime.
This text is more precise in its focus; for example, it defines relations between Europol and Interpol, and this is particularly welcome.
I voted in favour of the Dunn report, because I believe that these measures may help strengthen the fight against organised crime.
Â Â  . â The framework decision and (more importantly) the report by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs propose the adoption of a common definition of and penalties for participation in organised crime, while particular importance is attached to the responsibility of legal persons if they are considered to be involved in organised crime activities.
Nonetheless, the legal order of each Member State has an adequate and sufficiently strict legal arsenal for combating organised crime, which is a constituent element of the capitalist system and is bred by it.
As with the European terrorism law, these new measures, which abolish basic principles of criminal law, are being adopted so that they can be used against the grass-roots movement and democratic rights, so that repressive mechanisms such as Europol and Eurojust can be strengthened.
Obvious evidence of this is the recent premeditated plot against the chairman of the Workers' Party of Ireland, Sean Garland, who is in danger of being handed over to the USA on charges of 'communist conspiracy in order to undermine the American dollar'.
Already in plenary of the European Parliament we have heard an insulting speech presenting the activity of a political organisation (Sinn Fein) as organised crime.
The communists are and always have been opponents of the crime under common criminal law which is often connected to mechanisms of the urban state.
However, we do not accept measures which might be a pretext for the criminalisation of political activity.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to point out that it is, in principle, the Member States that are responsible for taking the action needed to forestall the flu pandemic that is being prophesied.
That having been said, it is also important that the Commission should coordinate them in doing this.
It is evident from the warnings they have issued that both the World Health Organisation and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control are taking the prospect of a pandemic breaking out extremely seriously.
Now is the time to draw up emergency plans, take the necessary coordinating action and, most of all, act to prevent panic among the public at large.
In conclusion, I would also like to thank the interpreters for having sacrificed some of their lunch hour.
Â Â  . The resolution that we have just adopted is a step in the right direction in the fight against this disease.
Most importantly, it sets great store by prevention, as we have been advocating, because a potential pandemic can be avoided through prevention.
As the text says, exchanging information is vital if we are to avoid alarmism.
We must work with a sense of proportion, in tandem with the national and international authorities.
Hence our calls for the Commission to provide financial support for a monitoring system, laboratory tests, research into suitable vaccines, vaccination in the Member States and financial and technical support for third countries, especially in Asia, to ensure prevention and screening at source.
Community support must be provided, as we have been advocating, in the event of an outbreak of the disease, given that this will cause poultry breeders to lose income as they restart their operations.
Such an outbreak will also affect a significant number of farmers and others working in or connected to the poultry sector, and will have a major economic and social knock-on effect in the Member States.
It is therefore important to bear in mind that, quite apart from the human health problems, some countries â be they EU countries or those at the source of the disease in South-East Asia â may not be able to meet the high costs involved.
Â Â  This resolution deals with an issue that is, to the highest degree, cross-border in nature.
There are thus good reasons for the EU Member States to coordinate the measures adopted and the political decisions taken.
We have therefore chosen to vote in favour of the resolution as a whole.
We wish, however, to emphasise that isolated EU measures are insufficient for getting to grips with the challenges posed by a global influenza pandemic.
It is therefore extremely important for the EU to act in cooperation with the World Health Organisation (WHO).
We question a number of individual points in the report, such as that relating to the Commissionâs need to prepare a comprehensive communication strategy in conjunction with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).
We presuppose that the EU Member States are perfectly capable on their own of communicating successfully with their people, without the aid of EU bodies.
We believe that it is internationally recognised organisations such as the WHO that should work on global world health issues.
Quite a few of the amendments lose sight of this and instead emphasise the EUâs international role.
We are critical of the fact that the European Parliament is in this way exploiting an important political issue in order to strengthen the EU and its international political role.
Â Â  . â Of the proposed measures for the Member States, some are right and others are pure propaganda, such as the provision of vaccines and medicinal products.
Of course it is done without excuse, by calling on the Member States to take a stand first and to order large quantities, giving vaccine and medicinal product companies the incentive to increase their output.
Without doubt a broader plan is needed, based on prevention, with examinations of poultry farm workers by occupational doctors and with the provision of integrated assistance (technical, financial and scientific) mainly to the countries of the Far East, where the disease has been endemic for 7 years.
The objective is the definitive eradication of the disease in reared poultry and wild birds, species that carry and feed the pathogen.
If these aspects are not included, the problem may reoccur in the future.
Similarly, the new EU directive, instead of introducing stricter measures than those which apply today, becomes very relaxed on certain issues, giving the facility to large poultry-rearing companies to derogate from bans on the intra-Community trade in poultry, even in areas which have been attacked by highly pathogenic influenza.
The EU policy, even on pandemic issues, is to use them for the profitability of big business, which is why they are 'harmful' to the grass-roots classes.
The solution is to 'combat' the ÎU of big business and war until it is exterminated.
Â Â  .
A few years ago, two major deadly epidemics were looming, that of the mysterious SARS virus, which has meanwhile disappeared out of the public eye, and a possible combination of bird flu with human flu variants.
I thought that there was far too much of a âwait and seeâ approach to the way these were handled.

The international movement of travellers from sources of infection was hardly checked, if at all; little attention was paid to research into the emergence of new flu variants; no preventive vaccination of poultry was carried out and the supplies of a vaccine for the mass-scale vaccination of people against already known flu variants were totally inadequate.
I have on previous occasions in this House drawn attention to these deficiencies: I did so on 7 April 2003 and 13 May 2003, and in questions to the Commission in 2003 and 2004.
The European Union and its Member States were then hardly prepared for a great danger that could have cost millions of lives in a short space of time.
There was also the imminent need for the removal, on a massive scale, of birds kept by humans.
Although those problems have not yet been resolved, this House and the Commission are now taking a different attitude.
Those who, like the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, believe that unnecessary panic is being spread and that it is mainly the hunters of birds that need protecting are no more than a small minority.
That is why I will be voting in favour of this resolution.
Â Â  .Avian influenza has arrived at our gates, with cases recorded in Croatia, Russia, the United Kingdom and Germany.
What assessment can we make of 15 days of crisis management?
We can be delighted that the Member States have taken vital emergency measures to prevent the risk of contagion in the EU by imposing a ban on wild birds, by using labels displaying the words âlocally produced poultry meatâ, by slaughtering huge numbers of chickens, by placing quotas on species and so on.
For all that, how is it possible not to lament the lack of coordination among the 25 countries, each one keen to isolate itself from any health risks present in others, even though it was with the aim of confronting all of these risks of a pandemic that, in 2003, following the SARS crisis, Europe equipped itself with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control?
Stockholm ought to be the centre for coordinating and monitoring the health situation in Europe.
It is no such thing.
Therefore, while we wait for the Member States to be so good as to give Europe a chance where its peopleâs health is concerned, it is vital that we prepare for the annual migration of wild birds next spring.
Let us hope that Europe puts these six months to good use in developing a vaccine and in making sure that all the conditions needed to encourage an outbreak of avian influenza on EU territory do not come together.
Â Â  . In the vote today on the Joint Resolutions on patents for biotechnological inventions, I voted for those amendments making clear the need for a prohibition on the patenting of all human body parts, tissues and cells in their natural life state and their DNA sequences.
There are no circumstances in which the human body and parts thereof should become a commercial commodity.
Moreover, believing strongly in the protection of human life, including at its earliest stages, I am opposed to both destructive processes and scientific engineering which tinkers with the marvellous creation which is the human body.
Â Â  . Biotechnology is, without doubt, one of the most important technologies for the future and as such needs to be backed up by an appropriate political framework.
Ethical, environmental and health aspects must also be taken on board.
One of the most significant problems in this area is that of patents.
We believe that under no circumstances should human life, including human DNA, be patented.
We therefore voted against all of the proposals paving the way for the patenting of genes and of life itself, and regret the fact, moreover, that in the final resolution there was a degree of ambiguity that could leave that door open to such patenting, even though its purpose was to prevent another proposal with more serious consequences.
We stand in clear opposition to any patents covering life and knowledge that we consider a universal good.
A further area for debate is that of ethical principles.
Stem cell research should not be blocked, although we are opposed to human cloning, as referred to in the resolution.
We ultimately abstained on the resolution, on account of its contradictory aspects in relation to our positions of principle.
Â Â  .The practices of the European Patent Office are once again subject to debate before this Assembly.
Software and computer-implemented inventions were the talking points a few months ago.
Today, in a far more serious way which affects the foundations of our moral principles and the essence of our humanity, biotechnology is the talking point.
Without doubt, European legislation, in failing to adapt and in allowing grey areas to exist in law, is partly responsible for the current situation, whereby permission has been given for human germ cells to be patented and opposition to a patent on embryonic stem cells has been rendered ineffective.
This legislation has to be rapidly revised.
We cannot, however, completely exonerate the EPO from this affair.
It can never be repeated enough: human beings are not patentable; a human being, as a whole or in part, and whatever its stage of development, is not patentable.
It is high time this was spelt out in a binding text.
Â Â  . An emotional and simplistic approach must not be used to tackle the problems linked to human genetics.
The European Union cannot allow itself to fall behind its international partners and hold a number of areas for research in abeyance.
From the perspective of the great fundamental principles and the universal values that we stand for, it is crucially important entirely to rule out reproductive cloning and the risks of eugenics.
Yet, it is just as important to define what is feasible and acceptable to carry out in genetic research, particularly in the context of therapeutic cloning and stem cell research aimed at improving human health.
We know that the framework set out for patenting biotechnological inventions is a crucial platform for developing new types of therapy, which, for a large number of ill people, represent an unhoped-for opportunity.
Â Â  .I voted against the resolution and all of the amendments tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.
This text is an alibi, one extra element in a long drawn-out strategy that has no other aim than to put a stop to European funding of embryonic stem cell research.
There have been three targeted attacks in less than nine months.
March 2005: the Verts/ALE Group and the PPE-DE Group initiated a resolution on the trafficking in female reproductive cells taking place in Romania.
Their only motive was to denounce cloning - including therapeutic cloning - and to demand that the EU cut off all funding for this research.
October 2005: 73 Members wrote to the President of the Commission on behalf of Parliament.
For what reason?
To attack â once again - freedom of research in Europe in the name of their beliefs, which, by the way, I do respect.
A few of us have set about replying to this letter, and a good 127 Members have made it clear to MrÂ Barroso that it is unthinkable for us to exclude Europe from a crucial area of research.
26Â October 2005 and the third act carried out by these Groups: holding this resolution hostage.
By means of this obscurantist vote, 338 Members have decided not to give science any chance whatsoever.
This is just one more disastrous sign for genome research and for million of patients in Europe.
Â Â  . Mr McCreevy made it clear last night when speaking on this subject that he does not intend to respect the Directive prohibiting any human cloning when he said that even though reproductive cloning was excluded under the directive he left the door open for the possibility of therapeutic cloning.
In doing this McCreevy is once again giving "the two finger". This time to the Council of Minister and the Biopatents Directive.
"A. Council memorandum on the common position on the Biopatnents Directive states, at point 35, that:
'At (a) in paragraph 2, the Council replaced 'procedures for human reproductive cloning' with 'procedure for the cloning of human beings', since it thought the adjective 'reproductive' could be too restrictive.
It was understood that the words 'human being' referred to human being from embryonic state'.
It would seem that Mr McCreevy is anticipating is ignoring the EU's existing Directives and anticipating the now defunct Constitution.
Â Â  .
This subject area is very complex technologically and morally, and while I have misgivings about some aspects of the resolution I believe that it does go some way to striking a balance between the need for research which could be hugely beneficial, and on the other hand the potential damage that this research could do to human life.
I therefore broadly support the compromise that Parliament has reached today, but this technology will need to be kept under constant review.
Â Â  Mr President, the Klamt report, which, we, I am sad to say, approved a moment ago, can best be described as a sort of naÃ¯ve wish-list, and as a description of ideological, left-wing concepts that are totally unrelated to the real world.
Quite apart from the mandatory obeisance to the alleged blessings of the multicultural society â which, incidentally, bears no relation to what that society is doing to our cities and neighbourhoods â I am particularly shocked by the notion in this report that organised legal immigration to Europe could help address the enormous problems of bogus asylum applications, illegal immigrants and people-trafficking with which we are faced.
As I see it, the one is completely unrelated to the other, for it goes without saying that the people and professional categories that could qualify for temporary or permanent legal immigration or for work permits are not the same people or the same professional categories who overwhelm us with this immigration problem.
Why, in fact, would the fight against illegal immigration suddenly improve if the only things that are hampering todayâs fight were a lack of political will and courage and if, as a result, the bold measures that are so necessary in our countries are not forthcoming?
Â Â  Mr President, I have voted against the Klamt report, which contains a list of proposals that fly in the face of the interests of our own people.
It looks as if the European Parliament is, more and more, making a speciality of voting on texts of that kind.
It is particularly short-sighted to again seek our salvation in new economic migrants.
We should learn from our past mistakes.
The integration policy so far adopted in most, if not all, Member States, has largely failed.
It follows that attracting aliens from outside of Europe would only exacerbate the problem.
It is therefore high time that we, in our ivory towers, started to realise this.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I must express my solidarity with MrsÂ Klamt, in view of the leftâs unsuccessful attempt to sabotage the report in committee.
As it is very clear that the amendments do not solve the problems and do not improve conditions for jobless immigrants, I agree with the rapporteur that mass regularisation is neither a way to control illegal immigration nor a way to recruit economic migrants; instead, it fuels marginalisation and widespread criminality.
Although the ambitious proposal to set up a European âgreen cardâ system is worth endorsing, a policy making entry more flexible for seasonal workers or for those with fixed-term employment will generate a catastrophic, unmanageable situation.
For immigration to be a source of prosperity and development, rather than instability, there have to be stringent procedures and criteria.
In addition to the immigrant having a sponsor and being able to demonstrate the ability to provide for his or her own upkeep, I believe further guarantees are needed.
A job must be a for a migrant to be admitted.
Providing for derogations and exceptions is unacceptable.
I hope the Commission will submit a consistent, pragmatic proposal containing precise, non-arbitrary conditions.
Economic migration provides an opportunity for a country, but it cannot be a panacea for all ills, from an ageing population to a labour shortage.
That is why my group, the National Alliance or the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, abstained from voting on this report.
Â Â  .I abstained on Article 6 of the Klamt report on a Community approach for managing economic migration because I believe that, although it is acceptable to allow Europeans and non-Europeans to vote in local elections, it is much less so to allow non-Europeans to vote in European elections.
During local elections, all citizens who have lived in a European country for a given period of time â for example five years, like in Belgium â have to be able to voice their opinions on their living conditions, the way in which their towns are developed, their childrenâs education and so on.
I should also like to see â again, like in Belgium â the right to vote granted to non-Europeans insofar as they make a solemn commitment to abide by what is laid down in the Constitution and in the laws of their host countries.
Â Â  The own-initiative report is part of the process of setting up a European immigration policy in which one and the same procedure shall apply in all the Member States.
The June List believes, however, that the Member States themselves should be free to decide what form their policies on economic migration are to take and that it should not be for the European Parliament to lay down which rules are to apply in this area.
We believe that economic migration needs not to be seen as a problem requiring harmonisation of the rules at European level.
On the contrary, the Member States should deal with these issues independently.
A Member State that, for example, wishes to permit generous rules for economic migration should be allowed to do so in accordance with the principle of institutional competition.
Â Â  . The report before us contains points that we endorse.
For example, it calls on the Commission to ensure the inclusion of all provisions of the âInternational Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Familiesâ adopted by the UN General Assembly on 18 December 1990, and urges all Member States to ratify this Convention.
Among other aspects that we welcome is the reportâs condemnation of the way in which current EU policies concentrate on the punitive side.
The report contains some contradictory points, however, in the context of a migration policy that encourages the exploitation of human resources, especially the best qualified workers, from third countries.
It also draws attention to the importance of clauses on migratory flows and compulsory readmission â in other words, expulsion â in the event of illegal immigration.
We also regret the rejection of proposals tabled by our Group, expressing our opposition to âtemporary detention centresâ and to other measures denying immigrants their freedom, condemning the setting up of âtemporary detention centresâ in third countries and condemning the political failure of the âquotasâ, which have exacerbated illegal immigration and the precarious work status of these workers.
Â Â  .This report, which is meant to be a response to the European Commissionâs Green Paper on economic migration, is nothing but a long litany of dangerous and suicidal aberrations for the nations and peoples of Europe.
Proposals demonstrating the greatest bias towards immigration and the developing world are littered throughout the report:
Granting non-European immigrants the right to vote in local and European elections; relaxing the measures allowing economic migrants to enter, and stay in, Europe; approving mass regularisations as a means of creating future prospects for illegal immigrants; launching awareness campaigns on the positive impact of immigration policies and including the history of migrations in school curricula; reaffirming immigrantsâ right to large-scale family reunifications; allowing economic migrants to benefit from social security payments from their host countries after they return to their home countries; and, furthermore, doing away with bank fees for economic migrants transferring money from their host countries to their home countries.
Finally, the icing on the cake is that this report refuses to give priority to citizens of the European Union before turning to third-country nationals.
It is always the same old story: preference is given to third-country nationals over European citizens.
Â Â  .This report on managing economic migration is a web of lies, falsehoods and ideological bias.
The wording is so excessive as to do a disservice to immigrants themselves by aiming systematically to encourage a policy of immersion at European level.
No national government whatsoever could present such a catalogue of measures without being sent to the opposition benches at the next election.
MrsÂ Klamt wants to go through European channels by keeping the people in the dark about the crime being committed behind their backs.
Fortunately, the Council, in its great wisdom, has held on to the principle of unanimity for all issues to do with legal immigration.
Only one example is needed to highlight the absurd nature of such proposals: âeconomic immigration can help in the management of existing migratory flowsâŠ and immigration has been proven to have positive effects on the labour marketâ.
This is obviously a falsehood: the more we let in legal immigrants, the more we will see an explosion in the number of illegal immigrants, who are hoping to have their status regularised one day in the near future, as in Spain and in Italy.
The European Parliament would be making a fool of itself and discrediting itself if it were to adopt such a report, which, if adopted, would draw to our borders millions of men and women enticed by the land of opportunity promised by our sorcererâs apprentices.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to call on the Commission to provide the House with an explanation, but the Commission is unfortunately absent.
Perhaps, though, your services might be so kind as to convey this to the Commission, which I would ask to do so in the course of this week.
The reason for this demand is Commissioner McCreevyâs statement in the course of yesterday eveningâs debate on the patentability of human cloning, a statement that finds no support in law.
The Commissionâs interpretation of this point is quite simply wrong and contradicts the protocol note of the Council of Ministers handed down by the Council when the directive was adopted.
In Article 35 of that protocol note, it is stated quite clearly that it is not only reproductive cloning that is barred from being patented.
The Commission, which is the guardian of the Treaties, cannot, in a speech by one of its members, give an interpretation that does not concur with the directive, that is false and that contradicts the Councilâs protocol note.
It is, therefore, as a matter of real urgency that I ask your services to demand that the Commission rectify this, for if it does not there are sure to be consequences.
Knowing that many other Members present in the Chamber take a similar view, I really do ask that this be clarified, that the clarification be forwarded to Commissioner McCreevyâs office, and that he himself, this week, should correct this error.
Â Â  I am pleased to welcome a delegation from the Verkhovne Rada, the Ukrainian Parliament, to the official gallery.
This delegation, made up of nine Members of Parliament, is chaired by Mr Valeryi Pustovoytenko.
They have come to Strasbourg for the eighth meeting of the European Union-Ukraine Parliamentary Cooperation Committee which will be held today and tomorrow.
I wish you and the whole of the European Union-Ukraine Parliamentary Cooperation Committee a very fruitful meeting.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the Council and Commission statements on the preparation for the next informal European Council.
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Mr Blair, is with us for this debate and I would like to thank him in particular for the effort I know he has had to make to be here with us today.
I believe it is a positive thing that, on the eve of the Hampton Court meeting, Parliament can hear directly from the President-in-Office of the Council his explanations of the purpose of this meeting.
Thank you, Mr Blair.
You have the floor.
Â Â  .
Mr President, colleagues, it is a very great pleasure to be with you this afternoon, here in the European Parliament in Strasbourg.
Let me add my words of welcome to our colleagues from Ukraine.
If we should ever feel lacking in confidence about Europe and its values, then the interest of people such as our Ukrainian friends should tell us that the values of Europe are strong and are much envied by so much of the rest of the world.
My purpose in coming here today is to report back on what we intend over these coming weeks to be the basis of the UK Presidency.
I have with me Douglas Alexander, who is our Europe Minister, and after I have left he will stay to answer more questions â especially the difficult questions!
However, I shall be here I am pleased to say for at least an hour and a half to hear both your comments and to answer some of those questions myself.
I would also like to explain at the very outset how we want to take forward the Presidency over these coming weeks.
On 23 June in Brussels, we set out an essential vision of how we should combat the challenge of globalisation.
I think it is agreed generally in Europe that we need to get Europe moving and we need to get it moving in the right direction.
The question is how we do that.
We now have an opportunity, both in the informal summit, which is tomorrow, and then in the formal summit in December, to set out that direction and put in place the specific policies to match it.
So, over these two summits, our idea is first to agree on the right direction for Europe economically, then, secondly, to set out some new priority areas for European action and then, thirdly, on the basis and in the context of that, to get a budget deal in December at the formal Council.
I shall first of all come to the informal summit.
This is what I want to come out of this informal summit.
The first thing is that I want to get that informal summit to agree effectively on the Commission paper presented by President Barroso and the European Commission.
That Commission paper is an analysis of the challenge of globalisation and how we meet it, both as Member States and as the European Union.
I have to say that it is a stark analysis, but it is the right analysis.
It shows just how great a competitive challenge we have from the emerging economies such as China and India, never mind the United States and others.
It shows how important it is we deal with the almost 20Â million unemployed people in the European Union.
It shows how we must make our labour markets less restrictive, how we have to make sure, in the field of research and development, innovation and other areas, that we catch up with the best practice in the world.
It shows how in areas like energy â where after all we are going to be importing within the next few years something like 90% of our oil and gas needs â Europe has to up its game considerably, and it shows also the enormous demographic challenge that we will face, with fewer people of working age, more people in retirement, and more people therefore needing to work.
As a result, issues such as work/life balance and how we allow people both to raise their families and to work in the workplace are all the more crucial.
The first thing we want to do at the informal summit is to get that paper agreed and make that the basis for the discussion we then have about Europe, its social model and its economic future.
However, we also want to add some specific areas of future priorities for European work.
I should like to mention some of those.
In respect of these areas of future work, we are also, as the Presidency, publishing some papers today from academics within the European Union on certain aspects of the challenge we face in each of those areas.
Those will be published and available to Members of Parliament and people attending the summit tomorrow.
But what are the new priority areas we should be thinking of?
First of all, there is research and development, and innovation.
We need to make sure that more of the European budget is spent on those priority areas, because those are the future areas for the European economy.
We also need to coordinate better the way in which we work in these areas.
We propose specifically a European research council that is the equivalent of the American National Science Foundation, that will support the funding of research and development projects and give us the chance in Europe to be forming the world-beating companies in the technologies of the future.
So, one major area for future priority work is research and development.
The second area is energy and energy policy.
I believe it is time to develop within Europe a common European energy policy.
For far too long we have been in the situation where, in a haphazard and random way, energy needs and energy priorities are simply determined by each country according to its needs, but without any sense of the collective power that we could have in Europe, if we were prepared to pool our energy and our resources.
That policy should focus not on new regulatory barriers, but rather on obtaining a genuinely open energy market.
It should deal with, for example, a properly integrated European Union grid.
Already this is done on a bilateral basis between countries.
Think of how much greater economic power and competitiveness we could have, if we were prepared to make sure that it was integrated on a Europe-wide basis.
Secondly, we, like other major countries in the world, should be prepared to enter into dialogue at European level with key suppliers of energy, to use our collective weight to make our voice heard.
Thirdly, we need to be developing clean technologies, energy efficiency and coming to some common views at least about the possibilities and perspectives on issues related to areas such as nuclear power.
I thought certain things might get a mixed reception.
These are areas we need to work on in future.
The third area concerns universities. Let us be clear about the situation in Europe today.
Our university sector is not competing in the way it needs to with America.
China and India are developing their university sector in an extraordinary way.
Looking not just at the spending of our tertiary education sector, but also where we are getting the value-added in the connection between business and university, we do not have anything like the same possibilities in Europe that they have in other parts of the world.
Our proposal is that we task the Commission specifically to report back to the European Council next year on the challenge facing European universities, how we compete with the United States, how we get more public-private partnership into sustaining them and more graduate schools linking business and the academic world across the European Union.
There is a fourth area I would like to suggest for priority work, and that is how we control migration, but also use it to boost the effectiveness and competitiveness of the European economy.
We need both to make sure that we have the proper controls on illegal immigration at the same time as recognising that controlled migration can actually bring a benefit to our European economies.
One of the papers that we published today is a paper from a French academic, Patrick Weil, who has also been an adviser to politicians in France, which points out how, ironically, those countries that have opened their labour market to those from the accession countries â the accession ten â have actually benefited economically from that opening up.
We need to take those lessons further.
The fifth area concerns the need to make far greater progress on what I might call the demographic or work/life balance issues.
Now here it is not appropriate for the European Union to be engaged in substantial bouts of extra regulation and so on, but here is where the open method of coordination could work properly, in things like work/life balance, childcare and provision for people to be able to raise their family and work at the same time, in how we get the best practice in pension and social security systems across Europe.
This would be sensible if we are looking at how we can modernise the European economy.
The final area of priority work concerns what was called by the European Commission the globalisation fund.
I just want to make one thing very clear about this idea.
The important thing about the globalisation fund is that it should not be a fund that protects companies that need to restructure, or failing companies, or one that bails out companies that cannot succeed.
What it should do, however, is protect and help people in circumstances where restructuring has made them redundant or left them facing difficulties within the labour market.
To take an example from the UK recently, where thousands of people were made redundant at the Rover works: we did not stop the restructuring, because, Iâm afraid, it was economically necessary, even though tragic for the individuals involved.
However, we provided real help with retraining, re-skilling and finding new jobs for the workforce in order to protect not the job but the individual.
Such a fund, if it is done in the proper way, will help rather than hinder us in meeting the challenge of globalisation.
What we want to propose at the informal Council tomorrow is that we should agree the basic direction in the Commission paper and then, in the six areas of work I have just outlined, that we should set out how we can make progress in each of those areas in order to enhance the competitiveness of the European Union and also its social solidarity in helping people adjust to the challenge of globalisation.
In addition, tomorrow, arising out of the special Council that we had on 13Â July, we want to propose measures for a counter-terrorism strategy in order to get agreement to those measures at the December Council.
Those should focus on things like the radicalisation of people inside the European Union, the protection of our infrastructure and, in particular, how we exchange information and protection more effectively, how we retain that, how we get cooperation between the different security and police services inside the European Union in order to protect our people better and, as the Home Secretary, Charles Clarke, said to you when he was here in the European Parliament, we are happy to deal with this under the first pillar, so that it can be part of the codecision-making process.
If we can agree that tomorrow, then I believe that we have the beginnings, at least, of the right context in which we can get a financing deal.
In addition to these other issues, there are outstanding dossiers, and let me just say a word about those now.
On the working time directive, I hope we can reach agreement under the United Kingdom presidency â we will certainly try to do that.
In respect of the services directive, we know the position taken by the European Parliament; I still, however, hope that it is possible to get political agreement on the right way forward, because â and I say this in all sincerity â the services directive is a necessary part of completing the single market and it is important for Europe.
