The person who recounts the history of European integration in 20 or 25 yearsâ time will be able to say, without any exaggeration, that an energy policy for Europe was launched in MarchÂ 2006, under the Austrian Presidency.
We are only just at the beginning with this, and it will not be easy.
There will be resistance, but there is resistance because there is change.
If there were no change, then there would be no resistance.
On this matter, I can assure you, on behalf of the Commission, that it will exercise all of its powers in relation to integration, because â and we wish to state this firmly â there is no reason why Europe should have 25 energy markets.
There is no reason why, in this day and age, Europe should have 25 national energy policies.
We need a common strategy for Europe in relation to energy.
There is no room for nationalistic reflexes.
The Member States have reaffirmed their desire to work together in seeking common solutions and acknowledge the Commissionâs central role in terms of setting up open and competitive markets at Union level.
As regards the Lisbon Agenda, we have no time to lose and we now need to get results.
It was in this spirit that, immediately after the European Council, MrÂ Verheugen and I met the national coordinators overseeing the implementation of the Lisbon Agenda.
We informed them of the Commissionâs desire to thoroughly fulfil its role not only in terms of providing support and assistance, but also in terms of monitoring the implementation of the national reform programmes.
I wish to congratulate MrÂ SchÃŒssel, who has just announced his desire to increase the level of representation responsible for monitoring the Lisbon process in his own country, Austria.
We should also like to take advantage of this to launch an appeal to all of the Member States to do the same.
Sound technical preparations are obviously important, and we are very pleased with the technical level attained for this exercise in the various Member States.
That being said, we also believe that it is important for the programmeâs success that we increase its standing in the political hierarchy, as MrÂ SchÃŒssel just announced in relation to Austria.
Furthermore, the Commission will continue to provide impetus at European level.
We also agree on the need to launch exchanges of practical experiences.
We believe that the time has come to hold meetings in the various Member States, something that we are going to do from autumn onwards.
This close contact with the Member States is crucial when it comes to making progress with our programme, but it is not enough.
Allow me, in this Chamber, to lend my support to Parliamentâs powerful message concerning the need for the greater and even more extensive involvement of all of the actors concerned at this crucial stage of implementation.
We have made efforts to clarify the levels of responsibility and competence of the various institutional, economic and social actors at European, national and regional level.
We must now promote a genuine kind of ownership of the Lisbon Strategy by all of these actors.
I call on you to focus all of our efforts on the crucial reforms with a view to preparing Europe to rise to the challenges of globalisation, together with that of an ageing population.
We can win the globalisation battle.
In order to do so, every one of us must also participate in the communication efforts and in the public debate.
I welcome the partnership that exists between the European Parliament and the national parliaments.
As recently as January, you debated the Lisbon Strategy in this context.
I can only encourage you to pursue this dialogue and offer you the Commissionâs support.
Your Parliament and the national parliaments are the key actors in this debate because, together, they all represent the people of Europe.
We will be unable to make a success of the necessary reforms without the broad support of the people, who will ultimately benefit from our efforts.
There was vision in this European Council, but it was also a practical European Council.
It left everyone with an in-tray of work for the coming months.
Not least, it gave the Commission a clear mandate for action over the coming months, and I want particularly to thank ChancellorÂ SchÃŒssel for his team work, team spirit, the way he understood, the way he supported the role of the Commission and the need to give consistency and continuity over time for the work that will follow different presidencies of the European Council.
That approach of partnership between the Council, the Commission and Parliament is essential.
Without that spirit and cooperation we will not be able to achieve real progress.
One area where Parliamentâs role has already been decisive in finding a compromise was and is precisely that of the services directive.
It took some time to convince the Heads of State and Government, but eventually the European Council backed the line that Parliament agreed and that also received our support.
If you remember, since the beginning I have said, and the Commission has said, that if there was a real, clear consensus from Parliament, we would be ready to work with you to resolve this services directive issue.
Yesterday, we presented to you our amended proposal and you see that it fully reflects the compromise endorsed by a large majority in this House in February.
The revised text preserves the balance between the urgent need to unleash the full potential of the internal market for services and the preservation of our European social model.
In parallel, we presented the communication providing clear guidance on the application of Community rules on the posting of workers.
As to freedom of movement for workers, I also want to commend the announcement made by several Member States following the Commission report in terms of anticipating the end of the transition period for the free movement of workers.
After Ireland, Britain and Sweden, we now have Finland, Spain, Portugal and most recently the Netherlands, which have announced their wish to anticipate such freedom of movement for workers, so that is the way for us really to have an enlarged Europe that works.
We will also follow this amended version of the services directive with a communication on social services of general interest.
We are also working hard on health services.
On the basis of the text now presented, I expect the Council and Parliament to conclude the legislative procedure rapidly.
I would also like to mention three areas where I believe the European Council took decisions which will have a real and lasting impact.
First, business: we all know that for new jobs we must look to business and small and medium-sized enterprises, because they create most of the jobs.
The decision to cut red tape for new business is a sign that Europe is now becoming open for business.
As for SMEs, I was glad that the Commission received support for its approach on state aid rules and for cutting administrative burdens.
We will take this work forward swiftly.
Secondly, knowledge: the proposal for a European Institute of Technology excited some debate.
Good.
I take it as a sign that the EIT has real importance.
A flagship for European excellence in education, research and innovation is a genuinely new idea which needs imagination and drive to work.
With the green light from the European Council, we will be working to flesh out the plans and to show how the European Institute of Technology will be an effective catalyst for knowledge and growth in Europe.
As I said in my introduction, the European Council paid particular attention to energy.
It put the Union on the path to a real energy policy for Europe.
It endorsed the triple goals of our Green Paper: sustainable, competitive and secure energy.
It also set out the practical measures to be taken, including some of the 20Â specific proposals set out in the Commission Green Paper: a real internal market for energy, a coherent external policy, effective support for energy efficiency and renewables.
The Commissionâs forward programme for energy is now very busy.
As a result, I really believe that specific measures will be delivered.
It was important for this not to be a one-shot show.
Now it is very fashionable to speak about energy, and now Member States accept what â let us be frank â two years ago would have been impossible to accept: that we need a common strategy.
So, for the June European Council, as Chancellor SchÃŒssel said, the Commission and the High Representative will come up with some ideas on the external dimension of energy policy.
We decided to put that matter under constant review, monitoring it every year at the spring Council.
That was important in terms of consistency.
After all those internal points, the European Council was also able to send a strong message of commitment on the Belarus situation.
The Commission is working with the Council very actively to promote the reinforcement of civil society in Belarus and to support the independent media so that the citizens of Belarus have access to media that is not censored and not controlled by a government that does not respect the fundamental principles of a democratic state.
We are now moving in the right direction.
We are putting words into action.
We know what we should do; we agreed to do it, and now we are doing it.
We are doing it in partnership with the European Parliament, the European Council and Member States, and also with businesses, trade unions, consumers and citizens across Europe.
I believe that is the only way to deliver more growth and new jobs.
I believe that is the right way to get out of a very negative situation for Europe.
As I said earlier, there is now a feeling in Europe of scepticism, sometimes cynicism.
The right way to change that is to deliver concrete results, to resolve the services directive issue, as we have been doing, to settle the financial perspectives, as I hope will now be done.
I will not comment on that now, because I did that in my introductory remarks.
So, if we can achieve results, we will create the best atmosphere for settling the institutional problems that have to be settled and for creating a new impetus for this Europe.
That is our duty.
We should do more to achieve it.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the President of the European Council, Chancellor SchÃŒssel, spoke of the responsibility that the European institutions have in common, and the President of the Commission has just been talking about actions.
Addressing the President of this House in particular, I can say that my impression is that we â by which I mean you three and the whole European Parliament â find ourselves today in a situation in which this sense of community and of shared responsibility for the future of the European Union is making itself felt.
It is my profound conviction that this is a good opportunity to restore, by our visible actions, the mindset that makes this European Union appealing to those who live in it, and to do this also with reference to other issues that we are not debating today, such as the Constitutional Treaty, to which we have to find a solution.
That is our shared responsibility.
I am very pleased to note that the President of the European Council is working hard, together with us and with the Commission, on the common destiny of Europe, and doing so unspectacularly but with professionalism and efficiency, and sustained by European conviction.
People â often wrongly â see Brussels as a symbol of bureaucracy.
Success will be ours if we â and on this point it is particularly the Commission that I am addressing â carry the Lisbon process through to a good conclusion, spelling it out that we want less bureaucracy; what we want is a freer internal market, for the stronger the internal market is, the more we will succeed in opening up the market in the European Union â something in which the services directive is an important instrument â with less regulation, fewer subsidies, and more competition, so that we become all the more competitive on global markets.
It follows that we must go for fewer laws and more freedom for businesses, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises, for the less bureaucracy and the fewer the costs that small and medium-sized businesses have to bear, the greater the capacity for job creation.
That is what matters most of all, for we are not talking here about the economy in the abstract, but about the people of the European Union, and that is why I am glad that the President of the Council has just had something to say about young people, for the worst thing of all, in fact, is for young people to have nothing to look forward to, and that is a state of affairs that we must do everything in our power to prevent.
If I may turn to energy policy, we have heard from the Polish Government, which does not demonstrate much commitment to Europe, that it expects European solidarity in matters of energy policy, and I say that they are right to do so, for this European Union is founded upon solidarity.
We need a European energy policy, but what I would also say to the Polish Government is that, if they demand solidarity in this area, we can expect them to display the same solidarity when it comes to the future of the elements, the substance, and the principles of the Constitutional Treaty.
Solidarity is not a one-way street, and on it we keep on meeting one another.
We need solidarity with one another for the sake of our European future.

As my time is up, let me make one final observation: perhaps we have to give some thought as to how this House and the chairmen of its groups can adequately express themselves; they do not need as long as the President of the Council and the President of the Commission, but we must share out the time properly.
Mr President, this House has just welcomed Alexander Milinkevich.
It was my group that expressly invited him to be here today.
While we debate energy and the economy, we must never lose sight of the foundations on which we stand, namely our values, human rights and human dignity, which are the reason why we are taking a stand for democracy in Belarus, and it is our doing so that makes our defence of human rights in Europe, and around the world, convincing.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Mr President of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, if we are going to assess the European Council, there are things to be said in its favour, for, the last time it met, it showed evidence of possessing the will to revitalise the European project, and that is something that we note with approval.
Before the last meeting of the Council, Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, the President of the Party of European Socialists, submitted on its behalf a plan of action for growth and employment that we had drafted together with the socialist ministers of the economy and finance.
At the heart of this action plan is the use of state investment and public expenditure as means of stimulating private spending, the very same thing that you spoke of when you said that the available resources of the European Investment Bank would be used to this end.
That is a good socialist approach, and, in taking it, you can count on our support.
As regards energy policy â and this is a topic to which I should like to return, since it is at the heart of your report on the European Council â it is indeed the case that we need a single European strategy for it, and the first thing to be noted when we consider one is that the Member States decide their energy policy for themselves.
Please allow me to reiterate this point.
You have again told how, at the moment that Russia turned the gas tap off, you were at the New Yearâs Concert, sitting next to the German Federal Chancellor.
Now I do not know whether there is a cause-and-effect relationship at work here, but that is something we can disregard.
Perhaps you could do me a favour and say to her, not at the next New Yearâs Concert, but the next time you meet her: âAngela, do as I do and leave energy policy aloneâ.
As far as nuclear power is concerned, that is the right thing to do, and you will get a lot of support for doing it, not only from people in your own country, but also in Germany.
The crucial issue is about how we apply solidarity to our handling of energy policy.
This is something that the Council has to decide, and it cannot follow the example of Buridanâs ass, which stood between two piles of hay and ended up starving to death because it did not know which one it should eat from.
It is of that that the European Council reminds me in almost every area, for the problem is always the same.
We hear the Council making fine statements about what Europe has to do, and when its members â your fellow Heads of State or Government â go home, they forget the undertakings they gave to Europe and answer only to their national publics.
There you see the European crisis in a nutshell; that is what our institutions have to overcome together.
The European Parliament is playing its part in this.
We have put together a decent services directive â the adoption of which by the Commission was announced yesterday â and I regard one of the highpoints of the last Council meeting as being the Councilâs unanimous statement that they would make that, too, one of the planks of their common position.
That is a good sign.
It shows that Europe â under this Houseâs leadership â is making headway.
It is an unfortunate fact that this cannot be left to the Council and the Commission alone, and so we will carry on biting at your heels.
One final comment, Mr SchÃŒssel: I have to agree that everything looks good around the middle; the Austrian Presidency is doing a good job.
Today, again, you made a number of remarks â and you know perfectly well to what I am referring â in which you alluded to certain aspects of what needs to be done over the coming weeks.
All in all, you are a smart operator: you assured MrÂ Berlusconi that you were willing to help him save Europe from Communism, only then to meet with MrÂ Prodi a couple of hours later.
You know how to balance different interests in such a way that it works to your benefit.
If we can all make good use of that skill for the good of the European Union, then we will be right behind you.
Â Â  . Mr President, the cynics in Liberal Democrat ranks would say of last monthâs Council that it could have been worse.
Congratulations to the Austrians for avoiding a row.
The Presidency conclusions were, as so often, pledges of economic reform in directly inverse proportion to acts of economic reform.
But the optimists among our number note that the tone of these Presidency conclusions is different.
As Mark Twain said of Wagnerâs music: âItâs not as bad as it sounds.â
Even socialist prime ministers have accepted that the game is up, that the market has to come in to give us growth and prosperity.
All Council members accepted that environment policyÂ can make an important contribution to jobs and growth.
We are making progress and, combined with the prospect of an interinstitutional agreement on the financial perspectives and the economic growth that we now foresee, there is hope again for our Union.
I welcome in particular the Commissionâs decision this week to mount legal challenges to those flouting the rules of liberalisation, because that is the kind of action that we need from the Commission to make progress.
The European Union is remarkably resilient.
Progress may not be made in one area, but it springs up somewhere else: an energy policy for Europe, a good step forward; or more countries wanting to join the eurozone.
The drive for common endeavour may come now from the challenges from outwith, rather than conviction from within.
But I hope that the Austrian Presidency and the Finnish Presidency that follows it can take this new spirit forward and help us to reconstruct a constitutional basis on which to build our Union for the future.
My Group believes it is time to drop the focus of the spring Council on economic reform.
You need three Councils a year.
You need to discuss other issues â important issues such as Belarus.
You could have discussed, as proposed by some Member States, the issue of GuantÃ¡namo Bay, where EU residents are still kept.
An unwillingness to upset the Americans prevented you from doing so.
Let us see a bit more European spirit coming out of these Councils.
Let us start to rebuild the Union with the active involvement of Member States.
Too often in recent years we have seen in Rome, in Paris, in London and even in Berlin attempts to unpick the Community method, to pull Europe apart at the seamsÂ â national capitals that risk enhancing global anarchy in the name of preserving national sovereignty.
I was very surprised to see you, Mr SchÃŒssel and MrÂ Poettering, and all of the glitterati of the European Peopleâs Party in Rome, supporting the re-election campaign of a Prime Minister who has undermined Europeâs values at every turnÂ ...
frustrating progress in judicial cooperation, even judicial proceedings; overstepping the borders of propriety, of a free and independent media, or even of electoral systems; using the Presidency of the EU to embrace Vladimir Putin, ignoring Russiaâs actions in Chechnya.
The European Peopleâs Party claims to be pro-European.
That is hardly the action of a pro-European party.
If the Italians vote wisely on Sunday there will be a pro-European government in Rome and perhaps it can work together with the new government in Berlin to re-establish the equilibrium that we need in our Union and start to put Europe back on an even keel.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, MrÂ Barroso, MrÂ SchÃŒssel, MrÂ Winkler, MrÂ Barrot, I would not wish to provoke MrÂ Schulz into taking the floor again by pointing out to him that my group could certainly agree with the last remarks made by MrÂ Watson on the Italian situation.
That being said, MrÂ Barroso rightly pointed out that the people expect results and that the European Unionâs legitimacy comes from the obligation to provide results.
We need instruments and resources first, however.
In this respect, allow me to turn to MrÂ SchÃŒssel and the Council â since we are, in fact, debating the Councilâs conclusions â and put three proposals to him.
My first proposal concerns the EU budget, which was discussed a short while ago.
I believe that it must simply be repeated that this budget is insufficient and inconsistent from the perspective of the Lisbon objectives.
The proposals currently on the table are EURÂ 110Â billion below the figure proposed by Parliament and EURÂ 200Â billion below the figure proposed by the Commission.
My first suggestion is that we therefore need to speed up the work on the European Unionâs own resources, as you yourself pointed out.
The second suggestion concerns the role of the European Investment Bank.
I believe that what has been decided is interesting, MrÂ SchÃŒssel.
EURÂ 30Â billion is all well and good, but ten times that amount is actually needed, according to economistsâ estimates.
From that perspective, I believe that the Council ought not to paint itself into a corner and agree to open a debate on the European government bonds.
We must harness the savings of the general public in Europe in order to finance both sustainable transport networks and eco-efficiency.
To begin with, this could be done in the context of the eurozone: the Council conclusions refer to this.
I believe that this is an important point.
Finally, here is my third suggestion: I believe that the debate within the Council on the development of taxation systems in the countries of Europe must genuinely move forward.
As you are well aware, in the next 20 years we will be faced with the problem of funding social security systems in nearly every country in Europe.
If we continue not to take decisive measures enabling tax to be charged on mobile bases, including at European level â which, I might add, brings us back to the issue of own resources â then the present situation will endure, with greater inequalities in the distribution of incomes together with an increase in the number of poor people that social safety nets will no longer manage to support.
There you have three suggestions, MrÂ SchÃŒssel, and I would hope that the Council, under your Presidency and under subsequent Presidencies, will look into these types of proposal.
Â Â  . â Looking at the conclusions of this Spring Conference and comparing them with what is actually happening in our economies and our societies, the only conclusion one can draw is that the gap between the policies and the citizens is widening.
Where are the practical measures to address the need to double economic growth and jobs with rights in order to reach the levels of 2000?
Where are the responses to unemployment, which has reached 18.5% of young people of working age under 25 and around 10% of women of working age?
Where are the responses to the growth in unstable, poorly paid work, at a time when 32% of employed women work only part time and over 43% of employed young people only have a temporary contract, without any future prospects?
The truth is that the only responses put forward have been the few vague commitments in terms of jobs, without any reference to the quality of that work or the practical measures to achieve this, and this is the most glaring symptom of the increasing tensions in a number of EU countries.
It is particularly shocking that there have been no responses to poverty, which affects over 15% of the population, and that poverty has not been deemed a serious violation of human rights.
Social inclusion should therefore be at the top of the political agenda of the Commission, the Council and the Member States, and this is simply not the case at the moment.
I should therefore like to propose a challenge.
What is needed is a change of direction, whereby the accent is placed on economic and social cohesion policies.
Â Â  . Mr President, I wish to thank the President-in-Office, as well as President Barroso, for their contributions here today.
However, I wish to begin by saying that I absolutely deplore the way this House has been used this morning, in this debate, to fight national political elections.
If we in Parliament cannot show enough maturity to deal with the real issues of the European Summit and the European Council, rather than going back to basic party political bickering between different individuals, then it is a sad reflection on this House.
In fact, a lot of positive things have come out of the European Council meeting that we should be promoting very strongly, in particular the commitments given to increasing employment opportunities and increasing the amount of money to be put into research and development; assisting in the expansion of the lifelong learning and education and training programmes; utilising the resources available to the European Investment Bank to kick start small and medium-sized enterprises, to give them an opportunity to create the jobs and to create the economic wealth and growth which is necessary within the European Union.
The overall new policies that we are trying to work towards include a common energy system, where we recognise, of course, the rights of the Member States to deal with their own energy issues, but also see where those individual Member States can cooperate with each other to guarantee minimum resources as regards safety and security, with regard to interconnection and to guaranteeing the proper use of funding for research and development as regards new renewable energies and in particular on biofuels.
In our desire to help the environment, whilst at the same time reducing our dependence on imported fuels, we could use new energy crops to run all of our public transport in the European Union, if we so wished.
We could use solar energy to heat our houses, if we so wished.
We could use biomass to heat factories, schools and hospitals, if we so wished.
However, that requires us to make an investment to guarantee that the technology is available for all and, through our taxation, to give preference to energies that are less damaging to the environment, as we did with the introduction of unleaded petrol many years ago.
Looking at the positive side, yesterday we saw where Parliament can respond.
With regard to the services directive and the financial perspectives, Parliament is willing to act as a political body to ensure that it can deliver on behalf of the European citizens, in cooperation with the other institutions.
However â and this is the downside â when we speak about small and medium-sized enterprises and encouraging greater growth in research and development, and put forward the wonderful idea of a European institute for technology and expertise, the one thing that is missing in all of that is a proper EU legal framework for the protection of intellectual property rights, because companies and businesses will not invest in R[amp]D unless they are guaranteed protection for their ideas.
We have failed miserably in the European Union to put in place a proper legal framework to allow that money to be utilised alongside the public funding that is available.
We have delivered on our commitments, we must now ensure that we can deliver on our future promises for the future generations in Europe.
Â Â  â Mr President, we have heard certain things from the President of the Commission.
I will comment on the phrase he used, when he said that we need to get past nationalistic reflexes; of course he used the word 'nationalistic' to make national reflexes sound scary.
But did we not teach national reflexes to the peoples of Europe at the time when communism and internationalisation reigned supreme?
In the face of the internationalisation of communism, we cultivated national reflexes in the people.
We named the League of Nations 'League of Nations', not 'League of States'; we named the United Nations Organisation 'United Nations Organisation', not 'Organisation of United States', precisely in order to cultivate national reflexes.
Now we are telling them to abolish these reflexes, precisely because we need to serve the globalisation which is the other face of internationalisation.
That is the truth, and when you talk about a common energy policy, it means that you are committing the states to not being able to have their own national energy policy.
If they do not have their own national energy policy, it means that they cannot have better relations with the Gulf States, which have oil, or with Russia, which has energy.
Consequently, you are taking all the peoples, all the states hostage and, of course, the people understand that and that is why they react.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the improvement of Europeâs economy and of its citizensâ standard of living depends on all the economic entities acquitting themselves well on the global market.
This requires all the somewhat sluggish European institutions to work efficiently.
It also calls for available resources to be focused on internal reforms.
Legal provisions and internal operating procedures must be adjusted to current needs.
Accordingly, I call for the changes proposed by the President to be adopted by urgent procedure.
I would like to emphasise that the Financial Perspective is not as good as it could be, and that there is considerable shortfall affecting various sectors of the economy.
These matters should be dealt with at the earliest opportunity.
Issues relating to many sectors of the economy such as agriculture should simply be dealt with by urgent procedure, as is the case for energy, amongst others.
This would enable Europeâs economy to develop satisfactorily in future.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr President of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, we can all feel it in our bones: these are good times for the European Union.
The services directive and the Financial Perspective are coming up to the finishing post, the Presidencyâs record for the first half of its term is a good one, and there are plenty of winners, including SMEs, young people, the trans-European network projects, and much else besides.
Let us remind ourselves: the Summit a year ago was a flop, with its debates dominated by accusations and counter-accusations, and everyone saying that the EU was in crisis.
Half a year ago, the Summit was rejected; the EU seemed paralysed, with little to show for itself, and a large majority in this House repudiated what emerged from the December summit.
What, then, is happening today?
Our Parliament has demonstrated its capacity for driving things forward; none of the three institutions has thrown in the towel, and the Council is once more capable of negotiating and getting the job done.
Together, we have brought the EU back on course; we can all feel that in our bones.
We cannot â and I certainly do not want to â separate this success from the Councilâs Presidency and from its President, Wolfgang SchÃŒssel.
His experience, his professionalism, his way of working, his habit of taking action rather than making speeches, has brought us all together and made todayâs result possible.
For that we are grateful, and we Austrians can take pride in it.
The Financial Perspective has involved the reallocation of a total of EURÂ 7.9 billion; together with what came out of the Summit, the services directive provides us with the most potent programme for growth and job creation in the EU for years.
There is more work to be done on it, so that what we have set ourselves we may actually bring to pass.
Â Â  â Mr President, I shall try to stick to the facts.
One fact is that there has certainly been some progress on the energy policy front, at any rate as far as the last Council is concerned, but what we have to concern ourselves with now, Mr President-in-Office, is its implementation.
What I would like to see is a lot more thought given to implementation and infrastructure.
Reference has already been made to Poul Rasmussen and his initiative.
On Monday, we adopted the directives on the Trans-European energy networks; we now have to get our hands on the money for them.
Since there is too little for that purpose in the European Budget, we must find national budgets that will contribute their share.
You said that we are all in the same boat, and that everyone has to row; I do not see everyone bent over the oars just yet, but I hope that will happen.
As regards the foreign policy elements â and this is something I would like to address to the Commission â we have been making this demand ever since the Commission was appointed, ever since it took office.
It is late in coming, but it is on the way, and I hope that we will get some statements in this half of the year.
The President of the Council is right to say that our atomic energy policy is a matter for the nation states.
While I do of course endorse the Austrian approach, the issues of safety and of proliferation, along with the comeback that atomic energy is making, will have major roles to play, and that is where I would like to see more being done.
Science and research: the list included with the Council conclusions is actually a sad one.
Two countries â Sweden and Finland â are way out in front, and it is thanks to them that we hit the 3% mark.
Nor, alas, is even Austria far enough advanced to reach 3%.
In this respect, too, we all need to pull on the oars, particularly those of us with higher incomes and greater economic clout, who must row more strongly, so that we achieve the 3% we have aimed for.
My last remark has to do with the services directive.
I am grateful for your support.
This will be an essential element in the social Europe, provided that we can get it through this House and that you can get it through the Council.
That is quite crucial.
Although you referred to the employers, you did not mention the employers in the cooperative sector â which is itself of vital importance â or, in particular, the employeesâ representative organisations, which have done much to bring about the social Europe.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is true to say that this spring summit has not been a failure, but it did repeat certain errors of the past that I regard as worthy of criticism.
Promising the creation of 10 million jobs was, after all, strongly reminiscent of the first Lisbon summit.
The emphasis on youth was something else that tended towards the rhetorical, and, to judge by the French example, the young do not appear to have taken much notice of it.
I regard the globalisation fund as a reward for those who reject reform; fostering structural change is what the structural and cohesion policies are there for.
Mr Schulz is also right to say that the Member States would not pull their weight.
At an energy summit held in Berlin yesterday, everything was up for discussion except the opening up of the electricity and gas markets.
Not a lot is to be expected of the Member States on this front, and so it is all the more encouraging that the Commission is at last rejoining the fray and instituting proceedings against the Member States, not least the French, in respect of their protectionism on the energy markets.
The necessary response, then, is not to do as in the past and make promises, but to make more competition possible, and the fact that the Commission is at last doing something about this gives cause for hope.
I would like to add that I believe we should be conducting this debate in Brussels rather than in Strasbourg.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe needs a new energy and transport policy.
What I would say to Mr SchÃŒssel is that it is yet to be seen whether opting for 20% more energy efficiency and 15% renewable energies amounts to a breakthrough.
For my own part, I am convinced that the most important thing about this is that we need, in transport and energy, a new culture, so what do I mean by that?
If it is indeed efficiency that we want, we need to forge an alliance with artisans and banks in order, at last, to make headway with our stock of buildings.
We need an alliance with the major cities in order to make our cities, once more, welcoming and pleasant places in which to live; we need less traffic and to be mobile while consuming less oil.
The reason why this initiative does not, I think, do sufficient justice to this is that the Commission relies too much on big business rather than on an alliance with small and medium-sized businesses and the general public.
I have three specific questions that I would like Chancellor SchÃŒssel to answer.
The first has to do with research into energy.
How do you propose to explain to the Austrian public and to Austrian small and medium-sized businesses the fact that we, in the fifth research programme, will be spending, or intend to spend, five times as much on nuclear power than on renewables?
How, too, do you propose to carry on a debate about nuclear issues in Austria and Europe when Mr Barroso has deleted any reference to âriskâ as regards the atom from the Green Paper?
I have to tell him that an ideology-free debate is one in which we also discuss the risks associated with things nuclear.
It is with you, Mr SchÃŒssel, that responsibility rests for our having an objective debate, and you cannot simply retreat and shelter behind national independence.
Â Â  â Mr President, if we take the twin-track approach to the Lisbon Strategy â considering it once as part of the budget and again through the national plans â then it does indeed get me wondering whether the compromise for which we are currently striving in the context of the European budget will really be enough to make the necessary resources available.
I say that it will not, any more than will the national budgets, if you care to take a look at those.
The funds that are needed for research and development, for training and education, are quite simply not being raised as they should be.
At your summit, you said that more needs to be done for the small and medium-sized business sector, and you were right to do so, but, if I want to do something for the small and medium-sized business sector, if I want to create jobs, then I have to do something to bring about an increase in public investment, and it is an unfortunate fact that that is not increasing, not in the Member States.
I have to do something to build up domestic demand, and you cannot do that by cutting incomes, by trying to extend peopleâs working lifetimes, by substituting private insurance schemes for social security systems founded upon the principle of solidarity.
That is precisely the wrong way to go about it.
Instead, we need to replace the Lisbon Strategy with a strategy of European solidarity and sustainability.
Just take a look at the results.
The risk-of-poverty threshold has not changed; it stood at 16% in 2000, and that is the level it is at today.
During the same period, long-term unemployment has risen from 3.9% to 4.1%.
The percentage of people in work has risen from 63% to 64%, which represents a slight improvement.
We are a very long way from what we undertook to achieve, and the reason for that is that the strategy is wrong.
This Lisbon Strategy in its present form will get us nowhere.
Â Â  Mr President, today, we are looking back on the results of the spring summit, yet another meeting of Heads of Government that has borne no fruit whatsoever.
The Netherlands has already made the suggestion that two European summits per annum for decision-making are quite sufficient; I would argue in favour of abolishing these talking summits, because the promises made appear impossible to fulfil upon the return home.
I only need to mention France in order to prove my point.
French energy companies are carrying out foreign take-overs, but the borders remain closed for foreign take-overs in France, and now that the services directive is on hold, foreign workers are also barred.
In that way, one step forward is accompanied by two steps back.
In this context, the riots in France are a demonstration of how difficult it is to reform the social system.
The Lisbon process is running aground in the protest of the electorate.
We will need to drive home to protectionist France too, though, that the social system is untenable without reforms.
The EU may no longer tolerate Franceâs braking effect.
If a European summit of Heads of Government were to come to a decision to that effect and to enforce it, then its meeting would be wholly justified.
Â Â  Mr President, I have read through the conclusions of the March sitting of the European Council in detail, and I must say that I am very disappointed.
They are superficial throughout and above all hypocritical.
The European Council acknowledges in the conclusions the exceptional importance of creating a more favourable entrepreneurial environment and praises small and medium-sized enterprises as the backbone of the European economy, speaking of the need to support them and to support entrepreneurship generally, but unfortunately this is only a paper exercise.
The European Council has missed a unique opportunity to proceed from words to actual deeds.
I was expecting the politicians to find the courage to support the Commissionâs original proposals regarding services in the internal market, especially the principle of country of origin, and that the Council would thus give clear signals that it really was thinking seriously about developing the entrepreneurial environment.
That did not happen, however.
The Council opted for the emasculated and populistic proposals of this Parliament and ended up doing nothing whatsoever for small and medium-sized enterprises apart from issuing words of encouragement.
I cannot see this being the path to fulfilment of the Lisbon Strategy and greater competitiveness.
Â Â  â From my point of view, the challenges that Europe faces today were correctly identified by the European Council: globalisation, the demography question, key sectors of the European economy such as energy and services, research and development, innovation, education, jobs and growth.
Yet what is the feeling that one is left with?
While on the one hand notable progress has been made in the field of energy â progress that six months ago would have seemed unthinkable â there have been other areas in which sadly we have not gone as far.
Why is that?
It is because the Lisbon Strategy committed the cardinal sin of not giving the Commission the responsibility for implementing, and being the focal point for, this strategy.
The Commission has now made an effort and this is why progress has been made.
Much more must be done, however.
The Member States must give the Commission that responsibility and the resources to facilitate this much-needed progress.
In this regard, I must say that we wholeheartedly welcome the support given to the European Institute of Technology.
After all, it makes no sense to have 25 European research policies that are not geared towards the key objective of the knowledge-based economy and that still lack the resources and the critical mass to be able to compete with other more developed economies.
Consequently, if we wish to send out a clear message today that the Lisbon Strategy is alive and if we want it to be implemented quickly, we must give the Commission the resources to enable it to get the European Institute of Technology up and running, which to my mind would be a very important step.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the people of France will remember two things about the Council.
The first is that when a Frenchman speaks English, the President leaves the room.
The second is that when a journalist asks him if a promulgated law should be applied, the answer is âyesâ in Brussels and ânoâ in Paris.
âYou had better get used to this, no matter how hard you workâ: that is what the people of France have taken away with them.
Trouble is brewing in this country; in the space of ten months it has been subjected to three revolts: the first one manifested itself in votes cast at the ballot boxes and expressed a form of hostility towards capitalism; the second one manifested itself in the riots in our suburbs and expressed a form of revolt against discrimination; and the third one manifested itself in strikes and demonstrations and expressed a form of revolt against all the insecurities linked to employment.
From that, I deduce â and forgive me for talking a little more about my country â that, for your next Council more than for this one, and irrespective of what you did there, there is an aspiration that needs to be fulfilled, namely mutual trust.
Our fellow citizens felt that there was much more of an âevery man for himselfâ attitude during that period.
France must take on its share of the responsibility for this, because it is no stranger to that kind of attitude, but it is not the only one.
We therefore need confidence, and trust in each other as befits its Latin roots.
The Commission and the Council must follow this path.
Another aspect relates to protection because, in a way, our fellow citizens fear that Europe does not protect them enough.
Good luck!
Â Â  â Mr President-in-Office of the Council and Mr President of the Commission, you are celebrating and patting yourselves on the back.
You are very happy with the results of the spring summit.
Do you believe that European citizens feel the same?
I do not think so, because the reform of the Lisbon Strategy which you are promoting sacrifices cohesion and the environment to a neo-liberal version of competitiveness.
This is precisely what the famous term 'flexicurity' describes.
After five years of failure, you are setting ambitious targets, with binding timetables for jobs, research, energy and growth; at the same time, the budget is characterised by extreme euro-stinginess and a lack of ambition.
With what resources and what policies are you going to achieve these targets, when crucial sectors, such as the Structural Funds, the trans-European networks, consumer and health policy, research and education are suffering from drastic cutbacks in resources?
Do you believe that you will achieve the targets you have set?
My political group does not believe you will and that is why it disagrees with your policy.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the European establishment has a shocking habit of using acts of terrorism, natural disasters, political crises and economic shocks for its political purposes.
Peopleâs legitimate anger, their anxiety and their political commitment are exploited in order to carry on the fight for a European superstate.
That is why we have often been forced, here in this Chamber, to listen to endless numbers of speeches inspired by terrorist acts in Madrid and London, the tsunami disaster in the Indian Ocean or the risks of war in the Middle East.
The speakers, including the President himself, have often shamelessly used these tragic and fateful events to promote a hidden agenda: the fight for a European superstate.
Now Europeâs energy supply is heading for a crisis, and it is the same old story.
The 25 ladies and gentlemen of the European Council do not have a clue how energy technology and politics will look in ten yearsâ time.
They should not, therefore, establish percentages for biofuels and renewable energy.
The individual countries must themselves experiment and seek solutions in a free energy market.
The EUâs task is to maintain a free energy market and coordinate investments in infrastructure.
Â Â  Mr President, the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, has mentioned ageing and globalisation as two of our key challenges.
It is important that we should put the former at the very top of the political agenda.
The ageing of the population in Europe is, in fact, not so much a challenge as a life-threatening problem, not only in terms of keeping our social security systems, and therefore our economies, intact, but also, quite simple, of securing the continued existence of European peoples.
Moreover, solutions are sometimes put forward that only make matters worse, in fact.
Just think of the plea for fresh, large-scale immigration.
The Commission has published a Green Paper in a bid to explore this route.
Whilst this may serve the short-term interests of some companies or industries, you can certainly not count on public support for it.
The problems are already incalculable as it is.
If the EU wishes to alienate itself from the public even more, then it should go down this route.
A real solution is to encourage young families to have more children, and to create a favourable climate for this.
If that is not done, the Lisbon objectives are nothing but empty words.
Â Â  Mr President, given the great expectations during the weeks prior to the Spring Council, with regard to the possibility of creating a common energy policy, the Councilâs conclusions in this field are, on the one hand, hopeful, but, on the other, disappointing.
They are hopeful in the sense that, for the first time, a Council text includes a paragraph dedicated exclusively to the launch of the common energy policy, because it stresses issues on which the European Parliament has been insisting for a long time, such as the correct application of the existing directives, the need for the Member States to fulfil their commitments in the field of interconnections, the lack of investments in infrastructures and in research and development, and the need to complete the internal energy market: a series of proposals that we hope the Member States will comply with as soon as possible.
Let us face facts, however.
Once again, the Council has shown a lack of vision and ambition in the crucial field of energy.
With the exception of a couple of issues, such as the need to speak with one voice on the world stage and the possible creation of a solidarity mechanism to deal with situations of crisis, the other measures are already provided for in various directives in force and in agreements from previous summits.
Furthermore, we need a frank discussion amongst Heads of State or Government on the political obstacles that certain governments are placing in the way of the proper operation of the internal energy market.
Conclusions advocating the creation of a single market cannot be signed when, at the same time, national champions are being proclaimed and a form of protectionism which seriously harms the process of integration is being implemented.
I shall end, Mr President, by telling the Council that we are pleased with its proposal that the existing obligations should be complied with, but disappointed that it lacks the political courage to establish a genuine common energy policy, which this House and the European Commission are calling for and which the Union urgently needs, because its future depends on it.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I have three messages for you.
I would like firstly to thank the European Council and Chancellor SchÃŒssel in particular for supporting the Spanish Government at the beginning of the long process of overcoming terrorism following the ceasefire announced by the terrorist group ETA.
Thank you very much.
Secondly, I welcome the fact that the European Council has accepted the Hispano-Swedish initiative of a pact for gender equality, which is one of the most important areas of progress in Europe.
Thirdly, I shall comment on the energy policy.
At last we are beginning to talk about energy policy, but, rather than attacking protectionism, what we need to do is to create energy policy, and we must begin by creating what in English is known as a level playing field.
There are currently two liberalised markets in Europe, which are the United Kingdom and Spain.
What we need to do is to put an end to fortress walls and create European policy.
As well as preaching to others, the Commission must do its duties.
It would be interesting, for example, to know what the Commission thinks, from a European point of view, about the Baltic gas pipeline and European solidarity.
Furthermore, having accepted Parliamentâs views on the Directive on the liberalisation of services, the Commission should offer us a directive on services of general economic interest.
Because we are not talking about a market, but about utilities and companies providing public services, and the Commission is obliged to do its duty.
Â Â  I would like to bring up two points: Europe has, and will continue to have, an urgent need for energy.
However, due to pressure on the part of the European Union and because of a weak national government, Slovakia will have to shut down two units of the nuclear power station at JaslovskÃ© Bohunice by 2008.
Given the safety features of those units, they could very well remain in operation until at least 2015.
Slovakia will be receiving only a fraction of the money needed for the shutdown of these units from EU funds.
This year, two new automobile plants of Europe-wide significance are scheduled to come on stream in Slovakia.
As a result, the transport system will be struggling to meet the needs associated with delivering supplies and shipping finished products.
However, under the long-term financial perspective, the European Union is reducing the resources available for trans-European networks by EUR 20 billion.
This will do nothing to further the trust of Slovakiaâs citizens in EU policy.
Â Â  Mr President, I begin by welcoming the firm stand of the Council on the situation in Belarus and the sanctions that have been agreed.
On the Lisbon Agenda, I welcome many of the Presidency conclusions but, sadly, Europe has yet to find an answer to its underlying economic malaise.
Governments find it easy to sign declarations of intent but harder to put into practice what they profess.
On the services directive, I admit I am unhappy with the Council compromise.
I have always urged the British Government and the Council to go further in a liberalising direction, but my words have fallen on deaf ears.
Mr Blair talks the talk; he says he is leading the way and that the rest of Europe is falling into line, but I think he deludes himself â and not for the first time.
A truly liberalising services directive would be the most fundamental sign of Europe reforming, which it desperately needs to do now and not at some vague date in the future.
The most disappointing aspect of the Council was, however, the fundamental failure of leaders to speak forcefully on the rising tide of protectionism.
We expected to hear something â at least a memorandum â from Mr Berlusconi, as he seems to have spoken on every other subject recently, and from Mr Blair.
But what happened?
The Council meeting could have made clear its determination to fight the protectionist threat to Europeâs prosperity and the functioning of the single market.
It was the perfect time to seize the high ground and it failed to do so.
Again, it is left to President Barroso to make the case.
I congratulate him on his continuing determination on this issue.
Last week in Florence he said that national governments were giving in to populist temptations.
I agree.
It is time to consider what action should be taken against those who seek to attack the basic rules of the single market.
I also congratulate Mr Barroso on the action he took yesterday to clamp down on energy giants in Europe, which are using their industrial muscle to hinder competition and distort the market.
This legal action against those who are trying to restrict an open European energy market will be welcomed by all those of us who believe in free markets and the completion of the single market.
Â Â  I should like to welcome a delegation of Father Christmases to the public gallery.
It is slightly out of season â I hope you are going to behave yourselves!
At least you are wearing the right colours for this morning â red and white, just like me.
Â Â  Mr President, we have reached the mid-term stage of the Lisbon Strategy, with a conspicuous lack of success so far.
The Unionâs priority must now be innovation in its broadest sense, together with investment in knowledge. This will lead to economic growth and increased employment.
It is therefore surprising that yet another Council is cutting expenditure on research and on educational programmes.
In some cases the percentages of the cuts are actually in double figures.
How can such decisions be justified?
How is the Union supposed to compete when its economic growth is barely 2% and average unemployment has reached 9%?
The European Unionâs budget has been put on a strict diet, but if it becomes gradually slimmer it will not be able to cope with the needs of an expanding Union.
In addition, an emaciated Europe will not be in a position to compete with the United States, China, and India, whose economies are robust.
The compromise reached yesterday on the negotiations concerning the Financial Perspective is certainly welcome and awakens some slight hope that the Lisbon Strategy will not simply remain on paper but will become a priority aim.
Paradoxically, however, it continues to appear at the end of the list of expenditure, and by that stage funds have usually run out.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I warmly welcome the firm stance adopted in the European Councilâs statement on Belarus, and also the position ChancellorÂ SchÃŒssel presented to the House.
The distinction made by the Council between the Belarusian authorities and Belarusian society is particularly significant.
This important distinction was proposed by the European Parliament as the basis of the Unionâs strategy towards Belarus.
It is not enough, however, just to condemn the fraudulent elections and the use of force, and to call for those imprisoned to be released.
More and more targeted sanctions are needed.
The list of persons banned from entering the Union should be extended and bank accounts frozen.
The European Union and the European Commission in particular are not doing enough for Belarus and they are reacting too slowly.
The Union should be providing much stronger and more specific support to civil society in Belarus.
Belarus should be treated in the same way as Ukraine was in its time.
Firstly, we should call for the fraudulent elections to be held again.
Secondly, a sizeable solidarity fund managed by non-governmental organisations should be set up to support Belarus.
Thirdly, we should call for more than the token effort made to date to ensure that independent television and radio can actually be received in Belarus.
Belarusians themselves should be employed to provide the information broadcast.
Fourthly, the scope of certain Union programmes like the Erasmus student exchange programme should be broadened to include Belarus and its civil society.
Fifthly, and this is my last point, the Union and its Member States should arrange stronger diplomatic representation in Minsk.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I have just two brief observations to make.
Firstly, I am very glad that we succeeded yesterday evening in achieving agreement on the financial framework, so that we now have enough time to allow things to really take off in 2007, with all the programmes being implemented.
We are very confident that you, Mr President of the Commission, will very soon approve and review what the Member States have come up with by way of structural policy, so that we do not waste time.
Since we are talking about the summit, I have a second comment to make; I do not believe that competitiveness can be decreed from on high; it has to grow from the bottom up.
I would of course like to see all the things you, Mr President-in-Office, quite rightly set out this morning brought to life and implemented on a local basis.
It is quite plain to me, when I see how, in Germany today, it still takes between seven and eight weeks to set a business up, because people are sent from pillar to post, that it is on the ground that things have to happen.
I hope that the initiatives you have taken will help to achieve that, and I can tell Mr Schulz that people in Aachen, which is so close to the border, know perfectly well just how uncompetitive German legislation is even in North Rhine Westphalia.
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, grateful though I am for the words of encouragement that have been spoken at the mid-point of the Austrian Presidency, we are not resting on our laurels â in any case, there are none â but want to carry on working hard alongside you.
I would like to make a few brief comments, firstly, on the objectives: What would we like to see?
Should we actually be setting ourselves targets?
To that there is the inevitable criticism along the lines of âwhat about their implementation?â
Or are we not, then, to set ourselves targets?
I tend towards the view that, yes, we should be bold enough to set ourselves definite targets, targets that are capable of being reviewed, notwithstanding the risk of one or other country, or perhaps the whole European Union, failing to achieve what we have set ourselves 100%, but the ten million jobs â 2 million a year â is a realistic target.
In 2005, we managed to create 2 million extra jobs in the European Union, and we can now take pride in the real chance we have now that the economic cycle is in a relatively healthy state and many European countries are beginning an upturn, and this is something we must not talk down.
Yes, of course it will call for national commitment and for funding of infrastructure.
In Austria, for example, we are making a very good job of this, and other countries will do likewise, but the goals are necessary.
To those who have said that the European Council should be done away with altogether, I have to say that I really do think that is the wrong idea.
What we have to do is invest more time and more energy, and that may even mean meeting more often â perhaps with fewer cannon and mortar effects and less media hype â but real work, hard work, is what is needed if we are to get anywhere.
Now for my second topic: A number of speakers have described themselves as less than completely satisfied with the financial perspective, measuring it solely against what the Prodi Commission originally proposed.
Now you are all experts; you know perfectly well that this proposal was not realistic.
It cannot be said that we now have EURÂ 200 billion less than what was proposed then; if you compare that with what we had over the past seven years, there has been an increase of over 100Â billion.
There have, in particular, been enormous increases in those programmes that your honourable House regards as important.
If you take only the example of research and development, provision is made in the budget for an increase in excess of 75% over the next seven-year period.
The amount allocated to the trans-European networks has doubled; that available for lifelong learning has been increased by 50%, so now between 30Â 000 and 40Â 000 more young people virtually right across Europe, have the opportunity to learn.
For the neighbourhood policy, 40% more has been made available; the foreign policy budget has been increased by 250%.
There are two options open to us: either we send the people out there the message that all this is far too little â which they will actually believe, for you, Members of the European Parliament, enjoy a great deal of credibility in your electoral districts â or we can say that this is a great advance, bringing us closer to the targets we have set ourselves, and then they will take that seriously and say, yes, that is a significant step forward.
I repeat: every single one of you knows that, and you are all aware of the position I am in, caught between those who have to pay up and those on the receiving end.
All that has to be extracted from the national budgets, and you know that.
The only solution is a new definition of what is meant by âown resourcesâ; that is the only way to deal with the situation.
Getting this Financial Perspective off the ground in the first place was a great achievement, and for it I would like to thank Mr Barroso, the President of your House and all the groups in it, and the negotiators.
It was not easy, but we do now have the chance to get down to work straight away.
I really do ask for general support, for people, wherever they are, want to hear that we are getting somewhere with things, and not just about the disputes that go on between the groups and between the institutions.
Nobody out there is interested in the question as to whether EURÂ 500 million more could have been found somewhere or whether or not the Council was offering EURÂ 500 million too much.
What matters to them is whether we can now get stuck into the job for the next seven years, in the peopleâs interest and in Europeâs.
I am ready and willing to do so and I very much hope that we will work together on the constitution issue every bit as well, so that we may well not have a solution in place by June, but we will be able to map out a way whereby we will achieve the better legal basis that we all need.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I feel that the key points have already been mentioned, but I should like to offer you a synopsis of my analysis of this debate, which, I note, is broadly supportive of the conclusions of the European Council.
An honest assessment would certainly reveal that these results have overall been welcomed.
It is obvious that not all of the honourable Members are entirely satisfied, because there are naturally differences of opinion.
There can be no denying, however, that we have seen results in the energy sector, in SMEs, in research, in the employment objectives and overall in the new system of governance of the Lisbon Strategy.
Consensus has also been achieved at European Council level as regards the services directive.
As regards energy, I wish to underline that our work has certainly not finished at the European Council and that the results of yesterday's Commission meeting will show you that the Commission is determined to ensure that all of the principles of Community law are upheld: for example, compliance with the principles of the internal market and with competition rules.
This is a vital prerequisite if we want to retain credibility, both within and outside the EU.
As regards SMEs, a particularly important step was the encouragement by the Austrian Presidency and the Commission to reduce the red tape that hampers so many potentially job-creating initiatives by companies.
As for research, for the first time all Member States were able to accept workable research and innovation objectives, and this is extremely important.
Equally important was the broad support for the idea of the European Institute of Technology and for the Commission now having a mandate to put forward a proposal.
The fact that employment objectives were set is also very positive.
I should like to underline one new aspect that arose at this European Council to which Chancellor SchÃŒssel did not allude, but which I feel is worthy of mention.
To some extent we already work in team presidencies.
Chancellor SchÃŒssel, as President-in-Office of the Council, has taken every opportunity to introduce the debate to the Commission, and to the forthcoming Finnish, German, Portuguese and Slovene Presidencies.
I believe this is important in terms of ensuring the continuity and sustainability of the Commissionâs efforts.
The Commission is also able to provide such continuity and consistency over time because, however good the Council presidencies may be, they change every six months.
There needs to be constant effort, which can only happen if the Commission takes the lionâs share of the initiative and if Parliament provides constant support.
These points were positive.
Similarly welcome were the confirmation of the agreement in principle on the services directive, and the news we received last night, or I should say early this morning, on the financial perspective.
I am totally convinced that if we achieve practical results, if we manage to resolve problems on a regular basis, we can take this Europe of projects forward, regain the confidence of our citizens and find a better environment for resolving some of the institutional issues that need to be resolved.
I therefore feel that we can look forward more positively to the June European Council, which of course will not be able to resolve the constitutional question, but which will certainly be able to point the way forward towards defining Europeâs future.
The Commission is working actively with the Council to this end and we hope to be able to make a worthwhile contribution.
With this team spirit, this spirit of partnership, Europe can and must move ahead.
Â Â  â Mr President, I want to raise a point of order.
Mr Farage does not appear to be in the Chamber.
Might it not be that the United Kingdom Independence Party are seated up in the gallery?
Â Â  I have been informed that the Father Christmases are from Denmark.
The debate is closed.
Â Â  We expect a great deal â sometimes too much â of the European Councils.
The one that was recently held at the end of March was mainly devoted to the economic aspects of European integration.
Europe is faced with a major problem, the scale and urgency of which was demonstrated by the Russia-Ukraine crisis in January: the absence of a common energy policy.
Several countries have worked particularly hard on this issue that is crucial to our countriesâ independence, including France, which proposed a memorandum that was the subject of a broad consensus.
The European Council launched an ambitious strategy promoting a secure, competitive and sustainable energy supply for Europe.
This is a major step forward, to which we must now give concrete expression.
The Spring European Council also decided to double the European research and innovation budgetary effort over the 2007/2013 period.
This is essential for the competitiveness of our economies and therefore for Europeâs place in the world faced with the presence of developing countries.
At the same time, the European Council made official the creation of a Globalisation Adjustment Fund, which was widely sought after by our fellow citizens.
Europe is undoubtedly going through a difficult period, but that must certainly not overshadow the positive signals given by the implementation of instruments of economic progress and of solidarity.
Â Â  Making the European Union the most competitive knowledge-based economy by 2010 involves two priorities, as far as I can see: investing heavily in Research and Development and removing the constraints weighing on businesses, and particularly on the smallest ones.
Despite the improved agreement obtained by the European Parliament, the European budget will not permit these huge investments to be made.
The European Councilâs appeal for the EIB to enhance its R[amp]D efforts is, in this context, an innovative and pragmatic solution, if EURÂ 30Â billion actually can be harnessed in this way.
This measure might not be enough to overcome the chronic deficit in European R[amp]D expenditure, and a great effort is still required if the objective of devoting 3% of GDP to R[amp]D is to be attained.
It is crucial to involve the private sector in this effort, since we can clearly see that public budgets are not enough.
We therefore need to make progress with taxation in order to encourage businesses to invest more readily in R[amp]D.
This purposeful policy is what we are awaiting from the revised Lisbon Strategy, which needs to offer a stimulating, effective and, above all, simplified European regulatory framework for European businesses.
Â Â  We shall proceed to the vote.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to raise a point of order on the basis of RuleÂ 170(4) and RuleÂ 150(3) of the Rules of Procedure.
It concerns the calendar and the PPE-DE Groupâs amendment to the calendar.
On the basis of these Rules, I would like to postpone the vote on that amendment to the next part-session because I would like to reopen the political discussion about our working methods in this Parliament.
As we all know, the fact that we have to travel between our work office and our actual seat here makes life somewhat difficult.
I myself, especially this week, have found it incredibly difficult to get here and consequently I have missed a vote.
Therefore some of the Members of this House, including myself, have drafted this motion to postpone the vote.
We would also like to ask the Conference of Presidents to reopen the discussion about amendments to the calendar.
Â Â  Mr President, this week we have debated the issue of better regulation.
One of the biggest obstacles to better regulation is our calendar of meetings.
We have 12 weeks a year of plenary sittings here in Strasbourg.
Frequently there is insufficient business for those plenaries, so we pad out the agenda.
As a result of that, the committee meetings are constantly under pressure and those codecision committees are now unable to legislate effectively.
We need to have a debate about how we organise our work.
This calendar has been introduced without any such debate.
We would like to postpone the vote on this calendar to the next plenary session, so that those of us who have tabled this motion can debate our working methods, that is to say, how we can improve regulation in the European Parliament and how we can better use the EURÂ 300 million it costs us to be here for the pursuit of better regulation.
This is a huge use of taxpayersâ money which undermines the work of this Parliament.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if there is an alternative to Strasbourg, I am all in favour of discussing it; that is what I have always said, but using this as a way of doing so is absurd and unfair.

It must surely be plain to see that for as long as the Council, unanimously, insists on Strasbourg, we shall have twelve part-sessions in this place, and whether Mr Titley understands English or German or French, he should simply take a look at the treaties, something that might also sometimes be a salutary exercise for Mr Blairâs Government.
I therefore think that we should have another debate on Strasbourg, but not in this fashion.
What we should do this week is vote on our calendar.
By what, Mr Titley, do you justify your assertion that our orders of business here in Strasbourg are not full?
You should just try standing in for Mr Schulz in the Conference of Presidents and then you would know that what you claim is a bare-faced lie and bears no relation to the facts.
Â Â  . Mr President, in the light of a declaration put on the record of this House last night by the Commission, during the plenary debate on the regulation on certain fluorinated gases, the text of which was not introduced during conciliation, and which compromises the spirit of the conciliation agreement and shows great disrespect and disregard for the clear will of Parliament and the Council, I should like to request a postponement of the vote on the two reports on fluorinated gases, at least until tomorrow.
Â Â  â Mr President, my group would very much welcome that as a way of enabling us to sort matters out by tomorrow, but if they are not, a further postponement will be necessary.
We should, at any rate, be able to make good use of the time.
Â Â  . Mr President, I requested the postponement of the vote on the two reports on fluorinated gases.
They have been taken together all the way through and I believe it would be more consistent to keep them together.
Â Â  .
Mr President, I would like to say a few brief words to Parliament, because I am very surprised at the behaviour exhibited by the Chairman of our Committee when yesterday evening he sent everyone an email relating to the vote on my report.
The report was unanimously adopted by the Committee, no one voted against it, and in my opinion this sort of attack by a Chairman against his own Committee is curious, to say the very least, if not extraordinary.
Accordingly, I do hope that Parliament will understand what this is really about and that it will not accept the two amendments tabled by the Chairman.
It would be a great mistake on Parliamentâs part to adopt his Amendments 62 and 63, as they would undermine the notion of active remembrance which is contained in this programme.
Mr President, this course of action is, I think, insulting to our Committee.
Â Â  â Mr President, I should like to clarify the following: I am a member of parliament and I have the right to table amendments in plenary.
That is what I did.
The recommendation and report by Mr Takkula are astounding, but what does our proposal with the two amendments add?
It adds totality.
We cannot only talk of Nazism and Stalinism when, for forty years, Greece, Spain and Portugal had concentration camps in which thousands of people lived for twenty years.
As committee chairman I followed due procedure, but as a member of parliament I have the right to table amendments.
Â Â  That concludes the vote.
The explanations of vote will take place following the formal sitting.
Â Â  Mr President of the Republic of Malta, it is a great pleasure for me to welcome you to the European Parliament today and to offer you the opportunity to speak to its Members, who have been discussing your country at length over recent days.
You are here today as a Head of State, but we are well aware of your long-standing commitment to European integration, as Prime Minister of your country, for many years â the years of Maltaâs journey towards the Union.
Almost three years ago you signed the Accession Treaty, which was the culmination of many years and great efforts leading to Malta becoming a member of the European Union.
It is a very important sign of the consensus that exists today in Malta with regard to European integration the fact that last July, you, your country, your â Maltaâs House of Representatives â ratified the Constitutional Treaty unanimously, and that you did so after others had rejected it, is a very important sign of the consensus that exists today in Malta with regard to European integration.
In doing so, you sent a very clear message at a difficult time for the Union and you put an end to the political divisions that had characterised the debate on Europe in your country.
Your presence here in this Chamber reminds us of something very important: European enlargement has been looking to the East for a long time and now Malta, in the South, is reminding us of our Mediterranean vocation and the need to reinforce our dialogue with the countries of the Mediterranean basin.
Your country is at the crossroads of the Mediterranean and has always been at the centre of policies relating to Europeâs southern borders.
Relations with the countries of the South today are the main geo-political challenge facing Europe and your country in particular, which is on the front line in this encounter; on the front line in terms of the arrival of many human beings who want to come to Europe, often risking their lives, because they see us as a new Eldorado, whose standard of living acts as a magnet to people suffering the most extreme forms of poverty.
We are therefore aware that great numbers of asylum seekers and immigrants are currently reaching Maltaâs shores.
We have been discussing this issue here.
We have listened to the report drawn up by a delegation from the European Parliament that has had the opportunity to visit the camps.
They illustrate the most important challenge facing Europe in terms of defending and protecting human rights and building better relations with its neighbours in the South.
In these special circumstances, Mr President, your visit is very welcome and Parliament therefore has a great interest in hearing what you have to say to us.
Thank you for being here with us.
You have the floor.
Â Â  Mr President, honourable Members of the European Parliament, it is a pleasure as well as an honour for me to address your institution.
As a representative of one of the countries that joined the European Union in 2004, I bring with me recent experience of the meaning of enlargement, both in terms of what a country goes through in preparing for membership of the European Union and in terms of the impact of membership on a new Member State.
My country considers membership of the European Union as a natural return to our home in Europe, where we belong.
We are proud to be part of the family of nations that forms the European Union, with all its spiritual, cultural and humanistic heritage.
Our journey towards membership was not easy.
We had a long and difficult debate leading up to the point, three years ago, when the Maltese people made a clear and sovereign decision in favour of membership by means of a referendum and then of a general election.
This lively debate gave us the opportunity openly and freely to discuss the merits and dangers of membership, while we scrutinised the possible impact of membership not only in economic terms but also in political and social terms.
In this sense, it was an exercise through which we brought Europe closer to the people, and it is an exercise with which we should continue.
The preparations for membership were a burden on those countries that joined during the last enlargement.
It is true that no enlargement on such a scale had ever previously taken place, and never before had candidate countries been asked to implement such huge reforms as part of their preparations for membership.
I wish to congratulate all the new Member States of the European Union for having completed such a difficult process.
I also want in the same way to congratulate the European Union itself on the way it acted as a hugely effective catalyst in encouraging those countries to adopt the reforms.
We often speak of the pessimism that gripped Europe following the two referenda that took place last year and in which the European Constitutional Treaty was rejected.
We fail, however, fully to recognise the European Unionâs enormous success in absorbing the new countries so naturally.
Not only was 2005 not an âannus horribilisâ for Europe, as some said it was.
Rather, it was a great success for Europe, for it showed that Europe was capable of facing the challenge of the greatest enlargement in its history.
We often forget now that enlargement actually took place less than two years ago.
That does not mean that life is easy after enlargement.
On the contrary, it is as difficult for the economy as much as for society to adjust to the reality of membership.
That adjustment requires leaders to take difficult decisions, which are often unpopular.
In fact, it is necessary for a country to take these decisions, whether or not it joins the European Union.
Membership of the European Union simply makes these decisions more real and more exacting, as well as inevitable.
What is certainly wrong is for us to blame Europe for reforms that are unpopular but that, in reality, are the result of decisions that every responsible government must take.
It is a mistake for governments to blame Europe for these difficult decisions and then to take all the credit for the benefits.
Mr President, I also wish to share my thoughts on a number of other issues with you.
I shall start with a few reflections on the European Constitutional Treaty.
We have to accept that there were shortcomings in the way that the Constitutional project was presented, even if the difficulties concerned were really more a matter of form than of substance.
To new Member States, the Constitutional project seemed premature and unduly rushed, for example.
The aspect of timing was a legitimate concern.
Indeed, countries preparing themselves painfully for membership viewed the prospect of a change to the rules of the Treaty as one might a change to the rules of a race just when the finishing line is in sight.
I know that the Constitutional Treaty was supposed to speed up decision-making by the Union of twenty-seven, but the citizens of some of the Member States clearly viewed it differently.
The Union that they had grown up in was altered by the 1995 enlargement and even more by the 2004 one, and in the light of globalisation the Constitutional project appeared to entail never-ending change.
In retrospect, therefore, we can see that we might have been wiser to have given this important project more time and waited not only until the ten new Member States had settled in but also until all twenty-five members had had time to adjust to the new realities of the European Union.
Nevertheless, the issue remains of how to escape from the present impasse.
It goes without saying that the wishes expressed by the people of the two countries that did not accept the Constitutional Treaty have to be respected, but the same could be said of the decisions of the fourteen countries that ratified it.
In my country, for example, the Constitutional Treaty was adopted by our national Parliament unanimously, and thus our commitment to membership became a foregone conclusion and there was a clear-cut end to our divisions.
Now is the time to engage in debate and to share our opinions about the possible scenarios we have before us.
One scenario is to stick to the commitment made by the signatory Heads of State or Government to try to find a solution within the European Council if four-fifths of the Member States ratify the Constitutional Treaty and one or more Member States have difficulty doing so.
This would make it necessary to continue with the ratification procedure.
In that way, it would be possible for the agreed process to continue with a view to our deciding afterwards how to proceed.
Another scenario could include using the first two sections of the Constitutional Treaty to draft a âEuropean Charterâ. This could offer Europeans a clear and concise document with which they could more easily identify.
The other section of the Constitutional Treaty may be considered as having already to a large extent been ratified by the existing Treaties.
Another scenario could include strengthening the protocol concerning the role of the national parliaments. Specifically, the latterâs consultative role in relation to the European project could be extended.
Naturally, there are other options that could be considered, and this period of reflection exists to enable us to do just that.
Let us not waste it.
Mr President, I turn now to the subject of political leadership in Europe.
We often speak of the lack of such leadership.
This is not the result of a lack of initiatives, and definitely not of European initiatives.
If anything, it may be the result of a lack of coherence between initiatives, for how can we expect to have political leadership if some of the initiatives do not hang together?
What sort of coherence do we have when, on the one hand, we insist on solidarity and, on the other, fail to make the necessary financial resources available?
What coherence do we have if, on the one hand, we remove borders and, on the other, create obstacles?
What coherence do we have if we call for a collective effort but then allow countries to face difficulties on their own?
I do not think that a lack of political leadership can be blamed on the Communityâs individual institutions, whose initiatives and perseverance speak for themselves.
Indeed, any lack of confidence in these institutions should be addressed.
Being able to inspire confidence is not like having a particular talent.
It is not something with which we are born, but something that we have to earn.
We thus need to ask ourselves what we can do to win back peopleâs confidence in the European Union and its institutions.
We can do this by once more developing a bond with the people, and in this connection I would praise the work of the Commission which, through Plan D, has taken on the difficult task of bridging the gap between the EU and its citizens.
As an institution elected directly at a European level, the European Parliament is in an ideal position to support the work of the Commission.
It is not more words that are needed in order to form close ties with our citizens.
It is a question of listening more and, if Europe communicates more effectively, it will be in a better position to reflect the aspirations of Europeans and to produce results in all areas of concern to them.
To strengthen confidence, we must not only communicate better but also be more efficient in the sectors to which the European Union is already committed.
We can also build confidence by showing that the European Union is willing and able to engage in new common initiatives in sectors where we face new challenges that cannot be tackled by individual countries on their own.
We have constantly to ensure that the European Union provides more and more value for its Member States and citizens.
More importantly, however, we can increase confidence in the EU by showing that, when adopting policies, taking decisions and acting both internally and externally, the European Union permits the expression of reason.
By this, I mean that it consistently reveals a sense of balance and justice in its political development, in its decision-making and also in its dealings with other countries around the world.
In this regard, there is enough evidence to make me feel optimistic that the Union really can win back peopleâs confidence, as it is evidently prepared to be on the side of reason.
Let me cite a few examples:
Because I come from Malta, I am also an observer of the way in which the European Union tries to find a balance between the interests of large countries and those of small ones.
I have always been convinced that, for the European Union, what counts is not the size of the country you hail from, but the strength of your ideas and the clarity of your vision.
Naturally, size also matters.
The European Union is, however, unique in the way it develops a model for leadership that balances the interests of large and small countries and often combines these interests in a common interest.
Due note should be taken of this particular value conferred by the Union.
It is a virtue that makes Europe what it is: rich in diversity and fully respectful of its Membersâ obvious differences.
It may also explain why small countries feel strong ties to the European project and, specifically, to the Community method.
The European Union increases the influence of small countries.
It strengthens their identity and, especially, their linguistic identity, and it really opens up to them the wide horizons of the rest of Europe and the world.
The European Parliament should also continue to develop this balance and to take account of the particular interests of the small states.
The European Union cannot and should not be a directorate of large countries.
The Services Directive is another example of how the European institutions stand out as the voice of reason.
I praise the work of this Parliament in drafting a compromise on such an important initiative.
The widespread approval enjoyed by the European Council is also a valid testimony to your work.
Now that a functional compromise has been found, it is time for the legislative process to be concluded quickly so that Europeans might reap the real benefits of the internal services market.
Similarly, the initiative in favour of a common energy policy to meet the huge challenge of obtaining a reliable energy supply is another desirable development in connection with which the Commission should be applauded and supported.
It is such initiatives that show that Europe really deserves peopleâs confidence.
However, there are other challenges to which Europe responded too slowly and in relation to which there is always an ever-increasing need for action at European level.
In these sectors, we have to do more work to permit the expression of reason, to achieve a fair balance and thus to increase peopleâs confidence in Europe.
I feel that the work of the European Commission on developing a maritime policy is of particular importance because it is aimed at creating an intrinsic maritime advantage for Europe as a main item on its agenda.
It is not just because I come from an old maritime nation that I state without hesitation that Europeâs maritime heritage is not being utilised enough at European level.
We need to adopt a holistic attitude.
We should not let short-term interests in certain sectors deflect us from the progressive view we take of maritime issues as a whole.
We should strive to lead the maritime world rather than try to create a privileged space within it.
We should win the confidence of people not only within the Union but also outside it, showing also that we are capable of increasing their confidence in us through acting justly.
Our Euro-Mediterranean policy is a clear example of this.
The complexity of this region, which we share with our neighbours, and its intrinsic connection to the peace process in the Middle East require us, much more than ever before, to be the voice of reason.
The recent incidents following the publication of certain cartoons unfortunately proved to be a step backwards in this regard.
These events do, however, give us the opportunity to rebuild confidence even at this level.
Another challenge comes from the obvious but inevitable consequences of globalisation.
The answer to this challenge cannot be found in protectionism or in putting aside what has been attained so far.
There has to be a fair balance between the inevitable consequences of free trade, on the one hand, and the affirmation of the main values of Europe, and not least our social model, on the other.
It is true that it is not easy to find such a balance.
However we cannot forget that it is Europeâs sense of balance and reason that distinguishes it from the other actors in the international arena.
Another challenge, and one that is more visible on the human level, is the challenge of illegal immigration.
Some days ago, a delegation from your institution visited my country as part of Parliamentâs current efforts to visit countries within and outside Europe in order to examine the extent of the challenge of illegal immigration.
This is a problem that, at the moment, places a heavy burden on the ability of a number of Member States, and not least of my own country, to cope with the seemingly endless influx of people coming mostly from sub-Saharan Africa.
As your delegation was able to see in talking to immigrants and those seeking asylum, the problem is both real and urgent.
On the one hand, the Mediterranean faces a humanitarian disaster in which hundreds of people die while trying to reach Europe, while thousands more live in uncertainty and in difficult conditions after having achieved their aim.
At the same time, the countries receiving a heavy influx of immigrants see their capabilities and resources stretched beyond their limits.
Clearly, this is not a problem for Malta alone or for any other country alone.
It is a common challenge requiring a collective effort.
However, I must emphasise that Maltaâs problem is more acute because Malta is the most densely populated Member State.
Europe urgently needs an immigration policy offering a more practical solution to this problem in all its complexity, a solution offering a typically European solidarity with the people involved in this drama and with the countries of origin, but also with those countries that constitute immigrantsâ introduction to Europe and that do not have the means of addressing this problem on their own.
I therefore thank the European Parliament and the members of the delegation that came to Malta for having placed this item on Parliamentâs agenda and for having made our countryâs call for urgent action heard.
If we want to increase peopleâs confidence in us, we have to show that we are responding effectively to the interests of the people and, to do this, we need to acknowledge the mood of the people.
Political leaders should not follow, but lead, the people. They should not, however, move forward with too much haste.
Otherwise, they will leave the people behind and be cut off from the realities of the world.
Here, too, a balance has to be found.
There are a number of values that distinguish Europe from other continents and the European Union from other projects in the world aimed at regional integration.
Europe is already distinguished by its full commitment to the values of peace, tolerance, human rights and solidarity.
The European Union is becoming more and more conspicuous as the voice of reason among its neighbours and in the world.
For Europe to be the voice of reason, we need to go beyond the bounds of national egoism and work together for our common good.
We must continue to uphold this value in the action we take both among ourselves and with other countries.
This is the Europe that people expect of us and the Europe that they are prepared to trust.
Thank you.
Â Â  Thank you very much for your words, Mr President.
I am sure that your presence here will have given all of the Members a better understanding of your countryâs difficulties.
Thank you for your words of praise for the European Parliament's work.
I also hope that the alarm sounded by our Members on visiting your country has been heard by all of the people responsible and that both your government and the Union's institutions will do what they can effectively to ensure that the admission policy in Europe shows greater respect for the citizens of other countries who try to come to ours.
Â Â  . I and my British Conservative colleagues have long supported attempts to ensure that the European Parliament has only one official seat, and that it should be Brussels.
The cost to the taxpayer of the Strasbourg seat is estimated at around Â£150 million per annum.
This is a gross waste of public funds.
British taxpayers deserve to have value for money.
We want to carry out our work on behalf of our constituents where it is most effective and cost efficient, namely in Brussels.
The cost of having to maintain parliamentary operations in both Strasbourg and Brussels has now become indefensible, and we will continue to campaign to have Parliament sit only in Brussels in future.
Â Â  â Mr President, I voted in favour of the Roure report on the grounds that it constitutes a very positive initiative in favour of greater security.
For the first time, the cooperation of liaison officers posted by Member States to serve in third countries is put on an institutional footing and specifically regulated.
For the first time, too, the cooperation of liaison officers with Europol liaison officers and their coordination by Europol liaison officers in the third countries is assured.
Moreover, Member States facing potential threats from states in which they have no liaison officers, can be supplied with early information through liaison officers of other Member States.
The institutionalisation of the cooperation of liaison officers adds to security around the European Union and in its immediate neighbourhood. This is in the public interest and in the interest of security within the European Union.
Â Â  . This proposal follows the assessment of Decision 170/2003, under which cooperation is stepped up between the Member States as regards the posting of liaison officers in third countries and international organisations.
I endorse the idea of introducing the amendments needed to ensure that the current practice as regards the use of Europol liaison officers is covered and is legally binding.
In this way, liaison officers from the Member States should establish and maintain direct contacts with the local authorities in the host State or the international organisation, with a view to facilitating and expediting the collection and exchange of information, which should in turn be passed on to Europol.
The objective is to help establish a spirit of European cooperation between police authorities, in other words, a Community approach to tasks assigned to liaison officers and direct exchange of information between those officers and Europol central command.
This will help raise the consistency and effectiveness of the tasks assigned to these officers, and prevent problems of lack of coordination, cooperation and even overlapping.
I therefore support the amendments tabled by the rapporteur and hope that agreement can be reached at first reading.
Â Â  Mr President, the tenor of the programme of the Takkula report perfectly mirrors official Europeâs arrogant, condescending attitude following the referendums in France and the Netherlands.
The dim-witted French and Dutch had not got the message and had to be re-educated.
The perfect representative of this arrogant elite is Commissioner Michel, who literally stated that the public is not always right and that in cases like these, the politicians should map out the route.
The present âCitizens for Europeâ programme fits into this dubious communication and information strategy.
By investing hundreds of millions of euros in all manner of meaningless, politically correct projects and organisations, the Commission wants to bring the citizens closer to the Union, or so it says.
Ironically, the document also refers to Plan D that stands for democracy, dialogue and debate, but in the same month that the plan was presented, accession negotiations were opened with Turkey, although it was common knowledge that the majority of the people in Europe are opposed to this.
This is exactly the kind of hypocrisy that is meeting with resistance from an increasing number of Europeans.
Â Â  .I voted in favour of the report by my fellow Member, MrÂ Takkula, on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing for the period 2007-2013 a programme to promote active European citizenship.
It is crucial to highlight this original feature of European integration, which consists in providing Europeans with dual national and European citizenship.
The Member Statesâ ability to harbour common ambitions at the same time as upholding our values is strictly dependent on the involvement of the people in European integration.
We must therefore all work towards this, particularly the MEPs in contact with our colleagues from the national parliaments, who represent the national citizenship of those living in the Member States.
European citizenship is the binding force that must be promoted everywhere, together with the pride of belonging to a project that is unique and special in the world: the integration of the European Union, which is not a nation but the creation, in peaceful circumstances and by democratic means, of a humanist civilisation.
Â Â  . UKIP has voted against amendments 62 and 63 on the âCitizens for Europe programmeâ because they believe that the proposed projects, for which they have every sympathy, should be organised and funded at national level.
Â Â  The Swedish Conservatives have today chosen to abstain in the vote on the Citizens for Europe report.
The report emphasises constructive solutions such as the importance of disseminating knowledge about the victims of Nazism and Communism.
It is also good that the EU institutions provide information about their activities and about the rights and duties attendant on European citizenship.
We disapprove, however, of increasing the EUâs financial appropriations earmarked for shaping opinion with a view to developing a European identity.
A European identity develops through meetings between people and through more thoroughgoing cooperation, not through public institutionsâ efforts to shape opinion.
Â Â  . I abstained from the final vote on this report because Amendments 62 and 63, to which I put my name, were not adopted.
To my mind, this attempt to rewrite history is appalling.
The victims of fascism and other dictatorial regimes that have been in power in Europe in the recent past must not be forgotten.
To vote against Amendments 62 and 63 is a historical and political mistake.
Given that the main objective of this new programme is to promote the values, conquests and cultural diversity of Europe, to bring EU citizens closer together, thereby strengthening the links that bind Europeâs citizens and institutions, and to promote cohesion between Europeans, one cannot omit the victims of fascism, or overlook the importance of the historical conquest of freedom and democracy, without which countries like Portugal would not have been able to form part of the European project.
Â Â  . The promotion of citizenship entails much more than simply strengthening democracy and political and social integration in Europe, which the report claims to advocate.
The promotion of citizenship entails encouraging the citizens to become involved in defining the policies that affect them directly and indirectly.
This can be achieved, by means of the following: equal opportunities for men and women; promoting high-quality, inclusive state education; the right to work and to work with rights; the right to free, high-quality healthcare; the right to culture; access to the law; access to decent housing; and peace.
This is, in fact, a list of the economic, social and cultural freedoms, guarantees and rights enshrined in the Constitution of the Portuguese Republic.
We feel that peopleâs individual and collective identity is formed by their collective memory and that this must be brought to the fore, so that we can all be aware of where we come from and define where we want to go.
We regret, however, that the adopted report will serve to contaminate European history and that the majority in Parliament has opted to contaminate the collective memory on which the identity of current and future generations will be based.
For example, they rejected the proposals on supporting initiatives in honour of the victims of fascismÂ âŠ
Â Â  We are not at all well disposed towards some of the amendments by the European Parliamentâs Committee on Culture and Education.
The report is based primarily on an attitude of apparent incomprehension faced with the low turnout in the 2004 European Parliament elections and the fact that the draft Constitution was voted down in referenda in France and the Netherlands.
The âCitizens for Europeâ programme will not help to change the political situation.
We are opposed to increasing this programmeâs budget over and above the EURÂ 235Â 000Â 000 set aside for 2007â2013, as recommended in AmendmentÂ 36.
The aforesaid sum is already too generous.
The work in relation to local amateur sports clubs smacks of contempt for people.
In the same way, we note that, important as it is for Europeans to preserve their memories of dictatorships and tragedies in their history, this should happen at national level.
It is not something for Eurocrats in Brussels to become involved in.
We have therefore voted against this report.
Â Â  I am well disposed towards the report to the extent that it is about EU citizens needing to become more aware of, and informed about, the EU and the opportunities they have to exercise influence.
I also support the rapporteurâs view that the programme should be accessible to everyone and not just be addressed to well-educated and privileged groups.
However, I am critical of the wordings that refer to the new Constitution and of the aspiration towards a common European citizenship.
Â Â  . I and my British Conservative colleagues agree that there is widespread alienation towards European institutions on the part of the citizens of the EU.
This was demonstrated by the 'No' votes in the French and Dutch referendums on the EU Constitution. It is also demonstrated by the low voter turnout at the 2004 European elections.
We believe that the European institutions need to become more transparent and accountable to the electorate.
They must also become more efficient and cost-effective.
Parliament and the other institutions need to operate in a way that gains trust and respect.
This report approaches those problems in fundamentally the wrong way.
It will further undermine confidence in the EU with its call for a budget of nearly EURÂ 300Â million of taxpayers' money to be spent on arbitrary projects that seek to impose an artificial European identity.
We wish to make clear that British Conservatives are strongly in favour of solemn acts of remembrance and commemoration of the evils that Nazism and Stalinism inflicted on millions of people in Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.
However, we believe that such acts are matters for individual Member States and their peoples.
Â Â  . Europe's citizens feel very disillusioned and detached from the institutions and the process of European integration.
The rejection of the Constitutional Treaty in France and the Netherlands has brought this situation into even sharper relief.
In this context, the Commission has put forward its âCitizens for Europeâ programme aimed at promoting European values and active European citizenship.
The programme provides for the implementation of measures that will bring European citizens together in order to share and exchange experiences, opinions and values, to encourage debate and reflection on European citizenship, via cooperation between civil society organisations, to hold high-visibility events, to carry out studies and surveys, and to bolster other information and dissemination instruments.
Broadly speaking, I endorse the amendments tabled to this report, especially as regards the title of the programme.
The title âEurope for the citizensâ reinforces the idea that Europe should act as a means of meeting the citizensâ aspirations and not the other way around.
Â Â  â Through the 'Citizens for Europe' programme, the Commission and the European Parliament are unleashing a brainwashing campaign against the peoples of Europe in order to combat increased displeasure at and condemnation of its policy and the questioning of the EU itself.
Its ideological arsenal rests on two pillars: on sanctifying capitalist barbarity, as the only way forward for the peoples, and on anti-communism, by reintroducing through the back door the 'memorandum' equating fascism with communism.
With appropriations of EUR 235 million to pay for and pay off all manner of eulogists and propagandists of the European one-way street, it is mobilising the mechanisms constructed years ago and so-called NGOs to cultivate a positive climate and sow delusion in the people as to the character and policy of the EU.
A similar mission is being given to the reconciled leaders of trades union, so that they can conceal beneath the title 'Citizens of Europe' the major and irreconcilable class differences between the capitalists and the working class.
The MEPs of the Kommounistiko Komma Elladas voted against the report.
As far as the amendment referring to the condemnation of Nazism and the dictatorships of Europe are concerned, we abstained from the vote, because it does not refer to the dictatorships of Spain, Portugal and Greece by name and is formulated such that socialist regimes could be interpreted as dictatorships.
Â Â  . As we know, the EU is enduring a difficult time.
Fresh challenges are appearing on various fronts; weak economic growth has had a social impact and has posed global challenges to which we have yet to find solutions.
The biggest challenge we now face, however, is that of the citizensâ opinion of the European project.
The increase in scepticism and the clear lack of satisfaction with the project of European integration is widening the gap between the citizens and the political decision-makers.
We therefore need to rethink the way in which Europeâs democratic institutions communicate.
I feel that this programme is an important tool in raising awareness of European values among all citizens.
It features a range of citizensâ projects, support for the provision of information to European civil society, and the holding of high-visibility events and other events that will help to raise knowledge of the European memory.
The European project is characterised by respect for diversity and cultural wealth.
This is achieved by means of measures that deepen the cohesion between Europeans that is vital if we are to complete the internal market and achieve the sustainable growth and development of our societies.
I therefore voted in favour of this report.
Â Â  .I obviously support this report aimed at bringing the citizens and the European institutions closer together, which is something of an objective, if not a necessity in todayâs Europe of ever-increasing scepticism.
This report introduces new lines of thought in relation to communication, to citizensâ projects with a transnational dimension and, above all, to a duty of âactive European remembranceâ, which is a unifying initiative aimed at commemorating the victims of the mass deportations and exterminations carried out under the Nazi and Communist regimes.
I voted against all attempts to water down the text, some Members having been keen to refer to other forms of totalitarianism in Europe.
The atrocities committed by these two regimes, and suffered by the nations of Europe as a whole, are at the root of European integration, and it is crucially important that we do not trivialise them.
Over and above this initiative, our role is to inform, to meet, to hold dialogues, to convince, to ensure that each citizen is aware of how Europe manages its daily affairs, to strengthen the feeling of belonging to Europe, to fight against any form of retreat into nationalism, to make Europeâs added value a reality and to point out the fact that the European idea represents the brightest idea of the 20th century.
Let us remember that, at a time when some of us are beginning to have doubts, the rest of the world is dreaming of Europe.
Â Â  .The âCitizens for Europeâ programme is nothing other than a propaganda tool designed to benefit the European Union.
This report notes that the Constitutional Treaty was rejected in France and the Netherlands and that Europeans are sceptical about enlargement, meaning enlargement to include Turkey.
Yet, far from drawing conclusions from this scathing disapproval, this report seeks to âre-educateâ the citizens!
An initiative such as town twinning, which has been proving its worth for a long time now, is shamelessly hijacked, while millions of euros will be poured into communication circles and communication actions.
One amendment, AmendmentÂ 14, even encourages actions at Community level!
Referring to actions in the field of sport, the report points out, and I quote, âIn this way, passive or even euro-sceptical citizens can be reachedâ. You actually intend to hunt down those Europeans who, unlike you, are not deluding themselves.
The made-up expression âactiveâ European valuesâ, as promoted by this report, has no meaning whatsoever. A value is neither active nor passive, it is not a device that we can switch on and off, unless we do what you do, and behave like ideologues.
Â Â  â Thank you, Mr President.
First of all, I wish to thank all those Members, amounting to 30% of Parliament, who, out of respect for my country, heard the speech given by the President of Malta.
However, I am today standing up to explain the vote in relation to the report on the Cultural Capital of Europe.
There was a misunderstanding yesterday.
I was supposed to speak but, for some reason, was not given the opportunity to do so.
In fact, what I wanted to say was that I abstained, as did my Maltese fellow Members from the Delegation of the Socialist Party, because, of the new Member States, our country was bottom of the list of countries that might be nominated and, of all the Member States including the two new countries set to join the Union, was next to the bottom of the same list.
I think it unfair that Malta should have been allocated a position in which at least twelve years have to elapse before it can be nominated.
Thank you.
Â Â  .
We voted in favour of the rapporteurâs amendments, which improve upon the Commissionâs original proposal and which safeguard Portuguese interests. A case in point is the recasting of Article 13 awarding a European Capital of Culture to Portugal in 2012.
It also simplifies the administrative procedures for selecting and monitoring âEuropean Capitals of Cultureâ, and ensures that the appraisal is carried out according to the new, more inclusive criteria.
As regards the programme, the only requirement is that it must be consistent with the Member State's domestic cultural strategy or policy.
Accordingly, diversity and the particular characteristics of the cultural heritage of each EU Member State will, in our view, be brought to the fore and dialogue between the various cultures will be facilitated.
Â Â  We are well disposed towards the basic idea of the European Capital of Culture event.
However, we see, at the same time, how the event would take on new dimensions in view of the organisation surrounding it and the EUâs commitments.
The idea of the European Capital of Culture is a good one, so good in fact that it could be funded in many other ways, for example through local sponsorship.
Financial resources from the European Union should not be necessary to this projectâs survival.
We are therefore voting against the report but are not opposed to the actual idea of the European Capital of Culture.
Â Â  Receiving the title 'European Capital of Culture' is meant to â and should â considerably improve a cityâs image, but European Capital of Culture status should not primarily be about a year-long festival in the city and short-term marketing of local culture.
Newcastle and Bilbao have shown that culture can also have a long-term effect.
In times when budgets are being pared to the bone, the follow-up costs for new prestige projects are often neglected.
The proposed Internet portal, as a tool for exchanging information and providing assistance, could be used to avoid problems in the organisation and implementation of the year of culture before they arise.
It could, at a much earlier stage, avoid applicants unnecessarily spending millions on elaborate advertising campaigns without actually getting the grant in the end, or even, as in the case of the former capital of culture Weimar, having to close down the city museum because of major financial losses.
In 2009, the title of Capital of Culture will go, once more, to an Austrian provincial capital â Linz.
The preparations are already underway, and it remains to be seen whether they are being made with the necessary foresight.
Â Â  â The restructuring of the institution of the European Capital of Culture comes within more general efforts to integrate and homogenise the cultural fabric of each country, in the aim of creating a single support for 'European culture' which will contain a mixture of subculture, a folkloric presentation of national cultures and modern commercial constructs.
My country's experience from Athens in 1985 and Thessaloniki in 1997 is miserable in the cultural and economic sector.
Exorbitantly expensive, historically disconnected, superficial cultural programmes run by venture companies, agencies and sponsors on vulgar, commercial/profit-making criteria which overshadowed any enlightened exemptions.
Mundane events, rich buffets and tasteless celebrations that marginalised or repulsed anything progressive in Greece or in neighbouring countries.
That is the 'European cultural model', which also operates as a source of massive profit for various companies.
The proposed amendment maintains the same character, transferring the cost to the Member States, strengthening supervision and control by the ÎU and calling on the people to pay at national level the businessmen and the cost of the EU policy to impose the European subculture and the 'values' of capitalist barbarity.
We are voting against the report, calling on the workers and people of art and culture to rise up in opposition.
Â Â  . Since it was set up in 1985, the âEuropean Capital of Cultureâ programme has helped to bring Europeâs citizens closer together, by highlighting the wealth, diversity and characteristics of Europe's cultural heritage.
The programmeâs huge success with the citizens has helped to strengthen the European dimension and socio-economic development in the selected cities.
These benefits can increase exponentially if we take new measures, forming a basic methodology that will enable us to establish synergies that would otherwise not be possible.
An example of this is the creation of a website with information on the cities awarded European capital of culture, the existing contact networks and exchange of experiences â a strategy that should be extended to all Community programmes.
I should also like to say that, with its innovation and success, this programme was the inspiration behind proposals that I tabled, and that were adopted by Parliament, aimed at creating a European Destination of Excellence, which will also help promote Europe worldwide.
I therefore voted in favour of this report.
Â Â  This decision does not involve any new costs but gives the new Member States and the enlargement countries the opportunity to choose Cultural Capitals.
Cultural cooperation is something that can give people knowledge of, and respect for, each other and is something positive.
The Commissionâs power is limited, and it is countries and cities that are responsible for working things out.
All this is encouraging, unlike the EU legislation that is forced on people and that limits their democratic opportunities for active participation.
I therefore voted in favour of the proposal, despite its containing a certain amount of woolly Euronationalism.
Â Â  â Mr President, I am giving this explanation of vote on behalf of the delegation from the Austrian People's Party.
We voted against the report because it calls for the currently applicable transitional periods for the free movement of workers to be abolished.
We voted against this because we expect the accession treaty, which all countries â including the new Member States â signed, to be retained, including its transitional provisions to protect the Austrian labour market.
This is quite justified, because statistics show that the number of workers from the new Member States has already doubled in the last two years.
The delegation from the Austrian People's Party opposes the report because, both now and in the future, only Austria can and will decide how long the entry restrictions guaranteed under the accession treaty will be retained in the interests of the Austrian workforce â it could be for up to seven years.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in view of the fact that Commission communication COM 2006 on the functioning of the transitional measures shows that the influx of workers from the EU-10 states into the states with open labour markets has not been at all great and, on the contrary, according to the experts, has had a positive effect by increasing output and improving the economy, and also in view of the fact that the transitional periods have clearly contributed to an increase in the numbers of illegal workers, I consider approval of the report by MrÂ Åry as a significant initiative which should help to open up labour markets fully in states throughout the European Union.
Only in this way can we fulfil all of the freedoms set out in the Treaty establishing the European Community, and give a boost to the entire EU economy.
I have therefore voted for the approval of this report.
Â Â  The free movement of people and access to labour markets constitute one of the pillars of European integration.
Unless we uphold this principle in conformity with the basic values of the Community, we will not catch up with the United States, even if America were to come closer to us; nor will we succeed in slowing down the Asian juggernaut.
I firmly believe that the concerns of some of the EU 15 countries are groundless, and it is deplorable that they do not accept the recommendations from a European Commission report that has been drafted in accordance with the accession treaties.
On the other hand, we must praise the decisions taken by those countries that will be opening their labour markets during the European Year of Workersâ Mobility.
For these reasons, the Ãry report should be viewed not so much as a bogeyman, but more as a simple guide on how to achieve the gradual fulfilment of the revised Lisbon Strategy goals.
It is an attempt to ensure equal rights for the old and new Member States in a united Europe.
For this reason, I have voted in favour of the report.
Â Â  â Mr President, there were transitional provisions when Greece and Portugal joined the EU, too, to enable the labour markets to adapt to the new situation.
It follows that this is not a way of branding the new Member States as second-class states.
Moreover, the transitional provisions are also welcomed by the new Member States to the east, inasmuch as they also serve national interests there.
In view of the high levels of unemployment, particularly in Austria and Germany, and of the increasing pressure on the low pay sector, freedom of movement for workers right now would be completely irresponsible.
We are already having to deal with large numbers of people pretending to be self-employed, some of whom are evading taxes and social contributions.
Until companies stop relocating to the low-tax economies in the east and trying to extricate themselves from tariff agreements, and until the market has adapted to the new situation or appropriate accompanying measures have been put in place, complete freedom of movement for workers would be irresponsible.
That is why I voted against this report.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the four European freedoms, that is to say the freedom of movement for goods, services, capital and above all persons, have always been among the things that people valued most highly about the European Union.
It is therefore incomprehensible, unjust and discriminatory that people from eight new Member States, including the Czech Republic, still do not enjoy the same rights in this respect as citizens from the other EU states.
The reasons for restricting this fundamental European freedom are entirely unfounded and nonsensical.
The examples of the United Kingdom, Sweden and Ireland show that labour markets are not under any threat.
I am pleased that other states are to open their labour markets as well, and I trust that they will be doing so very soon.
We need a Union in which all citizens share the same rights and the same obligations and not a Union where some are equal and others more equal, as in George Orwellâs .
I have therefore voted in favour of Mr Åryâs report.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, along with other MEPs from the Civic Democratic Party I have backed the report from my colleague Mr Åry on the free movement of workers.
We fully respect the right of individual Member State governments to decide on temporary restrictions in respect of the free movement of workers, within the context of the Accession Treaty.
We also appreciate the decision of Great Britain, Ireland and Sweden not to make use of this right and we welcome the decision from the governments of Finland, Spain, the Netherlands and Portugal to end these restrictions.
We are convinced that there are no objective reasons for restricting freedom of movement for workers within the European Union.
The political reasons for restricting this freedom, however, appear just as compelling to the old Member States as the free movement of workers is important to the new Member States.
We have therefore backed a call to all governments to scrap restrictions on the free movement of workers within the European Union.
Â Â  . The vote on this report on the transitional arrangements restricting the free movement of workers on EU labour markets is indicative of the contradictions in Parliament.
On the one hand, MEPs claim to defend the free movement of workers and to want to put an end to the unfair situation in which workers from the new Member States find themselves.
Yet when this free movement might lead to equal rights, they vote against, which means that they only want freedom of movement when it leads to low salaries and the loss of rights.
As such the proposals that we tabled were unfortunately rejected, which were as follows:
- believes it is crucial to put an end to the serious exploitation of workers in a number of EU countries arising from the illegal work to which many workers from new Member States and some older ones such as Portugal are subjected.
- stresses the need for effective monitoring and constant action aimed at ending discrimination, unequal treatment and illegal work, and the need to promote equal rights of workers and to apply the same labour and social legislation to all persons working in a Member State, regardless of their EU country of origin.
Hence our decision to abstain.
Â Â  We defend an efficient internal market and fully support the free movement of workers within the EU.
This is one of the fundamental freedoms under the EC Treaty.
The free movement of workers helps to create more jobs and to strengthen the EUâs competitiveness.
We are proud that Sweden is one of the three countries not to have introduced any transitional rules.
We regret that the Heads of State or Government decided to introduce transitional arrangements in the accession agreement with the ten new Member States.
At the same time, we respect the fact that individual Member States choose to act on the basis of the opportunities provided by the accession agreement entered into.
In the report, the European Parliament calls on the Member States to abolish the current transitional arrangements.
We believe that this issue should be decided on by individual Member States at national level.
We are thus opposed to the European Parliament shaping opinion with a view to influencing the Member States to take a particular line on this important issue.
Nor do we believe that the EU should carry out information campaigns concerning the free movement of workers.
We have every confidence that the respective national authorities can carry out this task satisfactorily.
We also question the proposal to introduce a scheme for âthe systematic monitoring of migration of workers within the EUâ and to provide the necessary funds for this purpose (paragraphÂ 11).
We have chosen to vote against this report.
Â Â  . From 1Â May 2004, three âoldâ Member States (Ireland, the UK and Sweden) opened up their labour markets without restrictions to nationals of the ânewâ Member States.
The other Member States of the EU-15 have opted to apply national restrictions under the transnational arrangements.
In the UK, after the labour market was opened up, 60Â 000 job seekers arrived from the new Member States in 2004; the two sectors chiefly concerned were agriculture and fisheries.
Given the high number of vacancies, the influx certainly did not increase unemployment in those two sectors.
On the contrary, the immediate effect it had was of improving the profitability and competitiveness of the businesses concerned, raising their productivity and strengthening their financial position.
In macroeconomic terms, the policy of opening up the labour market translates into a marked increase in the British growth rate.
According to the expert reports available, migration of workers from the ten new Member States has helped to increase production and create new jobs and has substantially reduced the number of illegal workers.
I welcome these positive benefits.
Â Â  . Supplementing the free movement of capital with the free movement of labour is hailed as an act of solidarity.
The reverse is true in practice, though.
It reinforces exploitation and creates unnecessary conflict among workers from different Member States.
Rushed implementation leads in the receiving countries to insufficient control of the application of minimum wages and collective labour agreements.
Despite the restrictions that apply until 2011, employees from new Member States are already being used in order to force down labour costs.
A study carried out by my party, the Socialist Party in the Netherlands, has shown that the influx of workers from new Member States has resulted in people being pushed aside in the labour market, unfair competition for small businesses, cheap labour being exploited, bad housing and working conditions and wages under EUR 3 per hour.
Many Dutch lorry drivers have already been replaced by Polish drivers.
According to a study which the Socialist Party carried out among contractors in the Hague region before, many building companies are also badly affected by unfair competition from Eastern European countries, against which the Dutch trade unions mounted a campaign in March.
In the countries of origin, there is already a shortage of qualified employees in some sectors.
As my party campaigns against such a neo-liberal free market, I will be voting against the Ãry report.
Â Â  . The report on the transitional arrangements restricting the free movement of workers on EU labour markets is a timely one, as it coincides with the publication of the Portuguese, Spanish and Finnish decision to scrap the barriers that have been in place since 1Â MayÂ 2004.
The free movement of workers is a core element of the EU, in that it represents what is generous about the Union and is indicative of the actual construction of a common area.
There was a time when the inhabitants of Eastern Europe wanted to escape from their countries but were unable to do so.
Nowadays there is certainly hope for a better future for those countries, and the expectations engendered by accession have led to a belief that their national economies can develop, as events have borne out.
What is more, the countries that have removed restrictions, such as the United Kingdom, Ireland and Sweden, have not witnessed major increases in their migratory flows in comparison with other Member States â some, mostly temporary, work permits have been granted â and have in fact confirmed that these immigrants have had a positive effect on their economies, as has been well documented.

Â Â  .I am obviously, as a matter of principle, in favour of opening up labour markets in the EU-15 to workers from eight new Member States.
In 2004, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Sweden opened up their borders without restriction.
Two years later, a Commission report is defending this political approach, with figures to support it: there are fewer migrants than anticipated and they are filling jobs left vacant in certain sectors.
However, since we cannot allow ourselves to be naively optimistic, I am also in favour of the provisional measures taken in this area by the majority of the Member States.
That is why I support the Belgian Federal Governmentâs decision to keep certain conditions of access to the job market until 2009 at the latest.
These restrictions are limited in scope and do not apply to the independent professions, such as shopkeepers, craft workers and liberal professions, which have enjoyed total freedom of establishment ever since enlargement.
First and foremost, these restrictions are limited in time, and deal with both the real situation on the ground and the sometimes unfair competition between European workers and employers.
We must give the âunpreparedâ Member States time to implement the registration and monitoring structures that are needed in order to enable workers to move freely outside of their countries of origin.
Â Â  . We recently celebrated 20 years of Portugalâs accession to the European project.
From the outset, Portuguese workers saw their freedom of movement restricted by barriers put up by Member States fearing disruption to their labour markets.
History is repeating itself and workers from the eight new Member States from the east are now experiencing the same ordeals.
I voted in favour of this report because it has been shown that, just as in 1986, migration from these countries has had positive effects on the economies of the Member States that have decided to open up their labour markets.
Those countries have found that there are no longer any valid reasons for maintaining such restrictions to freedom of movement.
It is precisely restrictions of this nature that foment illegal work and the exploitation of workers.
Above all, this is a matter of solidarity towards the new Member States.
The EU must not respond to the challenges of the world with the kind of nationalism and protectionism practised in some of its Member States.
All European workers are needed to improve business competitiveness and thereby increase economic growth in the EU.
Â Â  .
I support the Ãry report on the transitional regulation which restricts the free movement of workers in EU labour markets, and I do so because I share the view that it would be preferable if all Member States, including Belgium, were to abolish transitional measures.
The three countries that have opened their borders have not been faced with a large-scale migration flow.
Meanwhile, we have proof that transitional periods lead to considerably more moonlighting and feigned self-employment, which puts wages under pressure and causes employees to be faced with bad and unfair working conditions.
The restriction of the free movement of employees from the new Member States is discriminatory, leads to exploitation and bears witness to short-term thinking that is out of touch with todayâs reality.
This report can ensure that by abolishing the transitional periods, social rights are no longer blocked and the road for a social and just Europe is cleared.
What is crucial is that a European labour market is created where there is equal pay for equal work, that equal working conditions should apply and that all employees should be guaranteed equal access to social rights.
At the same time, the social inspectorates must also be reinforced and cooperate transnationally.
Â Â  . This report on the free movement of workers identifies the improved profitability and competitiveness of businesses in Ireland, Sweden and the UK â countries that have opened their labour markets.
The British experience has shown that the UK was right to take the bold step of opening up its labour market.
British growth and productivity rates have proven that fears about opening EU labour markets are unfounded.
A single market cannot function properly whilst labour markets remain protected and sealed off.
The UK has shown how free labour markets, coupled with proper social protection, can boost a prosperous economy.
This has led to the longest period of sustained economic growth in living memory in the UK.
The European Parliamentary Labour Party believes that European labour markets should be open, like the UK's, and should not fear tides of immigration.
Â Â  The next item is the statement by the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy and the statement by the Commission on the situation in the Middle East following the elections in Israel.
Â Â  . Mr President, I am speaking to you here in the European Parliament at a time which I believe to be critical to future peace in the Middle East, immediately after the creation of the new Palestinian Government and the elections in Israel.
I would like to talk briefly about the current situation and draw a few conclusions in relation to the responsibilities the European Union should take on at this moment which could be absolutely crucial to future peace in the Middle East.
I would like to begin with the situation in the occupied territories.
As you know, Hamas has taken control of the government; it is not a coalition government, but a Hamas government, and unfortunately the programme presented by its Prime Minister, Ismail Haniya, is not acceptable to the international community.
It does not give any clear indication that the Hamas government is prepared to respect the principles established by the European Union, and not just by us, but also by the Quartet and by the international community, in a very broad sense: to renounce violence as a means for resolving conflicts â and this conflict in particular â to recognise the State of Israel and to respect the previous agreements signed by the Palestinians and Israel.
Mr President, I believe that those principles are minimum requirements if the political ideal that the European Union has always defended is to be realised.
That ideal is no less than a negotiated solution leading to the creation of a viable Palestinian State living peacefully alongside Israel, within the framework of the principles of international law.
It is clear, Mr President, that there can be no negotiation if the parties do not recognise each other, there can be no peaceful arrangement if the parties believe that arms can resolve the conflict and there can be no solution based on the principles of international law if the parties disregard the fundamental principle that agreements must be complied with.
We believe that all of this has inescapable consequences as far as the European Union is concerned.
We must wait and see what happens in the future, but for the moment it is impossible for Hamas to be seen as a valid interlocutor unless it changes its views.
Mr President, please allow me to say a few words about the result of the Israeli elections.
There is no question that this result can be interpreted in many different ways.
It would not be appropriate for me to carry out a detailed analysis of the result of these elections, but I believe that a few comments may help us all to find formulae that allow us to carry out an analysis with a view to identifying different ways to work.
I would like firstly to point out that, although there has been a clear winner, the Kadima party, it has not achieved the results it wanted, and that may have a certain impact on the negotiations on forming a coalition government, which is essential, although MrÂ Olmert has already chosen the Labour Party as the foundation for his coalition.
Secondly, and I believe this to be important, I believe that we must take note of the fact that the election result shows a shift away from the strictly political towards the economic and social.
I believe that that analysis can explain the result achieved by the Labour Party, and that achieved by the Pensioners' Party or those parties with a limited social or linguistic base, including the Shas party or the Israel Beitenu party, the party of the Russian-speaking community.
Thirdly, and I believe this is perhaps the most worrying thing for all of us and for the peace process, I believe that the elections have demonstrated a consolidation of a desire for what I would call separation, perhaps illustrated by the completion of the wall and the absence of dialogue between the two peoples on defining Israelâs borders.
We view this as an unsustainable situation.
We have always argued that the final borders could only be established on the basis of a mutual agreement.
We are therefore in favour of negotiation in order to resolve these problems, as we have always been.
The inward-looking focus of the Israeli electorate has a parallel in Hamasâs desire to focus on Palestinian issues and to ignore an Israel whose right to exist it still rejects.
And we cannot ignore the fact that all of this has consequences in terms of the possibility of applying what we have seen as the roadmap.
Although these are difficult times for that roadmap, it must continue to be the reference point for seeking a definitive solution to the process.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, beyond the aspects relating to the Middle East peace process, the victory in Palestine of a movement such as Hamas, which is affiliated to the Muslim Brothers, in elections that were free and democratic, as acknowledged by the Unionâs own observers, is a complete novelty.
The European Union does not want the Hamas government to fail, and it must not want that, on principle.
What we want is for that government, as well as respecting the principles of which it is well aware, which have been proposed by the international community, also to apply the principles of law, the rule of law and democratic alternation, and to preserve the pluralistic nature of Palestinian society.
If it does so, we will be able to look at Hamas as a fully legitimate political body.
Within this context, what position do I believe Europe should take?
I would like once again to stress something that is absolutely clear: a satisfactory solution to the conflict has been, is and will remain a fundamental priority for us, the Europeans.
Now, more than ever, we must insist that only a negotiated solution can be stable and lasting.
We must therefore continue to put pressure on both parties to commit to a negotiated solution based on the existence of two States.
I believe that we should also reiterate today that the European Union believes that peace must be based on respect for the 1967 borders and that only territorial changes agreed by both parties will be acceptable.
As you know, the European Unionâs role over recent months has increased considerably; we now have two operations on the ground: a police operation and the important operation at the Rafah border crossing, which is still very much active.
More than 200Â 000 people have crossed from Egypt to Gaza and from Gaza to Egypt since it was opened in November thanks to the presence of generous people from the European Union.
Mr President, our fundamental objective is to get through the period ahead of us, which will remain a period of some uncertainty, in such a way that, when better conditions are in place for a negotiated peace â and I hope that will be soon â the European Union can continue to enjoy the trust of both parties and make an active contribution to achieving peace when that time comes.
With regard to the fundamental parties in the conflict, our principles at the moment are clear and are as follows.
With regard to Palestine, the European Union will continue to support President Abbas and the peace programme on the basis of which he was elected by an enormous, overwhelming, majority of Palestinian voters, and we must not forget that.
Consistent with the Quartetâs statement of 30 March, the European Union is currently reviewing its programmes of aid to the Palestinian authorities.
Until Hamas expresses unequivocally that it intends to respect the principles of the international community, we clearly will not be able to talk about âbusiness as usualâ.
But I would also like to make it very clear that the European Union will maintain aid for the Palestinian people, and it must do this for at least two reasons: firstly, because it is a moral imperative, which the European Union must never renounce â it has not done so in the past, it is not doing so today, and it will not do so in the future â and, secondly, because the humanitarian crisis and instability in the occupied territories do not benefit anybody, including Israel itself.
Ladies and gentlemen, another of the European Unionâs fundamental objectives is to preserve the institutional structure of the Palestinian Authority.
The European Union has invested a lot, has devoted resources and effort to the creation of that Authority and believes that it must be maintained, so that one day there may be a viable and democratic Palestinian State.
With regard to Israel, Mr President, the European Union must continue to reject any unilateral measures that may jeopardise the two-State solution.
In particular, the Union will be watching the development of the situation in East Jerusalem, in the Jordan Valley, where Israel is carrying out actions that are particularly damaging to the Palestinians, as well as the construction of the separation barrier.
In accordance with international humanitarian law, Israel has a series of obligations as the occupying power.
To facilitate the transit of humanitarian aid to the Palestinian population is fundamental, but beyond a strict interpretation of this obligation, Israel should also facilitate movement within the occupied territories in order to make economic sustainability possible, without compromising the security of Israelis, which nobody wants to see.
In this context, I believe that it is urgent for the parties to apply the Agreement on Access and Movement, which was signed in November 2005 in Jerusalem, and I was present at is signature.
That Agreement led to the opening of the Rafah border post â where the Union plays a role, as I have said â and other mechanisms for transit between Israel and the occupied territories.
Israel â and allow me to stress what I am about to say as emphatically as possible, and I hope that everybody understands it, including our good friend, the future Prime Minister, Mr Olmert â must transfer the money that it collects through tariffs and taxes on behalf of the Palestinian Authority â and which does not belong to it â to that Authority.
Israel cannot and must not hold on to this money.
I would like to state as loudly and clearly as possible that we are prepared to work with both parties to ensure that those resources are used for good purposes and I believe that that will be possible, if there is sufficient will on both sides.
Thirdly, I would like to say a few words about the international framework and the Unionâs objectives.
We must continue to work within the Quartet.
