Before I proceed, however, there is something I have to comment upon.
You must explain to me afterwards what the New Year concert had to do with the gas taps being turned off in Russia.
Scarcely had the conductor raised his baton at the New Year concert, you told us, before they turned the gas down.
And then the plot thickened: when the concert finished, you said, they turned it right down.
We really must discuss this mysterious link between the New Year concert in Vienna and Russian gas supplies to Europe.
Chancellor, you identified three aims.
You said that the people of Europe wanted growth and jobs.
Yes, you are right there: growth and jobs.
And the people of Europe do not want MrÂ Solana and MrsÂ Ferrero-Waldner to have to run round cap in hand when we want to engage in operations to stabilise the Gaza Strip, when we want to contribute to peace in the Middle East or whenever we seek to bring stability to the worldâs troubled regions.
It is undoubtedly correct to say that the citizens of Europe will be right behind us when the objectives adopted in Vienna last Sunday are propagated, namely an efficient fight against terrorism and an efficient European police force that can assist national police forces in combating organised crime.
With measures like these, we are sure to win the backing of our citizens for the European project.
That, indeed, was the reason why the European Parliament, in the BÃ¶ge report on the Financial Perspective, put more growth and employment and greater security within Europe and in the wider world at the heart of its financial proposals.
Let us now compare our proposals with the decisions you reached in the Council â you included, MrÂ SchÃŒssel â in December.
For growth and employment, you proposed 35 billion less than Parliament; for internal security in the form of efficient cooperation between police forces, 7.8 billion less; for foreign policy, 12.8Â billion less!
In all of the areas you enumerated here as strategic tasks for your presidency, the Council made swingeing cuts, with the aid of your own vote.
That is the true nature of the European crisis: your promises in the Council and the subsequent failure to deliver.
That is Europeâs crisis.
MrÂ President of the Commission, let me turn now to you.
I really must say that I fail to understand you.
To loud applause in this House, you encouraged the British presidency of the Council to proceed in the very direction I have just described, which is, after all, our common policy.
And in your budget proposal you called for even more money.
Your Commission requested EUR 1Â 022Â billion as the funding required for the performance of our tasks over the next seven years.
At the end of the day, this is whittled away to 862 billion, a shortfall of 160 billion, which you then describe as a great success.
That is what I cannot understand.
We want an agreement, MrÂ SchÃŒssel.
We want Europe to be structured efficiently.
It need not always involve more money.
If no more resources can be mobilised, we have to accept that.
But the expenditure structures must then be organised in such a way that the aims you described can be achieved.
What we have achieved is an unchanged budgetary structure.
Moreover, we now have Blairâs theorem, which has taken its place alongside that of Pythagoras.
Tony Blair should truly be nominated for the Nobel Prize in mathematics for his theorem, which states that the decelerated increase of a sum is equal to the reduction of the sum â brilliant!
Since this year marks the 250th anniversary of Mozartâs birth, Chancellor, I reflected on the words of Osmin in his aria in Mozartâs marvellous opera which are actually a good description of what the Council has been serving up to us.
Osmin sings the following line, which fits the European Council like a glove: âAll your tricks and all your wiles, all your schemes and all your guiles, thereâs none that I know not.â
The European Parliament, however, must add the next part of the stanza: âBut better ones are needed ere your victoryâs conceded, for well I know whatâs whatâ.
The European Parliament is ready to pursue with you the aims you have outlined, but with the necessary resources and structures.
Let us negotiate on that.
And you are right, MrÂ President of the Commission, when you say that Europe needs less grey and black.
Europe also needs more red!
Â Â  . President-in-Office, you are said to be skilled in drawing and adept at mountaineering.
You have sketched for us a clear picture of your Presidency and you have mapped the contours of your summits.
Your main task over these six months will be to reach agreement with this House on the Unionâs seven-year spending plans.
As one of the backers of the bid to slash the budget, you have belaboured the Union with its lowest capability ever.
This budget will meet not even the demands of Europeâs leaders, let alone the ambitions of our citizens.
That is why Liberals and Democrats will vote today to reject the deal brokered by Mr Blair.
If you are to rebuild confidence in the European project, you need to convince Europeans that the EU works to serve their interests.
The Erasmus Programme is one of our most visible and successful projects, yet the Council is seeking to cut the budget for young people.
The Airbus project is a triumph of common endeavour, yet there will be too little money for research and development to replicate it.
We trust the Council will show willingness to work with this House to redirect money towards priorities like research and development.
Each year, large sums are under-spent or decommitted in areas like agriculture or the structural funds.
These should be kept for EU priorities, not refunded to Member States.
Likewise, the budget should be based on the actual percentage of GNI, rather than nominal figures.
With growth just half a percent greater than forecast, for example, 1.045% of GNI could be worth almost EURÂ 16Â billion more.
Should the Lisbon Agenda truly succeed in making us more competitive, that figure could be even larger.
Can we count on you to study ideas like these for the Interinstitutional Agreement?
Liberals and Democrats look forward to working with you for greater economic competitiveness and more jobs.
You have described this as âthe most urgent task of European policyâ. But this means embracing the opportunities offered by the EU, not shrinking under pressure from protectionists.
In a wider Union, the gates of Vienna are no longer under siege, nor is your way of life threatened by the European Court of Justice.
President-in-Office, 2006 is the European Year of Workersâ Mobility.
How ironic, then, that you seek to prolong â for the first time in EU history â transitional arrangements which hinder the free movement of workers within our Union.
Liberals and Democrats reject a two-tier Europe in which citizens of the new Member States are treated as second class.
Moreover, Europeâs entrepreneurs need all the skilled help they can get in the absence of a consensus on immigration.
Was it not the celebrated Austrian Simon Wiesenthal who said: âFreedom is not a gift of heaven, you have to fight for it every dayâ?
Liberals and Democrats agree.
And we trust you will maintain our commitment to individual liberties and human rights in a world where they are increasingly trodden under foot.
Let us ensure that the European Monitoring Centre for Racism and Xenophobia in Vienna becomes a fully-fledged human rights agency.
And press for a world-wide Human Rights dialogue to tackle the death of democracy in Russia, the fetters on freedom in China and the hypocrisy of an American President who kills Pakistani villagers in the name of democracy and civilisation.
I believe that Austriaâs Presidency could be a service to Europe, and to the world.
If you uphold the promise of transparency made in December and start holding Council meetings in public, citizens will better understand the Union.
If you can rediscover 1998âs âPÃ¶rtschachsgeistâ and set a positive agenda for action Liberals and Democrats will applaud your efforts.
If you work with us and your colleagues to put the constitutional debate back on the rails you will breathe hope into the Unionâs affairs.
We wish you courage and accomplishment in the coming months.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Presidents, ladies and gentlemen, my neighbour has reminded me, Mr President-in-Office, that you play ice hockey.
In that case you will surely forgive me a few body checks.
We all claim to be honest, and we are certainly all trustworthy â no doubt about that.
My friend AlbertÂ Einstein told me the following about quantum theory: if the important thing is to ask the right question, he said, you must always try to find out what has been left out of the question, because that is the important thing at the end of the day.
I shall therefore follow Einsteinâs advice and say this to you: of course you are an honest broker, and of course every country should organise its energy provision as it sees fit.
The problem is: where do we set our research priorities?
Do we give precedence to the old energy source known as nuclear energy or to research into (a) renewables and (b) hydrogen obtained from solar power?
They cannot both be research priorities.
Given a choice between water and coal, we cannot choose both.
You can have your cake, or you can eat it.
It is high time you announced what you yourself wanted rather than simply saying you will go along with whatever the others want.
On the subject of small and medium-sized enterprises, I agree with you, but at some stage a decision will have to be taken here too.
We say yes to flexibility, but also to security.
It would be wrong for us to organise a society in which those who have difficulties with flexibility must also pay the price of insecurity.
In short, we must decide on a system that guarantees both flexibility and security.
You did not say that.
You went on to tell us that we need a market in Europe.
Wonderful!
We are for that too.
You also spoke of the Services Directive.
Interestingly, there is one thing that neither you nor your political ally Mr Poettering mentioned, and I should like to hear what you have to say about it. I refer to the country-of-origin principle.
No one is questioning the principle of freedom to provide services in Europe.
What we are questioning is a country-of-origin principle that will destroy social justice in the Member States.
Are you for it or against it?
You have not told us.
That is the problem with social justice: it shows that there is actually a difference between Right and Left in this Parliament.
Then we come to growth.
You rightly referred to training and qualifications.
The European Union, of course, is not responsible for education, but it can disseminate good practice.
I long for a presidency that will finally get together with the Commission to examine the education system in Europe and conclude, as did the neo-liberal OECD, that the German and Austrian systems are the pits, because they simply do not guarantee equality.
This is not Cohn-Bendit speaking but the OECD in its Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) study.
It is time we understood that.
Germanyâs so-called performance-based system is a disgrace and needs to be reviewed at the European level.
Let us move on to what you did not say, MrÂ President-in-Office.
I should like to know one thing about the European way of life: the European way of life is effectively synonymous with European law.
Is it possible that there are institutions in this world â the CIA, to be precise â that operate in Europe in a legal framework that has nothing to do with the European way of life?
What contribution will the presidency make to support the Committee of Inquiry of the European Parliament and the Council of Europe and to spell out to the United States and the rest of the world that Europe is not a place where any imperial power can feel free to do as it likes.
And I should also like to hear what conflicts Europe is prepared to risk to defend its way of life.
As you see, my friend Albert Einstein was right: a lot of probing is needed when someone does not speak about certain things.
Â Â  . Mr President, MrÂ Barroso, MrÂ SchÃŒssel, your Presidency is getting off to a good start, what with Parliament probably challenging the directive on the liberalisation of port services, the general outcry against the draft financial perspective at the European Council and so on.
You have inherited a minefield.
Good luck!
Some of your predecessors saw their image go from one of triumphant self-confidence to one of pitiful weakness, all in the space of six months.
You are embarking on your Presidency with more modesty, and I think you are right to do so.
I will dwell only on one passage from your memorandum. When you mention the debate on the Constitution, you write in paragraph 8:
We are trying to restore a higher level of receptiveness to peopleâs concerns about the preservation of the European way of life in the context of globalisation.
It is a matter of rebuilding trust in the Unionâs political decision-makers.
There lies the rub, in fact. Yet in the current climate of the peopleâs disaffection with the European institutions, words are no longer enough: practical, clear and convincing acts are required.
As an illustrious ancestor used to say: âthe proof of the pudding is in the eatingâ.
With this in mind, I can see no more meaningful a gesture right now than that of a clear and public call for the rejection or the definitive withdrawal of the draft Services Directive and of any other text drawing its inspiration from the same liberal principles.
Last Thursday, my group brought together in Brussels, to discuss the future of MrÂ Bolkesteinâs symbolic text, more than 200 social actors from throughout the Union, from the confederal secretary of the European Trade Union Confederation to the representatives of the social forum from Poland and Romania, in addition to a large number of local, regional and national elected representatives.
All of them expressed their strong opposition to the Commissionâs text, which was described as being very dangerous by the leaders of the ETUC, for example.
MrÂ SchÃŒssel, you yourself took note at Hampton Court, in October, of the phenomenal way in which this draft directive attracted real opposition in the majority of our countries, once our fellow citizens became aware of its content.
According to some indiscreet sources, you said: âWe cannot save it; we must withdraw itâ.
In our opinion, withdrawing the text is actually the path we should be taking, but not with a view to coming back with a new and slightly amended draft - a âwatered-down Bolkesteinâ, as one of the leaders of ATTAC described it during our meeting on Thursday.
In truth, this matter has served to reveal what an increasing number of Europeans no longer want: workers being pitted against one another, and their social benefits and rights being levelled down as a consequence.
It is this same logic that is rejected by all the port workers throughout the Union, irrespective of which trade union they belong to.
The same goes for the Swedish workers involved in the very symbolic Vaxholm case.
Other similar reports are reaching us from countries such as Finland, Scotland and Ireland.
As the years have gone by, we have surreptitiously gone from having European integration achieved through harmonisation of national legislation - that is to say through political acts and through votes, which at least gave us hope that we could harmonise from the top down â to integration achieved through the market, that is to say through unfettered competition, which naturally tends to lead to a levelling down.
You will not gain the confidence of Europeans, MrÂ President, without making a clean break with this liberal way of thinking, so as to really place the employee and the citizen â and no longer the market â at the centre of the European project.
It is primarily in this light that your Presidency will be judged in six monthsâ time.
Â Â  . Mr President-in-Office, so very wonderful was MrÂ Blairâs Presidency and his contribution to Euroscepticism that we had hoped for an encore of a further six months; but that was not to be.
However, I can assure you that you are our second choice.
We are very grateful to you for your thoughts that somehow the Constitution is not dead, but presumably merely sleeping.
Presumably you think that it will be brought back to life at any time, which according to the press shocked even Mr Barroso from his extended period of reflection.
So carry on as best you can!
Never mind the fact that 70% of your own people in Austria do not approve of the way you have been talking this morning. Never mind that two-thirds of the British people cannot see any benefit in remaining part of this sham Parliament.
Never mind about the ânoâ vote in France; never mind about the ânoâ vote in Holland. From your lofty position your disdain for democracy will be noticed and, I am sure, approved of in many sections of this Parliament.
Meanwhile, on a more mundane level, this is becoming a very expensive club to belong to. Never mind that during the season of goodwill Mr Blair comes along and contributes so much money â GBP 7 billion â that his would-be successor now wishes to have a national patriotic âBritain Dayâ day to try and undo the damage to the perception of the British people.
We have a 63% increase in our budget over seven years, and the Working Time Directive is to be brought in, so we cannot even create that wealth.
What a wonderful agenda!
And to all those who came from Eastern Europe in the hope of getting money, I am sorry, but the cheque is not in the post!
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, we are confident that the Presidency will keep its promises and rekindle peopleâs confidence in the Union, as has been mentioned.
Citizens must have confidence in a Europe which, as everyone knows, needs not just a common foreign policy, but also â and urgently â a revitalised economic policy, which today is shamefully lacking in respect of the twin needs of restoring competitiveness and not losing the social entitlements that underpin the very existence of the Union.
The Union has to rediscover the strength and willpower to make its institutions and its citizens work together.
The only thing that we really have in common today â and then only in 12 countries â is our monetary policy, which is in fact determined by the Central Bank without sufficient political interaction with the other institutions.
We shall have to debate that as well.
We appreciate the Austrian Presidencyâs commitment to resuming our journey towards the Treaty â with the tickets needed, we hope, to make it a smoother and more feasible ride.
We look beyond the wishful thinking and dreams, which are often divorced from the reality that we have to deal with, but in any case there is an ability to dare.
It is important to be able to predict the future realistically and not merely to manage the present.
The commitment to a more united Europe in which the various institutionsâ powers are more clearly defined, to a Europe that is more active and closer to its citizens, should see us united and also determined to address three further problems: immigration, energy and the environment.
On immigration we need a common policy in order to tackle both the humanitarian aspects of the current situation and the threat of international terrorism, which is often brought in with the flows of migrants.
There can only be civilised and worthwhile coexistence leading to true integration so long as non-EU nationals, no matter where they come from, respect the laws and constitutions of our countries.
Without energy there can be no development, just as wasting energy causes irreparable damage.
Energy cannot be separated from security, waste disposal and environmental protection as a common good and a prerequisite for our very survival.
The Member Statesâ finance ministers have not yet taken an active part in tackling the problems associated with climate change, despite the many economic consequences that climate change will have.
It is to be hoped that during the Austrian Presidency we shall also see the finance and planning ministers working on this problem and thinking about the costs in terms of human lives, housing, agriculture and the countryside, as well as reconstruction costs, which the world has had to pay following the recent disasters.
A common environmental policy is needed within the Union, just as it is also needed by the Union in relation to the rest of the world, because it is one of the duties and objectives that we set ourselves during the Conventionâs work on the Treaty.
We appreciate the Presidencyâs interest in the trade and neighbourhood policies.
The latter ought to include compliance with the : I refer to the recent inaccurate â not to say incorrect or false â statements made by a Croatian Government representative.
With regard to trade policy, we must remember to call for human rights to be respected wherever they are not.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ President-in-Office, it has been a lively morning.
Let us continue in that vein.
Like many other people, I am convinced that Europe would be better off if you were seated on the other side this morning, if you were President of the Commission rather than just the temporary President of the Council.
In the very limited time at your disposal, you cannot hope to perform any great exploits, but it is certainly possible to set the tone in areas such as energy and subsidiarity.
In the financial realm too, you can achieve something. But please do not let yourself be led astray by those with a historically proven inability to handle money.
Do not believe that more money automatically brings better results.
The money is actually there.
We do have EUR 112 billion.
The only question is what is done with it.
You said yourself, Chancellor, that the question was the most important thing.
You said yourself that trust had to be built up.
Do that!
Take real action!
Say who gets what, who pays for what, from the European pots of money.
How many euros have the influential banking and media mogul Christian Konrad and his friends already received in support payments for things like hunting grounds?
How many euros do State Governor Erwin PrÃ¶ll, his friends and his relative, the Minister of Agriculture, receive in direct subsidies?
Is it true that 427 influential farmers in Austria, almost all of whom are closely associated with your party, receive more than EUR 72Â 000 every year in direct subsidies?
I could go on.
What about Danone and France?
What about MÃŒller dairy products and Germany?
What about the corporations governed by public law?
Open the doors!
Create real transparency about who gets what.
Open the Council meetings to scrutiny, so that we know how such decisions are reached.
While you are restoring trust, you should concern yourself with the government broadcasting corporation ORF.
What is the editor-in-chief, WernerÂ MÃŒck, doing there now?
And what about the other retainers who keep appearing there?
You have opportunities here; grasp them!
Transform yourself!
Put an end to the age of secrecy in Austrian domestic politics.
Become a European enlightener!
Many millions of European citizens will thank you for it.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ President-in-Office, MrÂ President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, may I bid the President of the Council a warm welcome to the European Parliament.
We Austrians are not the only ones who are pleased to see Wolfgang SchÃŒssel taking over the presidency of the Council.
Your priorities and political principles, Chancellor, are ours too.
In the European Parliament, unlike national parliaments, we sit in a semicircle, because we need each other.
Thank you for urging the institutions to enter into a new spirit of cooperation in place of instinctive confrontation and dis-coordination and day-to-day political posturing.
Your speech made a refreshing change from what we have been hearing over the past few months.
This new approach, however, also demands mutual respect and willingness to engage in dialogue, trust each other and make compromises.
The book , in which you yourself wrote about the strategy of cooperation, contains the following quote from Kofi Annan: âWe donât need any more promises.
We need to start keeping the promises we already madeâ.
I see this as the essence of your speech.
That is why we say yes to efforts to strengthen small and medium-sized enterprises but no to a 70% reduction in the funding of the competitiveness and innovation programme for SMEs.
We say yes to education and must therefore say no to a 40% cut in that part of the budget.
We say yes to a transparent, accessible, democratic, parliamentary, socially responsible, stronger Europe, but this means that we must launch the debate on the political future of the Union and make our citizens stakeholders in Europe.
We say yes to the Services Directive.
Let us develop it into a showpiece of social market economics.
We say yes to an EU based on the Community principle.
Let us continue the development of the EU and bolster the common foreign and security policy.
We must be prepared to talk and listen, because there are many tasks to accomplish.
Let us get to work!
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council, MrÂ President of the Commission, let me begin by saying that the Chancellor did not really tell us very much about future enlargement, although that is, in fact, a priority of the Austrian presidency, firstly as regards Bulgaria and Romania and secondly with regard to preparation of the next steps in south-east Europe.
As far as Bulgaria and Romania are concerned, I should like to remind you of the Councilâs promise to discuss in depth with this Parliament whether accession can take place in 2007, as I hope it does, or whether it will have to be deferred until 2008.
We expect the presidency to honour its commitment to consult us on this matter.
As for south-east Europe, I regard that region as a very high priority.
Tell your colleagues in the Council that it is not a matter of incorporating these countries overnight for want of any other option but rather of maintaining the vision and the possibility of accession so that young people see the logic of remaining in the region instead of depopulating it by emigrating.
There are many tests to be applied.
One such test concerns the way in which the countries in the region treat their minorities.
For us in Parliament, the treatment of minorities is always an important factor.
In this respect, Chancellor, I am already deeply disappointed.
How do you intend to stand up as President of the Council for the protection of minority rights when, in your own country, you cannot persuade your coalition partner, JÃ¶rg Haider, to show a minimum of respect for the Slovenian minority in Austria by having bilingual place-name signs erected?
I also hope you will make every effort, during this particular presidency, to ensure that Austria behaves in an exemplary manner, with no backsliding, not least with a view to gaining international trust.
In connection with enlargement, we sometimes have the impression that heads of government â and you are certainly not alone in this â are very quick to take decisions.
When it comes to conveying to their own population, however, why steps towards enlargement are needed and what there is to be gained from enlargement, they have very little to say.
The Council must consider, together with Parliament and the Commission â for we can only do this together â how we should jointly present this great historic enlargement project to the public, because, as you rightly said, there really is a lack of trust.
We must reflect together on what we can do to overcome that lack of trust.
On the subject of economic problems and unemployment, I must give you my full support.
One of the criteria by which we shall measure your performance is the way in which your welcome pledge to combat unemployment is honoured during this presidency and the extent to which you are prepared to lead the way with specific measures.
In this context it is especially regrettable that, although more funds are available to us for research and development, some of these funds, as you very well know, have been siphoned off from infrastructure development.
The European rail network that is so important to all of us, and particularly to our country, will suffer from the swingeing cutbacks we have made in that domain.
We find this unacceptable, and we should try to make another adjustment here.
MrÂ President-in-Office, we Social Democrats shall judge your presidency objectively.
We shall measure your performance by what you have promised today.
We hope that the Austrian presidency will be a resounding success.
Such is the importance of Europe to us that we could not wish you any less.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Mr President-in-Office, I trust you will forgive me, MrÂ SchÃŒssel, if I compare you here with Zeus, but in fact most heads of government treat Europe as the supreme deity of ancient Greece treated Europa, namely as a lover whom one woos here but who, back home in the company of oneâs wife, is either not mentioned or played down, lest suspicion be aroused.
And the people of our countries react in exactly the same way as children in a family when this lack of clarity prevails.
They are extremely unsettled and distrustful; they become rebellious, as we clearly observed in the ânoâ votes in the French and Dutch referenda.
So you want to impart new impetus to Europe, MrÂ President-in-Office?
You can only do that by setting a good example and creating that long-overdue clarity.
The members of the Council must go home and confess to their relationship with Europe, stand up for her more boldly, see to it that she is given a carefully assessed financial allowance to meet her needs and tell the people back home that the prospects of every single Member State in the global competition for prosperity depend entirely on the existence of a strong, self-confident Europe and that it is the task of Europe to cultivate globalisation.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ President-in-Office, I, too, should like to welcome you here, Chancellor, and wish you success and good fortune wherever you devote yourself to the common European cause.
Following on from a great and almost despairing speech from the Luxembourg President of the Council half a year ago and a great demagogic address from the British President-in-Office, you have presented us with a kind of lesson in European harmony today and have tried to coax a out of the magic political flute.
This , however, cannot obscure the reality that Europe is in crisis.
Its notes cannot drown out the bickering of governments and the constant hubbub of the nationalistic horse-trading bazaar, nor can it drown out Europeâs agonised wailing as governments make it a scapegoat whenever they need one â the very Europe that those governments themselves have created.
I listened with rapt attention and great respect when you talked about the people of Europe, for it has to be said that most governments deny the existence of a European people; it would have momentous implications for the constitutional issue if the people of Europe were taken seriously.
But, to come back to something my colleague Mr Cohn-Bendit mentioned, the magic flute cannot even be heard above the silence of governments â the silence of their suppressed delight at the collapse of a constitution that would have given Europe, the people of Europe, more rights but would have cost governments some of their power.
You are not to be seen in the front line when the time comes to break a lance for European democracy: silence on social issues, Chancellor, and lessons in harmony.
The European way of life is not in danger.
It is not your responsibility anyway.
It has many facets.
People create the European way of life themselves.
What is in danger, though, is the European social model, the social market economy.
Not a word did you say about that.
It is not for freedom that we need a magic flute.
But your cooperation in the CIA affair, in a monstrous assault on fundamental rights at the heart of this Europe, âŠ
Â Â  I should first of all like to extend a warm welcome to Mr SchÃŒssel.
It would be fair to say that two themes will dominate the Austrian Presidency: the failed constitutional process and the services directive.
To put it quite simply, the Dutch and French people have pronounced the Constitution dead; having been rejected by two Member States, it is no longer an issue, and the sooner the European Union can admit this, the sooner we can start the necessary reforms: reducing EU interference in matters of national responsibility, stopping the money wasting and fraud in Europe and carrying out a real democratisation process in the EU.
As for the services directive, Austria is seeking a compromise between the different camps.
If, however, it is the intention to strike a compromise between multinationals on the one hand and trade unions on the other, this will always result in a deterioration of the working conditions in Europe.
Moreover, it will be impossible to compromise on the core of the proposal, namely the country-of-origin principle.
Since my party and my group reject competition in the area of working conditions or social dumping as Europeâs future, we also reject the proposed directive.
Europe did not want a Constitution; it does not want this services directive.
The Austrian Presidency could end up in the history books as the first presidency to really listen to what the people want.
If, however, a decision is made in favour of ramming a constitution and this services directive down peopleâs throats, then this will only strengthen the opposition to European cooperation.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the Austrian Presidency, to whom we offer our best wishes, has many topics on which to reflect: the rejection of the European Constitution, now dead and departed, and the scepticism spreading among Europeâs peoples.
We call on it to focus on a Europe of peoples and a Europe of regions.
I have called for the city of Trieste to be considered the capital of the Europe of regions, since it is a city symbolising a Europe of different ethnic groups and of civilised coexistence among its various peoples.
On the subject of peopleâs rights, I should like to mention the presence here outside Parliament of people from Istria, Dalmatia and Fiume.
I wish to draw attention to the fact that their right to their property has again been trampled underfoot, even though the 1947 peace treaty provided for its protection.
They are still here!
Chancellor SchÃŒssel, I shall give you a dossier on this long-standing and highly sensitive issue.
Let us uphold peopleâs rights and not allow Europe to be a Europe of Brussels technocrats.
The circumstances that have led to peopleâs scepticism are due to the predominance of that Europe of technocrats and banks, a Europe that hopes that Turkey will join and that the Bolkestein directive will be adopted.
We are for a different Europe: a Europe of peoples and regions.
The wise must provide a voice for this deep-held feeling.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I have to say that I was amazed to hear the Austrian Minister for Economic Affairs advocating freezing of the Services Directive, whilst the focus of the Councilâs work plan is on institutional issues.
In this connection, I feel bound to ask whether it is intended to waste six months of our common time debating the rejected Constitutional Treaty?
I would also like to enquire as to what action is planned with a view to creating a common market for services within the European Union and lifting all barriers in the labour market.
After all, it is now quite clear that there is no economic justification for the latter.
I am particularly interested in the reaction to the illegal actions of the Swedish Trade Unions.
Following the Latvian Vaxholm case, they are now planning to damage yet another construction company from a new Member State.
In this case, the company affected is a Polish one named Zojax.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ President-in-Office, if the Austrian presidency wants to combat the catastrophic rejection of the EU by broad sections of the European population, it needs to ask the right questions.
In so doing, it would be wrong to avoid the key question, which is what the end result of this European integration process is supposed to be: a federal superstate with centralist tendencies, to which the abortive constitutional treaty would inevitably have led, or a confederation of states, a Europe of the nations.
It would also be wrong to avoid considering how far Europe stretches and why some place like Islamic Anatolia should ever belong to Europe, or how far eastward enlargement should go and whether the process should not be more thoroughly prepared.
The last unavoidable question is why the Union cannot function unless an even heavier burden is imposed on the top net contributors, to which Austria now also belongs.
I very much hope that you do not continue to circumvent â elegantly, I admit, but embarrassingly â these questions that are central to the very future of Europe.
If you do, peopleâs scepticism towards the EU will continue to grow under the Austrian presidency.
Â Â  President-in-Office, on behalf of the European Democrats in the PPE-DE Group, and as the first British Conservative to speak, I welcome you and wish you well.
You take over the Council Presidency at an important time and, in the wake of the opportunities wasted by the British Presidency, you now have the chance to make real progress in a number of key areas.
I sincerely hope that the economic reform agenda will be taken forward with some urgency.
It stalled under the last Presidency and I urge you not to be deflected from pursuing the case for reform.
I am somewhat concerned about the issue of the Services Directive, on which I believe you are planning some changes, and about your plans to coordinate social security systems.
I hope you will not do anything that would damage the prospects of economic progress under such measures.
I also ask you not to change the Working Time Directive opt-out which, certainly from a UK perspective, has been fundamental to that countryâs economic wellbeing of late.
I warmly welcome your call for a serious discussion on the role of the European Court of Justice.
That is an extremely important debate because the Court has seemed in recent years to extend European competences into areas where there was decidedly no European law.
It is therefore a timely debate and one which I am very pleased will take place.
You have made a number of comments on the European Constitution.
I wish to make it clear that we truly believe it would be sensible for the Constitution not to be resurrected at present.
The remarks by the Dutch Foreign Minister cannot be ignored.
The citizens of Europe do not want a more centralised State and they do not want a centralised Europe.
At Laeken, at the beginning of the Convention process, the leaders stated that they wanted to reconnect the EU and its institutions with the people.
The Constitution failed to do that.
However, the people do want a Europe that deals with jobs, economic growth, the environment, and cooperation in fighting crime and terrorism.
We must break out of the tired debate on institutions and constitutions.
Let us focus on those areas in which the EU can add value to peopleâs quality of life and living standards.
I wish you all good luck.
Â Â  Mr President, Chancellor, I fully agree with what the Chairman of my Group, Mr Schulz, said about the financial perspective.
I sincerely hope, Chancellor, that with your negotiating skills you will show the necessary flexibility in the forthcoming negotiations with Parliament.
The Chairman of my Group also underlined, as you did, how important it is for this spring Presidency to promote more growth and more jobs.
I noted that you said that a possible perspective might be 3% growth and 1% reduction in unemployment in the coming years.
This is a marvellous perspective and one that I endorse, but we need to use the right tools to achieve this target.
Let us do it, but let us use the right tools to achieve it.
I sent you a proposal a few days ago on a new growth strategy which the Socialist Group and the party share.
Mr Schulz and I were in London just a day before Hampton Court, and there the Socialist leaders, presidents and prime ministers decided unanimously to bring before the European Union a new common growth strategy, recognising that we cannot achieve it merely by means of a European Union directive â we do not have the necessary competences.
But we can do it together in a freely decided intergovernmental decision at the forthcoming spring Council meeting.
I sincerely hope that you share this vision brought to you by the Socialist governments of Europe and that you will bring the forces on the other side together, whether they be grey or of any other colour.
It is the results that count, as you said.
This growth strategy has shown that if we boost growth as a combination of reforms and guided demand on intelligent investment in education, in active labour market policy, in child care, in research, in small and medium-sized firms, then we can do it.
But what we need are common decisions at the spring Council and guarded and guided decisions over the next three to four years.
I asked Commission President Barroso a couple of weeks ago whether we can do it.
Could we make a new deal as a new start for the spring summit?
I got the impression, Mr Barroso, that you said âlet us give it a tryâ.
You have the opportunity, and if you do it, not only will the people of Europe hear the sound of Europe, but we will hear the voice of the people and then they will begin to listen to us.
And then they will be ready to discuss a new treaty for Europe.
Is that not worthwhile?
I think it is.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ President-in-Office, you have many important tasks ahead of you in the next six months.
You enumerated these tasks, and most of them relate to our everyday work here.
I believe, however, that you have a far more basic task to undertake, namely to rediscover the European identity.
If that common identity is not visible, it immediately raises a question: from where does the European Union draw its legitimacy?
You must look for answers to the question whether Europe is worthwhile for me or any other individual.
Is it politically worthwhile? Is it financially worthwhile?
How is Europe actually visible in my everyday life?
What shows me that I am a European?
This is why you must conduct a public debate.
Allow controversial contributions, for I am convinced that those who shut out criticism do more harm to Europe than its critics.
At the same time, have the courage to launch unusual initiatives.
I must say that I am very impressed by your activities in the arts.
You are, after all, in charge of . You are a team player.
You are used to playing a tough game.
Half of your ministers are women.
So make Europe come alive in peopleâs minds!
That would be a success.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Federal Chancellor, there are three quite specific concerns that I should like to commend particularly to the current presidency of the Council.
The first relates to the protection of minorities.
We ethnic Austrians living in the Southern Tyrol/Alto Adige region have always received a great deal of understanding and support from Vienna.
Let Austria be equally magnanimous towards the minorities within its own boundaries, such as the Carinthian Slovenes.
What is happening at the present time in the dispute over place-name signs in Carinthia is grotesque.
The second relates to ratification of the Transport Protocol to the Alpine Convention.
If Austria does not settle this matter, which has long been a concern of the Alpine countries, who will?
The third relates to the need to prevent the construction of the Brenner base tunnel.
Building a high-speed railway through the Alps is very hazardous for many reasons: mixed traffic on the old line and on the projected new line, high-speed passenger trains travelling through so many and such long tunnels, goods traffic on the Alpine railway, which would cause unreasonable nuisance to those who live nearby, and the premature construction of the tunnel complex itself without the simultaneous construction of the feeder lines.
This new megaproject would be even more unprofitable than the Eurotunnel under the English Channel.
Â Â  MrÂ President, let me begin by welcoming the changeover to the Austrian presidency.
Perhaps we shall now have hard and fast policies in place of all the air bubbles we had during the British presidency.
Yet even so, MrÂ SchÃŒssel, the programme for your presidency of the EU is alarming, especially in the field of foreign and military policy.
On the one hand, we are told that the next steps with regard to the Treaty on a Constitution for Europe must be openly discussed.
That is all very well, but the present constitutional treaty is dead.
All we need now, essentially, is a date for the burial.
On the other hand, some parts of the constitutional treaty which are needed for the pursuit of the Unionâs military policy are simply being applied without ratification.
This programme for the domain of military policy poses particular problems for a neutral country.
Let me cite two examples: firstly, efforts are to be made to have the battle groups combat-ready by 1Â JanuaryÂ 2007; secondly, special priority is to be given to the so-called European Defence Agency.
Do not give the EU a military face, Mr SchÃŒssel; let it have a civilian and civilised one.
Â Â  â Chancellor, the recipe for success is very simple: take a large photograph of Blair, hang it opposite your desk and write underneath it 'I must not copy'.
You are sure to succeed.
The other recipe is not to be conciliatory.
Stand by what you believe in.
The conciliatoriness of 3 October 2005 is engraved in our memory.
Another matter is that you should confine control of the Americans to the area and to the work of the CIA.
Make sure they do not drag you into new ventures in the Middle East and do not, of course, try to resurrect the Constitution.
What is dead is dead. It cannot be the vision for the peoples of Europe.
On the other hand, look at changing the Maastricht indicators, because the developing countries of Europe cannot follow them.
No to the strong euro which prevents industrial growth and no, of course, to the high interest rates which are ruining households.
Another thing: when you applied in 1945 to join the UN as the Germanic Republic of Austria, you were told no 'Germanic'.
Now we are saying no 'Macedonia' in FYROM.
Â Â  Today the European Union is faced with such important internal and external challenges that it is not enough for the country currently holding the Presidency merely to continue with the work already begun.
Does the Presidencyâs proposed work programme reflect the essential tasks for the European Union?
In my view, the Presidency has pointed out accurately enough those problems which, unresolved, make it difficult to conceive of further successful development of the European Union.
Clear answers must be found to the fundamental questions concerning the limits of the European Unionâs enlargement and the extent of integration. This would make it possible to return to the debates on the Constitution with an altered level of mutual understanding.
In the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy now is the last chance to match the intensity of day-to-day activities with the deadlines for its completion.
A decision regarding the liberalisation of the services sector would not only open up new sources of economic activity within the context of the European Union market, but would also be the most significant support for the development of small and medium-sized enterprises that the European Union can provide.
Strategic decisions in the field of security of energy supply are also a pressing task, in order to direct business research and infrastructure development activities into a strategic channel without delay.
The country currently holding the Presidency should therefore not delay in setting out the fundamental problems and directing the Member States to seek solutions to them during the period of this Presidency.
Â Â  I have time to give only a very concise and basic message.
Today at noon the European Parliament will reject the Councilâs position concerning the long-term financial outlook for 2007-2013.
The Parliament will also send aÂ signal that it is prepared to continue discussing the financial outlook under the Austrian presidency, with the aim of reaching an agreement.
This may create the conditions for Parliament to approve the budget at its plenary session in late March.
Unless we are prepared to countenance aÂ crisis within EU institutions, half of the Austrian presidencyâs term will thus be overshadowed by efforts to find agreement on the budget.
Finalising the budget outlook and incorporating at least some of the suggestions put forward by the European Parliament may prove instrumental for the attainment of some of the goals of the Austrian presidency.
It may also prove instrumental in helping to meet the expectations of EU citizens in areas such asÂ education, job creation, labour flexibility and cohesion policy.
Â Â  Mr President, Chancellor, there is no question that six months is not sufficient time to demand that the Chancellor resolve the current crisis in Europe by the end of his mandate.
Nevertheless, six months may be long enough to point out the appropriate direction for this change and rectification that the European Union requires.
I am therefore simply going to talk about two urgent issues which I believe are facing the European Union.
Firstly, having heard all of us, Chancellor, you will see that the European Union has no problem with words, since almost all of us are asking for the same thing: more Europe and the incorporation of real problems into the operation of the European Union.
The problem is not one of words, but one of attitudes.
Every institution must adjust its attitude again and again when dealing with issues affecting Europeans.
When the day comes when the European Parliament does not examine what the President-in-Office of the European Council is doing but rather what the Heads of Government that are not holding the Presidency are doing in the Councils, we shall undoubtedly be dealing with one of the problems of the European Union, which is the lack of tenacity, the lack of constant work on the part of all of the governments, even though they may not be holding the Presidency of the European Council.
Secondly, Chancellor, within a few years, Europeans are going to have to identify and acknowledge the European Unionâs political role in relation to the great problems facing us: energy, immigration, terrorism, growth and employment.
At the moment, Europeans do not know what the European Union is doing on any of these issues; they do not evaluate, they do not criticise, they do not judge, because they do not know what the European Union is doing in these areas.
We need to do some political work in order to make the public aware of what the European Union and its institutions are doing in these fields.
That is the second great urgent issue facing the Union, Chancellor.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ President-in-Office, you have chosen Mozartâs 250th anniversary, Chancellor, as one of the of your presidential programme.
Some other Members have taken up that theme.
With all due respect to Mozart, a different Austrian and European whose birth we commemorate this year would probably be more useful to us in providing therapy for Europeâs ailments.
I am thinking here of SigmundÂ Freud, whose work included the study of inferiority complexes, frustration and narcissism, all of them conditions which seem to affect the European psyche. We have many inferiority complexes.
You referred yourself to the European way of life.
That is primarily a model built on social justice, a model we should be exporting. We should not be importing neo-liberal models into Europe from other parts of the world.
I therefore appeal to you, MrÂ President-in-Office, to seek musical harmony with CondoleezzaÂ Rice and the Bush Administration but not to sing from their political song sheet.
Represent Europe self-confidently in the world.
Frustration, as we know from Freud, derives from unfulfilled expectations.
These are something that Europe provides all too often.
For example, we promise thirty priority transport projects, and then a Financial Perspective is adopted which makes it impossible to fund these projects from either European or national resources.
In Austria itself, your own Deputy Chancellor has already written off a project to which I attach great importance, namely the rail link between Prague and Linz.
All of this, I believe, has to do with another condition that is especially prevalent in the European Council, namely narcissism and excessive egocentricity, which repeatedly prevent us from bringing Europe any further forward.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Chancellor, MrÂ President of the Commission, we reject the December budget agreement because it by no means fulfils the objectives of a more dynamic and competitive EU and because it does not guarantee an EU with a larger role on the international stage.
Both you, MrÂ Barroso, and you, MrÂ SchÃŒssel, have good advice on what we in the European Parliament should request and not request in the budget negotiations.
We should like first and foremost, however, to have a larger and more flexible framework, and both of you have of course shown today that we shall need such a framework.
MrÂ SchÃŒssel, you are right in saying that it is time to draw a line under the more ideological opposition to an EU tax, for it is clear that, following enlargement, we are in a new situation.
Not only are there far more countries around the table, but there are bigger differences between us in terms of prosperity.
We must find a replacement for the present method of funding, which involves contributions from the national exchequers.
Each country attaches far too much importance to its net contribution, rather than looking at the bigger picture.
I agree that that is something we must draw a line under.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ SchÃŒssel, in the , you supplied a vital piece of information: you pointed out that the Court of Justice should not use its judgments for the purposes of transferring powers to the Commission, and this outside the framework of the Treaties.
We congratulate you on your ability to make things clear.
In fact, the case law demonstrated by the âMarks [amp] Spencerâ judgment of 13Â December 2005 shows that the Court of Justice has a teleological take on the Treaties that leads it to go beyond its rights.
We want our Assembly, taking its lead from your Presidency, to redefine the role of the Court of Justice and to limit the consequences of its decisions.
MrÂ SchÃŒssel, if you want to reconcile the nations with Europe, then you should have only one aim: to use your authority to put the power back in the hands of the sovereign nations.
Â Â  â Mr President-in-Office of the Council, what I expect from your Presidency is progress over negotiations on the European Constitution.
I expect you finally to pluck up the courage to tell our citizens, loud and clear, that the text being foisted upon them by the politicians is impenetrable, iniquitous and, more importantly, does not in any way solve the crisis currently facing the European Union.
There is in fact a precedent for European integration, an important foundation on which Austria can base this announcement to our citizens.
Less than a hundred years ago, the Austro-Hungarian Empire was a unique confederation with common ministries for foreign affairs, war and finance, as well as a High Court of Auditors.
It was made up of 21 European countries, in which the citizens spoke a number of languages, and it lasted for 51 years.
What was its undoing?
Nobody had the courage to solve the kind of problems that such co-existence naturally brings.
Politicians believed that problems would simply disappear of their own accord over time; and we know what came of that.
I therefore hope, Mr President, that Austria will not take the same route as its predecessors, but will instead advocate that the European Constitution be recast in such a way that it is workable, concise, comprehensible and just.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the Austrian Presidency is starting at not an easy time for Europe, even though the agreement on the financial perspective may represent the beginning of a new chapter.
The Union is faced, in fact, with a major attack from within and just as dangerous a threat from outside.
The attack from within is coming from those who do not believe, or no longer believe, in the fundamental role that Europe can and must play.
They are riding on a credibility crisis that has alienated too many citizens from institutions that they consider distant and governed by an all-powerful but inept bureaucracy.
Europeans want a political Union that can solve those problems of theirs to which Member States and local bodies are unable to provide answers.
That is why we must work for a more political Europe that reaches out to take care of peopleâs interests.
We need a strong commitment to economic growth, which will create jobs; we need aid for small and medium-sized enterprises â as you mentioned â as well as budget reform and measures to address the important issue of immigration.
There is also a need for a Constitution to enable us to attain these objectives, to simplify the legislative process, and to guarantee the continuity of political action.
We are convinced that we can make progress in that direction over the next six months, and we look forward with confidence to 2007, when the German Presidency will happily coincide with the fiftieth anniversary of the signing of the Community Treaties and we can make constructive choices for the future of Europe.
The Constitution is not dead: having it enter into force is a fundamental objective for us to pursue.
The threat from outside is that of terrorism.
We have to defend ourselves by enhancing internal cooperation, not only through judicial and policing initiatives, but above all by means of political action to make the Union a key player in bringing peace to the Middle East.
The war on terrorism is waged primarily in that part of the world.
Guaranteeing security for Israel and creating a Palestinian state are the keys to seeing freedom and peace triumph over violence and fundamentalism.
Chancellor, and the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats endorse the Austrian Presidencyâs proposals to revitalise Europeâs role and to close the gap between the Unionâs institutions and its citizens.
You can count on our help.
We wish you every success in your work, MrÂ SchÃŒssel.
Â Â  Presidents, ladies and gentlemen, our discussions on the Financial Perspective are about to take place.
You said at the beginning, Chancellor, that you were familiar with annual budgets from working with the national budget in Austria.
We have one of those at the European level too. The difference is that we also have to try, within the framework of a voluntary Interinstitutional Agreement between Parliament and the Council, to lay down common rules for a period of seven years governing both the volume of resources and their use.
Since this is a voluntary agreement between two institutions, it is hardly surprising that one of the institutions is not prepared simply to accept the figures adopted at a summit meeting of the other institution on the basis of an assurance that the latter had gone as far as it could and that there was no more to be had.
That would be the last straw!
Any Parliament that relied on such an assurance would be jeopardising one of its fundamental rights and reneging on its corresponding legal and practical responsibilities.
Let us take a close look at your figures.
We adopted the budget for 2006 only a few weeks ago. It amounts to 1.09% of GNP.
In the Council, you said we should have to make do in future with 1.045%, which is considerably less.
At the same time, we have major tasks ahead of us that have to be accomplished.
These, however, can either not be adequately funded from a budget of this size, which would mean disappointing people, or else we must think of ways to achieve greater flexibility, so that we can keep our promises.
Your pruning strategy gives us decisions to take.
In which areas do you actually want to make cuts?
In the fight against terrorism?
I have heard that Europol is to be reinforced.
In the realm of air safety, for which we are setting up an agency?
I do not believe we can afford to make any savings in these areas.
What about exchanges of school pupils, students and trainees, who travel to other European countries to develop their own skills, work in a European environment and make themselves competitive in years to come?
Surely these exchanges are essential!
Research, you said, should be a national responsibility.
Satellite navigation, large-scale lasers, neutron sources, genome banks: should research in all of these fields be limited to national efforts?
I do not think that is the way forward.
We have done a great deal of work here to put a good proposal on the table.
We shall negotiate responsibly with you, in a spirit of mutual trust, to determine what is possible.
As Europeans, however, I believe we, all of us, should consider what this Europe is actually worth to us.
Before any figures in billions are bandied about, let me say that I worked this out for the other German Members and myself.
Our proposal means that every German would have to spend ten euros a month in future to make all these things happen.
Anyone out there who says that we are utterly irrational in the European Parliament or that we are overshooting the mark really has no idea what Europe is worth.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ Barroso, MrÂ SchÃŒssel, âA whole new way of thinking is needed in order to solve the problems we have created with the old way of thinkingâ, said Albert Einstein, whom we mentioned earlier.
I therefore have some specific questions.
What, in practical terms, does the Presidency intend to do for small and medium-sized enterprises?
You say that you intend to create jobs through energy policy.
Can you explain how?
Do you intend to support voluntary or compulsory targets where alternative energy and biomass are concerned?
That is also a very important issue.
As is well-known, it is easier to fight for oneâs principles than to live up to them.
You talk a lot about the environment and consumer power.
I therefore wish to ask, on the subject of the Chemicals Directive, whether you will fight to ensure that it is possible to replace the most dangerous chemicals of all and whether you will improve the Council agreement reached in December?
Will you add the right for the consumer to know which dangerous chemicals the product contains?
Finally, I should like to thank you for a very good conference in Vienna last week and wish you good luck with the Presidency.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I listened to you very carefully, MrÂ SchÃŒssel, and I wish you every success as this new year begins.
The UK Presidency was all about fine speeches.
Your own Presidency has to be all about action.
Humble proposals and effective action are required.
What Europeans expect from you is not more flowery rhetoric and endless broken promises; they expect real practical action relevant to everyday life.
I approve of your desire to restore confidence among Europeans, but you will forgive me if I am still sceptical.
I will take just the one example, which is particularly close to my heart: paediatric medicines.
Today, our children have very few medicines developed specially for them.
We can conclude this matter as quickly as possible.
Our Parliament voted at first reading, and the Council gave its political agreement, but the common position seems to be held up for unjustified reasons.
I am waiting for you personally, MrÂ SchÃŒssel, to make a commitment - before us in this Chamber - to make this text a priority with a view to bringing it to fruition under your Presidency.
I am concerned because I have not, in your programme, found the slightest mention of this extremely important matter, which is designed to benefit our children and which shows everyone the added value contributed by Europe.
I await your support and, in return, you will be able to count on my determination.
MrÂ SchÃŒssel, restoring the European Parliamentâs confidence in the Council will be a hard task because Europe cannot survive without a real budget.
There is so much that we need to do, build and develop and so much that we need to bring to each citizen.
Well, with what the Council is proposing â with this poor Council agreement on the financial perspective â we can, as it were, stop our parliamentary activities immediately, shut up shop and go on holiday.
Keep that squarely in mind.
MrÂ SchÃŒssel, I wish you luck.
Â Â  Mr President, as regards the 2007-2013 budget, please make every effort as Chancellor of the neighbouring state to ensure that the Interinstitutional Agreement is concluded, because new Member States have no time to waste.
If the seven-year draft budget is not in place, we will lose two thirds of our assistance, and if the draft is delayed any longer, we will not be able to prepare for the large structural and cohesion projects.
We believe that it is very important to have a better budget, but we would like to preserve all the positive, significant opportunities given to new Member States in December in respect of the utilisation of structural and cohesion funds.
As regards the Constitution, this was the first enlargement that had not been preceded by deepening.
Deepening cannot be achieved without the Constitution, and you can count on Hungary in this respect; two states cannot block 23 others.
As regards the competitiveness of the European Union, the Services Directive and the liberalisation of the free movement of labour are indispensable.
In Ireland, for instance, unemployment did not rise, but actually fell following liberalisation of the free movement of labour.
Finally, as a Hungarian, I am very pleased that you are dealing with the Balkans, because there is a great danger: if the status of Montenegro and Kosovo is not settled by the European Union, there will be destabilisation in the West Balkans, because the Americans do not know much about minority issues.
At the same time, as President of the Minority Intergroup, I would like to repeat what Mr Hannes Swoboda has already said, and I look forward to your answer, Mr President, regarding the issue of the Austrian Slovenes.
Â Â  President-in-Office, President Chirac says he would like piecemeal reform.
Mr Sarkozy says he wants a concentrated constitution and a core group of the six larger Member States.
MrsÂ Merkel says she would like a social protocol.
MrÂ Juncker and Mr Verhofstadt want a renegotiation of the treaty.
Mr Bot says that the project is finished.
Prime Minister Blair maintains a profound silence on the whole question.
Which of your colleagues can be right?
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, MrÂ Barroso, we broadly welcome the main guidelines, and as I have just two minutes, I shall touch on two points which, to my mind, should be examined without double standards.
The first of these is energy security.
Most of our fossil fuels come from areas suffering major political instability, such as the Middle East, Venezuela, Nigeria and Algeria.
No matter how much we reassess our reserves, and we negotiate long-term contracts, there will always be a threat to our energy supplies in Europe.
The time has come to examine the nuclear option with a cool head, because otherwise we will be living with this sword dangling permanently above our heads.
The second issue to which you referred, Mr SchÃŒssel, was that of growth, employment, globalisation and the Lisbon Strategy.
On this issue, we must once again avoid double standards.
I cannot recall any European project that has not been realised, developed and monitored by the Commission.
The time has come to say that this strategy, which has been pursued not on the basis of a Commission proposal but on the basis of intergovernmentalism, has stagnated and is not working.
The Commission must be called upon to do more.
It needs to set out and monitor a roadmap, as happened with the internal market and the single currency.
We still believe that the notion that intergovernmentalism can help the Lisbon Strategy to thrive is deeply flawed.
We must not pull the wool over the citizensâ eyes; what we should say is: give the Commission the power that it needs to help the Lisbon Strategy to work.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, having listened to your programme I feel relieved, firstly because of the clearness of a sentence that you uttered early on in your speech: âThere is a need for more Europeâ.
I do not think that that is a mere clichÃ©, because in my view it represents the crux of the difference between us at this time.
There are some who think that we can only find a way out of this impasse by taking a leap forward along the road to integration and a political Europe, whereas others delude themselves that we can have great projects and great objectives while cutting back on Europeâs ambitions, resources and policies.
That is a fallacy, a deception that we have seen before from those who actually have a hidden agenda and from those in the Member States that do not want to accept their own responsibilities.
The other significant word, MrÂ President-in-Office, is âconsistencyâ: if we want that Europe of which you have spoken, we shall need your help.
Please help us â Parliament â over the coming weeks to change the financial perspective, which was the result of national fears and self-interest, and is likely to destroy Europe instead.
Help us to get the constitutional process off the ground again, in order to aim for greater integration, to put the Treaty of Nice behind us as soon as possible, and to ensure that, insofar as the Treaties allow, we and the countries that so desire can at any rate press ahead with policies that are essential for the Union.
I speak of consistency because that is the most difficult concept to guarantee at this time.
It is inconsistency, however, and those declarations that are sometimes heard even here in Parliament but are not confirmed by events, which are today the main reasons for the gap between Europe and its institutions and Europeâs citizens.
Â Â  Mr President of the Commission, Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start with an observation about this debate.
It is very striking, to my mind, that the arguments that are used on the extreme Left, on the extreme Right and by the independentist forces are identical.
Maybe this is food for thought.
Let me now turn to the presidencyâs programme, MrÂ SchÃŒssel.
First of all, also on behalf of my group, I should like to wish you all the very best with it.
Above all, though, I should like to congratulate you on, and wish you well with, the focus on the Balkans with a particular emphasis on the Western Balkans, and wish you all the best for the conference in Salzburg.
In these times of what is known as enlargement fatigue, this is a very important sign, for which I, on behalf of my group, am particularly indebted to you.
Â Â  Mr President, most continents take billions of years to develop.
The Erste Bank, which one can certainly regard as a continent, started out in 1997 with 60Â 000 customers and has grown to the point where it has, today â according to what I have just read in an advertisement â 12.5 million account holders in Austria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Croatia and Slovenia.
Mr President, Austria has made use of the unique opportunities provided by reunification, and is to be congratulated for it.
At the same time, Austria is one of those Member States who know very well what still needs to be done before we take the enlargement one step further, to ensure that the 2004 enlargement is effective, opportunities are gradually equalised and dissimilarities are reduced.
Economic growth, more jobs â this is the topic of the Presidency Conference to be held in March.
In order to achieve this, we expect the Austrian Presidency to ensure that Europe is not divided by unjustified or artificially induced fears.
The free movement of people or services must be on the agenda.
What we need is an obstacle-free common market.
The countries that joined in 2004 suffer from the complete absence of a strong stratum of small and medium-sized enterprises.
We expect the Austrian Presidency to propose initiatives in conjunction with national governments to ensure that SMEs, which create the majority of jobs, are encouraged to take root and develop in these countries, as well.
Regulation or a framework programme for competitiveness must be on the agenda.
We expect the Austrian Presidency to ensure that, together with Parliament, we achieve a numerical improvement in the seven-year budget.
And when this is done, we must immediately facilitate the utilisation of available funds!
Let us eliminate, at last, the obstacles that hinder the already difficult utilisation of funds, whether by delays in time or the excessive restrictions imposed.
The objective is not repayment at the end of the year, but utilisation.
We need a more flexible budget.
Mr Chancellor, we welcome the Austrian Presidency and count on you.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I could have been Austrian because I come from a region â Brittany â in which, in the 15th century, the daughter of the Duke was married to Maximillian of Austria. However, the marriage was unconsummated and broken off, which makes me a sixteenth generation French citizen.
I used this historical reference for the purposes of capturing your attention and of illustrating a strong argument regarding the budget.
Firstly, be wary of this Parliament because it is a parliament under construction, and therefore it sometimes rebels: MrÂ Buttiglione did not bow down to the criticism made of him.
As for the dockworkers: the intention is to serve us up the same old menu, but we are not going to eat from it and we are going to cast a simple majority vote.
Be wary of this Parliament. âWaryâ is not the right word, but Parliament can react and it can rebel.
Parliament therefore needs to be given a bit of money or, rather, a bit of extra money.
I am going to point out a heading that I would like to see receive a bit of extra money: citizenship, youth, education and culture.
Put a bit of extra money into that!
Why?
Because, as a French citizen, what took place in my country on 29Â May has left a deep impression on me.
As far as I am concerned, 29Â May is an historic date.
It is not just any old date, and the debates in which I have participated have at times been harsh: it is all very well talking about the market and the euro, but you should put a few more resources into that heading.
Do it for the sake of European awareness, because history is reversible.
Any treaty that has been concluded can be broken.
Â Â  MrÂ President, at the start of the Austrian Presidency I should like to wish ChancellorÂ Schussel every success.
I trust the European Unionâs common foreign policy will be part of that success.
Democracy, human rights and peace are crucial to a number of issues the Union is currently dealing with.
I refer to Iran, Russia and China.
Europe should speak with a single common voice in all three cases, not only because what Europe says should demonstrate the ethical dimension of European foreign policy, but also to ensure that the relevant instruments are applied, even though we do not yet have a Constitutional Treaty.
Two Member States of the European Union are permanent members of the UN Security Council.
Four Member States of the Union belong to the G8.
One of these countries ought to be authorised to represent the European Union and speak on its behalf.
I hope this will come about during your term in office, Chancellor.
Â Â  MrÂ President, to the President-in-Office of the Council and the President of the Commission I want to say the following: let us stop talking about the Lisbon Process as a process in itself.
Let us instead talk about what we have done and what we need to do in order to turn the relevant aims and demands into reality, by which I mean achieve European competitiveness.
Otherwise, all references to the Lisbon Process will be no more than a device for distracting attention from what is not being done.
Let us talk about what needs, in actual fact, to be done.
Implement the Services Directive.
That is the most practical thing we can do to strengthen European competitiveness.
Ensure that it is done on the basis of a respect for European diversity that makes the most of each countryâs competitiveness.
That is not only the most important measure for strengthening European competitiveness, it is also the most important thing we can do to bring about the reunification of Europe and ensure that all European countries can experience growth, as well as relations unimpeded by borders.
Ensure that the long-term budget that emerges from the negotiations with Parliament is characterised by higher priority being given to research and development.
This is one of the individual measures we can take that will help more than anything else to turn Europe into a leading knowledge-based society.
Ensure that Europe can take vigorous unified action in the context of its policy on Iran, which is at present conducting a policy that is neither acceptable in the international community nor in accordance with the demands that need to be made of every country.
A country that threatens to annihilate another country, that secretly develops nuclear fuel technology and that supports terrorism must be confronted by a common unified European policy in alliance with our international partners.
These tasks are basically European ones that show why European cooperation is needed.
The Council and the Commission have a great responsibility to ensure that policy is characterised by practical efforts to implement the relevant measures.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, almost two years ago, as we were about to join the distinguished and respected association which the European Union undoubtedly is, it was our assumption that we would become equal members, accorded the same status as the other members, and that the citizens of our states would enjoy the same rights, just as when Austria acceded to the EU.
It appears, however, that some countries are finding it difficult to uphold the full range of freedoms on which the EU was initially based.
IÂ would like to urge Mr SchÃŒssel and the Commissioner, Mrs Ferrero Waldner, as Austriaâs representatives in the European Commission, to make sure that these highly discriminatory measures are dismantled during the Austrian presidency.
I am an MEP for Slovakia and I firmly believe, Chancellor, that the citizens of the Slovak Republic as well as the citizens of all the other Member States that have recently acceded to the Union should be enjoying the same rights as the citizens of the other EU Member States.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr SchÃŒssel, you can be certain that, after a presidency that was characterised by stagnation, our expectations of the Austrian Presidency are particularly high.
It is up to you, Mr SchÃŒssel, building on the report that is due to be issued during your period in office, to outline perspectives for the future of Europe.
This is not just about the European Constitution, although the fact is that Europe cannot grow any further without it.
It is also about Europeâs future prosperity, growth and employment.
The Council must set priorities, thus giving true shape to the Lisbon Strategy.
That is also how competitiveness is strengthened and the European model of prosperity safeguarded.
It is also about the future of the European social model, which MrÂ SchÃŒssel was right to mention this morning.
Six months ago, Prime Minister Blair was unstinting in his efforts to modernise the European social model.
An additional summit was dedicated to it, albeit without any tangible results to show for it.
No answer has been found to the challenge of globalisation and no measures have been taken to re-anchor the European social model in a society that is changing and ageing, one in which the number of young people is decreasing, and a society in which borders are no longer borders.
I would urge Mr SchÃŒssel to ensure that his presidency goes beyond fine rhetoric.
Let us work together to breathe new life into our European social model, and let us then tackle those who create differences between the market and its smooth functioning on the one hand and social policy â which is so crucial to our citizensâ well-being â on the other.
It is not a matter of doubt that Christian Democrats, too, see the socially oriented market economy as the cornerstone of a society that builds on people.
I admit that in my own circles, and among the Socialists too, free market thinking is gaining ground and that one sometimes has the feeling of being a voice in the wilderness.
I hope that this presidency, along with the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs which is set to report on this, will manage to put this on a surer foundation.
I would thank the President very much for being accommodating in this respect.
Â Â  â Mr President, now that the financial crisis at the December European Council has been successfully headed off, we are facing the tasks of overcoming the institutional crisis and of putting the Union on the kind of footing that will enable it to address the challenges posed by the globalised world.
I warmly welcome the fact that one of Austriaâs stated priorities is to put the European Constitution back on the agenda.
In this regard, however, I should like to warn of the pitfalls lying in wait along the route that the Commission â and Parliament, albeit only in part â have chosen to follow, which is to hold more and more debates on citizensâ expectations, and subsequently to prepare a new text that would seek both to resolve the issue of institutional reform and to address all of Europeâs economic, social and security-related problems.
If we strike out on that path we shall be repeating the mistake that lay at the root of last yearâs failed referendums, when anyone harbouring reservations over the EUâs internal policies rallied in opposition to the Constitution, irrespective of their views on the Unionâs institutional framework.
We made the mistake of putting forward for ratification a Constitution which, alongside the rules on the functioning of institutions, also contained a summary of all common policies.
What we now need, ahead of the forthcoming enlargement and in the light of ongoing changes to the international order, is to separate the constitutional framework, namely the first and second parts of the constitutional treaty, from the common policies in the third part.
The first and second parts of the Constitution were not the subject of debate before the referendum, and their ratification would enable us to seek workable solutions to the most contentious issues currently affecting the continent, by reforming the rules governing institutional competencies.
If we wish to solve everything in one go, we shall once again end up solving nothing.
The main outcome of the Austrian Presidency should be a workable plan, whereby debate over the reform of Europeâs institutions is kept separate from the general debate on other problems affecting Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, Presidents of the three institutions, ladies and gentlemen, there is no such thing as a miracle formula for a successful presidency, but ambition and constructive cooperation between the institutions go a long way towards that end, and, as you have heard, you can count on our groupâs support.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we will not be able to assess whether your presidency will have been successful until six months down the line, but in order to put you on the right track â or keep you on it, for I greatly appreciated your introduction â there are two concrete suggestions I should like to make.
Firstly, I would urge you to find a structural solution to the long-standing issue concerning the definitive list of goods and services that are eligible for the optional reduced VAT rate.
We have procrastinated long enough.
We must now take decisions.
The industries that are shown the carrot of the reduced rate â which includes the catering industry, but also other SME sectors â do not get what they want.
Those who have emerged from the experiment with labour-intensive services, which has been extended three times, are in untenable legal uncertainty.
Since I do not believe that the Commission will be able to tolerate manifest infringements of the sixth VAT directive for much longer, this strikes me as a priority area for action.
Secondly, I am delighted to hear that you would like to combine openness and protection in the services directive.
In this House, we do not shirk the hard work either in order to reach a widely supported, positive majority.
If you compare the Commissionâs original proposal with the result of the work in this Parliamentâs Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection, you will see that a different approach is possible through amendments.
If the Council supports us in this long-term ambition, this delicate dossier may well be able to turn a corner under your presidency.
I wish the Austrian Presidency â in the service of the European Union, as you yourself have put it â much success in these two, but also in the other, items on the agenda.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ SchÃŒssel, allow me to adopt something of MrÂ Poignantâs tone and add a few things of my own to this budgetary wish list.
Unfortunately, the budget is too small.
Your country, Austria, is a member of the âclub of sixâ, the âone per cent clubâ, the âclub of penny pinchersâ which wants more Europe with less money.
Yet, as the Presidency, MrÂ SchÃŒssel, you must allocate more money to the Neighbourhood Policy in the East and to this new challenge constituted by EU energy security.
Otherwise, we are going to rebel against the overly greedy Councils, just like MrÂ Poignant said.
The Austrian Presidencyâs intention to work for growth and jobs, competitiveness and the Lisbon Agenda is most laudable.
Such objectives can be achieved only through the completion of the internal market.
The best service we can render to Lisbon, growth and jobs is to open labour and services markets.
Austria has explicitly recognised in its White Paper that the Services Directive is essential for completing the internal market and reinforcing European competitiveness.
Yet when it comes to taking concrete steps to achieve the declared objectives, the Presidencyâs pronouncements are much less reassuring.
Soon there will be an initial review of the transition period for introducing freedom of movement of workers.
But Austria declared that it will use this opportunity to extend the transition period in the area of free movement of workers, and it takes the reductionist position on the free movement of services.
Are Austriaâs declarations as Presidency consistent with its intentions as a Member State?
On the one hand, the Presidencyâs declared objective is boldness in fighting for Europeâs competitiveness, on the other, Vienna strives to stifle Europeâs potential.
Enlargement was supposed to bring the European Union great benefits, increasing its competitiveness in global trade, largely through the influx of highly qualified, mobile and relatively cheap labour.
Now, certain Member States, including Austria, regardless of the positive examples of Great Britain, Ireland and Sweden, want to forgo those crucial benefits, introducing transition periods immediately after enlargement.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr Federal Chancellor and President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I am actually very happy with the way in which roles are allocated in the European Union, with Chancellor SchÃŒssel as both Chancellor and President of the Council and President Barroso chairing the Commission.
This arrangement is beneficial for the European Union and also for our own country.
Fortuitously enough, the commencement of the Austrian Presidency of the Council coincides with my departure from the European Parliament at the end of ten years in which I have had the privilege of leading the delegation of the Austrian Peopleâs Party â ten years in which the European Union has undergone drastic changes, and so have we.
Pride of place among these dramatic changes goes to the enlargement of the European Union, for which I worked in many different capacities, and which has strengthened both the European Union and Austria.
Our growth from 15 to 25 members is not now, any more than it was before, cause for our people to feel unsettled.
It was not too rapid; it was the right response at the right time after the end of the Cold War, the collapse of the Soviet Union and the new start in Europe.
While a further process of growth is of course necessary, what is important is something to which I am glad that the President of the Council referred, namely the standards that we must adhere to when incorporating new members into the European Union â standards that we must take seriously, standards that we cannot and must not undermine and subvert with a nod and a wink.
Europeâs growth is dependent on the fight against corruption, the fight for the rule of law and for proper, democratic and transparent administration.
Both institutionally and psychologically, Europeâs businesses and industries, Europeâs people and the European Union itself must be capable of absorbing the impact of enlargement; this is a criterion that we must apply in the forthcoming enlargement rounds involving Romania and Bulgaria, both of which will, I hope, meet the requirements in good time.
In his speech, the President of the Council referred to a number of things that I would like to highlight.
The first is that Europe needs strong own resources.
If, my dear Wolfgang, you manage to inject new ideas into the European debate and get Europe to at last get down to actually having this debate on own resources, that would be a great step forward.
I have to say, by the way, that I think you have enough negotiating skill to solve the major problem of the forthcoming Financial Perspective by an accommodating attitude towards the European Parliament, which will make it easier for Parliament and the Commission to draw closer to the Council on this issue.
The second aspect that I would like to highlight is one that I regard as positive, namely Europeâs need for solutions to be reached between the two sides of industry and its self-evident inability, in this dynamic and global growth process, to abandon the concept of partnership between them.
That is an important and basic premise.
You have seen the dockers demonstrating here; social partnership cannot be used to put the brake on economic growth, but must, on the contrary, be a motor for it.
At the end of the day, Europe and the European Union do need energy, not only in the literal sense of the word, but political energy too, and so let me conclude with an appeal.
We need to give more attention to the neighbourhood policy, to the policy that makes it possible for the European Union to devote its attention to a country as important as Ukraine.
There can be no âone size fits allâ approach where this is concerned.
We need to give special attention to the development of democracy in Ukraine and to that countryâs economic independence.
I am certain that a number of things will be done about that under this Presidency.
Thirdly, there is a need for restraint where the proliferation of nuclear weapons is concerned.
Â Â  We wish Mrs Stenzel the best of luck in her new position in her country.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by joining in a great big âthank youâ to Ursula Stenzel for the ten yearsâ work she has done for Austria and for Austriaâs citizens here in the European Parliament â with people in every political grouping and every institution.
Perhaps I might add that she will, in a sense, be in charge of me, as she will be a sort of Mayor of central Vienna, which makes me now one of her charges and subjects.
I wish her all the best for the future.
Perhaps I might, very briefly, address certain topics that have been raised in this debate.
I am grateful to all those who have raised the issue of enlargement, with particular reference to the prospects for the Balkans.
I shall be brief about this, for I have already been in touch with almost all the groups about it, and I know that you know that this is a high-priority issue for Austria, for the very simple reason that the Balkans are right next door to us â according to an old joke, the Balkans begin at the Rennweg in district III in central Vienna â and we are directly affected by what goes on there.
If we in Europe do not export stability, we will end up importing instability.
There must be no unstable zone in between Hungary, Austria, Slovenia, Italy and Greece.
There must not be a grey area there, but rather a place with prospects, without which the necessary impetus for reform and the reconciliation of the various ethnic groups in Bosnia, Serbia and Kosovo will not, at the end of the day, be possible.
That is something that everyone must be aware of.
It is with that in mind that we are committing ourselves, and we have now also given the UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari a base and an office in Vienna, where in-depth discussions are a daily occurrence.
We know that this is a task for us all to perform.
I might well add that the Balkans is one of Europeâs great success stories.
It may well have been the Americans who defeated Milosevic by military means, but 90% of the troops keeping the peace there today are Europeans.
What we present to the world there now is not the military face of the European Union, but the pacific countenance of Europe.
That is something of which everyone must be made aware.
It is worth mentioning that we are celebrating not only the 250th anniversary of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozartâs birth and 150thÂ of Sigmund Freudâs, but also the centenary of the first award of the Nobel Prize for Peace to a woman, Bertha von Suttner.
Her slogan, â lay down your weapons â is a real programme, and particularly relevant to the 21st century when one thinks of Iran, about which I had a conversation yesterday with Mohammed El Baradei â the IAEA, too, is based in Vienna.
Iran is an issue of the utmost concern.
Mr El Baradei said, in a readable interview in the latest issue of , that, even after his inspectors had spent three years in intensive talks, closely examining and monitoring Iranâs nuclear programme, it was still not possible to confirm that it was peaceable in character, and that is an issue to which we will be devoting a great deal of attention over the coming months.
It is not for us to make threatening gestures about it; on the contrary, we have to send a clear message from Europe that bids Iran go back to the moratorium, back to the negotiating table, with no unilateral actions that could end up putting the peace of the wider world in jeopardy, and that message must be carried by your House, by the Council, by the Commission, and by our representatives Benita Ferrero-Waldner and Javier Solana.
That is the only way in which we will gain credibility in that part of the world.
Let me turn to the subject of energy, which is something else that I do not want to mince my words about.
I do know, of course, that every country has its own way of dealing with this issue, but I have campaigned for every country, at the end of the day, to have freedom of choice when it comes to its means of generating energy, and even then there are a number of issues that are certainly open to debate.
I personally believe that it would be very, very dangerous to go down the road that leads to a revival of nuclear power, and there are many issues around it that have not yet been resolved.
It is a field in which public concern must not be underestimated.
At European level, though, we can address the issue of renewable energy, about which Mr Barroso has come up with some truly first-class ideas, and biofuels, in which, might I add, the Americans are investing five times as much as Europe and its Member States combined.
This is an area in which we need credibility.
We have renewable resources, we have wood, we have biomass.
As I see it, that presents agriculture with an opportunity over the coming years and decades.
Without, of course, disregarding the need to take account of the differences that do of course exist between the Member States, this is an issue that we should address very honestly and very frankly.
The next issue I would like to look at is that of the trans-European networks.
I have been a member of the European Council for ten years; once, when I was foreign minister, I was even in charge of an Austrian Council Presidency.
For ten years, we have been talking about trans-European networks, and, so far, not one single project has been brought to a conclusion.
Let me make that clear to you; we must succeed in this.
It really is an ambition of mine â and I hope that the Commission will help us in this â to get at least the first sod dug on the Brenner railway tunnel project during our Presidency.
If we want to get traffic off the roads, we have to have a competitive rail infrastructure to get it on to; to that there is no alternative.
What I ask is that we should play our part in eventually making a success of these Trans-European networks; everything else is rhetoric.
One thing that I forgot to mention when discussing international issues is the CIA question, and that we are taking very seriously.
If I may be perfectly frank about this, there must be no difference in standards here; human rights are indivisible, and so is the rule of law.
At the time the American public started to debate this, I happened to be with the Bertelsmann Foundation in Washington, where we met with the Republican Deputy Majority Leader in the Senate, Senator Bennett, and we addressed the issue in precisely those terms.
We therefore give our entire support to the Council of Europe in its investigations, and I would also ask the Member States to conduct their own where necessary.
There can be no double standards here: hidden jails, secret flights, the handing over of undesirable persons, are things that must of course, where they as suspected, be pursued with the full rigour of the law, but it must be done in accordance with our own legal standards.
I have no doubt that your House and our Council will take the same approach to this and go forward together.
I am much obliged to you for the observation that we have to give much more consideration to childrenâs rights.
We note with great concern that appalling things are going on in this area, with child pornography being transmitted around the globe via the Internet, with people trafficking involving the sale of children around the world, with far too little understanding even in European, developed societies of the need to protect childrenâs rights, support families, and balance work and family life â all these matters are clearly, of course, for nation states to deal with, but they can be raised at Community level.
Some of you have raised the subject of the rights of minorities in Austria, and it is one that I am happy to deal with.
During my term of office â since the year 2000, that is â town signs in the Croatian and Hungarian languages have been set up in Burgenland; this has been the occasion for great popular celebrations, has involved a great deal of public participation, and there has been a consensus in its favour.
Last year indeed, only a matter of a few months ago, as part of the celebrations of our State Treatyâs anniversary, 20Â towns and villages acquired additional bilingual signs, and this was a great success.
In some boroughs, things have not progressed far enough.
Last Friday, I met with 12 mayors in their boroughs in the quest for a shared solution.
Although I am making this commitment to your House, it is not your House that should be concerning itself with this issue; on the contrary, it is primarily a matter for us back in Austria.
I will not accept the accusation that we, in Austria, take less account of minority rights than do other regions of Europe, but I do want consensus among the political forces, and I want to seek it with the people.
I am also confident that we will succeed in finding it.
Turning to the labour market, an agreement has been reached with the ten or twelve new Member States.
Ten are already on board, and Bulgaria and Romania are yet to be added.
I am actually very confident that the new governments will be very cooperative about this in order to be able to keep to the 2007 target date, but these agreements include transitional rules that apply not only to the new countries but also to the existing Member States.
I want to say, very frankly, that this has been done by mutual agreement.
It is also my duty, as head of the Austrian Government, to take care that neither side of Austrian industry is put under excessive strain and that the balance between openness and protection â to which a number of speakers here have referred â is maintained in this case.
I would also add that, in border regions, we are endeavouring to help by way of flexible arrangements for specific sectors â the care sector, for example â and so far, in fact, they have worked very well.
All I want to do where the European Court of Justice is concerned is to start off a debate in this House, without going into details.
Here, too, there needs to be a certain balance between compliance with Community law and its implementation on the one hand and the subsidiarity clauses contained in the Treaties on the other, for there are such things as national rights, and national legislators, national law courts and the European Court of Justice need, in interpreting laws, to take account of them, and also to assess proportionality, as the German, Austrian and French Supreme Courts routinely do.
All these things need to be kept in a reasonable balance, and I do not doubt that the European Court of Justice is aware of its responsibilities in this respect.
In closing, I would like to come back to the point that Mr Schulz made about Mozart and Freud and the magic flute, and to what others said about Zeus.
I am far more modest and believe that six monthsâ worth of Presidency can never, realistically speaking, be enough to change Europe.
That much is clear.
We can, however, get things started.
For example, we want to get the financial perspective off the ground, and we want to do it together with you.
For that to happen, we need your agreement, and we will seek it.
We have to give thought to what are the ideal means to this end.
It was Austria that had originally proposed that the European Investment Bank should get some EURÂ 10 billion extra as a research facility â that is an important forward step made possible by a public/private partnership.
There are different ideas of what flexibility means â with amounts between approximately EURÂ 1 billion and some EURÂ 3.5 â 4 billion between them â and they leave a certain amount of room for manoeuvre.
These issues need to be addressed in a dialogue founded upon trust.
First, of course, I need a mandate, and Austria will be getting one from the other Member States in a matter of a few weeks; we will be able to start talking with you as soon as the Commission has come up with its own practical proposals for sharing this out among the various headings.
I am sure that we will be able to make more funds available to you in the areas you are interested in â namely research and competitiveness â than was made available during the previous period.
There is something else that should not be overlooked: the financial perspective provides for Bulgariaâs and Romaniaâs costs to be fully covered by the common agricultural policy, so that adds up to EURÂ 8 billion included in the current financial perspective.
In real terms, resources are being cut by 4%, and EURÂ 8 billion are additionally being set aside for Romania and Bulgaria.
If we look at these things in a realistic and practical light, then I believe that we will certainly, by way of dialogue founded upon trust, be able to sort something out.
I have no magic flute to hand, any more than I have a conductorâs baton or a magicianâs wand, but, if I may refer back to Osmin, it is interesting to note that he actually ends up losing, and what is also interesting is what Constanze, who for our purposes is Europe, says to him at the end: âNothing is as hateful as revenge, but only to great souls is it given to be humane and kindly and to forgive without self-seeking.â
Let us, then, be great souls and do something for Europe.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ SchÃŒssel, ladies and gentlemen, MrÂ SchÃŒssel has already answered questions concerning the programme of the Austrian Presidency.
To conclude, let me simply sum up by giving you a broad outline of how I see this Presidency evolving.
There will be two key moments: the Spring European Council and the June European Council.
The first is designed to implement the new system of governance and the new growth and employment strategy, and the second to take decisions on our measures concerning Europeâs future.
First, a very important issue needs to be settled with the European Parliament: the question of the 2007-2013 financial perspective.
You are well aware of the Commissionâs position on this matter.
You know how hard the Commission has worked to reach an agreement that is as ambitious as possible.
We believe, in fact, that it was important to obtain an agreement among the Member States.
Imagine what the state of mind would be in Europe today if we did not at least have the agreement that it was possible to reach in the European Council.
That being said, there is still room for manoeuvre where the negotiations are concerned.
My appeal and that of the entire Commission is a very sincere appeal for realism in these negotiations.
We believe, in fact, that any further delays could really jeopardise the application of the new financial perspective starting from 1Â January 2007.
If that were to happen, then those who would suffer the most would be precisely the new Member States or the regions of Europe that require more solidarity.
We therefore believe that there is still room for negotiation, but we need to embark on these negotiations with ambition and realism and with a great sense of responsibility.
If we succeed in resolving this problem, then we will be best placed to ensure that the Spring European Council is a great success.
This is the first time that we are applying the new Lisbon system of governance.
The Member States have all already submitted their national reform programmes.
We are going to present our assessment on 25Â January, and I will come to this Chamber to present it to you.
I believe that we now have the conditions necessary to give Europe a boost in the areas of growth and employment.
We must be clear on this subject, however: we have priorities.
MrÂ SchÃŒssel highlighted some of these priorities, including research, small and medium-sized enterprises and energy, all cases in which the Hampton Court Agenda usefully supplements the Lisbon Agenda.
Yet, if we really want growth in Europe, then we genuinely need to have a single market in Europe.
The great task now â that of the Commissionâs and Parliamentâs mandate â is to ensure that the single market works in an enlarged Europe.
There are 25 of us now, and we need to remember that fundamental freedoms exist that were at the heart of the European Community project: the free movement of goods, undoubtedly, but also the free movement of capital, services and persons, including workers.
While we genuinely want Europe, we know that it has to be far more than a market: Europe is a political project and a social project.
For Europe to be both of these, we must guarantee fundamental freedoms throughout its territory, by taking care not to create any divisions between the old and the new Member States.
We are all now members of this European Union, which is based on the idea of solidarity.
Finally, the June European Council must take a decision regarding Europeâs future.
While we are on that subject, I believe that MrÂ Duffâs question is very important.
It is true that there are some appreciable differences, and we are of the opinion that we need to tackle this debate carefully, with an awareness of our responsibilities.
On that basis, we believe that it is possible, with the June European Council in mind, to finalise the broad lines of the agenda on Europeâs future, to reach a new consensus with a view to progressing our European project and to find the best opportunity for resolving the institutional issues that do, in fact, need resolving.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  â The Austrian Presidency is beginning its term of office at a particularly critical time in the life of the EU, and with a number of important tasks pending, such as negotiations with Parliament on the financial perspective to ensure that it addresses the need for solidarity and economic and social cohesion; the rejection of proposals for directives on the liberalisation of ports, and of the notorious Bolkestein Directive on the creation of the internal market for services, which will undermine the rights of workers, consumers and service users; and a clear decision to reject the so-called European Constitution in light of the results of the French and Dutch referendums.
There also needs to be a sea change in monetarist policies and macro-economic priorities if we are to address the socio-economic problems faced by a number of countries.
Such a change will involve scrapping the Stability and Growth Pact and replacing it with a proper Social Progress and Development Pact, which will promote public investment, the fight against unemployment and inequality and the redistribution of income.
Statements made by the Presidency have fallen well short of addressing all of these issues.
This is nothing new, given the positions of previous presidencies, although we do welcome their words on being open to dialogue.
This is not much, though.
Â Â  I congratulate the Austrian Presidency on its desire to propose serious paths with a view to improving the decision-making process within the European Union.
France and Germany have also made proposals designed to move things forward in this area.
We can only encourage them in this regard and, as from this week, the European Parliament will play its full part in this exercise.
It is not a question here of rhetoric, but of ensuring that, after an in-depth consultation, decisions can be made about European matters with no delays or obstacles.
We need to go beyond the âreflection stageâ and move on to the stage of realistic and courageous proposals to be implemented over the next few years.
For Europeans, growth and employment are the most worrying issues.
They therefore require a strong political commitment and a precise action programme on the part of Europe, its Member States and its Parliament.
I hope that the 2006 Spring European Council succeeds in getting the revised Lisbon Strategy back on track in order finally to rescue us from the incantations and to focus our attention on the real issues and, in so doing, to provide a clear indication once again of the direction in which European affairs should be steered.
Â Â  Mr President, under Rule 19(1) of the Rules of Procedure, I would ask you to rule on an issue relating to the proper conduct of parliamentary business.
According to the screens, one of the groups in the European Parliament has scheduled a press conference this afternoon on a subject that Parliament is now voting on, and is seeking to criticise Members of the European Parliament by giving it the title: âParliamentary autismâ.
I do not wish to comment on the substance of the press conference, but would ask you to rule that using a disability as a derogatory term is an act of discrimination against disabled people.
I would ask you to rule that the group should withdraw that title immediately as it is offensive to people with autism.
Â Â  Mr President, actually I have a similar complaint to make about the homophobia title.
I am absolutely opposed to discrimination against homosexuals, but the title of the report is unsatisfactory.
If we are to speak here about a real problem, that of discrimination, why on earth use a word like homophobia, which is totally inappropriate?
Phobias are different kinds of anxieties.
They are fears which are considered to be neurotic disorders, and therapy is needed to help them: they cannot be treated through political controlÂ ...
Â Â  â MrsÂ Korhola, we cannot reopen the debate on points that are scheduled for the vote.
Thank you, but I have to cut you off.
Â Â  â The next item is voting time.
Â Â  Mr President, following consultation with the Liberals and the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I would like, with particular regard to the wishes of the latter, to change the wording of our amendment from ânon-UK consumersâ to ânon-European citizensâ.
I do not need to give an explanation for this; it is self-evident that ânon-European citizensâ is a great deal broader a term than the reference only to âconsumersâ.
Consultation with the Liberals leads me to ask that âUK legislationâ be changed to âUK and/or EU legislationâ.
That is self-explanatory and the purpose of the change is obvious.
Â Â  MrÂ President, my colleague, MrÂ Markov, had very clearly requested that we proceed to an electronic count of the vote on Amendment 1.
I believe that the balance of power was the same as that for the vote on Amendment 3.
I should therefore like a scrutiny of the vote on Amendment 1.
Â Â  â MrÂ Wurtz, I cannot grant you what you want, simply because the balance of power on Amendment 1 was totally different.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I take the floor under Rule 168 of the Rules of Procedure, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe.
I am not speaking as the chairman of the committee in question, although that role encourages me in formally calling for the draft directive to be referred back to committee.
I am calling for a referral because it would have the same result as a rejection, with the difference that the opportunity to express our opinion during this parliamentary term would remain in the hands of this Parliament. We might otherwise run the risk of showing total acquiescence.
Today â and this is my reason â we are not ready to vote.
We are ready neither in relation to the content nor on account of the emotional climate in which we are likely to vote.
We are not ready in relation to the content because Parliamentâs consultations on the proposal â and I apologise for my share in them â remained too concerned with the history of the first proposal that was rejected a few years ago.
The debate this time has not allowed us to take account of the changes that have occurred in the world scenario, which is witnessing a revolution in port procedures, or to consider competition among ports, or to consider state aid in ports.
In brief, we are not ready because we are also likely to vote from an emotional point of view in a climate that may well force us into taking one of two inappropriate positions: either displaying arroganceÂ âŠ
Â Â  â MrÂ Costa, your request is quite clear.
Under Rule 168, we ask for one speaker in favour and one against.
Â Â  â Please let me finish.
It is fundamental because of what happened the other evening outside this Chamber.
We run the risk of either being arrogant towards those who have demonstrated quite properly, or instead beingÂ âŠ
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express the opposition of the Socialist Group in this House to Mr Costaâs amendment, and will say two things to justify that stance.
Let me begin with the last point that Mr Costa addressed.
What went on here the day before yesterday was, predominantly, what one would expect of an ordinary demonstration by men and women who feel their social security threatened.
These men and women can count on us.
Those who cannot count on Socialists such as ourselves are those who never wait to hear the end of an argument and those who believe that violence can be a political instrument.
We are not in solidarity with them.
They were in a minority, and we repudiate what they did.
Mr President, the ports package is ripe for the vote, it is ripe for rejection, and so we ask that the vote be proceeded with now.
Â Â  MrÂ President, we are well aware of what we are voting on, as we already were in 2003 when we rejected the proposal, and there is a large majority in this Chamber who will reject it again.
With the procedure you are now proposing, this majority in favour of rejection will, however, be hidden in an attempt to have the matter referred back to committee.
We should therefore take a vote in the Chamber on whether the proposals recommending rejection should be voted on before the procedural proposal.
It is completely insane that the Presidency should administer a procedure that can conceal the attitude of the majority in this Chamber.
Â Â  Mr President, I just wanted to say, for the purposes of clarification, that those who want to throw out the port package must vote âyesâ in the first vote, that is âyesâ to its rejection, for the avoidance of any doubt.
Please vote âyesâ in the first vote!
Vote âyesâ, and throw it out!
Â Â  . MrÂ President, I will be brief.
I made it clear throughout the debate that I was there to listen to Parliament and that I was awaiting Parliamentâs vote. Before outlining what I intend to do, I should like very briefly to mention something that I regret has happened and something that I want to happen.
Firstly, I regret that the procedure has not enabled Parliament to give its verdict on the amended text.
Your rapporteurâs amendments were such as to allay certain fears on the part of the various actors in our ports, fears that were felt as much by businesses as by workers.
In view of that, I pay tribute to the work of your committee.
The Commission was in a position to accept the amendments.
That is my regret dealt with.
Next, I should like us not to lose sight of the aim of this text, an aim that, I might add, often came up during yesterdayâs debate.
It is a question of helping European ports efficiently to respond to the increase in maritime traffic and to the risk of their becoming overstretched in terms of capacity.
Efficient port services enable us to increase European competitiveness and to facilitate growth and employment.
Obviously, I will give the College of Commissioners a faithful account of yesterdayâs debate and of todayâs vote.
I will suggest that it draws conclusions from them.
I will also suggest that it continue the work being done with all of the actors concerned â the Member States, operators, users and trade unions â in cooperation with Parliament, in order to lay the foundations of a European port policy that enables us to manage and to reassure investors.
I hope, in fact, to provide, in the best possible way, the answers European ports are waiting for, whether in relation to the transparency of tariffs or to the use of infrastructure, to recourse to State aid or, more globally, to the integration of the ports into the intermodal chain.
Our debate has clearly highlighted the need for every aspect of this overall approach.
Â Â  I shall read the text in English, since that is how it has been discussed; it would read as follows:
âCalls for a solution to the problem of the so-called caveats which impede a proper cooperation among the different national contingents in the country.â
Â Â  â That concludes voting time.
Â Â  We seek a settlement with the Council on a new interinstitutional agreement on budget discipline and improvement of the budget procedure.
As our point of departure in the negotiations, we have the European Parliamentâs resolution of 8Â June 2005 on political challenges and budgetary resources of the enlarged European Union for 2007-2013.
We therefore support the European Parliamentâs resolution on the European Councilâs common position from 15Â toÂ 16 December 2005.
We cannot, however, support the wording on an improved European dimension to the EUâs agricultural policy.
We look forward to the overhaul of the EUâs income and expenditure in 2008 and hope that it will lead to a more modern structure for the EU budget and reduced expenditure on the common agricultural policy.
Â Â  . The British Conservative delegation supports the BÃ¶ge report in its call for the rejection of the European Council's common position on the Financial Perspective 2007-2013 in its current form.
We support the report in its call for a firm commitment to undertake a review of the financial perspective with a clear role for the European Parliament, and we very strongly support the call for sufficient accompanying measures to ensure better implementation and control of expenditure of funds in the Member States.
We note with concern, however, the call for the Committee on Budgets to negotiate on the basis of the European Parliament's position of 8 June 2005 which, if agreed, would increase the commitment appropriations by EUR 112 474 billion over the period.
For this reason we have abstained on the final vote.
Â Â  . We abstained from the final vote on the resolution on the financial perspective for 2007-2013, because we do not accept Recital No 4 of the resolution.
We believe that the minimum agreement was ultimately a good one for Europe, as it headed off a serious political crisis in the Union, albeit temporarily.
The use of the word ârejectsâ in Recital No 4 conveys the idea to the European public that Parliament is seeking to re-open the financial debate, which as things stand is not feasible, let alone appropriate.
Accordingly, we consider the word ârejectsâ to mean the same as âdisagreementâ, which obviously does not undermine the agreement that was reached.
Â Â  . It may surprise people that UKIP has, for the first time ever, voted for a report that is overtly federalist in tone.
We do so because the adoption of this report kills the deal brokered by Tony Blair in December.
To us, a 63% increase in the UK's contribution to the EU is unacceptable.
The surrender of Â£7 billion of our rebate is unacceptable.
The current financial perspectives are a bad deal for Britain.
If this report is accepted, we fall back on Article 272 of the Treaty and annual negotiations of the budget.
Though we disagree strongly with the reasons behind this report, we are happy to play our part in re-opening a debate about how UK taxpayers' money is spent.
The more people are exposed to the workings of the EU, the less they like it.
Â Â  . By consigning the Councilâs common position on the financial perspectives 2007-2013 to the waste paper basket, the majority of the European Parliament is putting the functioning of the European Union on the line, and this is something with which we are not in agreement.
First of all, it is the Member States that collect the contributions for the European Union.
Parliament is punching above its weight if it wants to force the Member States to make more money available for the EU.
Secondly, given the principle of subsidiarity, there are items in the European budget that should receive far less funding, if any at all: external policy, education, social affairs, employment, culture and health care.
Furthermore, paying out for EU propaganda and subsidies for âpro-Europeanâ think tanks does not serve any useful purpose.
Thirdly, the cohesion and structural fund policy must focus its efforts on the disadvantaged regions in the Member States where the GDP is less than 80% of the EU average.
Logically, this results in a shift of the structural support policy from the southern to the eastern Member States.
In the interest of the citizens, this House should adopt a more resourceful attitude and reduce the EU to its core tasks, in short, do more with less money.
Â Â  We are not satisfied with the settlement reached in the Council on 16Â December.
We wish to reduce expenditure on agricultural policy and the Structural Funds and allocate more resources to research and development and to the common foreign and security policy.
Parliament has the right of codecision on the financial perspective and has announced that it will push its own budget policy very hard.
We do not support the expansive budget policy advocated by Parliament but do support other proposals such as that to increase the appropriations to research and development.
In the light of this, we did not vote against the resolution in the final vote but abstained, given that we are able to support parts of Parliamentâs proposal.
Â Â  I chose today to abstain when the European Parliament voted on its resolution on the financial perspective.
In its resolution, the European Parliament rejects the Councilâs agreement.
I am certainly very disappointed in the Councilâs agreement whereby my priority areas will obtain resources fewer than those proposed by the Commission.
These are areas such as research, innovation, measures to combat cross-border crime, environmental measures and the Structural Funds set aside to help small and medium-sized businesses.
The Council has, however, taken a reprehensibly long time, and I do not wish to delay this process any further.
It is important for us to secure the funding for projects and programmes for the years 2007-2013 so that these do not have to be discontinued because of uncertainty and the absence of cofinanciers.
It is especially important for the ten new Member States.
I have therefore chosen not to derail the financial perspective that has now been agreed on.
Â Â  . The UK PSE Group will abstain on the final vote on the BÃ¶ge report of 18.01.2006 for the following reasons:
1. We are concerned about the reference to enhancing agricultural policy in paragraph 7 which is something we have been fighting against for a long time.
2. The UK PSE Group is against the first sentence of paragraph 4 which states that the EP 'rejects the European Council's common position'.
First, we believe the UK Presidency had a difficult task on its hands trying to reach agreement on this sensitive and divisive issue.
Few believed the UK would be able to achieve the final compromise given the sometimes diametrically opposed positions taken by the 25 EU Member States on this issue.
In the second place, we think it is not the EP's role to reject the position of the Council: all we can do is take note of their position and decide upon our own position which may disagree with the Council's position but does not reject it.
3. The UK PSE Group supports what the EP is trying to do in terms of improving accountability and the flexibility of the budget to respond to future challenges facing the EU given its role as a major global actor.
Â Â  . In December, the Council ignored Parliamentâs codecision powers/obligation and omitted to fund the central policies of the Lisbon Strategy and policies relating to Europeâs place on the world stage.
Consequently, the Commission is devoid of resources for funding citizenship policies â for example youth, education, research and culture â the Globalisation Adjustment Fund and the Unionâs external commitments, such as peace missions and measures to combat the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
I therefore voted to reject the agreement in its current form, and would call for negotiations to begin with a view to bridging the shortfall in resources.
The Presidency should be mandated to negotiate with Parliament on reserves for flexibility that would guarantee all necessary resources and to agree on a revision clause that would make it possible to re-examine spending in 2008 â including diverting funding from the CAP into competitiveness and innovation policies â and to reconsider the Unionâs budgetary resources.
This is not a matter of reopening what was agreed upon in Brussels in December, but rather of reinforcing it with the means necessary to finance policies and measures essential for a more cohesive, competitive and responsible Europe that has greater credibility on the world stage.
Â Â  . The agreement on the Community budget for 2007-2013 adopted at the December European Council is woefully inadequate in terms of financial resources and unsuitable in terms of the priorities and instruments required to address the economic, social and environmental needs and problems of a Union enlarged to 27 countries.
The much-trumpeted concept of âsolidarityâ has been pushed down the order of priorities, and funding for cohesion policy has been cut back from 0.41% to 0.37% of Community GNI; this in spite of the fact that economic and social disparities arising from the enlargement have increased.
There have also been cuts to areas such as the social, environmental, agricultural, cooperation, research and culture.
At the same time, areas such as âcompetitivenessâ, migration control, border control, security and the common foreign and security policy have seen their funding increase, at the expense of development aid.
This seals victory for the interests of the most economically developed countries and the large economic and financial groups in those countries, to the detriment of the interests of what are referred to as the âcohesionâ countries, such as Portugal, and of those of the workers.
The entire ânegotiatingâ process has been characterised by proposal after proposal, each worse than the preceding one.
In this context, although the proposal before us rejects the Councilâs agreement, it reaffirms Parliamentâs negotiating position, itself inadequate in terms of funding and priorities.
Â Â  . In the text adopted on the financial perspective, there are two points that should have been dealt with differently.
The first of these is the sentence which ârejectsâ the agreement reached at the Council.
There would have been more appropriate ways of expressing non-acceptance of the agreement.
The second is the manner in which agricultural policy is referred to.
The way in which some Member States have received more significant funds from the Union budget via the CAP has hampered the progress of the European project, blocking more appropriate criteria for granting funds.
The agreement reached in the Council is a positive one for Portugal.
Parliament has every right, however, to seek to start the process of fine-tuning that agreement.
In this process, there has not been any significant about-turn in budgetary methodology, the criteria for the global distribution of funds not having undergone any changes.
There must be continued solidarity with the cohesion countries of the south and east.
Support for greater competitiveness in Europe must not place currently less competitive economies at a disadvantage.
Â Â  . To be very clear: I do not reject the European Council's common position.
However, the European Parliament, as one arm of the legislative and budgetary authority, should be able to play its full parliamentary role in the definition of policies, their reform and their budget.
I therefore support the willingness of this House to enter into constructive negotiations with the Council.
Â Â  . Although the Socialist Group in the European Parliament is satisfied with the reduction of the EU budget, particularly with the improvement of the Dutch payment position, we are still very critical of the way in which the remaining funds are being spent.
To this day, the imbalance in the distribution of agricultural subsidies exists, funds are still being pumped around without any purpose and prestigious projects are still being promoted.
That the budget agreement should be reached at the expense of the really poor Member States is indefensible.
Â Â  The resolution rejects the Councilâs agreement on the financial perspective.
I believe, however, that it is unwise of the European Parliament to reject the proposal, and I have therefore chosen to abstain from voting.
The road leading to the Councilâs agreement has been long and difficult, and it would have been problematic if the Council had not in the end succeeded in agreeing on the issue.
Certainly, Parliament has the right of codecision on the issue and is entitled to reject the Councilâs proposal, but it would be unfortunate if the long-term budget were not to materialise because of power games between the institutions.
Parliament must now assume its responsibility and, together with the Council, do its best to arrive at a long-term budget.
I think it good that the Council agreed on the financial perspective and that the level of expenditure was not too high, but I am also critical of large parts of the budget.
For example, the budget has the wrong profile, with too much money being spent on agriculture and regional aid.
Parliament wishes to allocate more money to important areas, but advocates an unduly high total level of expenditure and, like the Council, wishes to allocate too much money to agricultural expenditure and regional aid.
I do not therefore support Parliament's position.
Tough prioritising of the way in which EU resources are allocated is of crucial importance to bringing about the changes needed by Europe.
Â Â  . Today, the European Parliament adopted a resolution on Europeâs multi-annual budget.
I welcome the compromise which the Council achieved in December 2005 and consider this to be a good basis for further negotiations between the European Parliament and the Council.
As far as I am concerned, this does nothing to detract from the successful efforts of the Dutch Cabinet, in the person of Finance Minister Zalm.
The Councilâs decision to cut the Dutch contributions to the EU by one billion does not fall within Parliamentâs remit, and will therefore not form part of the negotiations.
Believing as I do that Europe should invest more in knowledge, innovation and entrepreneurship, I do not think that the present compromise adequately reflects them.
Furthermore, I take the view that the European Parliament, like any national parliament, should shoulder its responsibility when it comes to determining the budget.
The negotiations which the European Parliament will open with the Council are similar to the debate which the Dutch Lower Chamber holds with the Cabinet in response to the Queenâs speech.
Â Â  â The European Council arrived at an agreement on the financial perspectives for 2007-2013, after hard bargaining as to who would give less and who would get more of the peoples' money, so that European monopolies would be able to benefit from it and improve their profitability and privileges.
At the same time, it laid the foundations for the new review of the CAP and for reducing agricultural spending, which will wipe out even more small and medium-sized holdings.
The peoples' money under the financial package is being used, enhanced by 110%, to reinforce the repressive policies and the strategy of the anti-grass roots Lisbon agenda, while resources for farmers are gradually being reduced.
We MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece reject the decisions on the financial perspectives for 2007-2013, because they are to the detriment of the peoples and their rights.
Nor, however, do we agree with the reasons for rejection expressed in the resolution by the European Parliament, because it comes under the philosophy of not contesting the anti-grass roots policy and militarisation of the ÎU, in that it calls for the 'competitiveness and security' of the EU to be strengthened, together with controls of spending in the Member States.
This philosophy favours capitalist restructurings, harsher exploitation of the workers and the strengthening of repressive and anti-democratic mechanisms.
Â Â  . The prime concern of all joint decision-makers is to act responsibly.
The public are only too aware that the process leading to the adoption of the financial perspective in December was a complex one, which was indicative of just how difficult these negotiations can be, in particular in the circumstances in which they take place today.
As I have previously stated, the final outcome of the December summit, although it fell short of what was required and of what I had been seeking, is broadly positive and favourable to European and Portuguese interests.
I therefore feel it is legitimate to seek to improve upon this agreement, whilst making sure that there is no danger that we will lose the consensus that we reached.
The stakes are too high for the main concern to be in the context of the institutional balance.
Â Â  . I voted against the Council agreement on the financial perspective, because I feel that it is symptomatic of the crisis facing Europe: it is meagre, lacking in ambition and uninspiring.
It is meagre in financial terms compared with other partner institutions, and also because the Councilâs proposal is more a summary of the claims made by the different Member States than an expression of political will of any kind.
The lack of ambition can be seen in the glaring signs of inconsistency with previously adopted policies.
