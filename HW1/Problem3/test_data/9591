In the name of the principle of continuity, coherence and protecting the financial interests of the European Union, the aid that has already been committed must not be ended, especially since another aberration may be added to this one, the fact that we are in deficit.
We are importing.
And if that is making profits for Turkey, then fair enough, but making profits for California!
You tell us that it is expensive, but you are not telling the whole truth. It costs EUR 250 million, but that is for years to come.
You are avoiding giving the annual figure, which would represent 0.0 something percent, a tiny fraction of the European budget.
In other words, Commissioner, action must be taken, first in the name of quality, in the name of seasonal employment, but also in the name of common sense, rurality, the environment, beauty.
I do not know whether you have seen an almond tree in February, well it is truly a thing of beauty!
And as we have told you, we are dealing with regions in Spain, in my native Languedoc-Roussillon, in Greece, where the land is arid.
We must prevent a rural exodus.
As a minimum, since extending the COM for fruit and vegetables is not a solution, we must set aside a few euros from the European budget to finance this activity.
But on top of that, Commissioner - you and I were both in Seattle - there is the problem of Community preference.
Our honey over Chinese, Canadian or Mexican honey.
Our olives instead of North African olives and our Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Greek, Languedoc-Roussillon and French Mediterranean before Anatolia and California, Commissioner.
Not for a fistful of dollars, but for a fistful of euros.
Commissioner, in your speech you told us how you viewed the situation, but I can assure you that the industry does not see it in the same way.
It is true that aid was adopted in the past to tackle great difficulties facing the industry, but the problem is that today, ten years later and through no fault of the producers, the circumstances that led to the approval of that aid have not changed.
As has been pointed out, our tariffs continue to be very low, European products are still unable to compete with those originating above all from Turkey and the United States, as a result of social and labour costs or because the crops, in the case of the United States, are in irrigable areas and are mechanisable while those in the European Union are in drought areas which are not easily accessible, where there is little chance of mechanisation, and it is therefore true that they are less competitive.
However, this does not make the production in the European Union any less important.
Furthermore, despite the importance of this production, we still have a deficit, and the disappearance of this crop - which may occur if the aid to the industry is not continued - would put the consumer in the hands of Turkey and the United States, who would set our prices from their position as a true monopoly.
We should also remember, Commissioner, that there is practically no alternative to the cultivation of nuts because of the places in which they are produced.
For all these reasons, it is not surprising that there is enormous concern in the sector at the possibility that aid may be withdrawn, since without it - and we must recognise this -, given that the future of these operations, as a result of the competition from third countries, is in jeopardy and the investment made in the modernisation of the production systems - which has taken place on a significant scale - will have been pointless.
I would therefore also like to ask you, Commissioner, on behalf of the producers in the sector and especially on behalf of the producers in Catalonia, for the specific aid to this sector to be continued in the way that has been pointed out here and along the lines of the motion for a resolution which I hope will receive the support of this House.
This aid only represents 0.18% of the total budget of the EAGGF-Guarantee and 0.16% of the total agricultural budget, for which, furthermore, it has been pointed out that there is a sufficient financial margin.
Any other type of aid such as those you have mentioned, above all rural development aid, may be positive in other sectors, it is true, but in this case, given the specific nature of the sector, they are totally insufficient to guarantee the competitiveness, and therefore the survival, of these operations, whose interests the Commission - you, Commissioner - can in no way ignore.
Mr President, here again, I would simply like to draw attention to the fact that, in this crop that I know so well, the return on investment is long term.
Moreover, the producers have worked towards obtaining certification on irrigation, selecting plants, precisely organising the crops, and this work would be completely ruined if the aid that had been given up until now was not maintained at least long enough for the return on investment to take place.
For walnut trees, for example, the return on investment is around 18 years, and consequently, I believe that economic and financial logic and coherence, and also political coherence, require that for these crops, the Commission should show continuity, logic and common sense.
Mr President, I would just like to respond, very briefly, to the most important arguments raised.
First of all I would like to make it as clear as possible that the Commission is definitely against production aids.
Even the aids that we had in the past were intended to support improvements in structure and quality - they were not intended to be permanent production aids.
In addition, I have to say that any such purely production-related aid would violate all the WTO rules.
It has been argued that we are talking about a long-term investment here.
That is quite right.
But every farmer who has made an investment in this area signed a contract at the outset before he made that investment, so that he knew for exactly how many years he would be receiving investment aid.
So it is not as if the Commission can now be accused of some kind of cynicism because it is withdrawing support in a way that the farmers affected were not expecting.
Every farmer knew for exactly how many years he would be receiving support.
We need to be very clear about that here.
I have explained that there are new options.
If a case is being made that this type of farming is absolutely essential for maintaining the landscape and preserving the environment, particularly in these dry areas, then this is an ideal case for environmental measures.
It was precisely for this purpose that, amongst other things, we topped up the funding for environmental measures in the context of agricultural development.
You cannot be right on both counts.
You cannot argue that this is an important form of agriculture if it is obviously not important enough for the regional authorities to give it priority and grant support for it.
You cannot have it both ways!
It has been said that this is all too little and that more money is needed, and it has been argued that this is only nought point something of the total agricultural budget.
I am sorry, but the proportion of the budget the Commissioner can spend as he likes is 0.0%, so that if you want aid, you must at least play fair and say who you want to take the money away from!
Because the room for manoeuvre is precisely zero, there is no leeway in the budget as has been suggested in this Chamber!
In accordance with Rule 42(5) of the Rules of Procedure, I have received two motions for resolutions to end the debate.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 9.00 a.m.
(The sitting was closed at 8.15 p.m.)
Mr President, on a point of order.
I understand that the first point of order ever raised in the directly-elected Parliament in 1979 was by the Reverend Doctor Ian Paisley and his point was that the British flag was flying upside-down.
Twenty-one years later I have to tell you that yesterday evening in the forecourt in front of the Tower building, where the motorcyclists were collecting, there were sixteen flags flying.
Fifteen of them were the right way up but the Union flag was upside-down.
To fly the Union flag upside-down is an internationally recognised distress signal and to fly it upside-down when it is not a distress signal is a gross affront to the flag, the British people and the British nation.
I have corresponded with the President of our Parliament on this issue and she has written to me assuring me that this matter would be corrected and that the British flag would be flown the right way up.
Can I now call upon you first of all to ensure that the flag is immediately placed the right way up and also to take measures to ensure that in future it is always displayed correctly.
I can assure you, Mr Helmer, that everything will be done to ensure that the prestige of your flag is restored.
Mr President, I have news for Mr Helmer, which should encourage him.
He should be grateful that we see our Union flag up at all.
I am advised that it is the most popular flag to be stolen in this place.
Mr Goebbels, I would ask you not to reopen the debate and to go easy on me, since I am myself an endangered species in my capacity as President of the Friday morning session in Strasbourg.
Mr President, I should like to return once again to the fax, which Mr Van Hulten made available to all of us before the vote, and which concerns the issue of whether sittings should continue to be held on Fridays.
This is not just about participating in plenary sittings; there are other tasks which need to be dealt with in this regard as well.
We will now have to deal with these matters at home.
There are, however, no attendance allowances for working at home.
But since we have been promised these allowances in Mr Van Hulten' s letter, in the coming year I will be claiming the lost allowances from him.
I call on all colleagues to do likewise.
Mr Van Hulten had better start saving up now!
(Applause)
Mr President, in its wisdom, the House has made a decision on Friday sittings.
I should like to suggest that those responsible ensure that, even if no sittings are held on a Friday, official cars are still made available, because there will be many Members who will, in any case, wish to make full use of the Thursday here and who will need to have some way of reaching the airport or the railway station on the Friday.
We will certainly note your suggestion.
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
Mr President, with your permission, I should like to draw your attention to an inconsistency between the Minutes and the lists of roll-call votes.
Yesterday, we voted on the resolution on the Feira Summit and many colleagues will recall that - to laughter from many in this House - the Austrian Members of Haider' s party voted in favour of two amendments which were very critical of Austria and then, some time later, took the floor and said that they had made a mistake and wanted their votes to be registered as votes against.
This correction - that is, that they voted against - is accurately reflected in the Minutes but, obviously in part thanks to their party headquarters' intervening, the names of these Members do not appear anywhere in the record of the roll-call vote taken on Amendment No 4.
I would therefore request that the lists of roll-call votes be corrected so that they correspond to the events which we all witnessed here.
The Minutes are correct in this respect.
It would also be desirable to clarify how many corrections to the corrections we Members are entitled to submit.
I take note of your comment, Mrs Berger.
Mr President, during the debate on common security and defence policy there was a roll call vote on Amendment No 36.
However, yesterday's Minutes refers to the wrong paragraph and thus the vote does not reflect what actually took place in this Chamber.
I have not had a chance to look in detail at this voting list, but that is one mistake I have spotted already.
I should like to draw that to your attention.
Thank you for bringing this to our attention.
We shall verify this and rectify it, if necessary.

Fatuzzo (PPE-DE).
(IT) Mr President, never was there more need for an explanation of vote, for I made a mistake and voted against the Bedoya report instead of for it.
I am therefore using the time available to me to make this statement.
Of course I voted for the report.
How could I not approve of the Cohesion Fund being used to assist Spain, Portugal, Greece and Ireland?
However, I would draw the attention of the House to the fact that it would be appropriate to grant this aid for as long as it takes for the States' gross domestic product to reach the European Union average in full, for otherwise I can imagine a situation where, as the gross domestic product of each State approaches the average, the relevant Minister for Finance and the Budget says, 'Put the brakes on or we will lose our European Union aid!'
Casaca report (A5-0137/2000)
Mr President, I voted against the Casaca report, not because I am against monitoring European Union expenditure, but because I consider that this is the moment to start changing the agricultural subsidy system.
We can all see that the European Union Agriculture ship leaks like a sieve.
I believe that, if we want to subsidise agricultural products and farmers in their activities, we must change our procedure completely.
I propose that, instead of granting farmers financial aid, we should grant them tax reductions and reductions in their social service and pension contributions relating to their activities. These expenses would otherwise be borne by the States and therefore, to a lesser extent, by the European Union.
European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA)
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:
A5-0147/2000 by Mr Sousa Pinto, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council Regulation completing Regulation (EEC) No 302/93 establishing a European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (OEDT) (COM(1999) 430 - C5-0304/1999 - 1999/0187(CNS))
(A5-0157/2000) by Mr Turco, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs on the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion of an agreement between the European Community and the Kingdom of Norway on the participation of Norway in the work of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (COM(1999) 496 - C5-0054/2000 - 1999/0203(CNS)).
Mr President, Article 13 of the Regulation establishing the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction allows third countries who share the interests of the Community and its States to participate in the Centre' s work.
Following a request for participation by Norway, the Commission submitted to the European Parliament a draft agreement between the European Monitoring Centre and Norway authorising Norway to participate in the REITOX network and to be represented on the Management Board of the European Monitoring Centre as well as on its scientific committee.
In this regard, the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs unanimously adopted 8 amendments which give a favourable opinion with reservations. In particular, our opinion was influenced by the EMCDDA evaluation report which the Committee had asked independent external consultants to prepare.
The evaluation reveals poor coordination and poor communication between the different departments within the EMCDDA.
Decisions are far too centralised.
The REITOX network is more a virtual network than an operational one.
The National Focal Points are under-used and they could make a far greater contribution to the EMCDDA' s work. The role of the scientific committee is still poorly defined and its work is not a central part of the programme.
The Management Board is ineffective in achieving its goals and its meetings are often held without a pre-established agenda and do not involve genuine discussion of strategies. There is no dissemination strategy for the results the Board produces and, therefore, only a small proportion of the information produced by the EMCDDA is published and disseminated.
With regard to work scheduling, there is insufficient coordination of the management tasks of the director and the heads of department. The administrative procedures are burdensome and inappropriate for such a small organisation and this generates manifest problems in terms of administration, management, planning assessment, development, recruitment and training.
The current accounting system will have to be revamped so that the real costs of activities can be traced.
Too many staff and too great a proportion of funds are dedicated to the purely administrative function of the EMCDDA.
These are the conclusions of the evaluation carried out independently by an external consultancy firm commissioned by the European Commission.
On the basis of this evaluation, we must now decide whether to allow Norway to participate in the work or not, taking into consideration the fact that the work is completely inconsistent with the mandate and far from exploits the Centre' s potential.
Having said this, our committee unanimously considered that the draft agreement between Norway and the Centre, together with the proposal for a Council Regulation aimed at adapting the regulation governing the Centre with a view to the participation of candidate countries in its work, is therefore an opportunity to stress the need for a comprehensive overhaul of the regulation governing the Centre in order to ensure its effectiveness and reliability.
I urge the Commission to give us a tangible response regarding the amendments adopted by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs.
Mr President, Mr Turco' s report, which recommends that Parliament accepts the proposal for an agreement between the European Union and the Kingdom of Norway on the participation of Norway in the work of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, was discussed at length and then unanimously adopted by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs.
The amendments made by the Committee in agreement with the rapporteur, which have been incorporated into the proposal, are intended to exploit the opportunity presented by this agreement with Norway to give fresh impetus to the Centre' s work.
The committee took into particular consideration the 1999 report on the Centre' s work and the difficulties encountered, and the outcome of the interinstitutional conference on drugs which took place in Brussels late last February.
These sources showed that some of the constraints on the activities hitherto carried out by the Centre, which also restrict Union activity in this field, are caused by the wide range of differing information gathered by the various national centres linked to the Centre, with the result that it is difficult to draw conclusions from this information which would be useful in terms of prevention or damage limitation measures and operations to fight illegal trafficking.
The various amendments, including those dealing with the Centre' s Management Board, are therefore intended to ensure that the Board uses genuinely effective data-gathering methods which are capable of interpreting the data in the light of unit criteria and provide useful indications regarding the efficiency of the various national anti-drugs policies.
Indeed, it appeared to many members of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs that both the annual reports of the Centre and those tabled and adopted by Parliament fail to take into due account the analysis of the results obtained in the various countries, whose anti-drugs policies differ, moreover.
The European Union needs to decide on its policies and recommendations to the governments of the Member States by means of a comprehensive assessment - which is not, as all too often happens, purely moralist - of the various strategies being followed in the various countries, especially with regard to prevention, damage limitation and consumer safety in the face of the constant emergence of new synthetic drugs.
We believe that the agreement on the participation of Norway in the work of the Centre, which, we hope, will pave the way for other enlargement initiatives, provides a major opportunity to revitalise the activity of this technical and scientific body, for the EMCDDA must become an increasingly important reference point in the development of a European policy to fight the illegal sale and distribution of drugs which are harmful to the health of the citizens of our countries.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at a time when expressions like 'bringing the European Union closer to its citizens' and 'good governance' are on everyone' s lips, an examination of the way the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction works, and of its scientific output, proves quite astonishing, as its conclusions are virtually non-existent.
Like the increasing number of centres that are being set up in order to conceal our differences, this one, in its five years of existence, has done nothing to justify the millions of euros that are pumped into it each year.
If you compare the amount of money which it is allocated with that available to national bodies, one would expect to see in-depth studies leading, as stipulated in the definition of its aims in Article 2, to the provision of objective, reliable and comparable information concerning drugs and drug addiction.
This Centre ought to be in a position to establish definitions and uniform indicators with a view to carrying out an evaluation of the various anti-drugs policies implemented in the Member States, from both a health and socio-economic as well as a law-and-order perspective.
When will we get to know, for example, what the consequences have been of the prohibitionist policy adopted in France or of the regulatory one adopted in the Netherlands?
The independent assessment of the activities of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, the conclusions of which were published in March 2000, is very specific regarding the serious mismanagement of the board of directors and of the REITOX network, which gathers information on drugs and drug addiction.
The reports that we are looking at today are about expanding the Centre to Norway and to the 13 candidate countries.
On this issue we must agree, but would it not be better to reform this body beforehand, so that it might finally serve a useful purpose?
New members should certainly be welcomed, but with what in mind?
Is the idea to reproduce the failure we have witnessed over the past few years, but on an even larger scale?
To add to the length of the beautifully presented annual reports which achieve precisely nothing?
It is high time that the European Union became aware that, a long way from the Centre' s magnificent premises in Lisbon, thousands of people are directly faced with the health and social difficulties engendered by drug dependence.
We are not asking it to deal with such problems, we are simply asking that it should analyse them.
Hundreds of varying initiatives are being implemented in Europe by both institutions and associations, which focus either on criminalisation or risk reduction.
What is the Centre waiting for to evaluate these strategies?
How is it that Member States are being so reluctant to cooperate in evaluation?
Is it possible that there is a fear that the results may not be that great politically?
I therefore join the rapporteur in arguing in favour of the idea of a real reform of the Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, in respect both of the way it functions and of expanding its activities.
This, moreover, is a necessary precondition to taking on new members.
Mr President, as other colleagues have mentioned, the rapporteurs hope that amendments to this regulation will facilitate the Kingdom of Norway' s participation in the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction and, in each of the amendments tabled, they have highlighted the action plans, Parliamentary resolutions and the annual evaluation of the Centre. They are also seeking to relaunch the Centre' s work, change the guidelines for action of the Management Board and - it must be pointed out - ensure that Member States cooperate with the Centre as required.
We are all responsible for achieving this; the Monitoring Centre, our national public institutions and the Member States themselves.
The only way to improve the Centre' s work is by ensuring that the information provided by Member States and the regulations governing the Centre are ever more thorough and reliable.
Failure to do so would make it impossible to put an end to an evil that particularly affects the youth of Europe.
I also believe that if we fail to take this opportunity to amend the regulation with a view to relaunching the Centre' s work, we run the risk of creating further problems when it comes to incorporating the applicant countries in this work.
In the short term, I think that this is one of the key issues to be tackled, which is why we fully agree with the rapporteur and why I believe the report will be adopted unanimously.
Each institution must fulfil their respective obligations and urge Member States to gather reliable information by working clearly and effectively together. What is more, they need to draw up specific action plans to tackle a problem that particularly affects the youth in our countries and implement them more rigorously and with greater enthusiasm.
Mr President, we are examining two proposals for partial revision of the working procedures and methods of the Lisbon Drugs Monitoring Centre, in particular two proposals on relations with the candidate countries and Norway.
This is therefore our chance - for the contents of these proposals are not in themselves revolutionary for the Centre - to discuss the role and usefulness of the Centre in terms of its function, which should also be our function, of providing political indications and assessments and adopting decisions and initiatives on drugs, although the European Union' s powers in this area are severely limited.
I would argue that this type of discussion can only be based on an evaluation carried out by an independent body.
A number of speakers, including, in particular, the rapporteur, Mr Turco, have stressed that from very many perspectives, such as strategy, functionality and the poor capacity to integrate scientific work, this Centre' s contribution to political decision-making is totally inadequate.
However, at this point I feel that it is necessary for the Commission to assume the responsibility of presenting a proposal for reform to Parliament as soon as possible, for we cannot record each year, if not the uselessness, the lack of usefulness of the Centre in terms of political decisions, and then each year, year after year, leave aside the debate and postpone it until the next year.
The Commission must present a proposal for reforming the procedures which are described as bureaucratic and tedious and, above all, failing to focus on the scientific function of the Centre.
Another important point: each year, the Centre and the Commission tell us that there is a data harmonisation problem because the data-gathering criteria differ from country to country.
This is a political issue.
At this point, the Commission must table a proposal on how the data can be harmonised, or the whole exercise will be completely pointless.
The Centre does not in itself have this authority, but it must provide the Commission with recommendations for data harmonisation and table a proposal - maybe a proposal for a directive - on the subject, because this is a political issue.
At the beginning of the 1990s, there was a great scandal in Italy because a leak from the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Health revealed that they were hiding the real overdose mortality rate. Obviously, it is more convenient for politicians and governments to say that a young man has died in the street from a heart attack than to acknowledge that his death was caused by an overdose, and the same applies to policy-making.
An official DG XIV document on alcohol consumption states that the Swedish authorities talk of there being 2000 deaths per year due to alcohol abuse in Sweden, while the real figure is between 6 000 and 7 000 deaths a year, but these figures serve to cover up the failure of their anti-drugs policy.
The data problem is therefore a political issue which must be resolved politically, by means of Commission proposals which Parliament may accept or reject.
Mr President, as one of the longest-serving Members in the House my memory goes back right to the first committee of inquiry into drugs in the Community on which I had the honour to serve.
I also have memories of other Community institutions.
We have happily set up over the years several semi-European institutions in different Member States.
Some of them have matured and grown and become quite effective.
But if they do not do that they become flaccid, rot and become totally useless - just another expensive quango, not actually achieving any great results.
It is appropriate that at the moment we are assessing the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction.
We all too often have a tendency in Parliament, I am afraid, when we cannot to do anything more concrete, to set up another institution.
That makes us feel good but does not actually change anything.
So it is appropriate that we look at the work of this observatory in Lisbon at this stage.
We should not kill it off until we are sure it is not being effective.
But we have to accept that none of our countries are going to come up with a harmonised approach to dealing with the tragedy of increasing drug addiction and the murders, deaths and all that surrounds this dreadful trade.
I take this opportunity to say to my dear colleagues from all parties in the Netherlands: your policies have tended to become like a honeypot for the criminal element in many of the accession countries.
In the last month alone five young Irish drug dealers - and I admit they should not have been doing it - moved to the Netherlands because it was more comfortable for them to be there.
They have all been quite horribly murdered by people coming from some of the accession states to the Community.
So it is important that we include them in the work of this observatory.
It is very important that we take a very serious look at the policies within Turkey, an accession state, in relation to the provision of drugs and to the criminal activities surrounding it.
The observatory in Lisbon cannot work effectively without very close relationships with the Europol agency in The Hague.
I would like to thank both the rapporteurs.
They have done a good, serious job.
They have asked very serious questions.
The point was made that three years is far too long between assessments.
I would like us to have another debate like this next year to really assess how effective the observatory is and how effectively it is using its very considerable budget in this work.
Mr President, I wish to thank Mr Turco and my colleague Mr Sousa Pinto for their important reports which show the essential work the agencies are doing through their investigations into how drugs actually function, their effect, the impact on society and which describe what help and improvements can be made.
This is especially important and significant when we look at the whole question of enlargement.
A previous speaker spoke very eloquently about the evil of drugs, and Mr Beysen referred to the tobacco vote a couple of days ago.
There is an element of hypocrisy here, because half the House voted against having stronger measures on tobacco advertising and - I choose my words carefully - there are many Members in this House who are regular users, to different degrees, of alcohol, which is a very powerful drug.
I am not teetotal, nor do I wish to be sanctimonious about this, but we have to be realistic about the situation that exists in Europe today.
That must be our starting-point.
We also have to be realistic about what we want from the Centre.
I take issue with Mrs Boumediene-Thiery and Mr Cappato on some of their remarks about the Centre as it functions at the moment.
For the work of the Monitoring Centre in Lisbon to be effective, Member States have to cooperate fully.
As Mrs Banotti has just said, the agencies have to be involved.
The Lisbon Centre has to have reliable, accurate information and be able to monitor and involve all the different agencies in as many countries as possible.
Mr Blokland said that we should not include Turkey.
If you look at the whole question of drugs and the issues of enlargement of the European Union, Turkey is an intrinsic part of the supply routes for drugs coming into Europe.
I know the Turkish authorities are looking at ways of improving the situation and so are the applicant countries and those which would like to be applicant countries.
They want to address this problem.
In many cases they do not have the civic structures and other organisations in place to properly enforce some of the regulations we would like and some of the monitoring that would take place.
So we cannot exclude one country because we do not like it very much: we have to open our doors to as many countries as we can and encourage the work that is being done.
Of course, there is not enough being done.
There needs to be more progress.
But if we just sit back and say that everything is fine or just say "no" to drugs and that people should not use them, we are not accepting the situation as it is; we are not giving the tools to those people who want to improve the position.
I look forward to another debate, as Mrs Banotti has said - perhaps in a year's time - when we can actually start to pinpoint some of the progress that is being made.
I congratulate Mr Sousa Pinto and Mr Turco.
Mr President, rapporteurs, ladies and gentlemen, Parliament' s proposed amendments on the Drugs Monitoring Centre seek to fundamentally change the remit of the original Centre.
As a result, the consensus enjoyed hitherto will be abandoned.
The purely information-gathering centre is to be converted into a drugs-combating centre.
It cannot be right to bring in the Swedish method through the back door, because this implies working towards the goal of a drug-free society across Europe.
But there never will be a drug-free society.
Or are cigarettes and alcohol going to be banned too?
Despite this restrictive policy being pursued with greater vigour, the number of drug-related deaths has not fallen.
Last year in Germany alone, there were over 1 800.
A drugs policy of abstinence has led neither to fewer addicts nor to less crime; neither has it led to less drug-related prostitution nor reduced so-called organised crime.
European drugs policy therefore needs a new guiding principle.
This principle is called damage limitation.
Damage limitation is pragmatic and based on reality, whereas abstinence is a moral programme which does not work.
Instead of solutions being sought, however, the mandate of the originally neutral information-gathering centre is now to be extended to cover criminal prosecution.
At the same time, in the Commission it is intended that, from now on, the issue of prevention should only play a minor role as a small part of health policy.
In addition, the Commission is making life difficult for NGOs working on drugs.
For example, their prevention projects are being hindered by the Commission' s disbursing the approved funds several months late.
Is it the aim of European drugs policy to place more emphasis on criminal prosecution and to cut back on prevention?
As far as I am concerned, this is the wrong way forward.
That is why I shall be voting against this amendment to integrate criminal prosecution into an extended remit of the Drugs Monitoring Centre.
All those colleagues who are interested in having a drugs policy based on people' s needs will, I hope, do likewise.
Mr President, the scourge of drugs and the action taken to combat it know no geographical, social or national boundaries.
Consequently, any attempt to study this phenomenon must not be contained within the geographical borders of the Member States or even the candidate countries, but must be based on information from as many countries as possible, if it is to help prevent and combat the problem more efficiently.
We need to study in depth why and how more and more young people are turning to escapism and drugs at ever younger ages.
Collating, substantiating and evaluating information from a number of countries will only help us carry out an integrated study and find basic answers if we collate and exchange data from as wide an area as possible on a comparable basis.
For example, in Greece, most of the information obtained so far has been from treatment centres, leaving sources of information from other agencies which might contribute towards a more integrated evaluation of the dimensions of the problem unexplored.
The treatment centres house young people who are able to access them because they are helped either by their family or by the wider social environment.
But what happens to the large section of the population which has no such access, such as economic migrants?
According to information from the Greek Addiction Treatment Centre, 97% of the people using these centres are Greek citizens.
However, according to prison statistics, the majority of drug users in prison are economic migrants who, either because they do not speak the language or because of a lack of information and social exclusion, have never set foot in such a centre.
Consequently, according to the data collated and evaluated by the Treatment Centre, this category of users is almost non-existent.
In my opinion, every user should have the opportunity to go to a detoxification centre without being obliged to give his or her full personal details.
We all know that using drugs leads to crime, not only because drugs per se are illegal, but because the high cost of drugs set by the huge financial rings which supply them, inevitably forces all users into crime.
Mr President, in company with most of the Members who have spoken before me, I can only say that these reports leave us two essential lines of thought to follow.
Firstly, this is a positive evaluation which is consistent with the Commission' s proposal.
There are no borders when it comes to subjects such as our present concern of drug addiction and the trafficking of narcotics, and so it is certainly a useful, sustainable initiative to set objectives which include countries which are not currently Members of the European Union but which are in the pre-accession phase, countries taking part in the PHARE programme or Norway, in their prevention or suppression strategies, for this will help us to broaden the scope of our anti-drugs strategy.
On the other hand, however, both the rapporteur and the Members have stressed that this occasion calls for reflection upon the way in which the Centre operates and upon the results it has produced in recent years, and I feel that we cannot say we are satisfied with its performance up until now.
And quite apart from our own reservations, there is also an independent report, which has just been referred to, which outlines all the limits and shortcomings of this action.
My fellow Member said that these changes will transform the Centre from a statistics office into a drugs monitoring centre.
I wish it could be so but I cannot share her optimism.
On the contrary, I fear that many proposals and concerns, including those voiced by other Members, will only serve the purpose of rationalising data and making it compatible.
I was even somewhat surprised to hear Mrs Ghilardotti mention consumer safety.
I would not like the Monitoring Centre for Drug Addiction to be likened to the Monitoring Centre for Food Quality and Safety!
Let us be careful, for this is an extremely serious phenomenon which is damaging the whole of our society and destroying entire generations. We must fight against it.
So, the efforts to make data from the different countries compatible and the call for efficient dissemination of the data are all very well, but if we think we can achieve these objectives, even our information objective, without taking into consideration the contributions made by the individuals concerned, Non-Governmental Organisations, voluntary associations and rehabilitation communities in the different countries, then we are living in a fantasy world.
We must involve them, and then the Centre will be able to perform a genuinely effective and productive part - and we must monitor this - in the fight against drugs.
Mr President, unfortunately, the drugs problem is likely to remain on the international community's agenda for several decades to come.
The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, established 7 years ago, is an important tool for collating comparable data from the Member States.
It is used to monitor this serious phenomenon and determine the approach to be taken in a multidimensional policy at national and European level.
At least two main criteria must be met if we are to achieve this objective: first, we need reliable assessments of the measures taken and, if they are efficient, we need to implement them, not only in the Member States, but also in the candidate countries, the rest of central and eastern Europe and in any third country with the right legal framework under relevant agreements.
Permit me to say that the fight against drugs is a prime example, perhaps the only example of an issue which calls for globalized measures and decisions and where globalized measures and decisions will only have positive repercussions.
The second main criterion which I should like to mention is the need to provide the Monitoring Centre in Lisbon with the necessary economic and administrative resources in order to facilitate its difficult and ambitious objectives.
It is clear from how it has operated to date, as documented in the recent experts' report, that we do not need simply to supplement Regulation 302/93, as suggested by the Commission. We need to amend it as described in the amendments tabled by the European Parliament.
These amendments refer mainly to the modus operandi of the board of directors, the provision of technical assistance by the Centre to the aforementioned countries and the Centre's help with evaluation procedures at national, European and international level.
I am certain that this will guarantee better operating conditions for the European Monitoring Centre and increase the potential for taking integrated and efficient decisions.
Finally, I should like to thank the two rapporteurs for their thorough work.
Mr President, whenever reference is made to a particular undertaking, it seems only sensible to assess the way it operates so that improvements may be made on the basis of the culture of quality and continual improvement.
This is why we agree with those who assert that the European Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction has not performed satisfactorily and therefore why we, like others, are critical of it.
We endorse the amendments and reforms aimed at enhancing the objectivity, reliability and comparability of the information provided, given that quality information is essential if related policies are to be improved upon.
As a group, we should like to see the proposal taken a stage further in order to encompass damage-reduction programmes. Lastly, I should like to stress that, as this issue clearly has pan-European public health and socio-economic implications, it requires a strategy at European level.
Whether we like it or not, Europe is not confined to the European Union, which is why we must support moves to broaden the scope of this proposal to incorporate countries that do not form part of the European Union and those who at present have the status of candidate countries.
As the issue of hypocrisy is so often raised in relation to the tobacco and drugs debate, would it not be appropriate here to mention other forms of hypocrisy, such as those tax havens in which drugs money takes refuge?
Mr President, in the previous Parliament, many Members, especially from Southern Europe, were in favour of free trade in milder drugs.
In the North, it is generally believed that any free trade in milder drugs lowers the threshold that makes it possible to move on to using hard drugs.
It is important that the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, in the context of the positive climate that exists in Parliament with regard to drugs, also acquires sufficient resources for its anti-drugs activities outside the European Union.
It would appear that this is not the case, however.
The Centre is being given new tasks without the corresponding resources to carry them out, and the amendments, by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance in particular, tend in that direction.
Resources must be increased via the PHARE and TACIS programmes.
The most important drug routes to the European Union area will, in the future, be Afghanistan, Russia, Chechnya and Turkey as well as Kosovo and the other former Yugoslavian regions.
All the PHARE countries have to be made to go the way of Norway.
And they must be given the technical assistance to do so.
Estonia is one of the biggest drugs routes from Russia to Finland, and from Finland to the common markets of the EU.
All countries that receive financial aid must be made to go the way of Norway.
There are, at present, no conditions set for EU aid. By way of example, Montenegro receives financial and political aid from the EU to pay its police force, but not for the fight against smuggling and drugs, but for its struggle against Milosevic.
No such conditions are imposed on the aid by the World Bank or the IMF.
The EU should, however, impose conditions for the aid it gives.
Mr President, the fight against drugs is one of the most important tasks we have as citizens and politicians.
That applies both to citizens down on the floor of the House and to those up in the gallery.
Drugs breed crime and social destitution and tear many people' s lives apart.
It is therefore a positive sign that we can now see both the candidate countries and Norway involved in the cooperation we already have.
In order to be able to carry out a credible assessment and produce reliable statistics, we must however have a strategy concerning what information the Member States are to send in to the Centre.
Otherwise, the statistical basis will be fairly meagre and not serve any larger purpose.
However, it is not only the Centre' s responsibility, but also that of the respective Member States to ensure that the information sent in is also relevant and can be used for some purpose.
Responsibility for taking measures to combat drug abuse now lies, in the first place, with the Member States.
This ought not, however, to stop us trying to devise common assignments and strategies for preventive work, which is perhaps the most important foundation stone in the fight against drugs.
It ought, moreover, to be possible for the Union and the Centre to have a role in supervising the domestic production of drugs, as one of the previous speakers mentioned, for we cannot get away from the fact that many of the drugs that are in circulation today, and which young people encounter on the streets, are synthetic drugs, produced in the Union and nowhere else.
In view of the open borders we now have, it is a problem if more drugs than we would wish are being produced in a particular place.
I should like to say that the definition of a drugs-free society is a good one.
It is a goal or vision, just like every other vision the Union has when it comes to social destitution and other phenomena we wish to combat.
It is an aggressive approach I should like to see maintained.
Mr President, I want to begin by thanking the rapporteurs, Mr Sousa Pinto and Mr Turco, for their excellent reports.
The fight against drug abuse and the drug trade is important.
This report has been produced to complement the current regulation concerning the Monitoring Centre.
Moreover, it is intended that the candidate countries should be involved in the work.
Let me comment on that first of all.
It is, in fact, important that the candidate countries be involved.
I myself come from Sweden.
In recent years, we have developed cooperation with the Baltic countries and with Poland in order to end the drugs trade and prevent drug abuse.
The drug trade is not confined by national borders.
We must therefore have cross-border cooperation to prevent the trade from developing.
The same applies to cooperation with Norway.
Norway participates in the internal market and is to become a member of Schengen.
Norway has much the same problems as Sweden when it comes to drugs crossing the border.
It is therefore important that we cooperate and gather information from these neighbouring countries, as well as study how they conduct their policies.
The rapporteur also deals with how the Centre operates at present.
I think he draws an important distinction, for the Centre should not be dabbling in politics.
Instead, it is we who should be engaged in politics here in political assemblies, as well as in the Member States - in fact, mainly in the Member States, when it comes to drugs policy.
However, the Centre should create a basis for political decisions.
In this regard, there are at present deficiencies when it comes to collecting statistics.
We must obtain relevant and reliable information which can be compared.
What is more, the Centre can carry out analyses and assess the objectives which we in the political assemblies establish, so that we might revise policy accordingly.
The Centre must become significantly better in this area than it is at present.
Analyses must be carried out of the policies which are applied - different types of policy are pursued in, for example, the Netherlands and Sweden.
I think it is important for us to analyse what these differences, in the guise of policy, in fact look like when it comes to problems such as drug abuse by young people.
The joint debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Report (A5-0147/2000)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
Report (A5-0157/2000)
Following the vote on the Commission proposal.
Mr President, I would like to intervene on a point of order pursuant to Rule 69.
It was not clear from the Commissioner' s speech whether the Commission accepts the amendments that Parliament has just adopted.
In particular, I did not understand whether Norway will start to participate in the work of the EMCDDA after it has been reformed, that is, whether it is the Commission' s intention that Norway should be allowed to participate in the work of the EMCDDA immediately or whether it should wait until September, when the reform is scheduled to take place, when the Management Board will issue its recommendations. This would allow Norway to join an existing body rather than something which, according to the independent consultancy firm' s report, is currently ineffective, inadequate, extremely expensive and altogether useless.
Mr President, the Commission intends Norway to become a member of the Monitoring Centre we were discussing this morning, as soon as possible.
As I mentioned earlier - and I was also speaking for my colleague Mr Vitorino - we see eye to eye on many of the concerns raised by a number of Members of this House this morning, but this is not an opportune moment to raise the issue of the functioning of the Monitoring Centre itself.
This morning' s debate was about adding Norway, and the countries of Eastern Europe of course, to the centre' s list of members, or that is how the Commission saw it at any rate.
Mr President, the Commissioner' s words on the report on the participation of Norway are not satisfactory, in the sense that Parliament once again unanimously considers that Norway should certainly start to participate in the work of the EMCDDA as soon as possible.
The problem is now that the EMCDDA is not in a fit condition for Norway to join.
I therefore call upon Parliament to postpone the vote.
In accordance with Rule 69, the rapporteur can ask, if Parliament so decides, to postpone the vote and the matter will be deemed to be referred back to the committee responsible for reconsideration.
I see that our co-rapporteur is also requesting the floor.
I would point out to you that Article 69 stipulates that this procedure takes place without debate.
I would therefore ask you not to start the debate again, but I give you the floor as co-rapporteur.
Thank you, Mr President, for allowing me, as rapporteur, to say that the debate we have engaged in this morning is the first opportunity since 1993, when the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction was opened, to make a statement on the fundamental issue of changing its regulations.
I think that Parliament would have seriously failed in its most basic political responsibilities if it had not undertaken a thorough review of the Monitoring Centre' s duties and tabled a set of proposals that represents a thorough overhaul of its operations. We believe that the Drugs Monitoring Centre is crucial, much needed and has a useful role to play in the future of the European Union, but not by means of this report, with which, in essence, the Commission apparently agrees.
The regulation now requires me to submit the request submitted by Mr Turco to postpone the vote to the House.
(Parliament rejected the request) (Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
Community design
The next item is the report (A5-0150/2000) by Mr Ferri, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on a proposal for a Council Regulation (EC) on Community design (COM(1999) 310 - C5-0129/1999 - 1993/0463(CNS)).
Mr President, having seen Directive 98/71/EC on the legal protection of designs, we are now being called upon to assess the proposed regulation and to decide whether to adopt it.
Of course, the regulation follows the same line as the directive, and it therefore contains all the same strengths and weaknesses as the directive on such a contentious, competitive issue where there are a large number of interests at play.
In the end, the directive did not deal with the issue of spare parts for the purpose of repair.
I am referring to the famous repair clause, the spare parts clause: the complex, organic world of the automotive industry.
The committee took great care over its work - and I would especially like to thank its chairperson - although a more conservative, extremely cautious interpretation prevailed in the end, for we did not want to push the boat out too far, since the directive will be supplemented on the basis of three years' monitoring of the use of spare parts for the purpose of repair.
However, one of the strengths of the regulation lies in its definition of the Community right for products and designs and registered and unregistered products: the proposal to use the central Community trade mark office for design as well, offers an exclusive right to protected use at Community level, with some exceptions.
This is a step towards meeting the clear fundamental requirement of the single market and towards common rules on invalidity, surrender of rights and possibilities of use, particularly in two very important areas: novelty, which is connected to disclosure, and individuality of character, which is connected to creativity.
These are two aspects of a fascinating world, which clearly requires protection, but also requires flexibility.
This is why I insist, in particular, on a minimal package of amendments which, in the balance of protections between the Community right and copyright - I urge the European Parliament to give an up-to-date and, most importantly, realistic evaluation of the highly complex world of designs -will prevent the persistence of monopolies.
I would therefore advocate that a ceiling of 25 years for the protection of registered design rights would be quite sufficient.
On the other hand, the directive is not open to subjective interpretation.
The directive states that the Member States must be able to strike a balance between the Community right and copyright.
I would point out that copyrights last for as long as 70 years in a number of States.
Thus, if we were to add the 25 years to the 70 years, we would end up preventing the modification of a common product which often - and also, so to speak, by its very nature and taking into account novelty and creativity - cannot last very long, not beyond the lifetime of a human being, for example, and therefore a ceiling of 25 years would seem reasonable.
May I insist, therefore, that at least this type of adaptation to requirements is implemented and that the Community of Europe, the single market, is given access to a world which is so important, particularly for the SMEs where, in effect, the productivity of design and creativity - which for the European countries naturally represents a boost for jobs and employment - fits perfectly into this network of rights and freedoms.
I feel that, even with the limits and constraints which I have stressed, in order to give the Members a balanced view, this proposed regulation, which introduces a standardised system with standardised protection throughout Community territory can, in effect, be an important milestone in the construction of Europe.
Mr President, it seems that the long road to creating a single regulation on the legal protection of designs, drawings and models in the European Union is nearing its end.
The large amount of time spent on this regulation was justified on the grounds of the importance of adopting the directive on drawings and models, a job that took most of the previous legislature and part of the present one.
It was clear that once the more serious problems relating to the text of the directive had been overcome - a directive that can be considered as balanced - the task of establishing a resolution would be far easier and so it has been.
The whole process proves that Parliament was right to adopt the approach in creating the directive first, followed by the resolution.
Its decision to intervene to obtain the freeze compromise in drawing up the resolution, with the directive being subject to the codecision procedure, was decisive. What is more, this perhaps would not have been the case had the procedure been the other way round, i.e. first the regulation followed by the directive.
Had this been the case, Parliament' s role would not have been as decisive and the balance between car manufacturers' interests on one hand and independent body part manufacturers on the other would not have been achieved. The same can be said of the interests of consumers and insurance companies.
The fact that this agreement - which is far from perfect, but which provided a way out of the impasse in such a contentious issue - was reached, made the task of creating this regulation and this report on the Commission' s proposal far easier.
This task basically involved incorporating the compromises reached in relation to the directive in the regulation.
If the European Union intended to announce laws regarding the harmonisation of Member States' legislation, it was only right that its own laws were in line with the laws on harmonisation.
Since the Commission' s proposal followed the wording of the directive almost to the letter, it received our support.
On this basis, the majority of the amendments we endorse consist precisely in enhancing the similarities between the directive and the regulation.
I should like to thank Mr Ferri for his report and, at the same time, welcome the flexible approach he adopted throughout proceedings.
The rapporteur' s first report did advocate certain proposals which, though he believed them to be correct, in the opinion -and I believe in the better informed opinion - of many groups in Parliament, contradicted the freeze compromise relating to the repair clause.
However, by adopting this flexible approach, Mr Ferri saw fit to withdraw his proposals and I thank him for that.
At present, there are only two areas on which the rapporteur and my group disagree.
The first relates to the definition of the individual character of the design, which incorporates an element that supposedly brings it into line with the TRIP agreements.
This is neither the time nor the place to begin a debate on this issue. We do not agree with this interpretation and would go as far to suggest that the amendment in question includes certain distortions.
The second point of contention relates to copyright and we shall vote against the amendments tabled by the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.
Mr President, my colleague from the PPE-DE Group, Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, says that the rapporteur, Mr Ferri, has accused her of being conservative.
I say to my colleague, Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, that it is a label she should accept with pleasure and a badge which she should wear with pride.
I am speaking today on behalf of my British Conservative colleagues, Lord Inglewood and Mr Harbour who unfortunately cannot be in the Chamber.
I wish to put on record the British Conservative support for Mr Ferri's report which we feel finds an acceptable compromise between the various conflicting interests.
In particular, we believe it is right that the directive and regulation line up to provide as seamless as possible a regime for the protection of industrial design across the Union as a whole.
I would also like to record our support for Mrs GrossetÃªte's report and to emphasise that in our view it is of supreme importance that EU law is implemented consistently, properly and in a timely manner.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
Application of Community law (1998)
The next item is the report (A5-0132/2000) by Mrs GrossetÃªte, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the sixteenth annual report from the Commission on monitoring the application of Community law (1998) (COM(1999) 301 - C5-0213/1999 - 1999/2168(COS)).
.
(FR) Mr President, the fact that this report is the final subject for this week' s part-session does not mean it is unimportant. Quite the contrary, we are all interested in a Citizens' Europe, in a Europe for the citizens.
It is our duty to consider the interests of the European citizen, to ensure that Community law is applied in all of the Member States and that the European Commission, the guardian of the treaties, monitors this process with the utmost vigilance.
The figures for 1998, in the report drawn up by the European Commission services, do not, sadly, indicate any significant improvement, and require vigilance from the outset.
Few areas are spared and Parliament must pick out those which are particularly prone to difficulties: the environment, social conditions and public procurement contracts.
Having said that, I am convinced that, in future, we will need to extend our vigilance to other spheres of activity.
The European Parliament must also reiterate its request for information concerning the application of international standards.
All of the Member States are affected to a greater or lesser degree by the problems of applying Community law.
This is why I wanted to stress just how important it is that they behave in an exemplary manner in the period prior to several successive enlargements.
How can we demand that those countries wanting to join the European Union apply Community laws if Member States are themselves unable to respect them?
If additional information is necessary, this is also in the interests of the citizen, who is becoming increasingly involved in the process of monitoring Community law.
This is where the whole question of the infringement procedure comes in.
The European Commission should not advocate more selectivity in dealing with cases which may give rise to an infringement procedure, a proposal according to which the Commission could abstain from intervening in cases of limited importance, such as, for example, the mutual recognition of qualifications.
We must protest most strongly against such a move, which could not be justified on the grounds of cost and effectiveness.
In doing so, the European Commission would find itself turning away from its role as guardian of the Treaties and would deny European citizens access to justice.
As for methods, I think they can be improved.
As has been indicated several times by the European Ombudsman, it is important to safeguard the rights of individuals through improved confidentiality, better access to documents and justification of the European Commission' s decisions on classification.
In the same vein, more data should be obtained on Member States' responsibility for damages suffered by private individuals.
Nobody would think of doubting the importance of petitions, which play a significant part in signalling that, in some instances, Community law has not been applied in Member States.
In this spirit, we are urging that special publicity be given to all complaints in order that any action taken is made more obvious.
Bearing in mind the approach that has been adopted, however, which centres above all on defending the working methods of the Committee on Petitions, I do not wish to support Amendment No 2.
The attention paid to the CELEX and EUR-LEX databases, that is to say improved access and ongoing optimisation is, I believe, beneficial to the citizen.
Consolidated documents should be associated with some indication of the successive amendments introduced, as required by Amendment No 1.
I therefore support this amendment.
Finally, there is the problem of the preliminary question.
I do not believe that it needs to be called into doubt in principle, but we can look into its forms.
When such questions are badly drawn up, the effect can run counter to the aim of legal clarification.
I therefore suggest that the Court of Justice reconsider the way this procedure works.
Moreover, I believe that, in order to clarify the text of Recital G, which reads: "whereas it is primarily national courts that must apply Community law" , it would be preferable to state "control the application of Community law" .
There is also, finally, the matter of relations with public administrations which are having to come to grips with new Community standards.
The current state of affairs in Europe' s construction tends to emphasise the principle of subsidiarity.
In consideration of this key principle, I am opposed to Amendment No 3.
I do not consider creating a European administrative law to be appropriate.
In conclusion, the fact remains that the aim of a control system is to penalise non-application of the law.
With this in mind, I want to stress the importance of the procedure outlined in Article 228(2), of the Treaty. This is a new procedure, and is certainly a deterrent in effect, and the Commission should be less reluctant to consider it in future.
By voting in favour of this resolution, we will be sending out a positive signal, from a European Parliament which is in tune with the citizens.
.
(ES) Mr President, I share the rapporteur' s concerns regarding the fact that we are debating a report of this type at such a late hour on a Friday, especially given the importance we attach to the application of Community law. The figures given by the rapporteur have only compounded our concerns as they are a clear reflection of Member States' failure to apply Community law and this report actually incorporates proposals that would force them to do so.
The fact that 1101 letters of formal notice, 675 reasoned opinions and 123 referrals have been presented to the Court of Justice clearly highlight the difficulties inherent in applying European Community law.
I intend to chiefly focus on the proposal put forward by the Committee on Petitions that incorporates amendments signed by all of the groups in the committee.
I should also like to point out, as a result of those gremlins which sometimes appear in this House, that the Committee on Petitions' conclusions were not incorporated in the rapporteur' s report.
I have the distinct impression that the Committee on Petitions is considered the poor sister of Parliament and, in fact, at the end of the previous legislature its very future was in doubt.
However, it is in my view one of the most important committees in Parliament, as it has direct and clearly defined relations with the citizens of Europe and the ability to deal with issues, such as concerns for the environment.
The rapporteur points out that more than 25% of the petitions lodged concern environmental problems, freedom of movement, fundamental freedoms and the internal market, issues that, in my view, are central to the European Constitution.
What is more, in view of the rising number of incoming petitions every year they also highlight citizens' desire to see Community law complied with.
At times it appears that citizens' groups, residents' associations and other types of association show greater concern with regard to the application of Community law than the national public authorities themselves. This is particularly true of environmental issues, something I have personal experience of as a member of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection.
Proof of this lies in the petitions we handle on a daily basis in the Committee on Petitions.
This is why I urge you to approve the two amendments tabled by the Committee on Petitions that are no more and no less than a clear reflection of the Committee on Petitions' concern regarding the procedures used for handling citizens' complaints.
There are considerable delays - often one, two or even three years - between the Committee on Petitions' or the European Commission' s final decision on a matter following the initial complaint.
The amendments tabled call for procedures to be simplified, as failure to do so would seriously undermine citizens' confidence in the effectiveness of the European institutions.
Among other things, the amendments call for a certain degree of harmonisation in European administrative law so that all citizens of the Union receive equal treatment.
Much more could be said, Mr President, about the nature and importance of the Committee on Petitions, but as time is short, I would simply urge members to agree to vote in favour of these amendments today, as they represent the opinion of the Committee on Petitions.
Mr President, I share Mrs GrossetÃªte' s regret: the construction of Europe must involve the creation of a legal area, and the diligence we have shown in timetabling such a major report for a Friday morning is certainly not reassuring.
One great Italian thinker maintains that a society is commonly perceived as such only insofar as it succeeds in establishing rules for itself which are respected by its members.
Certainly, the European Community used to be an institutional model with a remarkable history and the Union is so today; within this Community we have established rules for ourselves - and the Member States and the citizens respect them - but Parliament must not shirk its lawful duty to implement and ensure the implementation of the rules of Community law.
Moreover, it must draw fresh strength, fresh nourishment, from its tasks. Although we have come a long way and we are making every effort now, I feel that we still have a long way to go.
It is our duty to take on board the fact that there is still a great deal to do in the internal market in terms of standardisation, but also and above all, we must realise that there are a great many gaps in the development of the European legal system.
It is good to know that the rate of transposition of Community directives into Member States' legislation stands at 95%, but this is not enough if the failure to apply Community law correctly is the result of bad practice on the part of administrations rather than the failure to assimilate directives.
An effective intervention to deal with the national administrations is therefore, in my opinion, necessary, as the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has stressed.
This need is all the greater in that those who are in contact with the law and justice are often unfamiliar with the rules of Community law.
As the report requests, it is therefore appropriate for candidates to the magistracy and forensic science professions to pay particular attention to the rules which we are developing.
I tabled some amendments to Mrs GrossetÃªte' s excellent report in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, prompted by the concern that the legal protection of the citizens we represent is given insufficient recognition and enforcement in the individual countries.
Petitions to the Commission and the European Parliament in this context should give us not only food for thought, but also cause for concern.
The fact that some national courts hardly ever put preliminary questions to the Court of Justice under Article 234 of the Treaty is a further cause for concern, and the representatives of the Commission should instruct their departments to investigate the reasons for this situation.
In short, we must not underestimate the economic and practical difficulties encountered by the citizens in gaining access to Community case law.
It may be that we need to adopt a legislative initiative as soon as possible in order to facilitate access to case law in economic terms, perhaps by establishing a support fund.
Mr President, the Commission' s report on monitoring the application of Community law is a most important document because it reveals the true situation in the European Union and more sittings should perhaps have been devoted to it, not just the Friday sitting.
The rapporteur, Mrs GrossetÃªte, has produced an extremely balanced report containing a series of accurate observations which deserve special attention.
The two reports quite rightly divide the subject of the application of Community law into three dimensions: the non-transposition of Community law and the incompatibility of transposition measures with the letter of Community law and application methods.
As far as non-application is concerned, there are still serious delays in certain sectors, including the social sector, to which, I am sorry to see, the Commission' s report only devotes a few lines, despite the fact that the issues in question relate to social cohesion.
There are numerous reasons for non-transposition and they need to be studied.
Also, it is time that we considered political methods for reducing delays.
For example, what if each country were to appoint a uniform body at the highest political level which would be responsible, vis-Ã -vis the European Union, for transposing Community law correctly and on time?
What if each country which took over the presidency had to make a prompt, public declaration of its country's degree of compliance with Community law, given that it does not make sense for a country to be responsible for administering political matters when it has not honoured its own commitments?
It might also be useful if the state of compliance of each country were publicly announced before each summit.
Negligence in transposing Community law in the past did not have the same repercussions as it has on a single economic area in which the idea of not having a uniform legal Community order at the same moment in time is inconceivable
As far as the method of applying Community law is concerned, this issue relates mainly to the legislative system, both national and Community, and to the appointment of the Committee on Petitions of the European Parliament and the European Ombudsman.
The two basic problems relating to the legislative system are: first, often unjustified recourse to the procedure for obtaining preliminary rulings from the European Court and, as Mr Ãlvarez has mentioned, poorly prepared references and, secondly, the failure to take such recourse on crucial issues.
Despite appearing different, both have the same root cause, which is the national judges' lack of familiarity with Community law.
A general campaign is needed here.
We need to propose to the Member States that all judges should gradually be trained and that this should be the sine qua non for the promotion of older judges to more senior positions and for the admission of newcomers to the bench.
The present Grotius and Falcone programmes have become out-dated as a result of developments.
Finally, I should like to say a brief word about where the Committee on Petitions can play an important part in improving the degree of application of Community law.
This committee forms the interface between the European citizen, the European Parliament and the Commission.
We need to upgrade this committee if we are to uncover omissions in the practical application of Community law.
I am in favour of Mr Ãlvarez's proposals, which really do form the starting point for European administrative Community law.
Mr President, on behalf of my group I have the pleasure of welcoming Mrs GrossetÃªte's report.
I particularly want to stress a clause which she mentioned in her own speech: recital (e) says that on the eve of several successive enlargements the conduct of the current Member States of the Union in the application of Community law must be exemplary.
And so indeed it must.
Alas, we know that it is not so in all cases.
I have on more than one occasion in this House referred, as others have done, to the shocking case of the foreign language lecturers in Italy who first received a judgment in their favour eleven years ago.
The law of Italy has not yet been brought into conformity with it, to satisfy their rights.
We are tested by our will in favour of the individual, the citizen, seeking their rights under Community law.
No rights are more important than those against discrimination and those in favour of freedom of movement.
If we do not satisfy these we let ourselves down in the face of our own aspirations.
I have received disturbing correspondence this week from a number of sources in Germany, suggesting that a similar problem may be building up concerning self-employed foreign language teachers working there, where laws are being applied retrospectively for the convenience for the state with apparent injustice to the teachers.
I shall be following that up and we may have to look into it again.
I cite these two exemplary cases simply to stress the importance of Mrs GrossetÃªte's report and to thank her personally for her own intervention in the former case which I am sure will move it forward.
I apologise for the fact that I cannot stay to the end of this debate owing to exigencies of transport between here and Edinburgh, but I am delighted to have had the chance of participating so far.
Mr President, fellow members, this Community law which we are helping to establish presents serious difficulties as far as application in Member States is concerned.
European citizens have used this last resort as a way of expressing their anger and indignation at the disruption and even destruction of their daily way of life, foisted on them by bureaucrats for a purpose that sometimes escapes us and for stakes that do not justify it.
While this report should have offered us an opportunity, as elected Members, to assess the many texts on which we are voting, and to learn from them for the future, we are limiting ourselves to a control/sanction approach.
This type of constraining, over-regulated Europe is certainly not the one our respective fellow citizens want.
The way in which this report has been adopted is appalling.
The rapporteur for the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has demonstrated absolute scorn for the Committee on Petitions by not even seeing fit to put its conclusions to the vote.
Yesterday, the plenary displayed a similar contempt when it ignored the opinion of the Legal Affairs Committee regarding the Maaten report.
I greatly fear that the trend will spread and the Commission will not see the text, on which we in this half-empty House are about to vote, as very much more important.
Rather than unnecessary amendments, I should like a response to the following question.
The 1998 figures show that reasoned opinions have doubled in volume, cases of non-conformity or poor application, revealed automatically, have gone up by over 50%, complaints by 18% and letters of formal notice by 12%.
This is not, at this stage, evidence of effective control, but rather of the existence of a profusion of texts which, in the hands of the judges, leave our national assemblies, which are expressing the popular will both legitimately and democratically, under threat of condemnations as well as of penalties.
Do the Commission and the rapporteur not think that it would be a good thing to reduce the number of texts and, above all, to modify those which quite clearly raise crucial political, legal and practical questions that do not appear to be so obvious and acute when they are framed, or would they prefer to carry on sanctioning our States and turning our fellow citizens into the real victims?
Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs GrossetÃªte, I should like to make three comments on the report regarding monitoring the application of Community law, taking as my premise the fact that the proper application of Community law is not just an assessment of transposition in arithmetical terms, but also an evaluation of the practices adopted in actually applying it.
Firstly, I should like to comment on the issue of a community based on law and one based on values. In my view, the community based on law and the community based on values do not stand in contradiction to one other, rather they are interdependent.
Anyone who breaks the law or perverts the course of justice violates certain values.
And anyone who violates these values can be judged and condemned under the law.
You will understand that, in this context, what I am saying from the Austrian point of view is that, in their actions towards Austria, the 14 Member States of the European Union have infringed EU law, international law and the UN Charter, that they have defied the spirit of the European founding fathers and thus damaged the community of values.
And I therefore call upon you to repair that damage.
My second comment concerns the Commission as guardian of the Treaties.
On 1 February 2000, the Commission issued a statement on this matter saying that it would continue to fulfil its duty as guardian of the Treaties.
And with regard to Austria it said that, in this context, the Commission, in close contact with the governments of the Member States, would closely monitor the situation, maintaining its working relations with the Austrian authorities.
I would stress that, as guardian of the Treaties, the Commission has been closely monitoring the situation since 1 February 2000 and, to this day, it has not found any grounds for criticism, which makes it clear that neither the community based on law nor that based on values is being violated in Austria.
My third comment is that yesterday I made a mistake!
I should like to say this in conclusion.
I criticised my Socialist colleagues from Austria for the inconsistent way in which they voted, and I insinuated that at the end they had abstained from the vote on the Feira resolution.
That is wrong; they voted in favour.
This does not in any way change my critical attitude towards the double standards of the Austrian Social Democratic movement, which were also plain to see yesterday in the way its Members voted.
But I must admit my mistake.
It would not hurt the 14 either if, in Feira, they were to publicly retract the statement they made on 31 January 2000, contrary to the law, about one Member State, and if they were to rectify this mistake.
. (ES) Mr President, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and in my capacity as chairperson of this committee, I should like to use some of my allotted time to refute some statements in relation to our consideration of other committees' opinions.
The rapporteur is absolutely right, Mr President, to say that these amendments, though very interesting, are not relevant in this case.
Firstly, everyone is aware how hard I have fought to establish genuine administrative law in this area, however, the report centres on a different issue.
The same can be said in relation to the Committee on Petitions' other amendment that refers to an interinstitutional agreement and appeals to the Council and the Commission for greater cooperation.
We shall have to vote on these amendments, but in another report.
With regard to Mrs GrossetÃªte' s report, Mr President, the fact that I have only tabled one amendment - and even that was in conjunction with Mrs GrossetÃªte herself - is proof of my appreciation of her work and the spirit in which it was carried out.
Those of you who know me will be only too aware of the fact that, if I disagree with a text, particularly one that is close to my heart and to which I attach great importance, I never hold back when it comes to amendments.
There is one issue that I hope Mrs GrossetÃªte will raise during the vote - I unfortunately cannot attend, which is why I am making a point of it here - and that is the mistake in recital G. It should state that monitoring the application of Community law is first and foremost the responsibility of the courts.
As regards the other issues, this report is, in my view, thorough, comprehensive and of great importance.
I should like to mention a few points in relation to Mrs GrossetÃªte' s report.
We should perhaps consider broadening its scope, not only to encompass Annex IV and the development of Article 65, but also possibly take it further and perhaps consider -as part of the creation of the Europe of the Citizens - setting up communication channels to enable citizens to discuss issues that affect them in relation to Community law and even the Treaty on European Union.
Next year, Commissioner, we should like to see a more balanced and exhaustive report drawn up.
As Mrs GrossetÃªte herself pointed out, this report is very balanced and exhaustive in some areas but not in others.
The overall message put forward is that Community law must be applied properly; our Community is a Legal Community; there will either be a European rule of law or not; and monitoring compliance with Community law must be considered a priority.
Lastly, I should briefly like to highlight the importance of the infringement procedure and draw people' s attention, as others have before me, to this reform which is desirable and on which we all agree.
We need to improve the way in which the infringement procedure operates, but do so in a way that does not prevent citizens in the slightest from fully exercising their right to directly contact the Commission which, at the end of the day, is what brings them closer to it.
As we so often speak about bringing citizens closer to the institutions, this is surely one of the ways to achieve this aim.
Mr President, I want to thank Mrs GrossetÃªte for her report.
I agree with her: there is nothing more important that we could devote time to discussing in this Parliament.
Preceding the downfall of the Roman Empire it was customary to take out the imperial decree, unroll the great scroll of purple and gold, read it, have it copied and distribute it - and nobody took the slightest notice of it.
There is no surer way to bring about the downfall and disintegration of this Union than to make laws that Member States do not ensure are then observed.
One thing that did not come up in the discussion was the greater use that could be made of the proceedings in this House, particularly Question Time, to bring to the attention of the Commission and exchange views with them on grievances that arise throughout the Union.
These are increasingly being brought to the attention of Members of Parliament.
In the early days I lived in a border area where the right of freedom of movement of goods and services was not being observed and I found I could get a lot of satisfaction by raising questions directly with the Commission.
In those days Parliament did not have the same power or prestige that it has today.
So instead of reducing working time in this House we should devote a little more time to underlining the failures of the European Union to implement its decisions.
There are some areas that people, particularly in business, are well-familiar with, such as the single market.
But there are other areas where there is a lot of confusion.
I was at a conference last week.
Someone pointed out the fact that we need 100 million migrant workers in this Union over the next 25 years if we are to maintain economic growth and meet our social obligations.
If that happens, there will be a lot of movement of people.
If, from the very beginning, the European Union and the Member States make it clear that these people have equal rights, that the conditions on which they are admitted are common conditions and that they are free to move within the Union after they enter, then citizens would be half-way towards accepting the situation and we could forestall a lot of the difficulties with migrants which are already emerging.
Mr President, it is a shame that Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi has already left. However, I should like to speak in favour of the Committee on Petitions' conclusions.
Out of respect for my colleagues, in my previous intervention I made reference to what I termed the 'gremlins' that sometimes appear in Parliament, but it is not these poor gremlins' fault.
Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi made it very clear that the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights had no intention of incorporating the Committee on Petitions' conclusions.
Proof that these conclusions were unanimously adopted lies in the fact that they were signed by the chairman of the Committee on Petitions, another member of the Committee on Petitions from the European People' s Party, two members of the Socialist Group and I myself as draftsman of the opinion.
I am of the view that it is imperative for any report on the application of Community law to incorporate the Committee on Petitions' conclusions, as this committee plays such a key role in ensuring Member States apply Community law.
This is why I urge you to vote in favour of Amendments Nos 2 and 3.
Mr President, it is not my wish to see a problem arise between the Legal Affairs Committee and the Committee on Petitions.
The fact is that the basic points made by the Committee on Petitions have already been included in the text of the report I drew up.
The reason why we do not agree with your amendments, as Mrs Palacio has explained, is because this is not the place to include them.
If you look at the report in detail, you will find that the basic elements of your conclusions have been incorporated.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
Mr President, my Group abstained from voting on the GrossetÃªte report because in the middle of the perfectly acceptable general considerations on the application of Community law, the resolution put to the vote included a paragraph which we are unable to accept.
This is paragraph 11, which invites the Commission, and I quote,: "to be less timid in the use of the periodic penalty payment procedure in accordance with the third paragraph of Article 228(2) of the EC Treaty.
This Article stipulates that the Court of Justice may, as it sees fit, impose penalties or fines, sometimes very stiff ones, on a Member State that, for whatever reason, fails to apply Community law.
We feel, however, that the legal problem is not that simple, and that inflicting such penalties on Member States is excessive.
In fact, there may be totally legitimate contradictions between Community law and national law. For example, a contradiction which may appear following a qualified majority vote in Council - and there are an increasing number of such votes - or a contradiction which may appear between a national constitution and Community law, or even a contradiction which may appear between Community law and a law which has been voted for after due consideration by the population of a Member State.
These contradictions are very serious, they are still unresolved and this is why we see the existence of Article 228, which was brought in by the Maastricht Treaty, as wholly contestable.
I should like in particular to point out that France is now liable to incur severe penalties through the 1998 law, concerning, for example, hunting seasons which contradict Community law, the embargo on British beef and the conflict which, Mr President, is in the process of arising, relating to the patenting of human genes which authorises a European directive that contradicts French law.
This is why we absolutely cannot accept this report.
It is a question of respecting national sovereignty.
.
(FR) I am pleased that the proposed resolution contained in the report, on behalf of the Legal Affairs Committee, on monitoring the application of Community law in 1998, which I presented as rapporteur, was adopted in plenary in Strasbourg.
In doing so, the European Parliament sends a positive signal to Europe' s citizens, who have the right to expect a high level of protection through Community law.
This Assembly has also demonstrated its vigilance faced with the difficulties of application that exist in several Member States and in many spheres of activity.
It has remembered the importance of the infringement procedure, which must not become subject to opportune reform by the Commission.
It has highlighted the position of the preliminary question in the European system and the need to step up training in Community law within the Member States.
While nobody would deny the importance of petitions, I did not wish to go along with the amendments tabled by the members of the Committee on Petitions, in particular the request to set up a 'European administrative law' .
Account must be taken of the current state of progress in the construction of Europe and of the principle of subsidiarity.
I should stress, however, that the intention is to ask the Commission to intensify its relations with national administrations when there is a problem, in order that it can be resolved beforehand.
Taken as a whole, the resolution adopted serves to improve transparency and effectiveness, which is to the benefit of Europe' s citizens.
The Minutes of this session will be submitted for approval by Parliament at the start of the next part-session, if there is no objection.
Adjournment of the session
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
(The sitting was closed at 12 noon)
Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday, 16 June 2000.
Tribute
Statement by the President
Several days ago, ladies and gentlemen, 58 illegal immigrants tragically died in a lorry at the British border.
This was on 18 June.
The tragic deaths of these men and women who, like the two young Guinean men who died last year in the landing gear of a European plane, were investing their every hope in Europe, cannot fail to move us deeply.
Every one of us was, I am sure, outraged at this tragedy, and I am sure that we are all agreed that the European Union should step up its fight against this sort of modern-day slavery.
We must take every possible action to dismantle this 'industry' dealing in death.
The European Union must respond immediately, encompassing a genuine common immigration policy as well as the redefinition of North-South relations, involving aid to economic development and access to know-how as a priority.
The Treaty of Amsterdam has been in force for one year and the European Council at Tampere was held six months ago.
The legal bases for action are in place. All we need is genuine political will.
Action must be taken now.
This is why the Council Presidency and the European Commission will, at your request, be discussing this matter before Parliament tomorrow afternoon.
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of the previous sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
Madam President, on a point of order, I have here a report which appeared in the British newspaper The Independent concerning a meeting which appears to have taken place between yourself and Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.
According to this report, you left the meeting and then briefed the press on Her Majesty's political opinions.
This has caused a certain amount of concern and distress in political circles in the UK, because as, I am sure you know, the protocol of such meetings is that they are private and should not be commented on.
I would like to give you this opportunity to let us know what you understood the protocol of that meeting to be, and perhaps also to clarify what you said to the press afterwards.
Ladies and gentlemen, let me assure you that I gave no such press conference after leaving my meeting with Her Majesty.
I can, however, tell you that the euro was the focus of all my discussions with the authorities I met, and that they all showed great interest in this question.
I am quite inclined to tell you the whole story of my visit to the United Kingdom because, unfortunately, there were other aspects which, I am sorry to say, the British press did not cover, particularly the visit to a British farm which I was keen to make in order to fulfil a promise I had made.
While I am on this subject, I have to tell you that the British beef I tasted was truly delicious.
Madam President, yesterday, at the Euro 2000 final between France and Italy, an unfortunate and extremely serious incident occurred. As some disabled people entered the Rotterdam stadium, they were searched and subjected to a series of humiliating manoeuvres by the security guards.
This situation caused some Italian cameramen to film the treatment of the disabled people. As a result, a considerable number of journalists were attacked and beaten up by the police, and pictures of this scene were transmitted by all the television companies.
Some of the journalists were arrested simply because they were doing their duty.
I believe that the Rotterdam police were not acting on higher orders. Indeed, I am convinced that the Dutch Government and the heads of the Dutch forces of law and order have disclaimed any association with the actions of the police, but I certainly believe that the treatment reserved for these European disabled people who are Italian and therefore European citizens and some Italian journalists who were lawfully carrying out their duty of reporting incidents should be strongly condemned by Parliament and, moreover, the other European institutions as well.
I would also like to declare my disapproval on another matter in which you have taken a great interest, Madam President: the sentence passed on the 13 Iranian Jews who were sentenced to flogging a few days ago.
Fortunately, they were not sentenced to death, and that may be due to the intervention of Parliament which monitored the proceedings to ensure that the defendants received a fair trial in Iran.
At the dawn of the third millennium, more or less regular trials are still ending with the sentence of corporal punishment, and this does not seem worthy of either democracy or the civilisation of the third millennium.
In my opinion, whatever crime a person may have committed, it is uncivilised to sentence them to flogging.
I therefore call once again upon Parliament, the Council and the Commission to ensure that this Iranian Jewish minority is not subjected to further oppression at the Court of Appeal, for a certain element is already rejoicing that the Jews have been found guilty.
Anti-Semitism must cease to be part of the history of the European Union and the world, for the Jewish people have already suffered far too much.
Thank you, Mr Tajani.
As to the first point that you raise, clearly this is a truly shocking incident and I shall look into the most appropriate way of notifying the Dutch authorities of your legitimate protest.
As to your second question, on the sentencing of these Iranian Jews, I totally agree with your analysis of the situation.
The best thing would, perhaps, be for me to write to the President of the Republic of Iran to request that these thirteen people be pardoned, but I shall do so only if the sentence is upheld by the Court of Appeal.
I see that you agree to this suggestion.
Thank you.
Madam President, I would like to start by thanking you for the way that, during this initial stage, you take on board all our questions and follow them up with great care.
I would therefore like to thank you for your work.
As far as the Rotterdam incidents are concerned, I am in complete agreement with Mr Tajani.
Indeed, these were serious incidents which we would have not have thought possible, an affront to the freedom of the press as well to disabled people for the journalists were detained for several hours on no grounds at all.
In connection with these events, I would like to give you advance notice of our proposal, which we will expand in detail later on, to include a point referring to the said incidents in the topical and urgent questions on hooliganism.
This will give Parliament the opportunity to express a considered, responsible opinion on the matter.
I therefore call upon the Members to support this point when we vote on the topical and urgent subjects, for this will allow Parliament to express an opinion as it has a duty to do.
Madam President, precisely because the actions of the Dutch police have been called into the question, I would just like to protest about actions against Jews and corporal punishment etc., being mentioned in the same breath as the routine inspection undertaken by the Dutch police, who, following a request from a number of disabled Italian spectators at the match, endeavoured to push teams from Italian television aside.
When this attempt failed, these people were indeed detained by the police.
Moreover, I have to tell you that the Prime Minister of the Netherlands himself, and anyone else who was involved had nothing but praise for the way in which the Dutch police, along with the police from other Member States who were in attendance, defended public order.
I think this accusation is completely uncalled for, however much I, along with certain others, would have been only too pleased to see Italy win.
Madam President, contrary to the first speaker I should like to ask you to make our position very clear on the following point. On Friday, a bill was put before the Yugoslav parliament - a draft so-called anti-riot act - which is essentially targeted at the country's young people, more and more of whom are mobilising against Milosevic.
This bill has not yet been adopted.
I should like to ask you, Madam President, and of course also the Council and the Commission, to do all you can to prevent a bill of this kind from being adopted.
I do not know whether we will be able to influence the Yugoslav authorities or parliament, but the young people of Yugoslavia ought to know that we are on their side.
Mr Swoboda, I willingly take note of your statement and your request.
Madam President, I did not see the incident with regard to the handicapped or disabled people going into the stadium yesterday, or the supposed fracas with the Italian journalists.
However, I was in Rotterdam all day yesterday, from early morning until late last night and I was at the final.
I pass on my praise to the French, Italian, Dutch and many other fans who travelled from all over Europe to watch that final.
I also pass on my praise to the Dutch police for the way they conducted themselves, and to the people of Rotterdam.
It was an excellent day out in Rotterdam.
It was one of the best football matches I have ever attended.
The atmosphere was anything but hostile.
It was one of the best atmospheres I have experienced at a cup final.
On the point that Mr Helmer raised, can he join with me in congratulating Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II on supporting the euro?
I was in Rotterdam myself, in the spirit of complete impartiality necessitated by my position as President of the European Parliament, and I can confirm that the atmosphere was indeed as you describe.
Even so, we shall, nonetheless, look into the incident reported by Mr Tajani and Mrs Napoletano.
You can count on me to proceed with the requisite diplomacy.
I believe that we must look into this matter since it involved disabled people, making the incident much more serious.
Madam President, I would like to draw your attention to yesterday' s elections in Mexico.
There has been a change of power there.
A new president has been elected in Mexico, as well as a new House of Representatives and a new Senate.
The so-called institutional revolution, which lasted seventy years, has ended.
I would ask you to send greetings to the new president.
We can certainly all be happy about this change of power, because no revolution can last seventy years.
Madam President, I think that what is missing is a comment on the football match between Italy and France.
The reason why it all went so well was that Swedes and Danes were in charge of the match, so I think we should thank the referees and linesmen for their considerable efforts.
Thank you, Mr Blak.
So, yes, the referees, like both teams indeed, were excellent.
Agenda
The next item is the examination of the final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents pursuant to Rule 110 of the Rules of Procedure.
Relating to Thursday: Relating to Thursday, and the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance, I have received a number of requests for amendments to the agenda.
Firstly, a request from the Group of the Party of European Socialists to remove item 1, "Fiji and the Solomon Islands" .
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, three months ago there was a coup in Fiji.
Hostages were taken in the coup, and the press and politicians the world over have taken a stance on this.
Now it is over: negotiations have been held, the hostages have been freed and the coup has been over for some time.
I wonder what further urgent comments the European Parliament should now have to make on this.
In my view this contravenes Rule 50 and Annex III of our Rules of Procedure.
That is why we are requesting the deletion of this item from the list of topical and urgent subjects.
Madam President, it is clearly true that there have been developments this weekend but it is too soon to tell what they will amount to.
There is considerable doubt as to whether these developments will result in the restoration of full constitutional government in Fiji, so this issue still remains highly important and of topical interest.
The Indo-Fijians, the Indian population of Fiji, are in considerable danger.
There has been lawlessness, damage to property, and cases of assault and rape without any intervention by the security forces in recent weeks.
I have had representations to the effect that people are looking to the European Union for some kind of effective action, possibly - and this could be debated in the context of the resolution - some kind of sanctions under the LomÃ© Convention.
I do not want to debate the content now but I do want to ask that this be maintained on the agenda, because after what has happened over the weekend, there is still a risk of considerable discrimination against one ethnic group in Fiji.
There is no confidence that the constitution will be applied properly and will be observed.
I do not agree that what has happened reduces the topical importance of the issue.
(Parliament rejected the request) President.
I now come to another request from the Group of the Party of European Socialists, this time to remove the following item, "Tibet" .
Madam President, once again it is not the content of a motion for a resolution that is at issue here but our Rules of Procedure.
In the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy we have been trying to ensure - and I appeal to all those colleagues who have been involved in this initiative - that important issues of this kind are not dealt with in the topical and urgent debate; instead we want to ensure that proper treatment is reserved for them in the form of a committee procedure, an oral question or a Council statement.
Here the issue is Tibet.
We know how important this is.
In 1992 I personally produced a report on Tibet.
A motion reflecting the report's conclusions was adopted almost unanimously by Parliament.
On 15 April here in this House we unanimously adopted a resolution on Tibet, and now we are repeating what we said on 15 April, perhaps with one or two minor additions.
I do not believe that Parliament's reputation is enhanced by our constantly debating the same subjects.
That is why we are requesting that this item be withdrawn.
Madam President, Tibet is an issue which is on our agenda year after year after year, and to that extent I understand the point that the honourable Member has made.
We have adopted resolutions on this subject time and time again.
It is a country that is illegally occupied by China and its people are oppressed by that regime.
It is an urgent issue because in recent months we have seen various measures being taken by the Chinese government to move people into the area of Tibet and to exploit the natural resources there.
These measures were initially supported by the World Bank, Germany, the United States and the United Kingdom.
Now that the pressure has been put on, Germany and the United States have withdrawn their support.
The World Bank is withdrawing support but it has not yet said so publicly.
It is urgent that we put pressure on them to withdraw support for these measures so that this Parliament can stand up for the people of Tibet, stand up for democracy, stand up for the stopping of what is an illegal act in international law.
(Parliament rejected the request)
President.
Still on the subject of topical and urgent debate, regarding the "Human rights" section, I have received three requests to replace the sub-item on "Hooliganism" : a request from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance to replace this item with a new sub-item entitled "Outbreaks of racism in Germany and the killing of Alberto Adriano" , a request from the Group of the Party of European Socialists to replace this sub-item by one entitled "Incidents at the Rotterdam football stadium" , and a request from the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party to replace this sub-item by one entitled "Desecration of Prague' s oldest Jewish cemetery" .
We shall examine each of these requests in turn.
Madam President, the persecution on racist grounds of people in eastern Germany by their fellow human beings is becoming an increasingly serious issue.
It is an old and yet highly topical matter.
I mention this for Mr Sakellariou's sake, because just this weekend in Neissen people were once again persecuted simply because they speak a different language and because their skin is a different colour.
We must not allow this in Europe, and it is necessary, as a matter of urgency, for the European Parliament to support the forces of reason - which are growing weaker - in their efforts in eastern Germany to combat these racist tendencies and take action against neo-Nazis who want to create no-go areas for foreigners.
That is the background to this motion; the idea is that we state clearly that Europe has a vocation to be a multicultural Europe and that Europe supports all democratic forces battling against racism and neo-Nazism.
It is with this in mind that I ask you to support our request.
(Parliament rejected the request from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance) President.
We shall now move on to the second request, which is from the Group of the Party of European Socialists, that we replace the sub-item on "Hooliganism" with another sub-item entitled: "Incidents at the Rotterdam football stadium" .
In my opinion, on the subject of topical and urgent debates, as we have often found, it is not a matter of the extent to which we agree or whether to deal with this or that subject but of how to deal with it, and it sometimes happens that some of us consider that certain debates or resolutions should be dealt with in a more appropriate context, so to speak.
However, in this case, the matter is truly urgent pursuant to the Rules of Procedure because it happened yesterday, and I therefore feel that in treating it as such Parliament is being faithful to the intention behind the relevant provision of the Rules of Procedure, that is to deal with topical matters.
I feel that in holding a topical and urgent debate on this matter we would be acting upon our discussion earlier this morning, which you agreed to champion, Madam President.
We are all here and there is nothing to stop us, and in this way we will show all those countries against whom we often have to deliver opinions that we will not hold back on matters requiring thorough investigation such as discrimination against the disabled or where journalists are prevented from doing their job, and that we will not hesitate to investigate these incidents even when they occur within our Community.
I imagine that none of the Dutch Members of any of the political groups will object if we decide to investigate the matter thoroughly, for there is no doubt in any of our minds that the incident was not in any way motivated by political will, but this is the very reason why we must prevent such incidents from occurring.
This is our opportunity to do so.
Madam President, that makes perfect sense to me, given that you have already promised to make inquiries in your famously discreet manner, and we are not going to entertain the idea of having a debate and a resolution on urgent subjects just because of some cock-and-bull stories.
It seems to me to be obvious that we should await the outcome of your mission.
(Parliament rejected the request from the Group of the Party of European Socialists)
Madam President, I would like to make a suggestion and ask the Members whether this resolution on hooliganism will also deal with the incidents which occurred at the Rotterdam stadium. You can put it to the vote if need be.
I am sure that it would be possible to include the matter and we could also decide to instruct the negotiators to take it into account.
I feel this is a reasonable suggestion, for if we do not make an effort to act in some way we would certainly be guilty of reluctance to do our duty. I would find this totally unacceptable.
Madame Napoletano, I do not think that I need to put this proposal to the vote.
Everyone has heard the suggestion.
When we come to framing the resolutions, we will all remember your suggestion and bear it in mind.
Finally the third request, which is from the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, to replace the sub-item on "Hooliganism" with a new sub-item entitled "Desecration of Prague' s oldest Jewish cemetery" .
Madam President, our group believes it would indeed be more useful to concentrate on the matter of Prague and Czechoslovakia instead of hooliganism, because the foundations of the oldest Jewish cemetery were uncovered during the construction of an underground car park.
The coffins were then dug up and removed from the cemetery completely without ceremony.
Despite the Czech government' s promises to find an alternative site for the underground car park and to duly respect the cemetery as an historic monument, and despite the protests issued by various embassies, the construction work continued.
Our group feels that it must be made clear to candidate countries such as the Czech Republic that the European Union insists on respect being shown for fundamental rights such as freedom of worship and philosophy of life.
I think that now would be the ideal time for the European Parliament to issue a statement to this effect.
(Parliament rejected the request from the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party)
Madam President, we have just decided to retain the hooliganism motion on the agenda for the debate on topical and urgent subjects.
I should like to make a particular request to the translation service and indeed those who are speaking to the motion: one of the football teams with which some hooliganism was associated was the team representing England.
The Member State which has responsibility for that question is the United Kingdom.
But it is very important in this matter to draw a distinction between Britain - as the state which has overall responsibility - and one of its parts, namely England.
This is all the more important given the known intention of the Scottish Football Association to apply to host the next European Cup but one.
I have received a request from the Group of the Party of European Socialists to remove the sub-item on Iraq.
Madam President, I will not tire of appealing to the consciences of my colleagues.
We, and other Members, in particular the coordinators of the Foreign Affairs Committee, have established that the matters which we select for consideration in the topical and urgent debate are not always very appropriate.
This also applies here, to Iraq.
Three months ago, at the April plenary part-session, we adopted a resolution in which we say everything that it is possible for us to say about Iraq.
All the issues are covered.
I have carefully read the new motions for resolutions which have been tabled, but they do not contain anything new.
Nevertheless, this is to be included as a topical and urgent motion because one group, which has travelled to Iraq of its own accord, now has to submit this motion for a resolution.
I think that this would be wrong and irresponsible of Parliament, and that is why we are asking for this item to be withdrawn.
(Parliament rejected the request) President.
We now have a request to replace the item on Venezuela with a new item entitled "Colombia and the international conference of donor countries in Madrid" .
Madam President, there is to be an international conference on 7 July on the "Colombia Plan" which is to bring donor countries together, in the context of the aid plan for that country, also known as the "Marshall Plan" .
At the present time there are two different strategies on the table as regards such aid. One is a strategy from America aiming to increase police repression.
Personally, and I think I may speak on behalf of my Group, we feel this approach is doomed to failure. Indeed this has already been demonstrated on several occasions.
The other strategy, from Europe, which is intended to effect changes in culture, and which therefore represents a more preventative method, is, we think, a better solution and alternative policy.
In any event, we think it important that the European Parliament should express its opinion on the subject in the few days before this conference.
Madam President, I do not wish to speak against the proposal because I am in complete agreement with what my friend and fellow Member, Paul Lannoye, has just said.
I do, however, deplore the fact that this proposal is set to replace a resolution on Venezuela which is the follow up to a visit to that country by an official delegation from the European Parliament following the serious floods which devastated that country, especially as we have not had an opportunity to discuss the matter since then.
I shall personally, therefore, abstain from voting on the proposal, though unwillingly.
I would much rather the proposal had not been made, even though I do agree completely with Paul Lannoye' s argument.
(Parliament rejected the request) President.
The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has requested that the item on "Venezuela" be replaced by a new point on "Temelin" .
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, our hats are on fire as we say in Austria, but unfortunately the very fact that this is a burning issue means that there is no time for joking.
The nuclear power station in Temelin is being commissioned earlier than was agreed or was expected, and it is not intended to carry out the environmental impact assessment until some time after the fuel elements have been installed, making it a pointless exercise.
This is also happening against the wishes of the Czech Environment Minister, against the wishes of a large part of the Czech population and in spite of an urgent request from the German and Austrian Environment Ministers for detailed information on the safety arrangements.
Obviously, the Czech Republic still has more time to implement the acquis communautaire in full, but people might well have doubts about whether the Czech Republic is willing even now to start taking on board these aspects of European policy which are of fundamental importance for its citizens and for environment policy.
There is no need for me to describe the concerns felt by those living in the adjoining areas.
The whole thing could happen as early as next week.
I think that the European Parliament also ought to speak out on this.
I am rather torn.
I am Austrian and yet as a European from the adjoining area I obviously also wish us to proceed together on this.
Madam President, this is a point of order.
This absurd debate demonstrates that a Provan report on urgent procedures would be welcome, because the Prime Minister of Portugal has been waiting an hour for us to finish.
I do not understand how a political group in this House can table two motions to replace a point on the agenda.
I do not know which Rule of the Rules of Procedure this is based on.
I would be grateful if you could explain this to me, Madam President.
Mr BarÃ³n Crespo, this is perfectly permissible under the Rules of Procedure.
Having said that, you have just expressed out loud what many people were thinking to themselves.
We must apologise to Mr Guterres, and I must thank you for urging our fellow Members to be much briefer.
(Parliament rejected the request) I am sorry, but the Conference of Presidents proposed only four subjects.
I have received a request from the Group of the Party of European Socialists and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance to add a new item on the "European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia" .
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, that is precisely why we wanted to withdraw a number of items. We wanted to have fewer overall.
But I will be brief.
As you know, the Monitoring Centre is in Vienna.
Some time ago there were difficulties there between the government and the Director of this Monitoring Centre and also the Austrian representative.
Now it appears that the difficulties are being resolved and that better relations are once again being established.
Nevertheless, I believe that this House ought to call on all governments - the Austrian Government and the other governments - to ensure that the Monitoring Centre is in fact able to operate effectively and to support it in its work.
That is why we should like to add this item.
Madam President, I request that this is not taken as a topical and urgent motion.
The matter is potentially a very serious one, involving perhaps a breach of Article 10 of the Treaties, and I believe it requires more serious consideration than can be given to a topical and urgent motion on a Thursday afternoon.
This matter has been drawn to the attention of the Committee on Citizens' Rights and Freedoms, Justice and Home Affairs, which I have the honour to chair.
We have received the opinion of the Director of the Monitoring Centre on the matter, we have asked our budget rapporteur to investigate more widely the question of the Austrian government's attitude to the European Union Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia.
We need to know the full facts regarding the resignation of Mr Pelinka, the Austrian member of the Centre's Executive Board.
It may be that we need to refer the matter to the Group of Three Wise Persons charged with investigating the situation in Austria.
But a topical and urgent motion would shed more heat than light on the matter, and seems to me to be an inappropriate vehicle.
Therefore I would appeal to Members to vote against this request.
(Parliament gave its assent) The other two requests therefore lapse, and there are no further requests for amendments to the agenda.
(The order of business was adopted thus amended)
European Council/Portuguese presidency
The next item is the joint debate on the European Council report and the Commission statement on the European Council meeting at Feira and the statement by the President-in-Office of the Council regarding the Portuguese Presidency.
Thank you, Mr President.
I now give the floor to Mr Patten to speak on behalf of the Commission.
Madam President, I should like to begin by associating myself, as the Prime Minister has just done, with your moving tribute to President Pflimlin.
I am sure that we all agreed with everything you said about his role as one of the architects of Europe and of democratic accountability in Europe.
Can I also say that it is a privilege to follow that characteristically eloquent and politically perceptive speech.
Before saying a few words myself about the recent European Council in Feira which I attended with President Prodi, who is not with us this afternoon because he is attending a meeting in Paris with the new presidency, I would like, on behalf of all my colleagues in the Commission, to pay tribute to the hard work, skill and energy that the Portuguese government has devoted over the last six months to the presidency of the Council.
This ensured the success not only of the Lisbon and Feira summits, but of the day-to-day work behind the scenes that is vital in carrying Europe towards its ambitious goals.
I would just like to add that it was a great pleasure working with the team of Portuguese ministers, as well as an extremely rewarding experience.
We recognise how many of them, like the secretary of state, worked at a spectacular rate which would certainly have got them the man-of-the-match award during a number of the 90-minute matches of the last few weeks.
The European Council on 19 and 20 June was a very valuable meeting of important consolidation.
The agenda was very broad and I simply want to focus on what seemed to the Commission to be some of the most important highlights.
First the heads of state and government confirmed that Greece meets the necessary conditions to enter the third phase of economic and monetary union.
Greece will join the euro zone from 1 January next year which I hope will send messages to one or two other countries, including the one I know best.
(Applause)
I notice that Mr Helmer is not here to join in the applause.
(Laughter)
Second, the European Council took stock of the progress made in implementing the economic and social agenda adopted at Lisbon.
The Council gave, as the Prime Minister said, renewed encouragement to the work that has already been begun, particularly on the e-Europe action plan, research and enterprise policy and the extremely important subject of social inclusion.
In September the Commission will submit its proposals for indicators that will allow us to measure how well we are performing in meeting the goals set at Lisbon.
These indicators can then be used as the basis for the synthesis report to the European Council in spring next year.
Thirdly, some progress was achieved on completing the internal market.
In particular Europe's energy markets are to be further liberalised and air transport will be made more efficient by creating what has come to be called a single European sky.
Fourth, the Council welcomed the broad economic guidelines for 2000 and recommended their adoption by the Council.
These guidelines reflect the need to sustain growth and to continue pursuing macro-economic policies that promote stability.
The guidelines lay particular emphasis on the quality and sustainability of public finances and the need to continue reforming Europe's product, capital and labour markets.
The Council restated its commitment to carrying through reforms that are essential to enable Europe to become a truly knowledge-based economy.
During the Feira meeting we were shocked, as you said Madam President, by the news of the tragic death of 58 illegal immigrants hidden in a truck in Dover.
The European Council issued a strong condemnation of this traffic in human beings and the Council renewed its commitment to Europe-wide action against the criminals involved in such activities.
The tragedy at Dover underlines Europe's urgent need for a common immigration and asylum policy; a point that I notice much of the media -including in the country I know best - has been making.
The Commission will be putting forward proposals on these matters before the end of the year.
Trafficking in human beings is a serious international crime that no one government can tackle single-handedly.
There has to be a common European definition of the crime and vigorous cross-border cooperation to ensure that those who perpetrate it are caught and are punished.
Our citizens expect no less than that, and we must live up to their expectations.
Our citizens also expect swift and positive action on food safety, especially in the wake of last year's food scandals.
The Commission has been working energetically in this area.
The European Council expressed strong support for what we are doing.
The Council committed itself to making progress on setting up an independent food-safety authority, as soon as Parliament has delivered its opinion.
I am confident that this opinion will be given by the first October part-session at the latest.
At Feira a last minute breakthrough was achieved on the tax package - a lot of midnight oil and quite a lot of breakfast went into that successful outcome.
This complex agreement involves the directive on the taxation of savings.
Before the directive is adopted, discussions will be held with the United States and key third countries, such as Switzerland, in which we hope to promote the adoption of equivalent measures internationally.
Meanwhile the coexistence model will continue, with European Union countries either exchanging information or levying a withholding tax themselves.
The directive should be adopted by unanimity no later than 31 December 2002.
Agreement on this, as honourable Members will recognise, was not easy, especially for Member States that have a strong tradition of banking secrecy.
We welcome the positive outcome.
In the areas for which I have some responsibility, there were also, as the Prime Minister has mentioned, some important developments at Feira.
We took stock of the European Union's relations with Russia and the situation there, including in Chechnya, in the light of the recent EU-Russia Summit, which I think was regarded as fairly successful.
It is too early to judge President Putin's economic programme; however, our basic message is that a sound programme will be vital to boost investor confidence.
On Chechnya, there have, it is true, been some recent moderately positive developments in response to international and European Union pressure: for example the recent ECHO mission was able to take place and western humanitarian agencies have greater access to the area.
The conflict nevertheless continues and we still have considerable concerns.
In particular, we want to see much greater access for humanitarian aid agencies.
We want to see genuinely independent investigation into reports of human rights abuses, and we want to see a real dialogue between the Russian government and the Chechens.
I welcome the adoption of the common strategy on the Mediterranean.
The presidency should take particular credit for driving that through.
It will help our efforts to strengthen the Barcelona process.
The Commission will be presenting proposals to reinvigorate the process later this month.
The Mediterranean Strategy is global, covering all countries in the region and including the consolidation of peace in the Middle East.
After years of conflict and tension in the Middle East, the time is clearly ripe for peace.
We welcome the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon.
Our expert mission has returned from South Lebanon and we are considering what we can do to help rehabilitation in the area.
At Feira, Javier Solana and I presented a follow-up report outlining what had been achieved in the western Balkans since Lisbon.
The Prime Minister again referred to the importance of that.
The key challenges for the month ahead will be continued support to Montenegro, the strengthening of the Serbian civil society and the Serbian media, support of the Kosovo elections and to UNMIK and support for regional integration.
I was in Kosovo again last week for what was my fourth visit and I also visited the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia on Friday.
I saw once again the challenge we face, but also the impact that we can have when we work together.
I just want to add a couple of points.
First of all we were enormously grateful to the delegation from Parliament that went recently to Kosovo and was able to confirm that our team there is doing a good job and that there is not an absorption capacity problem as far as the assistance is concerned.
I hope that the Council and Parliament will support the proposals we have put forward for a new regulation to govern our financial assistance to the Balkans.
If we want to speed things up, then it is important to speed up the consideration of things like our new financial regulation.
I hope that we can also expect strong support for the proposals that we have put forward for asymmetric autonomous trade measures for the region.
It is very important if we want those countries to trade more together that we should give them greater access to our own market here.
That would give them the best sort of assistance in the months and years ahead.
Before I conclude, I would like to say something briefly about the EU-India Summit.
That summit was entirely a consequence of the initiative taken by the Portuguese presidency last autumn, although I know that there are many Members of this House like Mr Dupuis who have been active proponents of a closer dialogue with India for many years.
We have sometimes, in the Union, underestimated the importance of India and underestimated the importance of developing our economic and political relationship with it.
India is the greatest democracy in the world.
At every election, more people vote than in the European Union, the United States and Canada put together.
It is a democracy which shares many of our values and had a tradition of political tolerance when we still believed in the divine right of kings.
What we managed to achieve at the meeting last week in Lisbon was an important step forward.
I hope that in the new year we will be able to start the round table meetings with representatives of civil society in India.
I hope that we will be able to inaugurate the think-tank network with India and that will see a further development and strengthening of our relationship with that extraordinary and important country.
To conclude, the Feira Council crowned an extremely successful Portuguese presidency.
Above all it laid the foundations for a number of important decisions which will have to be taken later this year at least.
The Prime Minister mentioned some of the constitutional discussions that we have started to have in the European Union.
I am tempted to follow him down some of those highways and byways.
But perhaps I should leave that for the time being to my elders and betters, although I promise not to take a vow of omertÃ  on the subject.
Obviously we need to have some important political debates.
The German Foreign Minister, albeit speaking in a personal capacity, made a speech which breached the dam and all sorts of remarks and arguments are now flooding through.
I have always believed it is better in politics to talk about important things rather than sweep them under the carpet.
I am sure we will be doing that in the next few months although it is important for us to concentrate on the real priorities for the IGC before Nice.
We wish the Presidency of the French Republic every success in carrying the process forward.
I very much hope that they will have as much success as the Portuguese Presidency.
I am sure they will be as engaging to work with.
(Applause)
- (PT) Prime Minister, I hope you understand, as a former Parliamentarian yourself, that in Parliament it is on political issues that we should focus our debate.
There are at least two questions that I wish to ask you with regard to your speech.
First of all, I was surprised to hear you criticise what you called 'a shift towards an intergovernmental approach' , because, if one thing has occurred in the six months of the Portuguese Presidency, it is that the Council has actually become stronger at the expense of the Commission and Parliament. This was also clear from your words when you described the Employment Summit as 'showing a strong desire for political leadership of the Union' , demonstrating that, in fact, you see this as leadership by the Council at the expense of the other two institutions.
It is therefore worth tempering words and intentions with reality.
If we look at the most uncomfortable issue of the last six months, which I admit you would not really want to discuss here, that is, the Austrian question, we see the extent of the shift in recent months.
There are aspects of the Austrian question that are very dangerous for the future of the Union. The impasse in which the Union found itself at the Feira Council shows exactly why this shift is so dangerous.
First of all, it replaced the principle of collegiality in Union decisions with a greater emphasis on bilateral action between Governments.
If anyone should never have acted as spokesperson for the Fourteen, it was you, as President of the European Union.
You should never, under any circumstances, have acted as spokesperson, even if you felt that Portugal should agree to the sanctions against Austria.
As a result of your action, the Austrian question has become a European Union issue.
From the institutional point of view, this issue will clearly taint the European Union' s internal relations unless it is quickly resolved.
We all know that in order not to lose face, the basis of a resolution has already been negotiated.
This basis of a resolution, however, is a sign of weakness: weakness, essentially, on the part of the Fourteen countries that have taken a political initiative and do not know how to get out of it.
In contemporary politics, the trend towards handing political decisions to experts and judges shows just how weak politicians are.
These sanctions originated from a political measure and the same people who initiated them should have had the courage to take the decision to lift them. This should have been done at Feira.
As to the Intergovernmental Conference, unfortunately I do not have much speaking time left, but I must say that dangerous trends are being followed there too.
I am not against closer cooperation, but it must be made quite clear that closer cooperation falls within the area of the Union' s sectoral policies and is not an institutional or political matter.
Otherwise, at some point in the future, we will have two European Unions, a first- and a second-class Union. This situation would put an end to what has been the driving force of the European Union and the European Community since the Second World War.
Closer cooperation must therefore not lead to a two-speed Europe.
Instead, it must enable whoever wants to do so to move forward more quickly in terms of sectoral policies, but not in terms of the institutions, or else we will risk splitting the Union.
Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to echo our President' s tribute to President Pfimlin, who, as well as being a predecessor of mine and a great friend, was the person who welcomed the Spanish and Portuguese MEPs when we arrived in this House, precisely because we had built a community of values in our countries of the type we are now trying to strengthen.
I believe that this is an essential point because the Prime Minister of Portugal, over recent months, has indicated that he is firmly committed to defending these common values.
Prime Minister Guterres has paid Parliament a compliment by saying that relations with us have been good over this six-month term.
I would like to return this compliment because, during my years of experience in this House, I had never known a Prime Minister to appear three times during a Presidency, but he has done just that.
By showing this courtesy, the Portuguese Presidency has taken a significant step.
I am not just pleased that he has come here, but also that there have been two issues fundamental to this Parliament on which he has helped us positively and demonstrated his political sensitivity. I am referring to the Statute of MEPs, on which the Portuguese Presidency has continued the work started by the Finnish Presidency, and the Statute of the political parties.
The high point of the Portuguese Presidency was undoubtedly the Lisbon Summit, and furthermore I am happy that Prime Minister Guterres has indicated this in speaking of the knowledge society, because I believe that this is the key to the European Union' s investment in the future.
In relation to the Lisbon Summit I would like to highlight the importance which my group attaches to the triangle of employment, social cohesion and competitiveness, which is absolutely essential to us, and which is already part, not only of the Portuguese Presidency' s plans, but also of our policies, and which has been strengthened in Feira.
I would like to highlight the importance of the agreement which has been reached on taxation, because the European Union cannot make progress in the social field if the increasing discrepancy between employment incomes and capital incomes persists.
In this respect we cannot invoke banking secrecy.
If we are to progress in a serious and socially just way, it is very important that we take the step of dealing with all these incomes jointly, and, furthermore, I believe that this is a good first step in relation to the process of globalisation.
Another fundamental point is the progress in the Intergovernmental Conference.
The Portuguese Presidency began this, took it forward up until Feira and responded positively to the European Parliament' s suggestion to broaden the agenda, not only in relation to our requests but also to the Council' s compromises.
I would like to point out firstly that, in relation to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, although it has still not been included, an important step has been made in that direction.
There is something else, and in this regard I do not believe that President Guterres is going to criticise his Secretary of State. Last week, in different articles, I and the Secretary of State himself, both said that the method by which the convention was proceeding, that is to say, with the active participation of European and national parliaments, representatives of the governments and the Commission, is much better than Intergovernmental Conferences behind closed doors.
I hope that Mr Seixas da Costa' s personal opinion can be endorsed by the out-going President of the Council, because I believe that would be very positive.
Secondly, in relation to the debate on federalism and constitution, which fortunately has woken the issue of Europe from its lethargy, I would like to point out that it is not an academic or an ex novo debate, and that it must be held while respecting, and on the basis of, the current institutional balance.
I agree with the challenge set by President Guterres when he said that we have to talk about federalism in all areas.
Fine.
The problem is that we have monetary federalism, but we still do not have economic federalism, when we need to defend the euro and defend it seriously.
Madam President, I would like to make a final observation in relation to an important decision taken by the Portuguese Presidency bilaterally with thirteen governments.
I believe that the Portuguese Presidency was acting seriously and prudently when it proposed the decision of the fourteen countries.
I must say that the European Parliament and the Commission have been on the same wavelength since February and the Portuguese Presidency cannot be criticised for defending our community of values in the face of a decision of a political party to form a government with another party whose ideology and beliefs are absolutely contrary to our common values.
I believe that the Portuguese Presidency has shown signs of patience and perseverance and has defended our common values.
Madam President, my group also salutes the Portuguese Presidency's cooperation with the European Parliament and thanks it for this.
As far as the results of the Feira summit are concerned, however, we are rather more sceptical.
In recent weeks a debate has broken out between the governments of the Member States about the future of Europe, and even about having a constitution.
In stark contrast to these competing visions, however, is the way in which preparations for the Intergovernmental Conference are shaping up.
It even seems that the images of the distant future conjured up by a good many ministers are actually intended to conceal the European Council's inability to resolve the issues it has set itself.
Since Maastricht this European Council has been putting off the problems, the unresolved questions and the necessary reforms.
Many of these were already left unresolved in Amsterdam.
The public's confidence in the EU has now reached an all-time low in all the Member States.
In eastern Europe frustration is growing at the EU's hesitant attitude.
The real initiatives - highlighted by Parliament in all of its resolutions for years - are in some cases not even being discussed in the preparations for the Intergovernmental Conference.
The most important objective is surely to create and develop a European democracy and to eliminate the democratic deficit.
In Feira we did not see a decision to incorporate the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the Treaty, one of the decisions most eagerly anticipated by the people of Europe.
An alternative approach to the Intergovernmental Conference, which this Parliament has repeatedly advocated, was not even mentioned.
I think that, instead of making people want to enshrine the prevailing system in a future constitution, the European Council will have given everyone cause to consider the system's gross shortcomings, manifest in the current Intergovernmental Conference.
A procedure for adopting a constitution has not been planned or launched; there is barely a definite notion of doing so.
Questions remain about parliamentary and judicial control in the second and third pillars, as they do about the status of European parties and so on.
Neither are there any tangible plans for meeting the second challenge, to create a social dimension to European integration.
I believe that all of this has serious consequences for the degree of acceptance of the EU by those on the inside and also for the expectations which the eastern European countries have of us.
We still have a few more months, but the work will have to pick up speed and increase in gravity and depth at a much greater rate than we have seen so far!
Madam President, Prime Minister, the Feira Council did not provide any new items of substance.
It was even repetitive where certain fundamental policies are concerned and made no changes to weightier issues.
It was a disappointment for that very reason.
Predictably, the main themes, ranging from enlargement to the CIG, via the Charter of Fundamental Rights, were largely put off for the Nice Summit.
This is certainly why it became necessary to come up with a last-minute agreement on timetabling the tax package which, in the end and in essence, is restricted to waiting for another agreement a few years off, which will still be dependent on its unlikely acceptance by third countries, which are precisely today' s tax havens.
It is therefore not surprising that this virtual agreement should have been particularly warmly welcomed by those who have never been keen on a greater balance between legislation on capital and labour and who have always opposed mounting any joint action against these tax havens for tax evasion, fraud or the movement of large sums of money.
On the contrary and in the name of the completion of the internal market and the follow up to the Lisbon Special Summit, we have seen new pressures for speeding up the process of liberalisation and deregulation of the labour market.
When the broad economic policy guidelines for 2000 were approved it was accepted that constraints resulting from the Stability Pact would have to be strengthened and provided for, which suggests that there will be further and greater problems, particularly in the social domain.
The reasons for the large demonstration organised by the trade union movement at the Feira Summit are therefore understandable and the fact that tens of thousands of people took part in this demonstration definitely made it one of the most striking features of the Summit.
There are also grounds for concern in another area, however.
I am referring to the revision of the Treaties.
Almost the entire task has been left to the French Presidency and the most important aspect in this area has already moved beyond the normal institutional framework, into bilateral summits and various conferences and statements.
Nevertheless, in this area, we cannot let pass without comment the fact that the Feira Summit did not only fail to include the revision on the agenda but that it spoke about 'a form of closer cooperation' in the singular.
We already had deep-felt concerns about what has up until now been known as 'closer cooperation' , given its profound and unmistakable connotations of the creation of a hard core, a vanguard or a pioneer group. This would therefore mean a multi-speed Europe, headed by a political cabinet.
The adoption of this new wording, because it is undoubtedly much more indicative of such ideas, increases these doubts and makes us extremely apprehensive as to the kind of European construction which some people are advocating.
The worst thing is that other people seem to be distracted...
I reserve a final word of disapproval for the obvious trend towards the militarisation of the European Union. Proof of this is the fact that we are developing our own military capabilities, clearly in tandem with NATO.
We still think that the OSCE is still the most appropriate framework for developing the European Union' s security system. We also take the view that the prevention of crises and civilian crisis management should prevail over any interventionist action.
- (PT) Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the rotating presidency is one of the cornerstones of our Union. It is evidence that we are united on the path of cooperation and that we do not take the imperial route of some countries dominating others.
In addition to this, it works well, as the Portuguese Presidency has clearly demonstrated.
The fact that the Portuguese Presidency was a success and that comments on it have been universally positive confirms and reinforces the truth of this situation and our belief in it.
As a Portuguese citizen, a non-federalist and a European, I can only be delighted, in spite of our political differences.
Those who wish to see the Union' s system of a rotating presidency changed are wrong.
It is not true that only the large and powerful countries can preside over the Union.
The presidency can and must be divided between Member States, since this is symbolic of the fact that we share a common path.
