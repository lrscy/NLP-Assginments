They are the consequence of integration. On this we are all agreed.
We should continue our efforts to make the Lamfalussy structure the regulatory vehicle for delivering the effective, efficient and converged supervision required by a single market in financial services.
Work has been set in motion in order to determine how the Lamfalussy structure and our financial stability arrangements can be further improved to meet the demands that arise from closer European integration.
I look forward to discussing with Parliament in due course what precise initiatives may be required to respond to the problems that have been identified, so as to equip our European financial sector with the best possible supervisory system.
This is critical, because top-class supervisory and regulatory structures are crucial for long-term EU capital market competitors in the global economy.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Madam President, it is good that Mrs BerÃšs' question on the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is being discussed and answered here today.
This follows on seamlessly from the Muscat report, and also from yesterday's debate in committee - in which the Commissioner also participated.
The crisis simulation with a view to reviewing financial stability in the EU that was presented at the Ecofin meeting in Helsinki last September has indeed revealed shortcomings.
This scenario - that is, constantly evolving financial instruments such as hedge funds and derivative financial instruments - illustrates the need for further debate that takes sufficient account of consumer security.
Thus, we need a system of functional, interlinked supervisory rules and practices in the EU.
Consumer protection, an effective financial industry and stable financial markets constitute the supreme objective of financial supervision, which must also help the industry fully utilise its potential and creativity.
Therefore, good supervision must be guided by the existing risks and must take a principle-based approach instead of devoting itself to detailed individual analysis.
It must not impose any additional burdens on enterprises, the rules must be developed in close contact with the financial industry, and cross-border financial markets must be dealt with at pan-European and global level in equal measure.
Supervision should be limited to what is really necessary and useful.
Existing measures should be used in a more cautious, more market-friendly way, avoiding imposing unnecessary burdens.
At the present time, I strongly oppose a centralised European supervisory authority additional and parallel to the national supervisory authorities, as this would cancel out the EU principle of subsidiarity and lack any democratic legitimacy.
Not only would a body such as this meet with a lack of understanding on the part of many, particularly as it would create additional non-transparent bureaucracy, but it would also be accompanied by a serious loss of sovereignty for the Member States, as it would disregard national budgets in the case of crises.
Let us first wait and see how the supervisory bodies of the newly formed 27 come together and do their work.
We do not need a uniform, centralised supervisory structure, but we do need a common supervisory culture characterised by the same values and objectives.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (MT) There has been constant reference to a report drawn up by myself, dealing with this area in detail and approved by this Parliament.
This report, which has now been adopted as the position of this Parliament, contains an analysis of a situation that is becoming ever more acute.
One of the most important points is the fact that different practices and levels of supervision exist at national level.
From a European perspective, this signifies a reduction in market efficiency, as well as further operating costs for institutions that operate in different countries.
The report questions whether the present system ensures the effective supervision of large groups that operate in various countries and sectors.
We even requested a more detailed examination of the European Social Model at the level of prudential stability and crisis management structures.
We agreed on the need for an effective crisis management system at European level.
The current market development trend means that a crisis, even if initially originating in one country, can quickly spread to other countries.
The reaction to a crisis such as this one is becoming increasingly complex because of the large number of institutions involved and the lack of clarity about what their role consists of.
European consumers and investors are ultimately those who suffer the most from lack of action in this sector.
Within this framework, Parliament agreed on the need for a committee of experts to study these implications and report back with their recommendations.
I am well aware that there are different opinions on this initiative and on the form it ought to take.
However, I believe that the time has come for a full debate on the matter, with all the institutions participating.
What we do not need is for everyone to try to leave each other out of the debate when it comes to deciding what shape the supervision of European financial markets will take.
I believe we must focus our efforts more on the urgent need to debate this point, and stress that we have no time to lose.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (LT) I would like to say that perhaps most countries have a saying about starting preparations for winter during the summer.
As we discuss this issue, we would like to remind the European Commission and Council of that old truism.
Because up to now we were always told that working groups would be formed and this question would be discussed.
Without a doubt, consolidation has its positive aspects; however, with it comes an increased systematic risk in the market.
Financial groups operate in all European Union countries and quite often dependence on their activity and the influence of their activity is quite high.
When we talk about reforming supervisory processes, we must first ask ourselves something that I usually ask the heads of European supervisory bodies: if a subsidiary firm is operating in a certain country, and because of its unsatisfactory operation, that country's economy is starting to suffer, who will pay?
Who will be responsible?
Which country's legislation will apply?
Another question.
If a crisis situation develops in the subsidiary firm, how will it be managed?
At the national level or the financial group's level?
Unfortunately, as yet we have no answer to these simple questions.
I am quite pleased with the information that Council and Commission representatives supplied for us in relation to what is being done; however, once again I would like to stress that as new risky products find their way onto the market, we must speed up all processes and get together to resolve the basic issues, and not to get lost in details, because talking about various types of coordination and suchlike is all very well, until a crisis develops.
The reference point for our decisions about reforming supervisory processes has to be what we would do in a crisis situation.
Madam President, I would like to thank the Chairwoman of our committee, Mrs BerÃšs, for her timely contribution.
We started discussing the van den Burg report in committee this week, and one of the key topics also in the post-FSAP agenda is how to develop a good supervisory system for Europe.
It is very important for us to hear what the Council and Commission think about the future in this joint agenda.
The Financial Services Action Plan is now more or less complete, so the focus is now on implementation and supervisory convergence.
We think that even though national regulators have already been able to develop quite good practices, the work must go on, and beyond the Lamfalussy committees.
It is for example very positive that we now have colleges of supervisors handling big, multi-jurisdiction, pan-European cases, but sometimes these colleges lack authority; they do not have enough resources; they do not take enough majority decisions, for example, so it would be very good if we could consider more qualified majority voting in Level 3 committees as well as in the colleges of supervisors.
I would also like to point out that in Mrs van den Burg's draft report we have promoted a new idea that, for top pan-European players, we should have a well-equipped European supervisory authority inside the system.
We would like to create a European supervisory authority, but it should not be outside the scope of the Commission's current sphere of responsibility.
It should be inside the system.
I think this idea could also be considered by the Commission.
Finally, it is also important to develop cooperation at global level.
We know that the financial risks and prudential challenges are not only European, but also very much involve the big market players in America, and so on, so it is very good that the Commission has taken this financial services dialogue with transatlantic partners seriously, but there needs to be continual further development.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, I would like to thank all the Members for their very valuable contributions.
As I said earlier, the development of financial supervision is of critical importance.
A stable financial environment is a prerequisite for the economic growth that the EU needs, and the protection of consumers.
So the prevention of financial crises is important.
Supervision needs to be as efficient and effective as possible.
We need to make practices of national supervisory authorities converge in order to minimise the burdens on cross-border firms.
We need a common supervisory culture: more supervisors doing more things the same way.
These are important issues that I look forward to working on with you.
The debate is closed.
The future of Kosovo and the role of the EU (debate)
The next item is the report by Joost Lagendijk, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on the future of Kosovo and the role of the EU.
rapporteur. - (NL) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, looking back on the position which this House has adopted with regard to Kosovo since 1999, there is only one conclusion possible to my mind.
The present report is the logical culmination of a long process of deliberation in this House, with us having reached two main conclusions over the past two years.
The first conclusion is that maintaining the present status quo in Kosovo is not an option, as this would be undesirable, very much so.
Secondly, and whether we like it or not, it is inevitable that Kosovo will come to enjoy a certain form of independence, although the precise definition of it is open to debate.
In my report, I have tried to summarise the effect this general position, this general conclusion will have in practice.
In other words, what, according to this House, is the most desirable outcome of the deliberations in the Security Council about Kosovo's status?
Allow me to highlight a few key points.
Kosovo must gain access to institutions such as the World Bank and the IMF in order to at last be able to tackle its economic problems and get its economy out of the doldrums.
Secondly, Kosovo's multi-ethnic character must be retained.
This is, for the time being, best served by an international presence, both military and civil, the European Union, in other words.
This leads me to conclude that the European Union has a key role to play once this status has been established.
It is the European Union - we therefore - who have to ensure that the Kosovar authorities lead their country further towards a democratic multi-ethnic state that can eventually join the European Union, and, provided we are informed sufficiently and in good time, we in Parliament are prepared to make the necessary budget available for this role, for this task.
Finally, Kosovo is a unique case on account of the NATO intervention in 1990, but particularly on account of the fact that that part of Serbia has been under UN administration for nearly eight years.
This also means that solutions for the current situation, which are now being sought, are unique and cannot be used to solve conflicts elsewhere in the world.
So far, probably the majority of this House are in agreement with me.
What has happened in the past week, is that the discussion on this report has not focused on the content I have just outlined for you, but on the question of what label this desired situation should bear, in other words, of what word we want to use in order to describe this optimal situation following independence.
Is it supervised independence, supervised sovereignty, or should we perhaps steer clear from using a label altogether?
To those who wish to keep their own counsel for the time being about how this situation should be described, I should like to say that, as I see it, it is of the utmost importance that the European Union should speak with one voice and present a united front, not only here in Brussels, but also in the Security Council in New York and not least in this House.
If we are agreed on the end goal, why not say so?
This will impact favourably on the difficult deliberations in Brussels and New York and it makes it more difficult for Russia - the great challenger of eventual independence - to play the European Union's Member States off against each other.
Another argument against providing clarity right now is the question as to why it is we in this House who have to lead the way, as to why we should be the first European institution to be so clear about the final outcome, and on that subject, I should like to say that, since last Monday, someone else has been taking over the lead, namely Martti Ahtisaari, the Secretary-General's special envoy, who said in his recommendation to the Security Council that 'the status of Kosovo should be independence supervised by the international community'.


The UN Secretary General, Mr Ban Ki-Moon, has wholeheartedly endorsed this conclusion.
In other words, others are leading, and I think it only right that this House should spell out our wishes.
This means that we need to support Ahtisaari's recommendation by clearly stating that, in our view, the best outcome of the process would be supervised sovereignty.
We, in this House, are parliamentarians, politicians.
Diplomats we are not.
I would be delighted if I could count on your support for my report in this plenary tomorrow.
I will not rest until Parliament clearly states what in our view the end goal should be.
This is, as I see it, sovereignty supervised by the EU.
This is clarity to which the Kosovars are entitled, to which the Serbs are entitled and also to which the European public is entitled.
President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Lagendijk, the process of determining the future status of Kosovo - the most urgent political problem in the Western Balkans at the present time - is entering its final, decisive stage.
On 26 March, the United Nations Secretary-General forwarded the Comprehensive Proposal for a Kosovo Status Settlement of his Special Envoy, Martti Ahtisaari, to the UN Security Council in New York.
The Special Envoy is due to explain his proposal in person to the members of the Security Council on 3 April.
The EU Ministers for Foreign Affairs examined the proposed solution in detail at the Council of 12 February.
Expressing their full support to Mr Ahtisaari, they noted that the proposed status settlement was designed to promote in Kosovo a multi-ethnic and democratic society based on the rule of law.
They also expressed their conviction that the Special Envoy's proposals create the basis for sustainable economic and political development in Kosovo and will contribute to strengthening the stability of the region.
Belgrade and PriÅ¡tina held further rounds of talks on the proposals in February and March, first at expert level and then, on 10 March, at the highest political level.
As a result of the talks, Mr Ahtisaari further extended some of the already far-reaching provisions for the protection of the Kosovo Serbs and the Serbian Orthodox Church.
On the whole, however, the talks revealed the differences between the two sides to be irreconcilable.
PriÅ¡tina approved the status package in the end, whilst Belgrade rejected it.
Subsequently, on 10 March, Mr Ahtisaari declared the talks at an end and announced his intention to forward his proposed status settlement immediately to the UN Security Council - quite rightly, in the opinion of the Presidency.
After all, even if the negotiations were to continue for weeks or months to come, Belgrade and PriÅ¡tina are not moving any closer to a compromise solution that both sides can support, as one year's direct negotiations have shown.
On the contrary, in the last round of negotiations, the positions of the two parties had become even more entrenched.
The forwarding of the proposed status settlement to the UN Security Council last Monday took the Kosovo status process into its final, decisive stage.
As Mr Lagendijk has just pointed out, it is essential that the EU introduce this stage by presenting a united front externally and speaking with one voice.
The more visible the EU's unity, the smaller the risk of a permanent blockade in the Security Council.
The Presidency of the European Union trusts that the Security Council will discharge its responsibility, and hopes for its timely endorsement of the proposal.
I should like to say a few words about the future role of the EU in Kosovo.
The EU is prepared to take on an important role in the implementation of the status settlement.
Work by the EU to prepare our contribution to an international presence in Kosovo following the resolution of the status issue is making good progress.
The EU's preparatory work focuses on the following three fields.
Firstly, on support for the proposed international civilian presence.
The relevant EU preparatory team is working locally, including in close cooperation with KFOR, UNMIK and Kosovo's leaders, on targeted preparations for the establishment and inauguration of the International Civilian Office (ICO).
Secondly, our work focuses on preparations for the ESDP rule of law mission.
We have already made great progress on these.
We anticipate that the EU will be granted a mandate that includes monitoring and providing guidance and advice to the local authorities in the broader area of the rule of law.
We also expect the mandate to cover executive powers in some fields relating to the police - including the maintenance of law and order in the case of disorder and gatherings of people - and to the judiciary and customs.
Our planning is flexible and will be adapted to developments in the situation if necessary.
Thirdly, the preparatory work focuses on defining the prospect of Kosovo's EU membership and on support for its economic and social development.
In this context, we welcome Parliament's interest in Kosovo, which is also reflected in this draft report.
Mr Lagendijk's report on the future of Kosovo and the role of the EU represents a valuable contribution to international efforts to promote a lasting solution to the Kosovo issue.
I should like to conclude by reiterating that the process of resolving the status of Kosovo is entering a decisive stage.
This means the EU faces a twofold challenge.
Firstly, maintaining unity in its search, together with its international partners, for a lasting solution for Kosovo, Serbia and the region as a whole; and, secondly, intensifying its preparations to support international efforts to implement Kosovo's status.
The Kosovo status settlement represents the end point in the dissolution of the former Yugoslavia.
It is a unique case and, as such, cannot set any precedents for other 'frozen conflicts'.
The status settlement is a fundamental precondition for stabilising Kosovo, Serbia and the region as a whole.
As the conflicts of the 1990s have proved, sustainable stability in the Western Balkans is an issue central, not to say vital, to European security.
As in other fields, our unity is key in achieving a lasting solution.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, Honourable Members, first of all let me thank and congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Lagendijk, and the Members for their substantive and intensive work on this report.
As I said here before, the report and proposal of the Special Envoy, Mr Ahtisaari, were handed to the Security Council on Monday.
I join the UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, and the EU Presidency in supporting the report and the proposal put forward by Mr Ahtisaari.
I believe that we can all agree that in an ideal world, the two parties would have found an acceptable compromise between themselves.
Over the past 14 months of negotiations, common ground was found on several practical aspects of the settlement.
Unfortunately, Belgrade and PriÅ¡tina remained diametrically opposed on the core question of the status itself.
Mr Ahtisaari's proposal is designed to foster the building of a democratic, multi-ethnic society in Kosovo based on the rule of law.
It contains wide-ranging provisions intended to secure the future of all communities in Kosovo, as well as protection of religious sites and cultural heritage.
As Mr Lagendijk rightly underlined, the essence of a decision on Kosovo is European unity, here and in New York.
We need to support Mr Ahtisaari and his proposal with consistent determination in the UN Security Council.
There is no gain in delaying the decision.
The UN has been running Kosovo for eight years and, clearly, the status quo is not sustainable.
Therefore I expect the Security Council to live up to its responsibilities in the spirit of responsible multilateralism and bring the process to an early and successful conclusion.
Once the status issue is settled, the implementation phase will start, which will of course bring its own genesis.
Here too, the EU must work as one.
The EU will have to play a leading role both in the running of international civilian missions and in support of Kosovo's European prospects.
This will require deployment of all our instruments and considerable resources.
We have no exit strategy, only an entry strategy, in the Western Balkans and in Kosovo.
Let me underline that local ownership and partnership with the international community is the key to success for status implementation.
The EU and its international partners cannot substitute Kosovo's own efforts, neither in terms of political will nor in terms of resources.
But we can assist, and the status settlement will not come for free.
Kosovo's financial needs after the granting of status cannot yet be fully known, but early estimates suggest that international assistance of around EUR 1.3 to 1.5 billion may be required for the first three years after the status settlement.
There will be four main areas to cover: Kosovo's share of the Yugoslav debt, the cost of status implementation, economic development needs and the cost of the international presence, including the planned ESDP mission, which is expected to be the largest civilian crisis management mission the European Union has ever undertaken.
The EU's overall presence in Kosovo is likely to be in the order of 1500 to 2000 international staff.
We all know that the EU currently faces important foreign policy challenges in other theatres, including the Middle East, Afghanistan and Darfur.
Kosovo is not the only funding priority.
But Europe has a special responsibility in Kosovo, which is on our borders and is our future home territory.
At the EU Foreign Ministers' meeting in Bremen on Friday, the Gymnich meeting, I will stress that resources cannot come from the EU budget alone.
EU Member States and our partners in the international community must share responsibility.
The Commission will put together a funding package that reflects the scale of our responsibility.
I count on your support for this, because strong support from the budgetary authority is needed to put together a credible funding package.
A final word on Serbia: let me assure you that the EU remains fully committed to Serbia's EU prospects.
We are ready to work with a new government towards this goal.
It is now up to the new Government of Serbia to meet the conditions for resuming the negotiations on a stabilisation and association agreement with the European Union.
Strong engagement with Serbia is essential to bringing the status process to a successful conclusion.
A Serbia that has confidence in its European future will be helped to overcome the legacy of the past.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on International Trade. - (DE) Madam President, I shall examine just a few of the points discussed in the Committee on International Trade.
Having visited both parts of Kosovo several times myself - both PriÅ¡tina and Mitrovica - I am in a relatively good position to assess the situation.
Our particular concern is that there be a very detailed analysis of the economic and commercial situation, as we believe that economic stability is the only way to achieve long-term security in the region as a whole.
The situation is extremely problematic.
The infrastructures are very weak; key industries are in need of complete modernisation and renovation.
There are SMEs that are very innovative but require a great deal more financial support, and there is a very young population that must be integrated and needs jobs.
All of this is possible only within the framework of integration into the EU - not integration in the sense that we are appealing immediately for Kosovo's membership of the EU, but in the sense that we fully develop the concept of free trade areas, in particular, into one that really works.
After all, agreements have already been signed with many of the Balkan countries; but these must really be functional.
We also strongly advocate that the excellent work the EU has done to date in the field of the fourth pillar, in particular, be carried over to the new structures, so that the systems do not require complete renewal.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Madam President, in 1912, Kosovo, a region with a 90% Albanian population, was annexed to Serbia without a referendum.
It had a chequered fate, until, at the end of the 1980s, the war criminal Slobodan MiloÅ¡eviÄ revoked Kosovo's autonomy in the Yugoslav Constitution.
A brutal apartheid regime was installed: the Albanians were forbidden to attend kindergartens, schools and universities and to practise a profession.
They were even forbidden to visit public swimming baths.
The system was inconceivably cruel, something I saw at first hand.
There then followed the mass expulsion of 1998, which was only stopped following intervention by NATO, by which time the majority of the population had already been driven out of the country.
The United Nations established an administration, and now we are on the brink of a new beginning.
What could the future look like?
If we do our duty, if we resolve the status issue quickly, consensually and in unison, and if the EU takes responsibility for an international presence in Kosovo, the country could become a multi-ethnic democracy with the most extensive minority rights in the world within a short space of time.
After all, the Ahtisaari report contains the most extensive minority arrangement in the world, presenting economic prospects, certainly, and also the prospect of EU membership.
I agree with Mrs Mann that the country has seen decades of neglect.
Investment is needed for the benefit of a young, unemployed population, and this will only be provided once the status issue has been resolved, once legal certainty exists - which is why we have to concentrate on justice and home affairs - and once the country is at peace and has good neighbourly relations with Serbia.
I can only make a plea to Serbian politicians: General de Gaulle once spoke of the paix des braves - the peace of the brave.
The Serbians and the Albanians would then enjoy a good, common, European future as neighbouring European peoples ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Lagendijk, on his report, which is an excellent one.
Solving the problem of stable, sustainable and viable governance of Kosovo is of vital importance to the stability of the Western Balkans as a whole.
Such a form of government would be unprecedented since the Second World War, indeed since the Paris peace treaty, in terms of the possible changes to frontiers.
The European Union has, and will continue to have, a crucial and specific responsibility for being an international presence on the ground in Kosovo, replacing the United Nations.
This is the greatest test of the European Union's common foreign policy, which is currently being rolled out.
The solution implemented needs to be fair and well balanced.
The international community cannot give preference to one of the parties - the Kosovar Albanians - while punishing the other, namely the Serbs.
A just solution must be found.
As and when the Security Council determines the final status of Kosovo, consideration will have to be given to the problems posed by the influence of Kosovo's status on the region as a whole, on the stability of the whole of Central Europe, on conditions within Serbia, and on the installation of a new Serbian government.
Mr Lagendijk's report enjoys Socialist support, and we endorse the Ahtisaari Plan, which is an excellent basis, but it is not the European Union that will decide on Kosovo's final status; that is a matter for which the Security Council is responsible.
We Socialists believe that, once the Security Council has taken its decision, the final status will have to be incorporated into European Parliament documents.
Ladies and gentlemen, we Socialists congratulate Mr Lagendijk and ask the House to endorse our proposal that the definition of the final status be postponed.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, although the European Union does not have the foreign policy powers that many of us would like it to have, our debate today on Kosovo has greater political significance than it would in other circumstances, mainly because the discussion and the adoption of the Lagendijk report is taking place at a moment in politics when matters are still fluid, when events are evolving week by week and when individual participants can still influence events.
I believe, therefore, that it would be very useful for the European Parliament to make a clear statement tomorrow - and the European Union the day after tomorrow, so to speak.
If possible, it should do so with a large majority tomorrow in Parliament and, possibly, unanimously in Council a few weeks from now.
I find it interesting that the assessments we have heard so far from Mr Lagendijk, the Council and the Commission are largely along similar lines.
I think that is a very important prerequisite.
I would like to briefly refer to five points.
Firstly: the future of the Balkans and of Kosovo is a future in Europe.
The first clear step that we can take to bring a bit of peace to those areas is to ensure a positive target for all - for Serbia and for Kosovo - namely, membership of the European Union.
This is an objective that suits them but that also suits us very well, particularly with a view to transforming an area that will otherwise be unstable into an area of permanent peace, economic growth and multi-ethnic democracy.
Secondly: we need to escape the institutional limbo that arose after 1999, and that is why we should support the report by Martti Ahtisaari and the position - which we hope will be unanimous - to be adopted by the Europeans within the United Nations Security Council.
Thirdly: independence is the final result which the entire population of Kosovo would like to see and to which the Lagendijk report also refers, partly as a result of the amendments which we have tabled.
Perhaps historians will tell us that it was an error not to provide for alternative options.
Today, however, this is a reality, and one that the leaders of Serbia are also well aware of.
They need to be politically reassured and not humiliated.
It is necessary to realise that, on the symbolic level, Serbia has never given up Kosovo but at the same time, on the factual level, Kosovo has for years been outside the orbit of Serbian influence.
Finally, the European Parliament must endorse - and I say again, unanimously - the Ahtisaari plan, in the hope that the same will occur in the next few weeks within the Council.
Madam President, a final remark: the debate on the European Parliament's budget, which we will have in a few weeks, must provide consistency between what we say on the political level and the financial instruments we adopt to help Kosovo towards the final result.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - Madam President, I would like to join my colleagues in thanking the rapporteur for the work carried out on this report.
When we speak about Kosovo, we often tend to think about it in the abstract, whereas it is the last linchpin of the very fracturous European region of the Western Balkans.
I think it is incumbent on all of us to ensure that we deliver the strongest possible message that the democratic will expressed by the people of Kosovo is respected, that it is brought to a conclusion and that the European Union has a unified voice on how things should progress in the future.
The roadmap has already been laid out for us through the Ahtisaari Plan. It is a very clear and concise plan with regard to the kind of protection and mechanisms that can be put in place to guarantee that the Kosovars' rights are represented and maintained.
Most importantly, however, they will ensure that the minorities within Kosovo are also protected and represented and that they do not become part of a singular state in which they have no influence or role to play.
Most importantly of all, if history has taught us anything - through the example of the establishment of the European Union or conflict resolution in other areas of the European continent - it is that only by having better and closer relations with our neighbours can we achieve what can truly be called a just and lasting peace.
That is why Serbia must not be ignored.
Even though many of us have criticised Serbia for its actions in the past, and maybe for some intransigence at the present time, it has legitimate concerns which must be responded to.
Likewise, the Serb minority in Kosovo has concerns that must be addressed.
We must act as the guarantor of those rights.
We must show the way forward to be the best possible way of achieving the peace and stability we all crave for in that region of Europe.
At present, there are 213 Irish troops among the KFOR force stationed in Kosovo.
They are playing an invaluable role in creating peace and stability.
As the previous speaker said, when we vote on the European Union budget in the future we should remember the common foreign and security aspect, because that is one area in which we are successful.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, there is no simple solution for the future of the remainder of the former Yugoslavia, including Kosovo.
It does not make the solution any easier, however, if we just put off dealing with the problems; the reverse is the case.
For this reason, I am glad that, after eight years of international administration, there is a tangible proposal on the table at the UN Security Council.
I would appeal to the House to vote in favour of this proposal, as it largely corresponds to Mr Lagendijk's report.
There must be an end to the state of uncertainty in which the Kosovars of all ethnic origins and the Serbs find themselves.
Only then will the urgently needed economic development, as a step towards integration into the EU, be possible.
Any delay in taking the current decision and in Kosovo's subsequent integration into the EU will cost the region, and the EU, dear.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Madam President, the great majority of our group will be voting against this report.
This is mainly because of the report's negligence with regard to international law - which is shared by the Ahtisaari report itself.
Mr Ahtisaari has proposed that the EU develop a kind of successor to UNMIK, which means that UNMIK would be continued by other means, among them the so-called Kosovo Trust Agency, which has mainly carried out privatisation in Kosovo, causing problems locally.
We should like to spell out that Parliament's position on this is one-sided and apt to escalate conflict.
We wish to draw attention once more to paragraph 3 of the report adopted by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and I quote: 'Considers that any settlement regarding the future status of Kosovo must be in accordance with international law'.
I hope that this clause remains in the report.
I have heard that there are already initial amendments seeking to remove it.
We all know that one of the causes of the present state of affairs in Kosovo is NATO's war of aggression against Yugoslavia back then, and I keep asking - I have already asked the Commissioner - what the EU intends to do if Serbia and Russia, in particular, continue to say 'no'?
I have yet to receive an answer to this, which means that the intention is really to act contrary to the will of these two countries.
The great majority of my group wants no part in this, and hence we shall be voting against this report.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Madam President, Mr Lagendijk has produced an even-handed report on the complex situation in Kosovo, and one essential aspect he has touched on is citizenship on the basis of Kosovo's multi-lingual and multi-ethnic character.
Strikingly, the present report does not breathe a word about Kosovo's explicit status, although Amendment 13, which we will be backing, does.
Neither, in fact, has the UN mediator Mr Ahtisaari, who, the day before yesterday, passed his final report on to the Security Council with a plain recommendation: independence under international supervision for Kosovo.
Prime Minister Kostunica, however, reported last week that independence for Kosovo will never be an option for Serbia.
He even hopes for a Russian veto in the Security Council.
This wish is diametrically opposed to the Albanian movement's demand for self-determination.
Their leader, Kurti, will not settle for anything but unconditional independence.
Whatever happens, the risk of ethnic disintegration and regional instability is real.
The big challenge for the international community is therefore obvious: how to combine regional stability with a multi-ethnic citizenship in a sovereign Kosovo.
Last week, Commissioner Rehn spoke of this as being an important litmus test for the EU.
I would, in this respect, wish the Commission and Council much wisdom, support and every success.
(SL) I would like to commend my fellow Member, rapporteur Lagendijk, for his highly responsible efforts in securing the broadest possible political unanimity in the report with which the European Parliament assumes its share of responsibility for deciding on the final status of Kosovo, which has been under UN trusteeship since 1999.
The regrettable fact that the negotiations could not produce a solution makes the responsibility of the European Union even greater.
Kosovo, Serbia, Southeast Europe and the whole of Europe need peace and stability.
People in this region have the right to peace and stability regardless of their ethnic origin.
Considering the problems and tensions that have built up in Kosovo, the process towards the final status should be conducted so as to prevent chaotic development which might, once again, wound the dignity of any of the ethnic identities, or lead to destabilisation, or create additional barriers to the European prospects for the countries of this region.
The rapporteur and all of us are bound by our common values and principles, in particular the Thessaloniki Agreement for the countries of South-east Europe which arose from the desire to permanently root out the sources of conflict in this part of Europe.
We are working together for a solution that should enable coexistence for several ethnic communities in Kosovo and create in the shortest possible time circumstances in which Kosovo, which is facing very challenging economic and social difficulties, can begin to move towards reconciliation, progress and prosperity.
(DE) Madam President, tomorrow, this House will be voting in favour of the Lagendijk report - I assume by a very substantial majority - but this will primarily reflect support for the work of Mr Ahtisaari and his staff.
I believe that the position proposed by Mr Ahtisaari is, in essence, the path we should take.
The question asked time and again is: independence - yes or no?
This decision will be taken by the United Nations, and I hope their decision, following all the necessary deliberations, will be the right one.
This decision will have our full support.
What is really important, however, is what will happen after the resolution of the status issue.
The status issue will not be an easy one to resolve as far as Serbia is concerned - no one likes losing a significant part of their territory - let us just imagine that from the point of view of our own country.
Nor will the resolution of the status issue solve the problems that Kosovo itself faces, as the difficulty of constructing its own, independent economic and social system is only just beginning.
The people of Kosovo will then ask: what about my job, how am I supposed to earn money, afford a house, and so on - and this will also be difficult in their own country.

Europe's task - and this is also supported and highlighted by the report on which we shall be voting tomorrow - is to help both parties cooperate on supporting this difficult process sensibly and in a way that shows decency and mutual respect.
This is the most important thing as far as we are concerned, including with regard to tomorrow's decision.
We declare our support for a clear-cut decision on the status issue, but we also affirm that Europe - and particularly this House - must support both parties, so that both Kosovo and Serbia can look forward to a bright future.
(SL) This weekend we marked solemnly in Rome and Berlin the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome and celebrated a long period of peace.
In the Western Balkans, however, this period was not only punctuated by peace, but also by extremely cruel and destructive wars.
The genocide in Srebrenica has taught us all that we cannot and must not allow or risk a repeat of such a human catastrophe in Kosovo.
This is why, eight years ago, we took timely preventive action by intervening with military force.
At that time, too, there was the threat of a veto in the United Nations, but, nevertheless, we managed to act.
Today, Kosovo is still only half the way there, without status, without access to international funding and without an effectively functioning state ruled by law.
Only a state can and must secure the basis and framework for economic recovery, for foreign and domestic investment and for badly needed jobs.
Only a state can become a member of the European Union.
Delays in these process leading to the determination of status could threaten the fragile situation and slow down the constructive processes that are stabilising the region, promoting economic and political cooperation between neighbours and uniting them in their objective to develop cooperation with other countries of the European Union and model their own environment on ours.
However, the dynamic provided by the efforts of Martti Ahtisaari in determining the status of Kosovo is helping us to inject more hope as well as the spirit and methods of the European Union into the lives of all the inhabitants of this region.
We are dealing with their future, coexistence and well-being.
For this reason, I believe that politicians in neighbouring Serbia, Montenegro, Albania and Macedonia, as well as those in Croatia and Bosnia, will find additional motivation to come closer to the European Union.
(PL) Thank you, Madam President.
In the report we have discussed, the European Parliament has made its pronouncement on the thorny issue of the future of Kosovo.
The province lies in the heart of Europe, and for this reason Europe must also play an active role in determining its future.
However, we cannot simply go ahead and do this, as the report emphasises, without the approval of the UN Security Council.
And it will not be possible to gain such approval without Russia's agreement.
In their contacts with the West, the Russians see Kosovo as a useful bargaining chip they can use in the negotiations concerning Iran's nuclear programme.
We should also remember that granting Kosovo independence will constitute a precedent which Russia may wish to invoke during negotiations concerning other regions such as Abkhazia, Transdnistria or North Ossetia.
We must therefore emphatically underline that Kosovo is a unique case and an exception, and that Russia cannot use it as a tool to re-establish its position as a super-power.
(NL) Madam President, Kosovo was the divisive element in former Yugoslavia.
Even before Slovenia and Croatia gained independence, the residents of Kosovo had mentally detached themselves from Serbia.
Even then, they set up their own administration and education and boycotted all state institutions.
They demanded international recognition of their independence, but had to settle for war and renewed occupation instead.
Since 1999, the Serbian military and officials have been replaced by other colonialists.
The residents of Kosovo only want one thing: self-determination - Vetevendosje - as is evident from the graffiti on every wall.
Prolonging the present twilight situation will promote stagnation and crime.
The forced return to Serbia will inevitably culminate in either a civil war or two million refugees.
This prospect is worse than another violation of international law which, without agreement, does not sanction separation.
For Serbia's future too, it would be better if it were finally unshackled from the nationalistic battle of prestige for Kosovo.
Everyone knows that there is no ultimate solution other than an independent Kosovo, but nobody dares to be the first to take responsibility for this.
Unfortunately, this will seriously delay the implementation of Ahtisaari's weakened proposal.
(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, congratulations to Mr Lagendijk!
There is actually no need for me to speak at all, as I could simply endorse what you said, as Mr Swoboda and Mrs Kallenbach have done.
Nevertheless I will make a few comments.
I should like to give advance warning that after a debate of this kind we may very quickly be suspected by the outside world, and above all by the region itself, of being anti-Serbian or pro-Albanian.
I should like to protest against this.
We have been trying really for years to help the people in Serbia and Kosovo to have a peaceful and prosperous future.
Creating the prerequisites for this is difficult and the proposed solution put forward by Mr Ahtisaari makes it possible for the people finally to put MiloÅ¡eviÄ's poisoned past behind them.
Whether that can be just, my dear Mr Tabajdi, I do not know.
Just solutions are very difficult to achieve.
However, I know of no other possibility than the one that has now been proposed.
Proper negotiations have of course never been held between Serbs and Albanians.
The extreme views were so far apart that they were never brought to the negotiating table.
Heaven forbid that we should therefore lengthen the procedure any more.
I also understand that no Serbian Government will ever sanction the loss of Kosovo.
However, if the Serbian politicians are honest - and of course some of them are when you talk to them - then they also know that with Kosovo in their national territory a peaceful future will not be possible, and it is this peaceful future that the people in Serbia and Kosovo, in particular the young people, deserve.
The politicians ought to ask themselves who in Serbia actually wants to bear the consequences of Kosovo's remaining in Serbia, both the financial and all of the political consequences.
The Albanians must enable those Serbs who wish to live in their homeland in Kosovo to do so, and to return if they so wish.
The Ahtisaari plan is in my view the only basis for a peaceful coexistence.
Unfortunately, discussions often disregard the years of the apartheid regime from 1989 to 1998, as has happened again today.
I noticed this in Mr PflÃŒger's comments, for example.
I do not think that the NATO attack marked the beginning, but that it all started with the revocation of Kosovo's autonomous status.
The Security Council would really be well advised finally to cut the Gordian knot quickly, so that we can continue working and help both Serbia and Albania on their peaceful path into the European Union.
(NL) Madam President, needless to say, I should also like to congratulate my friend and fellow Member, Mr Lagendijk, on his report, even though we do not see eye to eye on every detail.
We as a group do, of course, welcome the proposals which the negotiator, Mr Ahtisaari, presented in New York last Monday.
This is also something which is clearly reflected in the report on which we will be voting tomorrow.
In that respect, our group backs the report as it now stands.
These proposals, as set out on this platform, also enjoy the support of the Council and the Commission.
What we believe matters most of all now, though, is that the Security Council should take a decision on the status of Kosovo. This should be done without unnecessary delays, so that the uncertainty in Kosovo can be lifted before long and that both Kosovars and Serbs can focus on their future in Europe.
It is not up to the European Union, however, to take a stand in this respect at the moment.
In this light, it is not, as we see it, up to the EU to pre-empt the final outcome of the status in the Security Council.
Kosovo's interim status is based on a Security Council resolution, and so should its final status be.
This is of the utmost importance for the international legitimacy of this decision, and it is for this reason that we have rejected Mr Posselt's amendments.
It is also essential for the internal legitimacy of the decision on the status.
Indeed, the EU will not get down to the real work until after the decision in New York. To a great extent, the EU will be responsible for guiding the implementation of this status.
This is something for which the Union will need to be fully prepared, but will, above all, need to avoid being piggy in the middle from the word go; this is also why my group will be voting against the amendment which qualifies the status without there having been a debate on this in New York.
In this respect, we follow the line as expressed by the presidency, but also by the Commission, neither of whom mentioned qualification this afternoon.
- (PL) Madam President, the debate on Kosovo has raised an issue which is of the utmost importance in terms of international relations.
For the first time in many years the international community is breaching the territorial sovereignty of a European country.
While it is true that there are no proposals to grant independence to this new political entity, this new quasi-state is supposed to have its own national anthem, flag and mini army.
It will also remain subject to international control for an undefined period of time.
This novel approach to international intervention in the internal affairs of a sovereign state will set a precedent which may, in the future, lead to attempts by the international community to manipulate the internal affairs of other countries experiencing far more minor problems.
The only sensible solution is to formally leave Kosovo within the Republic of Serbia, and to grant it a greater degree of autonomy, while also taking fast-track measures to incorporate the region into the European Union.
For an independent Kosovo will still have a significant Serbian minority which will destabilise the country.
(EL) Madam President, the situation in Kosovo, following on from and as a result of interventionist policies, is another problem that needs to be resolved within the framework of the United Nations.
However, the Ahtisaari proposal, which is basically adopted in the report we are examining, goes against basic principles of international law, the UN Charter itself, and makes provision for the borders to be redrawn and the area's history to be distorted, at the expense of the Serbian community.
Overall the Ahtisaari proposal promotes the creation of an independent state, to the degree that it can be independent with such a NATO military presence and the application of the European security policy.
I fear that it will operate as a protectorate, rather than as an independent state.
We are and shall continue to be in favour of the self-determination of nations, but not when it is used indiscriminately on the basis of double standards.
We only need remember that, after the procedure of decolonialisation and before the break-up of Yugoslavia, the only recognition of secession by the international community - and it was for very specific reasons - was that of Bangladesh by Pakistan, and to warn that making Kosovo independent will open a Pandora's Box and will result in the strengthening of all forms of secessionist action.
(ES) Madam President, the Kosovo issue is a complex one and has many implications on different levels; it affects the fundamental principles that regulate the functioning of the international community.
On this issue, therefore, it is necessary to act cautiously, seeking the broadest possible consensus and taking account of international law.
Kosovo is also an exceptional case. This has been acknowledged by the United Nations' special envoy and the great majority of the international community.
In view of its exceptional nature, the solution does not set a precedent for other possible cases in Europe: that is stated in the text of the resolution that we will vote on tomorrow.
As the contact group stated in its conclusions of January 2006, the specific nature of the Kosovo problem results, amongst other things, from the break-up of Yugoslavia and the resulting conflicts, the ethnic cleansing and the events of 1999, of which I would stress NATO's military intervention of that year. Another factor that makes the Kosovo case exceptional is the long period under international administration in accordance with Resolution 1244.
Madam President, I would have liked Mr Ahtisaari to have found a solution that had the approval of the two parties in question: Serbia and Kosovo.
In relation to such sensitive issues that involve fundamental principles and in a region that has suffered a long period of conflict and instability, a mutually acceptable negotiated solution would have been the best thing.
Unfortunately, however, the negotiations during 2006 and at the beginning of 2007 have failed to bring the differing positions together.
It now falls to the Security Council to debate Mr Ahtisaari's proposal and, on that basis, to adopt the appropriate decisions.
Clearly neither the European Parliament nor any other institutions are competent to decide on the final status of the territory; it should be established by the Security Council that adopted Resolution 1244.
I would like it still to be possible for the Security Council, within a reasonable timescale, to try to achieve an agreement between the parties.
In any event, I hope that the members of the Council, particularly its permanent members, will play a constructive role at such a decisive moment as this, as we request in the text that we will vote on tomorrow.
Madam President, whenever we find a just, feasible and sustainable solution to overcome a crisis, we want it to become a precedent.
The mere fact that we do not want our solution for Kosovo to become a precedent this time is the recognition that this solution is unfortunate, or at least imprudent.
And it is wishful thinking to believe that nobody will use it as a precedent.
Therefore we must find ways to mitigate the subsequent risks.
In this respect, four suggestions could be considered.
One: to accept and state that the solution for Kosovo is based on and should be consistent with the principle of regional security.
Two: to agree that Kosovo might become independent only within the European Union after meeting the membership criteria.
Three: to offer immediately to Serbia a clear European Union accession action plan, free from any prerequisite conditions.
And four: to convene an international conference on the Western Balkans in order to integrate the solution for Kosovo into a region package deal.
Without an approach which looks beyond the borders of Kosovo and beyond the present time, the effects of this plan might blow up in our faces.
Madam President, the rapporteur Mr Lagendijk and our shadow rapportuer Mr Posselt have certainly done an excellent job.
However, I will not vote in favour of this report for reasons of general principle.
I believe that such a dispute must be resolved by mutually negotiated agreed settlements by the parties concerned, and not through unilateral actions or impositions from the outside.
A durable settlement necessitates the will of those who will implement it.
I do not accept the notion of an independent state with limited sovereignty.
An independent country is fully sovereign, or there is something wrong with it becoming independent.
I am aware that the only realistic outcome for Kosovo cannot be a return to Serbian sovereignty, nor partition, nor union with any other country.
The negotiating process may have lasted for a very long time, but the Ahtisaari report was only published a few weeks ago.
Why do we conclude so soon that the positions of the parties are unbreachable?
We should encourage them to understand that there is no other way but to negotiate within a reasonable time on the basis of that report.
The Commissioner said that commitment towards Serbia can serve as a diplomatic tool in encouraging Belgrade to mainstream its position towards the Ahtisaari proposals.
I think that the virtue of patience is a factor for international diplomacy.
(PL) Madam President, resolving Kosovo's status is a good test of the European Union's nascent foreign policy.
Firstly, we should express our appreciation for the efforts of Martti Ahtisaari, the UN General Secretary's Special Envoy for the Future Status Process for Kosovo, and for his plan.
Secondly, the European Parliament stresses that any settlement concerning the future status of Kosovo must conform with the democratically expressed wishes of the inhabitants of Kosovo, whilst respecting human rights and international law.
Thirdly, the problem of Kosovo must be regarded within the broader context of the situation in the Balkans.
At a time when we are celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the signing of the Treaties of Rome, I would like to place particular emphasis on the political responsibility of the European Union for drawing up the terms, and opening the way, for future membership of the Union to Serbia.
The European Union must play a historical role by helping to foster democracy and prosperity for all the peoples of the Western Balkans.
Madam President, Commissioner, honourable Members, despite my belief that not all stones were left unturned in our joint efforts to bring the Serbian side to support the final deal, I welcome the Lagendijk report because it emphasises the need to obtain the consent of both parties involved.
I know that the people of Kosovo cannot live in limbo for much longer.
They pay a very heavy price each day that negotiations are prolonged.
However, we need to keep in mind the lessons of history: what happens when third parties decide the final outcome of a conflict between two countries without the clear consent of the primary parties involved.
This is exactly the direction of Mr Ahtisaari's report, from which Serbian support is sorely missing.
At present, it seems that all decisions have been made and that Kosovo will soon have its own status.
But if we truly desire lasting peace and prosperity in the Western Balkans, we need to continue to encourage Belgrade to sign on the dotted line.
We have the EU resources and the global institutions to achieve such a goal.
I continue to hope for the best and in doing so I will vote for the Lagendijk report, while acknowledging the fact that when the final status of Kosovo is announced, the work of all interested parties must not end.
The sooner we bring Serbia to accept the deal, the better it will be for the Balkans and for the whole of Europe.
(SK) Like my colleagues, I, too, would like to praise the work done by the rapporteur and the efforts of our shadow rapporteur, Mr Tabajdi.
I believe that we have dealt at length with this topic in the Committee on Foreign Affairs and have met the representatives of both PriÅ¡tina and Belgrade.
The UN Security Council is now set to rule on the status and especially the future of the people now living in Kosovo.
This ruling will impact Serbians and Kosovo's Albanians equally.
It will also impact Christians and Muslims equally.
It will affect developments in the quality of life.
As a Member of the European Parliament, I very much regret that we have driven Serbia into a situation where it has to rely on Russia and is looking to play Russia as an ace in defending Serbia's interests in the UN Security Council.
I must say that I do not believe that tomorrow, if asked to vote on the report, the Members would support amendments that dramatically erode the legitimacy of either party.
I believe that this honourable House would only back proposals that treat the two parties concerned in an equal and just manner.
Member of the Commission. Madam President, honourable Members, I want to thank you for this very substantive and responsible debate.
I believe that your report, and I trust your vote tomorrow, will further reinforce European unity in order to bring the Kosovo status process to a successful conclusion.
With the submission of President Ahtisaari's proposal to the UN Security Council, the process now enters its decisive phase.
I trust that the Security Council will live up to its responsibility, and I hope that it will endorse the proposal in a timely manner.
Then follows the hardest phase for us, that of the implementation of the status, which, as has been said today in this House, is a real litmus test for the EU's common foreign and security policy.
Therefore, I highly appreciate the support for this joint challenge of ours provided by Parliament and by the rapporteur on Kosovo, Mr Lagendijk.
In conclusion, I am glad that all three institutions share the view that European unity and EU leadership continue to be needed to achieve a sustainable settlement that produces a democratic and multi-ethnic Kosovo and assures continued regional stability.
At the same time, we are providing Serbia with a tangible EU perspective, which should help Serbia to leave the nationalist past behind and turn towards a European future.
(Applause)
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Written statements (Rule 142)
, in writing. - (ET) Over a period of eight years, the international community has become convinced that independence for Kosovo is the best means of ensuring stability in the region.
UN Special Representative Ahtisaari has presented a report that recommends Kosovo be afforded all of the elements of independence, without using the word independence per se.
The report prepared by colleague Joost Lagendijk repeats all of the well-known facts and supports Ahtisaari's recommendation as the basis for regulating the status of Kosovo.
I would, however, like to ask whether systematisation and paraphrasing is the only added value that Parliament is able to offer.
The proposal for amendment, one of the authors of which is Lagendijk himself, recommended adding to the report the concept of supervised sovereignty, which is indeed the core of the report.
This is the kind of clarity that is expected of us.
The most common argument against the proposal for amendment is fear of Russian displeasure.
For months Moscow has been issuing warnings that independence for Kosovo will create a precedent on which Trans-Dnistria, Abkhazia and Ossetia could also seek independence.
The Kremlin is, however, very well aware that no legal precedent can arise.
Kosovo is the only territory where the UN has a sufficient mandate to recommend independence.
As a member of the UN Security Council, on 10 June 1999 Russia granted its approval of independence for Kosovo.
Russia simply wishes to avoid the shrinking of its sphere of influence in Europe.
I doubt whether Russia will be willing to take responsibility for any new outbreak of bloodshed in Kosovo that may arise if independence is not granted.
Our ultimate objective is to prevent suffering, and to ensure democracy and economic development.
This sometimes requires courage.
(EL) In accepting the Ahtisaari report on the creation of an 'independent' protectorate of Kosovo under Euro-NATO occupation, the European Union and the European Parliament are creating a clear state of secession in the eyes of the world and a new state.
This undermines and violates all the agreements and principles created by the United Nations and international law since the Second World War.
The report voted for by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the liberals and the social democrats promotes the redrawing of the borders in the Balkans, perpetuates the presence of the Euro-NATO military occupation forces and blatantly blackmails Serbia, while at the same time incriminating and condemning the Serbian community in Kosovo and Serbia itself with insulting impudence.
It opens a Pandora's Box of escalating nationalistic opposition and clashes throughout the Balkans, the incitement of secessionist movements and the imposition and legalisation of the presence of Euro-NATO occupying forces in the area.
Now we see the real objectives of the criminal war by ÎÎÎ€Î against Yugoslavia, participated in by the EU and the governments of its Member States, both centre left and centre right, including the PASOK government in power in Greece at the time, a policy continued today with the same consistency by the New Democracy government, confirming the adherence of both parties in the two-party state to participation in and support for the criminal imperialist plans of the EU and ÎÎÎ€Î and the USA in the area and in the world as a whole.
Organic production and labelling of organic products (debate)
The next item is the report by Marie-HÃ©lÃšne Aubert, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation on organic production and labelling of organic products - C6-0032/2006 -
Member of the Commission. Mr President, I welcome this opportunity to discuss our proposal for a new Council regulation for organic production.
I want to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mrs Aubert, and the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for their efforts.
The thorough work that they have been doing is a very valuable contribution to our discussions.
With 160 000 organic farms and more than 6 million hectares of land in the European Union, the turnover of organic products is estimated to have a value of between 13 and 14 billion euros.
This tendency is on the increase, so it is indeed a very important sector.
There is no doubt in my mind that this expanding sector has an essential role to play.
It addresses a range of expectations on the part of the public and of consumers; expectations about food quality, care for the environment, animal welfare and opportunities for developing the countryside.
It is also a sector with plenty of optimism and confidence about what the future has to bring, as I was able to see clearly during my recent visit to the BioFach in Nuremberg.
But in order to develop and reach its full potential, the sector needs an appropriate regulatory framework, and this is actually what we are trying to achieve with our new regulation.
It is therefore a very important legislative proposal, and I am pleased with the progress that we were able to make through our deliberations last year.
In 2006 very intensive discussions were held on our proposal in the Council and in Parliament.
As a result, some elements from the original proposal that proved to be very sensitive ones have now totally disappeared.
This includes a prohibition on higher claims, the mutual recognition of private standards by inspection bodies, and the EU organic indication.
Parliament has also proposed a range of amendments in order to improve the wording of the objectives and principles of organic farming, on the indication of the origin of the products, on the explicit right to use national and private logos, on embedding of the control system in the official food and feed controls, and the reinforced guarantees on imports.
These are amendments that improve the original proposal and I am therefore happy to take them on board.
We have also managed to improve the emphasis of the regulation on soil fertility, soil life and soil management practices.
The question of GMO and organic farming has generated a lot of debate.
I have noted Parliament's wish that operators provide proof that they have taken all the necessary steps to avoid adventitious or technically unavoidable presence of GMOs, and I could not agree more with that.
So although these amendments present a reiteration of an existing requirement, I have decided to accept them because of the huge sensitivity of this issue.
But let me also be completely clear: the threshold for adventitious presence of GMOs is not, as some suggest, a de facto threshold for GMO tolerance.
GMOs and their derivatives remain strictly banned for use in organic production.
Although the Commission and Parliament agree on the fundamental aspects of the new regulation, there are certain issues where we have not managed to see eye to eye, and I would like to touch briefly on some of these.
Parliament is asking for more details, and it is clear that a lot of the detailed rules as we know them in the current regulation have been removed.
But let us not forget that one of the main purposes of this proposal was to set out the basic rules more clearly and more logically.
This, however, does not mean that the detailed rules that form the unique fabric of organic standards should disappear altogether.
Certainly not.
But I believe that they are better placed in the implementing rules, and the content of these detailed rules will, as I confirmed to you earlier on, be very similar to the detailed rules that we have in the current regulation.
On our wish to extend the scope to cover mass caterers, cosmetics, textiles and preserved fish, I would like to point out that we cannot take all steps in one go.
We are substantially extending the scope now to wine and to aquaculture.
The other sectors are still at a very early stage of the development, and I think that harmonising them could hamper their development.
The current text actually provides for the possibility of looking at the issue again in 2011.
Linked to this, I have also noticed that you would like to see a double legal basis for this proposal.
It is no secret that there is a wider discussion on the introduction of codecision for agricultural matters.
This is an important issue and it is a discussion that I have clearly indicated that I welcome.
But it is an issue that should be dealt with in a horizontal manner, at the proper level and in the proper context.
I do not believe that it serves anyone to take an approach on a case-by-case basis.
Therefore I cannot accept a change to the legal basis for the new regulation on organic farming as you have proposed.
Finally, you propose that Member States may maintain or introduce stricter national rules.
That is not acceptable to me.
The very purpose of this regulation is to bring about a solid harmonisation at a strict enough level, with a flexibility mechanism for exceptions.
By harmonising the rules at a fairly high level, with flexibility, I think we are reaching the same end, but with a reduced risk of unequal treatment of operators in similar conditions.
I am convinced that this is a way to foster a thriving internal market for organic production.
I am sorry to have spoken at such length, but it is a very important issue that I wanted to address in detail.
Commissioner, the Commission is free to speak for as long as it likes and to say as much as is necessary.
rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, the circumstances of organic farming are somewhat paradoxical today.
On the one hand, there is growing demand for it because it is a method of farming that creates jobs, protects the environment, biodiversity and, ultimately, everyone's health.
On the other hand, organic farming still accounts for only slightly more than 1% of European agricultural production and slightly more than 3% of usable agricultural area - in other words, little.
I believe that it is our responsibility to help develop organic farming within the European Union.
This is perhaps only a small issue in terms of quantity, but a huge issue in political and symbolic terms because organic farming is also a kind of breakthrough, in that it refocuses the common agricultural policy on a far more sustainable form of farming, which is what is required.
Throughout 2006, we worked on the basis of a Commission proposal that has caused a great deal of concern and given rise to many protests, and a certain hastiness, too, since we were initially asked to give our verdict in two months on a proposal that had not really been developed thoroughly.
However, I readily admit that the work has been constructive and that the discussions have taken place regularly, with both the Commission and the Council, to improve the initial proposal.
Through all these exchanges, all these discussions and comings and goings, what did this Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development ultimately hope to do?
You have pointed out the key elements.
Firstly, it hoped to extend the scope of this regulation to non-food products such as textiles and cosmetics, but also, and above all, to mass catering, because mass catering is an extraordinary lever for developing organic farming in our countries.
We would be quite wrong not to use it.
That is also why we want a dual legal basis - Articles 37 and 95 - which relate to both the internal market and consumption.
It would seem that you have nothing but praise for our work, for our contribution and, thus, for the fact that the European Parliament has become far more involved - not to mention codecision, in general, for farming, because that is another debate that we have yet to hold.
It therefore seems to me that, if we want to pursue this work, if we want MEPs really to have the right to inspect these famous decrees that are going to play a vital role in the application of this regulation, you should accept this dual legal basis, and we will pursue this debate.
Secondly, as you pointed out, we have requested - from what was a vague text - far more precise definitions of what is meant by inspection, certification, products authorised or unauthorised in organic farming practices, the link to the soil, animal conditions, and so on. Next, you raised the very sensitive point of the lack of genetically modified organisms in organic farming.
There must be a total absence of these organisms, just as there must be a total absence of pesticides and synthetic chemicals.
On the subject of genetically modified organisms, we are absolutely set on confirming to consumers that organic farming does not contain any GMOs, from seed to distribution.
The current threshold of 0.9%, which is a labelling exemption threshold, causes confusion.
Therefore, in our opinion, we need to return to this issue so that we opt for the detection threshold for both conventional crops and organic farming and also so that, no matter what happens, we take all the measures necessary to prevent any contamination, even adventitious, of biological crops by GMOs.
You say that it is not possible to accept the stricter measures that the Member States might take.
Well, in our opinion, the specifications of both private and public authorities, which already exist and with which consumers are well acquainted, should be able to stay.
In any case, this is what we want, and, if there is any flexibility, harmonisation must be upwards, not downwards, the latter being something that we fear.
You have given us a number of answers.
I believe that this debate will continue, no doubt beyond tomorrow's vote.
Finally, I should like to conclude by saying that this regulation is not the be-all and end-all, either, and that it is not going to settle all of the issues concerning organic farming.
Within the context of the common agricultural policy, we also need far greater support for organic farming than we have at present.
draftsman for the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the work done within my committee, for which I was the draftsman, was very careful, and the result was adopted unanimously in committee.
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety is obviously deeply concerned with protecting the environment but in this specific case we have focused on how the environment can also be protected through the laws of the market.
I say this because the key point of the opinion I have presented is precisely this: for those producing, selling or buying organic food it must be clear with the utmost certainty and without any room for error that this food is in fact organic and not, for instance, contaminated by GMOs.
I think that it is vital for us to have this 'zero threshold' of contamination immediately; it cannot be postponed to later measures.
Anyone selling a product - for example, a luxury automobile - cannot tolerate the product containing a single bolt not belonging to that automobile.
That is, therefore, the key point of the recommendation made by my committee, which we would like to see included clearly in the final text.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank Mrs Beer very much for her very committed report.
Organic farming is of great interest to the public; its manifestations are very diverse and its significance varies greatly across the Member States.
Consequently this is a controversial and emotive issue to debate.
In this context, genetically modified organisms always constitute a major problem in organic farming.
That is why I support the limit value of 0.0% for organic farming, because what we identify as GM-free must also be GM-free.
Coexistence and liability are fundamental issues here, issues that also still need to be resolved, Commissioner, and I know that you are on our side in this respect.
The future of organic farming lies above all in the hands of consumers.
They decide whether they are prepared to pay more for food that is natural and GM-free.
The increase in sales of organic products in recent years clearly confirms that the public values this quality.
But it is precisely in this respect that it is important for the purchaser to know where the food comes from.
We have to ensure that the European organic labels are only used for products from the Member States that meet these criteria.
The future use of logos, the intention to label products more precisely and the related possibility of tracing are measures that I very much welcome, because they will also enable more effective checks to be carried out.
We need to ensure that equal account is taken of the interests of producers and consumers.
Joint, coordinated measures will bring additional gains both for European farming and for consumers, while still safeguarding subsidiarity.
The 197 amendments that have been tabled prove, however, that we are actually not yet able to vote on the report at the present time.
I therefore support the rapporteur on Amendments 37 and 39.
(The President cut off the speaker)
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) The organic production sector is asking us for - or rather demanding of us - clear and simple legislation that responds to the needs of a market that is clearly growing.
Europeans are consuming increasing quantities of organic products and we must establish an appropriate framework as soon as possible in order to meet those needs, protecting the interests not just of consumers but also, at the same time, the interests of the sector and environmental interests in general.
With a view to achieving that objective, the report that we are currently debating and which has been facing difficulties since its negotiation, is a good starting document.
I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Aubert, on the great work she has been doing.
I say that I believe this to be a good report because, for example, it takes account of the specific characteristics of the different European regions, it better stipulates the competences of each of the authorities and bodies involved in the control of organic products and it establishes a single obligatory logo, which is also something that I have insisted on during the negotiation in committee.
In this same vein, I also believe that it stipulates that, in order to be marketed as organic in the European Union, products from third countries must conform to rules equivalent to the European legislation.
In conclusion, I believe that the report is intended to promote organic production and consumption, seeking to consolidate this growing sector as the Ã©lite sector of our agriculture, since organic agriculture is destined to be characterised by its higher quality products.
Having said that, I believe that another debate is now opening up which until recently we had not taken into account: the possibility is being proposed of the European Parliament acquiring more of a say in decision making, taking a step further by means of the codecision procedure, calling for a twin legal basis for this Regulation.
I would like to make it clear that, as passionate Europeans, we are always in favour of greater decision-making powers for this Parliament, which is the European Union's highest democratic expression.
We will therefore vote accordingly tomorrow.
Nevertheless, I would also like to stress that this Regulation is a social demand both from the sector and from consumers, and therefore the subsequent steps that we must decide upon after tomorrow must not be delayed much longer, but rather, for the sake of the legal certainty of producers and the confidence of consumers, we must continue to work quickly in order that we may have a Regulation that the European sector has been calling for for a long time and which distinguishes this clearly organic agriculture, for the sake of consumer safety.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FI) Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Marie-HÃ©lÃšne Aubert, for an excellent report.
Organic production is one sector of agricultural production. Its importance in the future will probably be marked, because consumers are paying more attention to the quality of food rather than to its price.
Organic production is a way to improve the quality, taste and preservability of produce, thus creating added value on farms and boosting their profitability.
Organic production, however, is a difficult agricultural sector, which calls for earnest devotion to farm management.
Even tiny mistakes are hard to put right, as there are no opportunities for conventional production.
The EU's agricultural policy is generally characterised by the complexity of rules and bureaucracy.
With organic production there may be fears of an even greater burden.
The farmer has to be extremely familiar with both EU and national legislation.
The proposal for a regulation before us will mean more laws.
In itself, the aim is sound, as it is consumer confidence that one is trying to safeguard, but if there are too many laws it may well lead to a slow down in the increase in organic farming and many farmers will simply give up.
This would result in harm being done to the sector as a whole.
Mt President, agriculture and the food industry together form a huge sector of European production.
There is room within it for different methods and trends.
Organic production may offer very tempting opportunities, especially in the regions with the harshest natural conditions.
Hopefully, this regulation will strengthen our continent's food economy and boost its success in global competition.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as an Italian, I would like to mention that worldwide Italy is the fourth-ranked producer of organic products, while in the European Union it is in first place.
We therefore endorse the changes made by this report to the regulation: the changes regarding its scope, flexibility for the Member States, checks and the free movement of organic products within the European Union.
With regard to labelling, on the other hand, we believe that there must be an absolute guarantee that products are organic and that therefore there must be no accidental contamination by GMOs at any stage of the production process.
The regulations in force allow a threshold of accidental contamination by GMOs of 0.9% for organic products, which unfortunately is equal to that laid down for conventional agricultural products.
To conclude, in order to avoid a collapse in consumption as a result of a crisis in trust concerning foods chosen and purchased precisely because of their characteristics and their natural methods of production, it is necessary to lay down a threshold of accidental contamination by GMOs for organic products.
(The President cut off the speaker)
Mr President, Commissioner, the rapporteur has tabled a good report and Parliament must insist that the Commission and the Council do actually use this good report.
In other words we need codecision, particularly as all of the new substance of this regulation is related to the internal market.
The agricultural issues were of course already legislated on previously and could essentially be imported into the new regulation.
That is one reason for the dual legal base; the other, as you rightly established, is that many of the details should be resolved in the implementing provisions.
Parliament, just like the Council, must reserve the right to be consulted on these implementing provisions.
As you are aware, we now have a ruling.
If we had the constitution this issue would be resolved anyway.
In the coming months we will have to fight this out.
On the issue of GMOs, I am pleased that you have established that 0.9% is not a contamination threshold.
It is a labelling threshold; there is no right to contaminate.
Our group is concerned, however, that the technical means that we have at our disposal to prevent contamination are not being fully utilised and that as a result the 0.9%-threshold is being set too high.
We would like it to be lowered, because we say that for organic products any contamination must be completely ruled out.
I hope that you understand this and will take the necessary measures.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the provision under examination can be significantly improved by Parliament during tomorrow's vote in the Chamber.
In fact, a provision such as this one, which lays down a threshold of contamination of 0.9% for organic products, namely a threshold equal to that for conventional products, is of no help either to organic producers or, particularly, to consumers.
Even the figures provided to us by the Commissioner show that this is a provision that could cause significant damage to the organic sector.
In fact, laying down the same threshold for conventional products and for organic products would create confusion for consumers, who might no longer choose organic products, and this would also be detrimental for the agricultural production system, which in recent years has grown considerably in this sector.
I therefore believe that Parliament should return to the zero tolerance threshold in order to make these products even more attractive, ensuring that they are consumed in increasing quantities and providing ever more protection for consumers.
An organic product where a 0.9% threshold is allowed makes no sense and, equally, consumers would see no point in buying and spending more money on a product which no longer gives them the necessary guarantees and is not free of pollutants.
on behalf of the ITS Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I reject the attempt to remove a clear indication of the country of origin from product labelling, in favour of an EU label that would solely serve to hamper traceability.
The Commission is trying, in its usual manner, to standardise rather than to harmonise.
Organic products enjoy advantageous market positions in terms of advertising, thanks to the 'organic' label, and respectable turnover as compared with other products, despite the greater retail costs.
Until now the labels used have given satisfactory results in terms of differentiation of supply and demand.
This would be compromised if a common EU label were to undermine consumer awareness.
The regulation ought to offer a guarantee of independence to certification bodies, particularly with regard to relations with operators from non-EU countries.
We need an accreditation system based on strict, transparent rules, but this is what the Commission does not want.
To conclude, the idea of imposing an EU organic logo on products from non-EU countries, without the indispensable indication of the products' regional and national origin, should most definitely be rejected.
(EL) Mr President, Community legislation on organic products has been applied in the European Union for over 15 years with a fair degree of success, one might say, to judge from the results.
Of course, they could be even better because, if in the Europe of the 25 1.4% of all agricultural holdings are organic and account for 3.6% of farmland, this means that there is a considerable margin for further development.
How can we persuade consumers to opt for organic products and spend more on food, so that the resultant increase in demand encourages more farmers to work in this sector?
Obviously through constant and strict quality control, by ensuring they are free from genetically modified organisms and, most importantly, through proper labelling, which will strengthen consumer confidence.
We should highlight here the very important issue which usually shakes consumer confidence, by which I mean imports of allegedly organic products from third countries.
We must be strict on imported organic products.
Only if they have been produced using production methods similar to Community methods should they be entitled to be labelled as 'organic', because we all know that the cost of producing organic products in third countries is usually lower.
If organic production rules are circumvented, then these imported products would not be organic - meaning that we would be deceiving consumers - and would be competing with European farmers who comply with all the terms and conditions.
. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by expressing my satisfaction.
This report on organic production and labelling of organic products has finally arrived for debate in plenary at an important time, since the vote in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on 27 February, coincided with a demonstration by agrobiologists, who were rightly complaining about the new specifications for organic farming, which aimed and still aim at allowing 0.9% of contamination, which is the level allowed in conventional farming.
This report, which is the result of the unrelenting efforts of Mrs Aubert, to whom I pay tribute, is therefore terribly important for the entire sector and provides Parliament with a unique opportunity to distance itself from the Council and the Commission.
It is truly vital, particularly now, to send out a strong signal with the aim of protecting organic farming.
To this end, I, on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, have tabled Amendment 170, worded as follows: 'the Member States shall provide themselves with an appropriate legislative framework, based on the precautionary principle and on the 'polluter pays' principle, in order to exclude any risk of organic products being contaminated by GMOs.
It shall be incumbent on operators to take every precautionary measure necessary to exclude any risk of adventitious or technically unavoidable contamination by GMOs.
The presence of GMOs in organic products shall be limited exclusively to unforeseen and technically unavoidable volumes up to a maximum value of 0.1%.
In short, just as it is crucial not to change the very essence of organic production by allowing overly high levels of adventitious contamination, it is important to keep a minimum rate that is acceptable and accepted by the sector, so as not to penalise adventitiously contaminated organic farmers, who would see their production totally devalued if a zero tolerance policy were applied.
Furthermore, we support the use of natural nitrogen mineral fertiliser, as well as any other natural mineral fertiliser, and therefore propose, via Amendments 168 and 169, to delete the passage in Article 8(1)(d) that aims at prohibiting the use of nitrogen mineral fertiliser.
Finally, I fully support Parliament's Committee on Legal Affairs' decision to apply the dual legal basis - Articles 37 and 95 of the Treaty - because there are two advantages to referring to the competence of the internal market, too.
Firstly, this report, voted for in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Affairs, would be extended to the entire mass catering sector - caterers, institutional catering, canteens, restaurants - and to some products such as food supplements.
Secondly, as a result of the competence of the internal market, we would shift from a consultation procedure to a codecision procedure, which would give us the crucial right to inspect the drafting of this regulation, which will directly affect the quality of Europeans' diet.
- (PL) Despite the widespread interest in organic farming, both among consumers and among producers and the media, the sector's development continues to be slow.
What are the reasons, and what can be done to increase the consumption, and therefore also the production, of organic food?
In my opinion, the most important thing is to ensure stable conditions for development, and the support that goes with it.
This includes appropriate certification, labelling and monitoring, including the monitoring of imports from third countries.
In other words, we need good legislation.
The small scale of the organic sector makes the distribution of organic products excessively expensive, which therefore makes it not as attractive to major retailers.
It would therefore be a positive step if external subsidies were to be given to this part of the organic food production chain, and if farmers involved in producing this kind of food were to be organised.
It would also be good for the importance of organic farming to be stressed more within the field of education and for the sector to be better promoted.
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating Mrs Aubert on the excellent work she has done since the start of the mandate, firstly on the European action plan for organic food and farming and then on this proposal for a regulation.
The task was not easy because the proposal undermined the strong and credible identity of organic farming.
We can be satisfied with the progress made within the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on several points: a stricter definition of the use of phytopharmaceutical products, veterinary treatments and national derogations; increased monitoring at the certification stage, including monitoring of imported products; and an extension of the scope of the regulation and the consolidation of regulatory committees.
I also support the dual legal basis, which will move us on to codecision.
However, I remain very worried about the issue of GMOs being present, even adventitiously, in organic products.
Indeed, the regulation states that a product cannot be labelled 'organic farming product' if it contains GMOs, but it does nonetheless accept an adventitious contamination threshold of 0.9% of GMOs, which is inadmissible.
That is why I would ask you to endorse Amendments 170 and 171, tabled by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, which request that the presence of GMOs in organic products be limited exclusively and that the term not be used.
(HU) We must ensure that environmentally-aware consumers who are concerned about and anxious to protect their health are able to use products that are free of chemicals or of contamination by genetically modified organisms.
We must, therefore, clearly indicate if a product has its origin in organic production.
We must guarantee that products bearing the European Union's organic indicator have been prepared 100% in accordance with the basic principles of organic production.
In this area we cannot make any concession, just as we cannot with regard to consumer information.
We must also ensure that it is possible, when using public information services, for people to decide whether to choose organic foods.
This is not only a question of consumer protection but has great significance from the perspective of agrarian strategy and market protection as well.
A well formulated, universally recognised European standard and corresponding certification, along with harmonised European labelling, will strengthen consumer confidence, increase demand and guarantee the producers' livelihood.
Because of the different circumstances and traditions among the various Member States, however, we need to make sure that it is possible for them to regulate the matter even more strictly.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, first of all I have enjoyed the dedicated discussion we have had on this very important topic.
I also appreciate your support for the main thrust of these ideas.
On some of the more difficult points, I hope that I have been able to explain that we can, to a certain extent, accommodate many of your ideas.
I would like to make some comments on three different issues.
Firstly, on labelling.
It is important to realise that when the European Union's logo is used, an indication of the place where the raw materials were farmed is compulsory.
This is also the case for imported products and it must be crystal clear that they have to comply with the same rules as domestic production.
The issue of co-existence was raised.
It is very important that Member States make their own decision nationally to legislate on the rules for co-existence and the rules for liability.
Once these GM products are in a Member State, then there must be rules on distances and cleaning machinery when going from one field to another.
The decision has to be taken in the individual Member States, owing to the differences between production in northern and southern Europe.
I can only encourage Member States to put in place this legislation.
On the threshold mentioned seemingly by all of you, it is necessary to underline that the Commission proposal does not change the current rules regarding the unavoidable presence of GMOs.
However, it does clarify the organic operator's responsibility for avoiding the presence of GMOs.
Again, the important thing is that the use of GMOs and their derivatives is and was strictly banned in organic production, so they must be kept completely out of all organic production.
We are also making the rules on the tests on each and every batch of organic products sold less restrictive than at present.
On mass catering, also an issue raised by many of you, it is today possible, and will be in future, for mass catering companies to produce goods, under national legislation, which they can label as organic.
This is crucial.
We could not accept an EU ruling or legislation on this issue.
I can accept amendments 20, 31, 35, 56, 71, 75, 99, 101 and 120.
Furthermore, as I mentioned previously, 68 of the amendments are acceptable partially or in principle.
I cannot accept the other amendments in the light of the discussions that we have had and I refer specifically here to the amendment proposing a double legal basis.
However, the fact that 77 of your amendments are either totally or partially accepted clearly indicates that we have more common ground on this issue than you might think at first glance.
Thank you for a passionate debate.
Thank you, Commissioner.
That concludes the debate.
The vote will be tomorrow at 11.00.
Written statements (Rule 142)
, in writing. - Some things are black and white.
Organic and genetic modification are opposites.
A food cannot be called organic if it is genetically modified.
To pretend GM food contaminant can be labelled organic is so ludicrous that we have to ask why this possibility is allowed for in this directive.
Is it because the Commission knows that co-existence will not work?
If we carry on with the Commission's GM coexistence policy, organic farms will inevitably be contaminated.
Is it because the Commission realises that if GM agriculture goes ahead it will destroy organic farming unless we redefine 'organic'?
This would be a gross injustice and deception of organic farmers, sellers and consumers.
Therefore I would like to ask colleagues to support amendments 166/167, 170/171, 175 and 194, and to oppose the inclusion of any genetic contamination threshold, which means to oppose the AGRI Committee's amendment 41 and any others with this effect.
2008 budget guidelines (Sections I, II, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII(A) and VIII(B))
rapporteur. - (FI) Mr President, the main idea behind the budget for 2008 is that we can ensure that 2008 is the year of the taxpayers, which in practice means keeping expenditure more or less at 2007 levels.
The level of inflation needs to be raised to 2007 levels.
It nevertheless needs to be pointed out that this cannot apply to buildings.
Buildings policy has to be kept separate because we now have so many commitments regarding buildings that expenditure in this area is bound to increase beyond this level, but then that is how the matters has been presented out in this proposal and report.
It is also, however, important for Parliament's reputation that we look after the taxpayers' money and do not necessarily implement all the wonderful projects which have been proposed.
The people cannot have confidence in Parliament if each year we spend money in accordance with the 20% rule, although now in 2008, when there will be no further enlargement or any new languages, we have a real chance of adhering to 2007 levels and showing the taxpayers that we are genuinely concerned about how much money is being spent here.
There need to be a few more projects.
With respect to information policy we have to send a clear message to the people about what happens here, and this may be best realised through visitors' groups, which has been a priority for many years.
That is surely the best sort of information policy, although another issue is the small-scale local media, which does not have the resources to pay for trips to Parliament.
The local media should be able to visit Parliament more often and we need to find some solution where we MEPs could invite more representatives of the local media here, because this is just the sort of media which people read and listen to, and if it reports positively on us, Parliament's reputation and that of the EU as a whole is bound to improve.
We also need to pay more attention to the way we draft legislation, and this means that we must have good and sufficient technical facilities.
In this connection there is a proposal that, for example, we Members should be able to connect to computers via our mobile phones.
That facility exists in almost all the national parliaments, but not in the EU's Parliament, and these things need to be put right by the year 2008.
Translation services are a subject we talk about daily, and this of course is largely about how equally all Members are treated regardless of which language area they come from, and this is something that is certainly in need of major, and above all, structural change.
These services, however, always need to be kept functional.
I would furthermore emphasise that we could keep at this current level, and with regard to buildings, although some claim that 2008 is the last year in which money can be used for them, the list is very long indeed.
We have talked about external offices in London, Stockholm, and Paris.
We are embarking on the KAD construction project in Luxembourg at the same time as another institution, the European Court of Auditors, starts on a major construction project there.
Here in Brussels we have completion work to do on new buildings, we have the purchase of premises close to here in the 'banana' building, there is the completion of the Sports Centre ...
The list could go on, but this only goes to show that not all of them can be embarked on or realised in 2008: instead, a priority list should be drawn up for buildings and we need then to proceed with reference to it.
I believe that the preparatory work has been done in the right spirit and that we all wish to tell the taxpayer that the year 2008 has been specifically proclaimed the year of the taxpayers.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (LV) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I would like to express my support for the rapporteur's approach, that the European Parliament's level of expenditure should be based on requirements that are justified following careful evaluation.
In this speech, however, I would like to draw attention to my proposal to reduce consumption of paper and energy resources at the European Parliament.
The EU institutions ought to set an example of environmentally friendly policies and reduce consumption of energy resources.
Unfortunately, in various spheres the European Parliament uses resources inappropriately, for example by consuming paper extravagantly and using unnecessary, intensive air-conditioning in the summer.
Reducing paper consumption and using air-conditioning more rationally would produce both gains from the environmental viewpoint and also significant savings in the European Parliament's budget.
In practice, all European Parliament documents are accessible in electronic form.
My proposal envisages reducing the circulation of paper versions of documents by stipulating that paper versions of many documents would be available on request, instead of being automatically distributed to all Members and officials.
Every working day the Members and Parliament officials receive an enormous quantity of paper documents.
The majority of these are subsequently thrown away, since should it be necessary electronic versions of the document are available.
It would be much more rational to allow the Members and Parliament officials to stipulate which documents they wish to receive in future in paper form and which they will read electronically.
The potential saving is considerable, in view of the fact that the European Parliament's current consumption of paper is nearly 850 tonnes a year, or 3.4 million sheets a week.
With regard to air-conditioning, the proposal envisages raising the air temperature of the European Parliament by a few degrees in summer.
Up until now it has been kept unnecessarily and even uncomfortably low.
Thank you for your attention.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (SK) The fathers of the idea of a united Europe did not know what would happen 50 years on, but there is one thing they knew for certain: if we are to build Europe, we must build it together.
We have transposed these words of Robert Schuman in a striking way into the EU slogan and logo, which reads 'Together'.
In the 2008 budget we emphasise the political importance of the instruments we would like to use to better inform European citizens.
One of our aims is to eliminate the shortcomings that undermine the European Union's image, especially with a view to the 2009 elections.
Ladies and gentlemen, on Saturday many of you, along with millions of TV viewers, were watching the major concert held in Brussels to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Treaties of Rome.
However, the overall impression was not so much a commemoration but rather an embarrassment.
The entire event would have achieved a far greater symbolism if artists from all of the Member States had been invited.
If we want to deal with problems successfully, we need to take a comprehensive view.
It will not suffice for us, as the European Parliament, to make progress in communication and information policies.
We need to work with the Commission and the European Houses in the Member States to elaborate effective communication measures and then to regularly evaluate the effectiveness of the process.
Our emphasis on a comprehensive approach and strengthened cooperation between institutions will result in greater transparency and a more efficient use of resources.
Ladies and gentlemen, Parliament recently decided to adopt a meaningful statute on the assistants employed by MEPs.
I would therefore ask you to adopt an amendment calling on the Council to take a definitive decision in the matter.
As we all know, this statute will ultimately contribute to improving the quality of our work.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DA) Mr President, I would thank Mr ItÃ€lÃ€ for his constructive work on the report on Parliament's 2008 budget.
He proposes that next year's expenditure remain in principle at the 2007 level, and that is something that we in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe can happily endorse in principle.
Following enlargement, 2008 is, of course, a year of consolidation, and very good cases will have to be made out for meeting additional needs if meeting them would have budgetary consequences.
At the same time, we would concur with the observation that 2008 will probably be the last year in which we can use the surplus of up to 20% in the EU's administrative expenditure for the purchase of buildings.
Last but not least, I want to emphasise what Mr MaÅka also said, namely that now we are obtaining a Members' Statute, this needs to be backed up by a Statute of Members' assistants here in Parliament.
On this point, we do not have the Council's support, and, without that support, we cannot put matters in order.
Let us get something done about that.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FI) Mr President, the European Parliament's expenditure has grown very rapidly.
This growth can be explained by the enlargement of the Union, and the ensuing need for interpretation and translation services as well as space.
It has been estimated that 60% of costs are due to the demand for multilingualism and a policy of having several places of business.
So far all the expenditure has been financed out of the 20% of the Union's administrative costs whose use was agreed on unofficially with the other budgetary authority, the Council.
Within the context of Parliament's expenditure 2008 is a sort of gap year.
Funding for new premises is in order, and there is no new round of enlargement in sight.
Consequently, the rapporteur's view that Parliament should not invent new, artificial expenditure for itself and should not necessarily aim at the 20% level is right.
If we do that, there is a danger that Parliament's big groups will fund their own political objectives out of common administrative expenditure, and that will be a financial burden for Parliament after 2008.
Mr President, I agree with the rapporteur that the institutions should base their estimates on well-defined needs.
This should result in better efficiency of resources, thus avoiding duplication of functions.
In this respect, we expect the final proposal for an interinstitutional agreement for the two committees, the Committee of the Regions and the European Economic and Social Committee, to be reached in 2007, ensuring equitable governance of the joint departments.
Prima facie, it seems reasonable to request that Parliament should retain the same budgeting level as in 2007.
However, we should ensure that Parliament's financial independence is not compromised in any way, especially as the Members' Statute, amounting to over EUR 100 million, comes into force in 2009.
The benchmark of 20% of heading five should be retained as the budget's upper limit.
This threshold should provide us with the necessary stability and discipline when formulating the 2008 budget.
Finally, I wish to express my appreciation to Mr ItÃ€lÃ€ for his report.
(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report is essential, not only because it highlights the financial resources used to run the European institutions, but also because it underlines Parliament's role as controller and because it gives concrete expression to the functioning of our Europe.
As the report highlights, we need to stabilise our finances, and our budgetary strategy for 2008 must be prudent.
To achieve this, priority must be given to, among other things, improving the performance of our services and the redeployment of staff.
I shall make three remarks quickly.
Firstly, while paying tribute to the very high quality of the translation services, I should like to highlight the ever more frequent delays in distributing language versions, something that has a negative impact on our upstream work.
Secondly, I should like to reiterate my request to have equivalent technical and information technology resources in the different places of work, Strasbourg and Brussels.
In this period of commemorating the Treaty of Rome, I should also like to emphasise the possibility for Parliament to have an ambitious communication plan concerning the media.
I would also emphasise the need to improve the information given to the citizens, for example by doing more to accommodate them during the part-sessions.
Visits by our fellow citizens are often an effective way for them to discover Europe.
I would therefore like the capacity for receiving visitors to be improved, especially in Strasbourg, at the seat of the European Parliament.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
Written Statements (Rule 142)
, in writing. - Last week the Commission held an important and interesting conference on the ecological taxation - eco-taxes.
Sustainable development and a proper climate policy need political and administrative rules - strict regulations, directives, laws and by-laws.
But, living in a market economy, we have to understand the importance of the financial tools as well.
An adequate tax system can decrease the use of the natural resources, pollution and environmental damages, and can encourage the use of renewable energy and energy efficiency.
As Commissioner LÃ¡szlÃ³ KovÃ¡cs said, during the second half of his term he intends to concentrate on taxation promoting the EU's energy targets and to fight climate change.
The European Parliament should call for a solid and environmentally aware European-level taxation, which can contribute to sustainable development and saving energy.
Future of Professional Football in Europe - Security at Football Matches (debate)
The next item is the joint debate on the reports:
by Mr Belet on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education on the future of professional football in Europe, and
By Mr Catania on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs on the initiative by the Republic of Austria with a view to adopting a Council decision amending Decision 2002/348/JHA concerning security in connection with football matches with an international dimension [10543/2006 C6-0240/2006.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, honourable Members, dear friends of football and sport, I am very pleased to represent the Commission here tonight for the debate on football.
I think this constitutes further proof that Parliament is committed to sport.
The support you give to our initiatives for sport is of course both welcome and needed.
I would like to start by congratulating both rapporteurs, Mr Belet and Mr Catania, on the quality of their work.
The two reports treat football from different angles, but they both illustrate the nature of sport, its values, its potential for education, for society and for the economy.
Before speaking on the more detailed aspects of the reports, let me say a few words on the White Paper.
This is going to be an essential piece of work for the future of European sport.
The White Paper on Sport is due to be adopted in July this year.
This will be the culmination of a long process and should be seen in the light of wider political considerations.
Plans for a White Paper are driven by the expectations of sport stakeholders.
They wish to see their concerns addressed by EU policymakers, including the need to better promote sport and to achieve more legal certainty.
The White Paper will cover all sports, and there will be no football-specific approach.
The ultimate goal of this initiative is first to mainstream sport into other active policies of the Union in order to improve its use as a tool for EU policy.
Secondly, we are aiming to set conditions for improved governance in European sport.
The main topics of the White Paper will be the social and economic role of sport, the organisation of sport and governance issues.
We will pay great attention to Parliament's reports when preparing the White Paper.
The Commission has been following the committee's work very closely and this has already given us very useful input.
On Mr Belet's report, the Commission welcomes Parliament's initiative on the future of professional football.
We share many of the concerns expressed in the report.
The White Paper will address many of the issues which Mr Belet raises, such as social cohesion, protection of young workers, social dialogue and the free movement of workers.
As your draft report acknowledges, it is extremely difficult to establish a comprehensive European legal framework recognising the specificity of sport, but EU case law does recognise the specificity of sport and the social and educational role played by football in Europe.
Concerning the free movement of workers, for example, the Court held that sport is only subject to Community law when it constitutes an economic activity.
This covers both professional and amateur athletes, and the Court made an exception to the general rule of non-discrimination for matches which are of purely sporting rather than economic interest, for example, games between national teams.
On the issue of home-grown players, the Commission is very sensitive to the measures proposed by UEFA.
We could share the idea of promoting the training of young people, as well as sending a signal to the clubs that they should invest in the training of young people and not only in transfers of players.
However, we are still considering the question of quotas of locally-trained players, including from the angle of proportionality.
The Commission welcomes Parliament's call for intensified social dialogue in the football sector.
This is a good mechanism for addressing issues such as mobility, work contracts and working conditions.
We have supported the social partners' efforts to develop a more structured dialogue where football has taken the lead at European level.
The Commission will continue to support employers' and employees' organisations in the whole sport sector and it will continue its open dialogue with all sport organisations on this issue.
In conclusion, the Commission will give due and realistic consideration to your recommendations in line with current EU areas of responsibility.
The request for the Commission to draw up an action plan to define the issues to be tackled deserves careful consideration.
On Mr Catania's report, I want to underline first that sport can be a positive force for education, culture and social integration.
But in recent years we have seen unfortunate and growing signs of violence and hooliganism during sporting events.
Two weeks ago sport ministers discussed the issue in Stuttgart.
They underlined the need for improved prevention measures, in particular encouraging cooperation between all those involved, including the supporters.
The Commission has concentrated on promoting exchanges of experience and good practice among Member States so as to develop better police and judicial cooperation.
We have established good working contacts with UEFA and other sporting authorities.
In terms of public order and police control, I think everyone was pleased with the excellent results of football matches during the World Cup in Germany last year.
It shows that good preparation and coordination with other Member States are very effective in preventing crime and especially hooliganism.
The first statistics show that the crime rate did not increase at all during that period.
Council Decision 2002/348/EC obliges Member States to establish national football information points.
This is a positive step in improving cooperation between police forces and other bodies that combat football-related violence.
The Austrian initiative that Mr Catania's report addresses aims at replacing the existing network of information points with a specific network of national football information points.
These would have access to the personal data of hooligans or 'risk supporters' identified by the different Member States.
The Commission welcomes the report's support for this initiative and takes due note of the concerns expressed on human rights and data protection, to which, as you know, the Commission attaches great importance.
In conclusion, it is a positive result that sport is now truly on the agenda at European level.
The 50th anniversary of the Rome Treaties is colouring many of our objectives this year, and what a good way it was to celebrate the anniversary with a football match in Manchester two weeks ago.
There could be no stronger signal that sport and sporting values are truly appreciated at the highest political level.
rapporteur. - (NL) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the very idea that Europe, the European Union, should have any say in matters relating to sport makes some people's hair stand on end.
Their predictable response will always be that the EU has no say in the matter and should, as such, not attempt to do anything in that area either.
As we all realise, and as those involved know only too well, this position is wrong.
As the Commissioner already mentioned, sport, and certainly professional sport, not least the economic aspects of professional football -which is what this report is about - is affected by European legislation in all kinds of ways.
There is interference from the Commission and from the European Court of Justice, and we have, in recent years, had adequate proof of that fact.
Needless to say, professional football is big business. This is beyond dispute.
It is, however, so much more.
It meets important social and educational needs, and this is why we underline in this report the specificity that we simply cannot get round.
Specificity of sport is enshrined in the declaration to the Treaty of Nice and in the protocol to the Treaty of Amsterdam.
There is no two ways about it.
It is therefore our duty to take this into account when applying EU rules and regulations.
Nobody is asking for exemption measures or so-called group exemptions.
What we do ask for, though, is Commission guidelines - not directives, but guidelines, particularly to lift the legal uncertainty that is around at the moment.
We want the autonomy of the professional sport to be fully respected.
Self-regulation is the central concept in this report, but that does not deny us the right to nudge the trend in a certain direction.
The reputation of professional football has in recent months taken a battering in very many EU countries due to all kinds of scandals, something to which there is only one answer: good governance.
This is why we demand determination from the administrative bodies of the UEFA, of the football leagues, and of the clubs, in their selection in favour of transparent management.
A huge number of Members of this House also want more solidarity and a redistribution of resources in football.
I do not think it is up to us to redistribute the resources in professional football.
It is in the interest of the professional clubs, of the leagues and the federations to take measures to this effect.
Football requires competitive even-handedness, for this is something that is now more than ever in the balance.
The gap between the big, ever richer clubs and the smaller clubs is widening all the time.
This is blindingly obvious.
This trend is threatening the future of the sport that is so close to our hearts and I have to say, it also threatens the social and integrating role that sport has.
This is why we, as the Commissioner already referred to, and I should like to underline this point once again, remain fully committed to the home-grown rule which the UEFA introduced for locally trained players.
Not we, but football bodies themselves should make it compulsory for professional clubs to invest in the training of their own young people as an essential element of the social component.
This is why it deserves our unqualified support.
The sale of TV rights is a delicate issue, as it involves the key source of income for the professional clubs, but also because it is a national matter, of course.
The only thing we ask in this report is for the competent authorities and competent bodies in football to sit round the table to look for a solution that guarantees more solidarity between the large and small clubs.
This strikes me as a reasonable and justified request.
Commissioner, Madam President, we are counting on the Commission, when outlining its White Paper on sport, to very much take into consideration what is in this report and what will hopefully meet with approval tomorrow.
We have taken maximum account of the EU's competences in this area, as there is little point in pulling the wool over our own eyes, certainly not when a complex sector such as professional football is involved, in which millions of young people take a direct interest.
We are looking forward to an ambitious document from the Commission and I think - indeed, I assume, and you can rest assured - that you, in turn, can count on our loyal support.
rapporteur. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his support for our reports, and would also like to stress the importance of this joint debate, since I believe that the future of football is fundamentally linked to stadium security.
For this reason, placing the future of professional football together with security in stadiums is a practical way of developing a debate on the future of sport and football.
The Commissioner is right to say that in recent years we have seen constantly recurring displays of violence in the stands, and these have transformed the very nature of the sport: the huge number of incidents of violence, displays of intolerance, and acts of xenophobia and racism are signs of a fundamental change in a sport that is one of the best loved and most supported by Europe's people.
Unfortunately, these are not isolated cases but the result of an overall transformation of football, which has now become big business, with clubs quoted on the stock exchange and an astronomical capital turnover.
I believe that this factor has significantly contributed to the gradual transformation of sporting events.
Football today is very popular and is at the same time a major event, leading telecommunications companies to invest in the acquisition of television rights.
I endorse the proposal made by Mr Belet concerning the collective selling of TV rights, which seems to me to be a practical way of preventing the major teams 'filling up' on money at the expense of the small companies.
There is another factor which is fundamental to football, represented not only by sporting prowess but above all by the presence of the public.
It would be unthinkable to have football games without spectators: in some cases extreme measures have been taken which, in my view, have damaged the spectator nature of the sport.
Since the presence of spectators in the stadiums is vital, we must insist that football games are always played in front of a crowd, and this means that appropriate measures need to be taken to ensure that the games are played in perfect calm, without displays of violence or racism.
The recent tragic events at the Italian football championship premier league match between Catania and Palermo, which resulted in the death of a policeman, are in my opinion the most serious example of what can happen inside stadiums and of how a fringe group of violent fans often clashes not only with opposing fans but also with the forces of law and order.
In recent times we have also witnessed deplorable events involving not only fans but also footballers: often the fights between the players themselves have been the very worst form of education and culture to be seen in European stadiums.
Preventive action must therefore be taken to avoid the repetition of similar acts of violence in stadiums.
Priority should be given to preventive action when football games are being played, as against repression and the militarisation of stadiums.
The Council adopted this decision in 2002, establishing a national information point on football, which functions as a point of contact for the exchange of police information in relation to international football games.
The results of this measure have been very positive, as can also be seen from experience in the stadiums and relations between police forces.
In recent years the number of supporters going abroad to see games has constantly been on the increase and therefore the Council believes it is necessary for the bodies responsible to step up their cooperation.
I think this is an important point: the agencies responsible for monitoring the presence of supporters in the stadiums and obtaining data on the nature of organised supporters groups are undoubtedly a useful tool but they must operate exclusively in accordance with national laws and in compliance with European directives and international agreements on the protection of personal data.
We must make sure that the large amount of data collected is not used for investigations by the legal system or for other investigations not connected with football, and certainly not as a method of criminalising all fans.
Care must thus be taken when the data is being obtained: I think that otherwise the national agencies might change from being tools for preventing acts of violence in stadiums into tools for social control, liable to act in an indiscriminate manner.
I therefore endorse the proposal made by the Council to amend the decision we are discussing.
We are anxious to ensure that this decision is implemented in full compliance with the law, to ensure that stadiums are not considered to be a territory outside the law, a sort of free zone.
National and international laws must apply in stadiums too, precisely in order to ensure that acts of indiscriminate violence and displays of racism and xenophobia are not repeated.
Mr President, we are nonetheless in a rather surprising situation.
We are celebrating the 50th anniversary of the creation of the European Union, and, if we explained to our fellow citizens that the European Union is no longer concerned for one second with sport, they would be surprised.
It was therefore time for the European Union to take up this issue, and to do so as we have done, I believe, in the European Parliament.
I should like to thank the main rapporteur, Mr Belet, for the way in which he has worked for six months on this report, a joint piece of work between various committees and between various democratic political groups of this Parliament.
We have therefore taken up this issue with the aim, which I believe is shared by this Parliament, to respect both the European 'exception' regarding sport, not least in comparison to the way in which professional sport is managed in the United States, and the various bodies and organisations in charge of professional football: federations, professional leagues, players' associations, agents' groups and so on.
I believe that, at this level, this report is useful if we succeed in gaining support for these positions among the various organisations and in thereby enabling them to make this report, on which we are going to vote tomorrow, their own.
I believe that our exchanges back and forth with these organisations, which paid an enormous amount of attention to the matter, have been very interesting, and have enabled us to come up with a number of proposals.
We therefore welcome, and I think everyone else will do the same, the various recommendations and proposals concerning the training of players, the training of young players and UEFA's efforts in this regard to prevent young players from being sold straightaway and to enable them to play at the clubs under which they have trained.
We welcome the recommendation concerning what might be referred to as 'trafficking in young players', whereby hundreds of young African players are used, with there being no plans in place for them afterwards.
We welcome the fact that this report points out that immigration laws are made to be complied with, even in the world of professional sport, even in the world of football.
We also welcome, as the Commissioner said, the repeated demand for crucial social dialogue.
As Mr Belet pointed out, the financial sums at stake, today, in professional football, are exponential - huge - and there is a need, in this regard, for social dialogue, and clearly for regulation and redistribution.
There is one criticism, however, which was voiced today, and I am surprised by it.
Everyone, including all of the committees, is talking about financial transparency.
Today, I heard some of my fellow Members voice the idea that the simple act of saying it was enough.
No, the proposal to create an independent organisation - under the auspices of UEFA, perhaps, but independent - would enable us genuinely to move in the direction of financial control and financial transparency.
That is the only solution.
Repeating it is not enough. It is like saying, on the subject of doping, that we need to combat doping, but without creating any national, European or international body to do so.
We must not be hypocritical: we need such a body.
I see that I have come to the end of my speaking time.
I still had many things left to say.
I also welcome, of course, the fight against discrimination and the fight against racism, these being subjects that are regularly taken up by the European Parliament and the Commission, as well as by the football world as a whole.
draftsman of the opinion for the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection. - (NL) Madam President, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I am shadow rapporteur of the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection, but I should like to point out that we started this dossier in the Internal Market Committee to prevent football from disintegrating - which was a real risk at the time - with a possible second Bosman case, namely the Charleroi case.
I should like to thank the working party, particularly Mr Belet, for their good cooperation, which has now put before us what I see as an even-handed proposal, one that covers all aspects of the professional sport and in which we send a clear warning to all interested parties to do something about the situation that has come about over the years, in which it does seem as if professional sport is above the law until such time as a case is brought before the European Court, and then we speak about an economic entity with social and cultural values.
The European rules must, however, be complied with.
I would therefore ask the Commission whether it shares my view that we leave amateur sports out of the equation, but that professional sport is an entertainment industry which should probably even fall within the Services Directive, and that an internal market should probably eventually be created for these services, for this entertainment industry.
After all, we are not discussing what is happening on the pitch, but outside of it, particularly the financial players around it.
Competition at European level reveals very many discrepancies, because there are differences in interpretation.
What is this attributable to?
Why has an internal market not been established yet and why is every club required to operate within the domestic market in order to be able to compete with each other at European level?
As I see it, if the bodies involved refuse to regulate themselves, then politicians should step in.
We are now sending a warning without wanting any fresh legislation - certainly not an exception - but a sign that the parties involved should solve their own problems and, if not, then I hope that the Commission will step in and say what should be done.

Mr President, my colleague from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, Mr Belet, has done an excellent job.
His report strikes a balance between the social and economic dimensions of football.
I spoke to club managers, players and fans and tabled amendments in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, which received widespread support.
Young players need to be nurtured from early on by attending high performance centres and by being given plenty of playing practice.
That is why I support the UEFA proposal always to have a minimum number of home-grown players in the team.
Surely it ought also to be possible, Commissioner Figel', to enshrine this principle in law.
I am in favour of professional clubs releasing their players for the national teams and being entitled to compensation if they are injured or absent for weeks at a time.
It is time that FIFA and UEFA had a new, joint insurance system.
Being named for the national side is extremely stimulating for the players and good for the clubs.
Just a moment ago Karlheinz Rumenigge was here in the European Parliament.
I am a member of a German league club and also of the Friends of Football Group here in the European Parliament.
The issue here is fair play in competition between the teams.
At present, many clubs have huge debts and yet still receive a licence.
Other clubs manage their finances responsibly, but cannot reach optimal strength because of limited funds.
Something has to change here.
Let us continue to fight together against racism.
Last year our resolution received the greatest number of signatures in the history of the European Parliament.
Offences must be dealt with consistently, with games played in front of empty stands, points deducted and clubs banned if they are not prepared to take action.
When it comes to preventing and eliminating doping there should not be any lazy compromises either.
We do not need a European supervisory body to monitor the activities of sovereign football clubs.
What is effective in the long run is cooperation.
That is why we must safeguard the independence of our clubs and subsidiarity.
I have faith in the legality of the decisions made by sports tribunals and in the power of self-regulation in UEFA, FIFA and our national associations.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, allow me first of all to thank the rapporteur, Mr Belet, for having sought to reach a compromise among the various committees and political groups of our Parliament.
However, I should like straightaway to say how hugely disappointed I am.
We have reached a compromise between the groups, not least between the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.
This compromise was voted on in committee, and here we find, today, that crucial points have been amended, namely the independent regulating body and the legal status of sports companies.
This report will not mark the start of a new era for football in Europe, and I deeply regret it.
Nevertheless, I hope that it can establish a form of cooperation between UEFA and the European Union with the aim of cleaning up as much as possible the world of football, for, as the UEFA President, Michel Plattini, pointed out, football is a game before a product, a sport before a market and a form of entertainment before a business.
Ladies and gentlemen, the deregulation that resulted from the Bosman ruling must be counterbalanced today by clear rules, in an effort to restore true values to the EU's top sport.
The European football authorities do not have all the guarantees necessary to be able to regulate in a truly satisfactory fashion.
Aside from their limited legal rights, they are both the judge and the ones being judged.
They act as both commercial operator and regulator, functions that are difficult to reconcile.
On this point, as I indicated at the start of my speech, it is regrettable that the PPE-DE and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe should not have endorsed my twin proposal, namely the creation of a European legal statute for sports companies and the implementation of an independent body in charge of monitoring the top clubs, the main task of which would be to ensure that the financial, economic and sporting balance of football in Europe is preserved.
I hope, however, that the European Commission will take due note of these proposals, which are meant not only as a defence against the current excesses, but also as an instrument for promoting a fair and united European sporting model.
At a time when we are celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome, Europe must show its citizens that it remains for them not just a vehicle for peace and democracy, but above all a vehicle for protecting them against the excesses of all-out liberalism.
It is on this condition alone that Europeans are proud to participate in this great project that is European integration.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Belet, I will start straight away with the thing that has done the most to change professional sport in recent years: money.
A professional club's greatest source of revenue is the sale of television rights.
The bigger the national television market, the greater the clubs' revenue, budget and buying power.
It is no accident that nearly all of the teams playing in the group phase of the Champions League are from large Member States.
As in other sectors of the unbridled market economy, this imbalance leads to a rapidly widening gulf between rich and poor.
On the one hand there are enterprises worth billions, like Real Madrid: on the other bankrupt clubs like Sturm Graz.
That is unsporting and unfair.
What can small Member States do to counter this imbalance?
We need new leagues; we need to stop thinking so narrowly in terms of national countries.
We need to be more European, including in football.
Moreover, I believe that we should not buy and trade home-grown talent, but rather, as is usual in the United States, allocate talented players to clubs by lot.
Weaker teams would have more lots and therefore more of a chance of being top clubs.
If money alone determines football, then Europe's most popular cultural asset will lose its defining characteristic: its sporting spirit.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, soccer has moved from being a sport and providing entertainment to being a money-making machine and a way of gaining power.
It has practically become a new religion.
If soccer is not to become a tool of lawlessness and violence, we must change the environment in which it operates - in terms of business and the media - radically and rapidly.
I would like to express my gratitude to the author of the report, Mr Ivo Beleta, for raising this important issue, and for pointing out most of the problems and indicating ways of solving them.
In my opinion, radical decisions are required to counteract the monopolisation of football by wealthy corporations.
In the first place, full transparency is needed as regards the income and expenditure of all clubs, and high penalties should be paid for any breaches.
Secondly, there need to be limits or caps placed on the increase in spending by the wealthiest clubs over the next few years.
Thirdly, financial and other support is needed for countries, organisations and clubs investing in young people and sports facilities.
Fourthly, there has to be an agreement with FIFA to tackle corruption and crime in football.
Poland wants to host the European championships in 2012, at which the principle of fair play and healthy competition will triumph.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, Mr Belet made reference to believing in the autonomy of sport.
I agree.
The report draws attention to areas where more cooperation or even regulation might be appropriate, but I believe the structure and organisation of the game of football is not one of them.
Local, national and international leagues and competitions are best left to the football authorities to organise.
Around here, when we refer to the term 'national' we tend to mean 'of the Member State.
The Member State is, of course, the building block of the European Union, but in football that is not the case.
