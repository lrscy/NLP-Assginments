Mr President, the Commission, together with Member States, is following the situation in Syria very closely.
Since our last debate at the June 2006 part-session there have been a few positive developments.
I would like to point out that a human rights contact was appointed in January 2007 in the Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
We also consider it positive that the EU is granted regular access to trials at the High State Security Court, the Military Court and the Criminal Court.
However, we regret that none of the promises of political openness have been transformed into action - for instance, the relaxation of the emergency law, the adoption of a multi-party law, the granting of citizenship to stateless Kurds or the declaration of the National Council for Human Rights.
We also deplore the disproportionate sentences pronounced against prominent civil society activists in recent weeks.
We cannot accept that they are jailed only because they have expressed themselves freely.
We call again for the release of all political prisoners in Syria.
To give an example, all our attempts to help Mr Anwar al-Bunni have led to a dead end.
Today Mr al-Bunni was sentenced to five years in prison merely for denouncing torture and poor prison conditions in Syria and fined EUR 1500 for allegedly not respecting Syria's law when setting up the training centre, also financed by European Funds.
For several years the Commission has been supporting the modernisation process in Syria through a range of activities.
We have seen very encouraging results in the economic field. We sincerely hope that these will spread to the political sphere.
We will continue to encourage Syria to respect this obligation and the UN Convention on Civil and Political Rights and Torture.
I am sure that the European Parliament will give its support to these efforts by the Commission.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at the end of the debates.

Human rights in Sudan
The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on human rights in Sudan.
author. - (DE) Mr President, on 6 March and 13 February 2007, respectively, Amouna Abdallah Daldoum, 23 years old, and Sadia Idries Fadul, 22 years old, were convicted of adultery and sentenced to death by stoning.
Both women had been found guilty of adultery by a criminal court in Managil province, Gezira state.
According to reports, the women did not have a lawyer during the trial, and could not even conduct their own defence because they only speak the language of their respective ethnic group.
The trial was conducted in Arabic, but the women were not provided with interpreters.
There was an appeal against the verdict.
According to the Sudanese Embassy in Brussels, the court quashed the death sentence on grounds of lack of legal assistance.
We welcome the quashing of the death sentence if the court really confirms this, and we call on the Sudanese Government to ensure that the two women are not harmed physically or mentally.
On 3 May, two 16-year-olds were sentenced to death for murder and robbery.
The imposition of the death penalty on young offenders is prohibited under international law.
Sudan has ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, and accordingly committed itself to refraining from executing any persons under 18 years old.
The Sudanese Government is called on to lift the death penalty imposed on the two minors and guarantee they are not harmed physically or mentally.
We call on the Commission, the Council and the Member States to condemn the death penalty, whipping and all other cruel and degrading punishments.
author. - (PL) Mr President, this is my first term as a Member of the European Parliament, but I do recall that this is our third debate on the subject of Sudan.
In an ideal situation, from the point of view of the Sudanese people, there would be no need for our involvement.
I welcome the fact that the six largest political groups in Parliament have come to an agreement on the matter of Sudan, and that we have a joint position.
Paradoxically enough, one could say that the suffering and terrible verdicts handed down by the injustice system, I repeat - the injustice system, in that country seem to unite us in Europe.
It is unacceptable in the twenty-first century for a situation to continue where women are sentenced to death by stoning for adultery or where sixteen year old children are sentenced to death by hanging.
Yes, we have become involved in Sudan's internal affairs.
Moreover, we should be involved for moral as well as other reasons.
One of these reasons is that we have already earmarked EUR 85 million for humanitarian aid to that country this year alone.
That figure was increased two months ago, as it initially stood at EUR 40 millions.
We also have to loudly denounce cruel practices, such as the mutilation of young women, which also occurs in that country.
On a personal note, there is no point hiding the fact that there is a debate taking place in my country on the subject of the death penalty.
Personally, I am against the death penalty.
Events in Sudan confirm my convictions, although the cultural context is, of course, entirely different.
I would like to highlight the fact that we have to show solidarity in this matter.
We have to act together, as it is only our solidarity, the solidarity of the whole European Union, that can put an end to these absurd verdicts.
author. - Mr President, Sudan is perhaps best known for the conflict in Darfur, in which human rights abuses have reached gigantic proportions.
However, Sudan is also a state where respect for human rights in general is seriously lacking throughout the country.
This motion for a resolution reminds us again of the anachronistic and primitive judicial system applicable in Sudan, a system that allows the sentencing of women to death by stoning if found guilty of adultery and the sentencing of children to death.
It is truly hard to believe that in the 21st century there are still governments that continue to tolerate and support such extraordinarily barbaric systems.
We understand that Sudan is a very poor country, with many political and economic problems, but such problems should not be an excuse for not following a course of common-sense-guided progress towards upholding universal values of justice and democracy.
Furthermore, we find it difficult to accept how religion can interfere to such drastic and occasionally sadistic effect in matters of criminal and civil law.
We wish to send a strong message to the Sudanese Government that our patience is running out and the limits on our tolerance have long been exceeded.
We demand that they implement an urgent revision of their judicial system, taking into consideration international law, UN conventions and respect for the human rights of the Sudanese people.
We trust this will be done speedily, in order to avoid having to resort to more drastic persuasive measures.
author. - (DE) Mr President, I fully agree with Mr Matsakis, except on one point.
He states that Sudan is a poor country - which is true, but, with its oil wealth and much more, it has the potential to be an extremely rich one.
Yet it is being exploited, and international forces and companies have certainly fanned the flames of the war in Darfur and elsewhere to promote their energy interests.
Sudan, with its defective political system, is also inflicting infinite harm on itself, however, not only as a result of the conflict between north and south, east and west, Christians and Muslims - as the generalisation always goes - but also as a result of a host of individual conflicts.
For this reason, we must insist on respect for fundamental human rights there.
As has just been said, rightly, Europe rejects the death penalty.
The debate in Poland has been mentioned.
As we know, the death penalty is incompatible with membership of the European Union and also of the Council of Europe; but similar standards are having to be developed slowly in Africa, of course.
The still fledgling African Union is particularly called upon in this regard to not only develop, but also implement and enforce politically the relevant human rights standards little by little - we know that this cannot be done overnight.
For this reason, we appeal to the Sudanese Government to not only discontinue the death penalty - particularly its particularly scandalous use on minors - but also to refrain from a) misinterpreting Sharia law as it is doing, as the barbaric customs practised there have nothing to do with real Sharia law, and b) extending Sharia law to non-Islamic communities.
The country must comply with normal civil law that is in line with the human rights standards of the United Nations.
author. - (ES) Of all the horrors that can be inflicted on a human being, death by stoning is unquestionably one of the most incomprehensible and patently unacceptable.
The case we are discussing today, the sentencing to death by stoning of Sadia Idris Fadul and Amouna Abdallah Daldoum, has two equally important dimensions.
On the one hand, it obliges us once again to state our opposition to the death penalty as a form of punishment under any circumstances, and, on the other, it brings us face to face with another case of flagrant gender discrimination, since the sentence in question is based on an alleged crime - adultery - that is only classed as such in the case of women, and not in the case of men.
It is not sufficient, therefore, to call for compliance with the international legislation regarding the death penalty against minors, nor even to urge all of the countries maintaining that practice to consign it to judicial and political history.
In this case, we must also present this situation as one of blatant sexism, or one of selective killings on behalf of a patriarchy, which comes to the same thing.
What we are dealing with when it comes to this kind of sentence that only affects women is a situation in which less value is attached to the lives of women compared to those of men.
That is not acceptable in Sudan or in any other country of the world.
I am therefore delighted with the extremely high degree of consensus on this resolution and I hope that it will contribute not just to putting an end to the death penalty but also to the practice of valuing the lives of men and women differently.
author. - (NL) Mr President, even in the days when the current state of Sudan was still known as Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, the question was whether this very extensive area with very different peoples should gain independence as one state.
A united state would mainly be the state of the Arabic people in the north, the east and the centre, because it would be difficult for the black Islamic people in the east and the black Christian and animistic people in the south to secure an equivalent position.
These areas, which were far less developed, were at a fair distance from the sea and were largely unknown to the international community.
Eventually, they were ignored by everyone.
After years of war, a compromise appeared to have been struck for the non-Islamic south that had been given self-government and a representation in the central government.
As we know, this is not the case for Darfur that is located to the west.
Fundamentalism is a prevailing force among the dominating Arabic people, and particularly among those who wield power and administer justice, with capital punishment, even stoning, for offences including adultery being the worst outward signs of this.
The resolution rightly draws attention to international agreements and the need to abolish capital punishment.
Sufficient attention must be given to this area, for the situation facing Sudan is a terrible one.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PL) Mr President, the conflict in Sudan, which has continued for over 50 years, has claimed at least 2 million victims.
The breakthrough in one of the bloodiest wars in contemporary Africa came when a peace agreement was signed in Nairobi in 2005.
However, the conflict continues in Darfur, in the western part of the country.
To date, this conflict has resulted in 400 000 deaths and has displaced 2 million people.
The inhabitants of this province are victims of the most serious crisis in the world today.
They have no food, water or healthcare.
The situation in Darfur has been critical for four years.
The European Union has yet to take any effective steps to force the government in Khartoum to stop committing war crimes and crimes against humanity.
The latest reports on the execution of minors in Sudan is additional confirmation of the fact that this country has, once again, infringed human rights.
Although Sudan has signed many international agreements, including the Cotonou agreement, it flagrantly disregards them.
We can no longer simply express our concern regarding the situation in Sudan, as European foreign ministers have done for the last three years in nineteen declarations on this issue.
The time has come for effective economic sanctions, which would show the Sudanese leaders that their campaign of mass violence against their own citizens has a real price.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (LT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the four-year war in Darfur gives little hope that human rights will be observed in countries at war.
Although the appropriate documents have been signed, the commitments made have not been honoured.
During the military conflict in Darfur about 200 000 people have perished, and 2.5 million of the province's people have become homeless.
The country is rife with chaos and governmental self-indulgence.
I would like to draw attention to the conditions which continue to provoke military conflict and allow for human rights breaches in Sudan.
Whose arms are being used for the fighting in Darfur?
According to Amnesty International, arms are being supplied to Darfur by China and Russia, although they deny it and have supported the UN Security Council resolution prohibiting the delivery of arms to Darfur.
In addition, China has many energy and raw material interests in Sudan.
They come to take profits and, it would appear, the unstable situation is to their advantage.
Resolution of the conflict and rebuilding of human rights in Sudan will depend on the EU's cooperation with interested parties and international organisations, and their commitments, which these countries are not honouring.
Mr President, Sudan's human rights record remains a cause of extreme concern to the European Commission and the EU, especially in consideration of the insecure and extremely volatile situation still existing in marginalised areas such as Darfur.
Almost two years after signing the comprehensive peace agreement, the Sudanese Government is falling far short of many of the human rights commitments made under the CPA and the internal interim national constitution, signed by the President of the Republic in July 2005.
Within the international community, European efforts to improve civilian protection in Sudan focus simultaneously on both security and political civilian actions.
Since 2005 the Commission has funded approximately 35 projects aimed at promoting human rights and democracy in Sudan with a total budget of about EUR 6 million.
With regard to the cases of the two women mentioned in Parliament's resolution, I can assure the honourable Members of Parliament that the European Union and the Commission are following the case very closely.
This case was first raised by the heads of missions meeting in the Netherlands in mid-March and it was followed by the EU Troika on 27 March, composed of representatives from Germany, Greece and the Commission.
More recently the EU raised the issue at the last Advisory Council on Human Rights meeting on 16 April.
The Court of Appeal ordered that case be returned to the court of origin - the al-Gezira State Court - to be looked into again.
Although we remain firmly opposed to the death penalty, the fact that the case has been sent for retrial is at least positive and we hope that the women will be given a fair trial in line with international human rights standards.
The last case which we are discussing now is the case of two boys aged 16 years old sentenced to death by hanging.
Various Member States and the Commission have raised this issue with the German Embassy and are waiting for the EU Presidency to take the lead on this issue in the days to come.
If not, the Commission intends to raise this issue directly in a letter to the Sudanese authorities such as the Minister of Justice and the Advisory Council on Human Rights.
The next meeting of EU-Sudan political dialogue with the Advisory Council on Human Rights will be in early June and this could be a good opportunity to raise this case again.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at the end of the debates.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - How is this still going on?
There have been so many genocides in the past 100 years and each time we say it will never happen again.
But we know it is happening right now in Darfur, and the world knows it is happening - so why are we so powerless to stop it?
In my own country of Ireland we have been able to silence the gun and bring communities together that we never thought imaginable.
So why are we so unable to make headway in this part of the world?
To answer this question, we need to look at the situation in Darfur in a different way.
If the world's sympathy and our resolutions could bring peace and relief to the people of Sudan it would have arrived long ago.
We can continue to call on an unresponsive government in Sudan to change its ways, or we can look at why the support for its intransigence continues.
We must cut the lifelines that are fuelling the destruction in Darfur, lifelines like Chinese oil money and Russian weapons.
Until we are willing to stand up to these powers our resolutions will remain impotent and ineffective.

The situation concerning the President of the World Bank
The next item is the debate on four motions for resolutions on the situation concerning the President of the World Bank.
(DE) Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of my group.
Under the Rules of Procedure, three debates on human rights issues are held within one hour on Thursday afternoon - and solely on cases of violations of human rights, democracy and the rule of law.
This is a fourth debate, and it has nothing to do with democracy or human rights.
Therefore, we are of the opinion that this constitutes an infringement of the Rules of Procedure - which not even the Conference of Presidents may disregard.
Thus my group formally proposes that this item be discontinued immediately.
I take note of your statement, Mr Posselt.
Since the Conference of Presidents, in full knowledge of the facts, has decided to schedule four topics for debate today, I can do no more than take note of your statement and forward it to the President, who will consider how best to respond to it.
That having been said, this item clearly cannot be carried forward.
You are familiar with the rules, according to which items not taken today under the heading of debates on matters of topical and urgent importance lapse, and so, if you are absolutely insistent on this item not being discussed today, it will lapse and will not be taken forward to the mini-session.
Mr President, on a point of order, you said that the Conference of Presidents had decided this under the Rules of Procedure.
Could you tell me under which rule they were enabled to extend this item to have four rather than three debates?
Mr President, there has been a decision by the Conference of Presidents to follow this particular procedure.
These matters have been placed on the agenda and I think that we should continue.
I do not see why we are prevented from continuing our work.
(FR) It may well be, Mr President, that we read the Rules of Procedure in a different way ...
In any case, as I read Rule 115, which allows these points of order to be put together under the heading of urgent business, the rule of law does actually have a part to play and, if the Conference of Presidents has ruled that, in its opinion, this resolution could be fitted in under this heading of our order of business, it may well be because the situation that has come about within the World Bank raises questions pertaining to the rule of law and of the way in which the law is applied within that institution.
(DE) Mr President, as has already been said, the Rules of Procedure speak of three subjects - no one can disregard this.
As my fellow Member has just mentioned, the matter itself has already been resolved by the resignation of the World Bank President.
There is no reason whatsoever to address this matter, as the man concerned has taken the appropriate action.
The Rules of Procedure state the number three, and we have already discussed three subjects.
Even the Conference of Presidents cannot disregard this.
Ladies and gentlemen, the situation is as follows.
As they stand, our Rules of Procedure permit the listing of three items on the agenda for debates on violations of human rights, democracy and the rule of law; the Conference of Presidents has proposed four of them, and the plenary of our House accepted this on Monday without any objection being made.
It can be contested under Rule 167, by moving the inadmissibility of a matter, but this has to be done twenty-four hours before the debates.
In view of the fact that the Conference of Presidents, which is acquainted with the Rules of Procedure, made the proposal to the plenary, which did not object, I do not see how I could, today, go against the plenary's decision on Monday, not least in view of the fact that you have not submitted your request within the prescribed time.
(DE) Mr President, it is possible, however, to propose the discontinuation of an item at the start of the debate - and that is what I have done.
Mr Posselt, I shall quote from the Rule: 'The intention to move adjournment shall be notified at least twenty-four hours in advance to the President, who shall inform Parliament immediately.'
I very much regret it, but I am obliged to apply this Rule.
You are perfectly entitled to demand that this item be withdrawn; you were able to do so when the agenda was adopted on Monday.
I would remind you that nobody in this House on Monday objected to the agenda as proposed by the Conference of Presidents, and the period in which the withdrawal of this item could be requested has, unfortunately, expired.
I really am very sorry, but I cannot decree that the plenary was wrong on Monday, and what I propose to do now is to move on to this debate, which, I can assure you, will be very brief, as very few Members have put themselves down to speak in it.
author. - (NL) Mr President, appointing of the President of the World Bank should not be the privilege of the leader of the state with the largest package of shares, which has been the case to date.
There was no need to compare the United States candidate to other candidates, or to weigh them up against each other, and there is one man who decides who the US candidate shall be.
Wolfowitz was not the choice of those most closely involved in the World Bank, but the American President, George W. Bush's, and his alone.
To Bush, he was a faithful ally, to others, an accident-prone person who always makes unsuccessful attempts at pursuing the wrong policy.
He was a very controversial man when he took up office in the World Bank and has not really ceased to be one now that he is leaving it.
Showing favouritism towards his fiancÃ©e was not an inadvertent mistake, but the justification needed to put an end to his headstrong and unacceptable way of going about things.
These mistakes should not be repeated when his successor is chosen.
A transparent appointment procedure with public hearings for candidates is very much what is called for.
author. - (FR) Mr President, 60 years after the implementation of the Bretton Woods system, something clearly has to change.
Two years after Mr Wolfowitz's arrival at the World Bank - and we all remember the conditions under which he was appointed and of which the previous speaker reminded us, whereby Mr Wolfowitz was obliged to come and explain himself to EU representatives meeting at Ecofin - it could be said that Europeans made the mistake of being right too early.
Two years on, we find ourselves in a situation that has weakened not only the World Bank but also the entire international regulatory system, at a time when we really need it to be equal to its tasks.
I would urge the EU - and this is the point of the resolution we are proposing - in future to meet its responsibilities in full and prove capable of proposing changes to the Bretton Woods system, in order to enhance the system of nominations, which currently ensures neither the legitimacy, transparency nor credibility of the person in charge of an institution as important as the World Bank.
In this regard, the International Monetary Fund, for example, operates a system in which there is a degree of competition between the candidates and a certain amount of publicity, and this strikes me as a more acceptable system.
In order to obtain something similar, we need to hold exhaustive negotiations with our US partners, covering all aspects of the issue.
We made this point in the resolution we adopted last month and, with this in mind, we call on the current German and forthcoming Portuguese Presidencies to consider proposals that the EU might like to put on the table.
For the appointment of Mr Wolfowitz's successor, Europeans will hopefully have the opportunity to hold a hearing with the selected candidate, prior to that person's confirmation.
Lastly, we regret the fact that Mr Barroso acted as host to Mr Wolfowitz during the time when the latter's post at the head of the World Bank was under review.
author. - Mr President, Mr Wolfowitz belongs to the powerful Iraq War Bush gang.
It was therefore no surprise to anyone that in June 2005 Uncle Sam appointed him to the lucrative post of President of the World Bank.
What was surprising was the sheer audacity exhibited by this individual in provocatively arranging a generous pay increase for his girlfriend, and even more surprising was the shameless way in which he fought to stay in office, despite the worldwide outcry against him.
Needless to say, during this fight he had the full backing of President Bush, himself not unaccustomed to shameful behaviour.
The Wolfowitz affair may now be over, but the stench associated with the Bush Administration's corrupt and evil running of the world remains firmly stuck to our nasal smell receptors.
Let us hope and pray that, for the sake of the American people as well as for the rest of the world, soon enough Mr Bush and his warmongering associates will also find their way out of office.
In adopting this motion for a resolution, we wish the World Bank good riddance to Mr Wolfowitz, and may better days ensue.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when Mr Wolfowitz was appointed to the head of the World Bank, our Parliament, through its Committee on Development, sent an open letter listing in detail all the problems liable to be created by an appointment made in this way, both in terms of governance and therefore the rule of law and from an international point of view.
Events have proven that initiative to be right, unfortunately it remained isolated within the European Union, given that neither the Commission nor the members of the Council have ever had a real desire to commit themselves to developing a European position on the Bretton Woods institutions.
I believe that the next few weeks hold a challenge for us: to demonstrate and try to convince the Member States, but also the Commission, to act on this issue, without pretending that the matter does not concern us; without a European voice, this kind of procedure will remain unchanged.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Paul Wolfowitz is stepping down as President of the World Bank at the end of June.
The impetus for his resignation came primarily from Canada and Europe, as we justifiably feared a loss of confidence in the World Bank.
The principles of democracy, transparency and accountability of public institutions called for time and again by the outgoing World Bank President must also apply to the operations and decision processes of the World Bank itself.
Like many of my fellow Members, I welcome the resignation of Paul Wolfowitz, a leading neoconservative and one of the main proponents of the war in Iraq.
Like many others, I regret that this decision is somewhat belated.
Of course, today's discussion and resolution do not concern only Paul Wolfowitz personally.
What is more important is to avoid making the same mistakes in future and to seek much better selection procedures.
We would ask the German and Portuguese Presidencies to present proposals on behalf of the Union for making the selection of executives of the Bretton Woods Institutions more democratic, more transparent and more responsible in future.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, the resolution talks about the Wolfowitz affair in terms of 'the World Bank's failure to live up to the globally shared standards of transparency and democracy'.
What utter humbug!
Any standards of transparency and democracy in the world are practised on a strictly limited basis, and the European Union hardly sets an example.
Mr Wolfowitz has been hounded out of office by those opposed to his anti-corruption agenda.
The worst thing that the executive directors of the Bank could find to say against him was that 'a number of mistakes were made'.
If Mr Wolfowitz's worst offence was giving his girlfriend a job, then it would hardly qualify as a minor error of judgement compared to the legendary levels of nepotism and corruption that the European Union has been guilty of over the years and the usual levels of corruption associated with the World Bank.
Mr Wolfowitz wanted to clean it up and now he will not be able to, but it is an ill wind that cannot be used by the European Union to its advantage.
This brings me to paragraph 6 of the resolution that calls for the Commission to have observer status at the Bank and for it to attend and intervene at certain councils.
The key phrase here is 'pending legal personality for the Union'.
That legal personality depends on the ratification of the European Constitution that the European Union intends to stuff down the throats of the peoples of Europe whether they want it or not.
President Bush should nominate a new head of the World Bank whose girlfriend or boyfriend already has a job and who will either clean it up or close it down, and he should make sure that the European Union is let nowhere near it in the meantime!
Member of the Commission. Mr President, the Commission understands the European Parliament's concerns about the situation at the World Bank before Mr Wolfowitz's resignation.
However, unlike the Member States, the Commission is not a shareholder in the Bank; it is not a member of the Board of Directors and can only take note of Mr Wolfowitz's decision to resign.
The Commission calls on the Bank and its members to begin discussions to designate a successor to ensure continuity and stability in the leadership of the Bank.
The World Bank plays a crucial role in development.
The Commission looks forward to a continuing strong role for the World Bank and to continuing its good cooperation with this institution in development efforts.
Before I close the debate, I should like to make the following statement.
I understand why Members of this Chamber were surprised and perplexed to see that we had four points for this afternoon's debate instead of three, as laid down by the Rules of Procedure.
What happened was something of a divergence between two entirely legitimate perspectives: namely, what is laid down in the Rules of Procedure and what Monday's Conference of Presidents was seeking, which was validated in plenary.
I therefore call on the President of Parliament to ensure that the Chair will never again be faced with such a problem. The Chair had to do his best to respond to the Chamber's astonishment, which is understandable given the conflict we have seen today between two sources of legitimacy.
Please do not think that your points of view have gone unheard. They will be followed up, and the necessary conclusions will be drawn.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at the end of this afternoon's debates, that is to say right now.

Human rights in Syria (vote)
Motion for a resolution
- Before the vote
(DE) Mr President, we should have liked to insert:
'Calls for the abrogation of the state of emergency in Syria established more than 40 years ago'.
(DE) as paragraph 6(a).
Are there any objections to the inclusion of this oral amendment?
(FR) Mr President, please note that I find the number of MEPs present needed to oppose the oral amendment utterly preposterous this Thursday afternoon.
Indeed, more people than the total number here in the Chamber are needed to vote against. I am not sure there are even 40 people here in favour of this oral amendment.
I cannot oppose the oral amendment itself, but I am firmly opposed to the procedure.
I should like you to take note of this.
Let me remind you of the rule. The number of people required to oppose the adoption of an oral amendment is always the same regardless of when we vote and of the time, the day and the place of the vote.
To propose an amendment, however, requires just one single MEP.
You can call for a quorum, but there is a procedure, a different procedure, for that.
Yet if you ask to verify the quorum and the quorum has not been reached, I should like to remind you that this vote will not be adjourned because it is an emergency vote.
The text will lapse, and there will not be a vote on it.
That is the rule.
Mr President, it is not the Rules of Procedure that are wrong but the fact that colleagues from our groups leave early.
They should be here to vote!
(Applause)
(The oral amendment was accepted)
That concludes the vote.

Statements by the President (membership of Parliament; ETA)
Ladies and gentlemen, it is a great joy for me to be able to welcome today 18 fellow Members from Bulgaria - the first directly elected MEPS - to this House, and thus into our midst.
(Applause)
The citizens of Bulgaria went to the polls on 20 May 2007 and elected their representatives to the European Parliament in a democratic process.
This was an important day for Bulgaria, which joined the European Union on 1 January. It completes Bulgaria's integration into the European family after the fall of communism.
It took over 60 years for Bulgaria to be restored to a free Europe and for our continent to be reunited.
Bulgaria's culture is an ancient one, and the country is situated at a crossing point between East and West.
It is claimed to be the site of one of the oldest countries in Europe, founded in 681.
Bulgaria is the country of Orpheus and Eurydice, the home of the Thracians and of Dionysus.
It brings with it a rich cultural and intellectual heritage, and will thus contribute to the mutual enrichment of the European Union and Bulgaria.
Particular thanks are due to Bulgaria, and especially its people, for their efforts over recent years and the willingness to undertake reforms.
Great progress has been made, and many reforms were accomplished in a relatively short period of time.
It is now up to our new fellow Members to help ensure that the reforms that remain necessary are implemented with the same determination.
I wish you a speedy, successful integration into the work of the European Parliament so that, with your work and efforts, you are able to make a constructive contribution for the benefit of your voters and of Europe.
You will be the voice of Bulgarian citizens in the European Parliament, and will represent their interests.
Let us work together on the further development of our European community!
(Applause)
Ladies and gentlemen, in agreement with the chairmen of the groups and the whole of the European Parliament - and seeing Mrs DÃŒhrkop DÃŒhrkop in our midst - I should like to make the following statement on behalf of this House.
The terrorist organisation ETA has declared the 'ceasefire' announced on 22 March 2006 at an end.
I should like to express my solidarity with the entire Spanish nation and its democratic institutions in these difficult times.
Parliament firmly condemns the use of violence as a means to any end.
Today, more than ever, Parliament appeals to all Member States to be determined in their support for the Spanish authorities in their fight against terrorism.
This is a fight that can only be carried out on the basis of the rule of law, with the full force of the law and strong democratic institutions.
We remember the victims of terrorism at this time, with whom we stand in sympathy and solidarity.
(Applause)

Mr President, I would like to address a very brief request to you as President of this House.
I should like you to ask the Mayor of Moscow, Mr Luzhkov, for clarification on the treatment of two MEPs - Mr Cappato and myself; a member of the German Bundestag, Mr Volker Beck, and a member of the Italian Parliament, Ms Vladimir Luxuria, on 27 May.
On the occasion of a peaceful action for equal rights for gay people, we wanted to hand over a letter to the Mayor of Moscow signed by nearly 50 Members of this House.
Mr Cappato, Mr Beck and an ALDE Group official were violently attacked by hooligans and then arrested by the Russian police.
Two of the Russian activists who were arrested are here today - Mr Nikolaj Aleksejev and Mr Nikolaj Khramov.
The police equally failed to protect Ms Luxuria and myself from an angry crowd and the police stood by watching as other activists were beaten up by thugs, skinheads and even priests.
As Members of Parliament not engaged in any illegal activity, we would expect the Russian authorities to protect us against violent criminals, and certainly not to arrest us on dubious grounds.
Freedom of assembly is a basic human right that must be observed by Russia as well, being a Member of the Council of Europe and present at the G8 Summit today.
Mr President, I trust you will ask Mr Luzhkov and Mr Putin for an explanation on the way that Members of this House were treated.
(Applause)
Many thanks, Mrs in 't Veld.
We shall take the steps you propose and do what is necessary.
I declare our solidarity with you.

Middle East (debate)
The next item is the debate on the Middle East, with statements by the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy and by the Commission.
Mr President, we, as Members of the European Parliament, have decided to express our solidarity vis-Ã -vis our Palestinian colleagues imprisoned by Israel.
Symbolically, 45 MEPs demonstrated this support by collectively sponsoring the 45 Palestinian Members of Parliament.
As elected representatives, we cannot but condemn the imprisonment of the President and of one third of the Members of the Palestinian Legislative Council.
We ask for their immediate and unconditional release.
We continue to appeal for a European Parliament delegation to be sent and for all the necessary steps to be taken in order to achieve this aim.
(Applause)
I must inform the honourable Member that last Wednesday - a week ago today - I made a similar request to the Knesset.
Making such a request before the Knesset is something that takes a great deal of prior thought.
Let us hope that we reach a solution on all the issues, including the release of the three captured Israeli soldiers and the BBC journalist Alan Johnston.
Movement is needed on all sides.
High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy. (ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by saying that exactly a week ago, the Quartet was meeting in Berlin.
Since I am sure that you will have read the document that was made public that same evening, you may be aware of our solidarity with the Members of the Palestinian Authority, of the Parliament, who have been detained and, as the President of this Parliament has quite rightly said, with the other people who have been detained against their will in Israeli or Palestinian territories.
Mr President, I would like to make a brief statement.
I have been asked to speak for no longer than 10 or 15 minutes - I shall try to do so I would like to tell you that I have just returned from a long journey throughout the region, and I have been able to meet with the most important regional leaders and to carry out an analysis of the situation so that I could report also to the Quartet, which met last Wednesday.
I was pleased to make that trip at more or less the same time as the President of Parliament, with whom I spoke by telephone, and also a distinguished group of MEPs, who have written me a letter to which I have not yet replied.
I would like to meet with them personally, because, please believe me, I have not been in Brussels for a single day since then.
I shall see if I can do so so that I can meet with you to talk calmly about the issues that you have raised, which I believe to be extremely important.
Mr President, I believe that this sitting is of particular importance.
It is also being held on a very important date for Palestine, for Israel and for the citizens of the world in general, and of the Arab world in particular.
It is currently the 40th anniversary of the outbreak of the 1967 war, the many tragic consequences of which we are still suffering.
When we look at the last forty years, it undoubtedly sends a shudder right through us.
They have been forty years of occupation, of suffering on both sides, of violence, during which the citizens - both Palestinians and Israelis - have suffered greatly, and also forty years during which there have been an excess of Israeli settlements in the occupied territories.
Given this forty-year situation, we have two opportunities or ways to look at the situation: to look back in order to try to learn lessons regarding mistakes that must not be repeated or to look forward and try to see whether we can learn the most important lesson of all - that the only solution to this conflict that has now lasted for forty years is peace.
A rapid peace process that leads rapidly to peace.
There have been many processes, many opportunities for peace have been missed.
I believe that we should now all have the will - the will to act, not just the will to think and speak, but the will to act - so that we can truly make peace a reality in those lands that are so dear to many of us and to Europeans in general.
I would therefore like to look forward, but I must make a brief comment on this journey, since the areas that I have visited are all areas which are unfortunately not enjoying the best of times at the moment.
In the occupied territories, in Palestine, we are witnessing a difficult situation, with violence amongst Palestinians and also renewed violence between Israel and Palestine.
The parties' appeals for a ceasefire have not been heard, either in Palestine or between Palestine and Israel.
I would like to send an appeal today to everybody with responsibilities in this area for a ceasefire as soon as possible, so that a favourable climate can be created for progressing towards peace.
I had the opportunity to visit Gaza. So did the President of Parliament.
Visiting Gaza at the moment is a truly significant experience.
This is not the first time I have been to Gaza, but I believe that going there at this point in particular and meeting with the President of the Palestinian Authority was a moral obligation in order not to give the impression that the world has completely forgotten about what is happening in Gaza.
Gaza is in a difficult situation, with violence between Palestinians, violence which will lead nowhere if it continues.
The first thing we must do is therefore to try to quell that violence, to bring about a ceasefire, so that the Palestinians can finally begin to work together for a common cause, which is of course peace: peace with their neighbours and peace amongst themselves.
We are doing everything we can in relation to that policy, both from my position and from the position of the Commission, which is helping generously.
I would like to tell you that the situation in Palestine, from economic and social points of view, is a dramatic one.
I therefore believe that, as soon as this period is over and we can meet again with the political leaders in a clearer and more transparent way, we shall have to think about drawing up a special plan of aid for Gaza. Otherwise we may be faced with a truly difficult situation in Gaza, and it will be difficult to recover for the purposes of a genuine peace process.
I would also like to say that I believe that President Abbas's solemn appeal yesterday, on the anniversary of the beginning of the 1967 war, deserves to be read and analysed by everybody, because it shows a moral courage that is worthy of note.
I would like to say that I was also in Israel.
I met with the Prime Minister, with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and I was also in Sderot, the area suffering the most Kassam rocket attacks. I also felt it appropriate to express our solidarity European solidarity with all of those suffering any kind of violence, including Kassam rocket attacks.
It was a difficult and tough place to be, but in any event, experiencing it on the ground gives us a clearer picture of what is happening.
In our statement last Wednesday, the members of the Quartet called upon Israel to show restraint.
Israel is also experiencing a difficult political situation.
The primary elections in the Labour Party are not yet over - they are about to conclude - and we shall see what form the next government takes, if there are any changes, after the elections in the Israeli Labour Party.
I would also like to say that the Quartet's statement contains a clear - and vigorous - appeal for Israel to transfer resources to the Palestinian authorities.
The international community can do a lot, and we are doing a lot in fact. We Europeans are probably doing more than anybody.
The Arab countries have also started to give money to the Finance Minister, Salam Fallad, and today we can say that the possibility is beginning to emerge of creating a budget for the Palestinian National Authority.
Without the transfer of resources from Israel to Palestine, however, there is little else the international community can do.
Improving the economic conditions is essentially linked to a transfer of resources from Israel to the Palestinians.
I would like to make a few brief comments on the Quartet and then on Lebanon.
I believe that the meeting of the Quartet last Wednesday in Berlin was, in my experience - and we have belonged to the Quartet for many years since I participated in setting it up - surely one of the most important meetings we have held so far.
It was a Quartet in which we were able to give serious thought to how the peace process can be implemented.
If you read the final paragraph of the Statement you will see that it truly looks to the future and commits the members of the Quartet to beginning to work hard, in cooperation with the parties - Israel, Palestine and Arab States - to initiate a peace process, to initiate a process with a political outlook.
I would like to inform you that, for the first time in its history, the Quartet is going to make a joint visit to the region, it is going to hold a meeting over the coming weeks with the Palestinians and with the Israelis and it is also going to hold a meeting with the Arab countries, who I believe, with the Arab peace initiative, are also cooperating in the beginnings of a normalisation of life - or the beginning of the possibility of normalisation - in the territories between Israel and Palestine.
I therefore believe that, at this time of dejection amongst many people, of dejection amongst the Palestinians and also within a certain sector of Israeli society, the international community, by means of the Quartet, is reacting in the opposite manner: It is reacting with hope, with the sense that, after forty years, we have the moral obligation to make every possible effort to make progress towards the formalisation of peace, towards a peace process.
I would like to say to you that these coming weeks are going to be absolutely crucial in terms of setting in train a movement that can take us from the current situation to a peace process that leads to peace.
It is not so difficult to identify the elements that can lead this process to peace.
Almost all of us have a notion of the parameters required in order to achieve peace.
What we now need to do is to get to work on it in cooperation with all of the members of the Quartet.
I would like to stress that the Secretary-General of the United Nations, the US Secretary of State and the Russian Foreign Affairs Minister were very cooperative with regard to our proposal, and they expressed clear support for the ideas that it was my privilege to present to the Quartet on Europe's behalf.
We are therefore at an extremely significant crossroads, ladies and gentlemen, in terms of the situation on the ground, but also a positive crossroads in terms of moving towards a peace process that we can begin to see sketched out on the horizon.
Ladies and gentlemen, I cannot let this speaking time that the Presidency has allowed me to go by without saying a few words about Lebanon.
Lebanon is once again in a situation of profound crisis.
The honourable Members are well aware of this.
These are moments of profound significance, and some of them have been going on for some time. From the murder of former Prime Minister Hariri, the whole situation that they experienced over the summer, the current situation of political paralysis, which has become even more serious with the movements that have emerged, with acts of terrorism, in the refugee camps, in two refugee camps, specifically: one in the north and the other in the south.
As you know, the Lebanese army has reacted in a way that I would describe as patriotic, and the support for the Lebanese army from all of Lebanon's political factions has also been patriotic, which is truly extraordinary given the differences that have existed amongst them over recent months, weeks and days.
We also hope and pray that peace will also come to Lebanon, and that the special circumstances that have arisen over recent days - which were also accompanied by the United Nations Security Council's approval of the International Criminal Court to try the crimes that were committed in Lebanon - will make it possible to reach an agreement amongst all of the political forces in order to unblock the political process in Lebanon.
That is what we want, and we are cooperating in the best possible to way in order to see it come about.
Mr President, I shall remain within the speaking time available to me and I would like to end by reiterating what I said at the beginning: we have a moment of hope, a moment that we must be able to exploit, which in one way or another must complete the circle that was begun forty years ago and which we hope to see completed by means of peace, by means of a life lived together by two States - Israel and Palestine.
That peace must include the other countries - Syria, Lebanon - so that we can see the re-emergence of a Middle East that can offer more hope to everybody, which is prosperous and which makes a constructive contribution to peace throughout the region.
We Europeans cannot close our eyes to this task and you may rest assured that mine at least will always be open.
(Applause)
Thank you, Dr Javier Solana, for your statement but also for your untiring work and deep commitment.
Let me say that my experiences were the same as yours.
We must not let ourselves be discouraged from continuing along the path of peace.
Mr President, as we all know and as Mr Solana has just said, the atmosphere in the region is extremely tense.
I would even say that there is even a sense of despair.
My director is still there and he has just called me.
Unfortunately, security has deteriorated and we are witnessing a vicious circle of violence, particularly in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, in Israel and in Lebanon, as Mr Solana has just said.
If the causes of this despair are not addressed, we may very soon witness the consolidation of more radical groups throughout the region.
I think this is the great danger there.
In Lebanon, as Mr Solana has just said, fighting has now spread to other Palestinian camps.
We are therefore deeply concerned that the confrontation between the Lebanese armed forces and the Islamist insurgents is there.
This has turned out to be the most serious internal conflict since the end of the civil war and has already cost over 100 human lives.
I would like to stress once again our full support for the legitimate government of Lebanon.
I would, however, repeat our position that everything possible has to be done to avoid further casualties among the civilian population.
The relief agencies must be able to carry out their work.
On the other hand, I would also like to express my satisfaction with the adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 1757, which secures the establishment of a special tribunal on the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri.
I think this will allow the people of Lebanon to affirm respect for the law and the rule of law in their country and to turn a page on one of the most tragic events in Lebanon's recent history.
The meeting due to take place in Gaza tomorrow between President Abbas and Prime Minister Olmert has unfortunately been cancelled, but at least the leaders of the G8 will tomorrow be tackling the issue of the Palestine-Israeli conflict, as we did at the G8 Foreign Ministers' meeting.
There was the greatest concern about the political and security developments both in Gaza and in Israel, but also recognition that there is no alternative to continuing this humanitarian support and, on the other hand, to exploring how to support this Arab peace initiative.
Even at this very delicate and difficult time, we believe that there is still some reason for hope, because the Israeli initiative is a unique opportunity for a comprehensive solution.
We know that the Egyptians too are trying to broker a ceasefire with all the Palestinian factions.
US involvement, particularly the involvement of Condoleezza Rice, is very valuable at this difficult time.
Our EU Presidency is also very committed.
The Quartet has done exactly as Mr Solana has said, I think it was a very good meeting and the idea is there for both the bilateral track and the regional track.
Hopefully the meeting can come about in Egypt with Arab League interlocutors and hopefully also with the two parties.
Two days ago I spoke to the Jordanian Foreign Minister, Mr Abdel Ilah Al-Khatib, who is planning, with his Egyptian counterpart, to visit Israel before the Arab League meets with the Quartet at the end of June.
We hope that this will help to further engage Israel and encourage it to respond positively to the Arab peace initiative.
Last week I also attended a conference in Vienna on the role of women leaders as contributors to peace and security in the Middle East.
Prominent women, such as Tzipi Livni, Hanan Ashrawi, Condoleezza Rice and others, discussed the potential contribution of civil society, of women in society, to peace.
Even if it is a small contribution, this was the first time that Tzipi Livni and Hanan Ashrawi had held discussions at the same table.
I must say that there was quite a lot of mutual understanding and there was even a friendly atmosphere.
The initiative proved to be another useful part of this very difficult process.
I plan to organise some sort of follow-up meeting in Brussels, perhaps next year.
We very much appreciate the European Parliament's involvement: the visit by the EP Delegation for Relations with the Palestinian Legislative Council was followed by your visit, Mr President, and by your very balanced speech in the Knesset on 30 May.
It is encouraging that the speech, as you said, was quite well received by the Knesset.
This is not an easy opportunity.
The Palestinian people desperately need a political perspective.
We, the members of the Quartet, are all clear on that.
This is why we must press for negotiations on a final status issue, cooperating with the structures set up by the Arab League.
The Arab League asked Israel to free certain measures also related to the occupation, for instance the settlements and the separation barrier.
I was very encouraged by President Abbas's call for an immediate end to this internal violence, because Qassam rockets from Gaza have to stop once and for all.
The ceasefire should indeed be extended to the West Bank.
I very much regret that tomorrow's meeting between Prime Minister Olmert and President Abbas had to be cancelled, but we apparently have to realise that the two sides could not reach agreement on Abbas's plan for a ceasefire, in particular on linking the ceasefire in Gaza with the cessation of military operations in the West Bank.
No agreement was possible, either, on unfreezing Palestinian clearance revenues withheld by Israel before the release of the kidnapped soldier Gilad Shalit.
We had hoped for some movement on this.
The Palestinians decided that they could not risk this meeting, but of course we had all hoped that this would give a little more progress on the dialogue on the ceasefire, progress on the transfer of revenues and on movement of access.
Regarding the National Unity Government, in my opinion now is certainly not the time to give up on it.
I can agree that it has not yet delivered everything we were hoping for, but there are no attractive alternatives.
If we allow this Government to crumble, the implications for the institutions of the Palestinian Authority are very grave and radical splinter groups may be strengthened as a result.
I think this is the last result we would want.
As you know, within the limits set by the Council of Ministers, the Commission has responded quickly to the National Unity Government and to the increased needs of the Palestinians.
In the first half of 2007 alone, we committed EUR 320 million of Community funds, which almost equals the total amount of funds committed last year.
This exceptional effort shows that, since the formation of the National Unity Government, we have stepped up our emergency assistance to the Palestinians.
But the financial situation of the Palestinian Authority is extremely grave, as Salam Fayyad told my colleague yesterday. They still need us to go on even with this mechanism.
Israel must release the withheld clearance revenue to the Palestinian Authority.
I think we therefore will have to go on encouraging them to do so via the temporary international mechanism or through the PLO account.
We reiterated this request at the last Association Committee with Israel in Jerusalem on 4 June.
The Quartet has also noted the importance of the resumption of transfers to improve economic and humanitarian conditions in the West Bank and Gaza.
As I said, movement is of course essential in any case.
Since the formation of this National Unity Government, we have been working very closely with the Minister of Finance.
Because the socio-economic situation is so dire, we will extend the TIM until 30 September and we must look for fresh funds for this new extension.
I will soon ask the European Parliament and the Council to make another effort and to find additional resources in the budget.
I thank you for whatever you have given as support in the past and do hope that this support will also be extended to us in the future, because our priority task should be to help restore the institutions of the Palestinian authority so that it can then deliver services to the Palestinian people.
We are trying gradually to shift towards a resumption of institution-building and development projects, and to decrease our current concentration on emergency and humanitarian aid if we can do so - of course, this condition is still there.
We look forward to new Palestinian proposals.
They said they would come up with ideas for specific international support.
The Palestinian Authority is currently preparing an operational plan which could then be a useful tool for identifying development activities, particularly in Gaza, that we could support.
I would also like to say that the financial deficit of the Palestinian Authority is so large that it would be impossible for the Community to shoulder the burden alone.
Arab States also have to deliver on their commitments to help the National Unity Government.
I was encouraged to see that the PLO account established now was at least used by Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.
This will help but it is not sufficient.
(Applause)
Thank you, Commissioner.
May I also thank you very sincerely, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, for your commitment to this difficult peace process - if we can still speak of a peace process.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (ES) Mr President, I would like firstly to thank the High Representative for his tireless efforts in the quest for peace, and you yourself, Mr President, for your visit to the region, for its symbolism and the solidarity it demonstrated; and Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, for the immense job that the European Commission is doing in the midst of a serious political crisis, with the factions making up the Government of National Unity now in confrontation and in the midst of an extremely serious social, economic and humanitarian crisis.
What can be done in this situation?
Little more than what Mrs Ferrero-Waldner and Mr Solana have told us, I believe: to redouble the European Union's diplomatic efforts and to act on the basis of two premises.
The first is a halt to the internal fighting between the two factions making up the Government of National Unity, which are waging a vicious battle for power, which is having a dramatic effect on the civilian population.
Secondly, Mr President - and we must also state this very clearly - a permanent and explicit commitment from the Government of National Unity to democracy and the renunciation of violence.
What can we do in the meantime, Mr President?
Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner has explained it very clearly: to try to apply the humanitarian aid mechanism as flexibly as possible, to increase the sums allocated to it and to redistribute it amongst the other priorities.
Mr President, the maximum sentence according to my country's Penal Code is thirty years and one day.
Mr Solana reminded us today that it is forty years since the Six Day War, which led to the occupation of Gaza, the West Bank and the Golan Heights.
And the situation remains stagnant and bogged down.
Forty years of suffering and death is more than a society - or two societies, as Mr Solana pointed out - can tolerate.
I believe that this Parliament must respond in a united fashion in support of the representatives of the Council and the Commission so that the European Union, within the international community in general and the Quartet in particular, can do everything possible to bring about - as Mr Solana and Mrs Ferrero-Waldner have said - a new opportunity for peace for a society and a region that has already suffered too much.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (IT) Mr President, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, Mr Solana, ladies and gentlemen, as has been pointed out, this debate is taking place on the 40th anniversary of the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza.
What was supposed to be a lightning strike has turned into a never-ending nightmare: 40 years is such a long time that entire generations of Palestinians have never known anything but occupation, humiliation, checkpoints and then the wall and almost total imprisonment.
Movement is now all but impossible in the occupied territories.
Over these 40 years, Israel has certainly not found the guarantees of security that it was looking for, either, and it has experienced worrying erosions of democracy and the rule of law.
These are two peoples exhausted by endless war and violence.
For our part, we would like to emphasise - as the Socialist Group in the European Parliament has long been saying quite clearly - that the only possible way to inject any form of a constructive approach into a constantly deteriorating situation is to openly support the Palestinian Government of National Unity.
We should add to that the commitment that the international community should consider making to send in a peace-keeping force to prevent the violence of recent weeks in Gaza from degenerating even further, to re-establish the basic conditions for people to lead normal lives and for international law to be respected, and above all to break the vicious circle of endless violence.
From Israel we expect gestures other than the murders and indiscriminate arrests that came in response to the Qassam rocket strikes on Sderot.
The occupation, the settlements, the wall and the status of Jerusalem are making the prospect of a two-State solution more unlikely every day, as even United Nations sources are now saying.
The United Nations, the United States, Russia, Europe and the entire international community have a responsibility to act before all chances of coexistence are gone for ever.
Lastly, I would remind you that there is an Arab plan that offers Israel a prospect of peace, not only with the Palestinians but with Arab countries as a whole.
That is something that needs addressing with more conviction.
Prime Minister Olmert himself said the other day that that plan could provide a basis for negotiations.
I hope he did not say so just because his government is particularly weak.
The situation in Lebanon is equally serious, as you have pointed out.
I believe that the UNIFIL forces on the ground should be supported and reinforced.
Lastly, we should like to call on President Poettering to take steps to call an extraordinary meeting of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) Mr President, High Representative, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, around this time, we commemorate the Six-Day War, which, on the one hand, established Israel's military supremacy, but which also ushered in the start of the occupation, confrontations, violence and endless bloodshed that have lasted 40 years.
Anyone in Israel who was born in the Occupied Territories after June 1967, in other words anyone who is 40 years or younger, has known nothing but uncertainty and anxiety about the future of their own country, their loved ones and their own lives.
After 40 years, it is really time to say enough is enough.
Peace should now be brokered as a matter of urgency: sustainable peace, on the basis that two countries recognise each other's right to exist and need to be left alone by their neighbouring countries.
All previous speakers have taken great pains to explain how complicated, difficult and complex this is but, ladies and gentlemen, there is one ingredient without which it will never work, namely political will and political courage.
Without the kind of political will and political courage that was evident at one time in South Africa, for example, in both camps, to end apartheid - a brutal regime - it will not work.
The unfortunate thing is that nobody can have political will and political courage for the protagonists.
It is they themselves who will need to muster this political will and this political courage.
Tomorrow, a human chain of Jews and Palestinians will be formed around the Berlaymont building who will all say together: 'After 40 years, we have really had enough.
After 40 years, we must work on peace.'
Sadly, though, the conflict between Israel and Palestine is not the only one fermenting trouble in the region.
Fresh violence has flared up in Lebanon, in which some see the hand of Syria, which wants to avoid an international Hariri tribunal at all costs.
On behalf of my group, I should like to welcome the decision by the UN Security Council, which has had the courage to say that such a tribunal will be set up.
As you know, this will be a mixed tribunal, involving both international and Lebanese judges and a mixed public prosecution, which will function according to the principles of Lebanese law.
In Lebanon, too, though, political courage will be needed in all camps finally to give the Lebanese what they are entitled to as well: peace and security.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - Mr President, I should like to thank the High Representative and the Commissioner for their presentations here today.
Rather than speak about all the countries in such a short time, I shall concentrate on Palestine, because everything that happens in every other part of the Middle East relates to the situation in Israel and Palestine.
Looking at the debates that took place at the special session of the UN Security Council 40 years ago in 1967, after the start of the Six-Day War, it is interesting to see that the potential solution or plan considered was a guarantee of Israeli security and borders based on a withdrawal by Israeli forces from the Occupied Territories and a two-state solution.
Forty years later, the Quartet has failed to deliver on what should be the simplest of all goals: to bring people around to this way of thinking.
We have made mistakes at European level with our negative reaction to the election of the Hamas Government in Palestine, which sent out the wrong signal, allowing radical groups to take control on the ground and leading people to say 'There is no point in voting for these people or bringing these people in because the Europeans will cut off the money'.
That is why it was so important, as the Commissioner rightly said, that funding was restored through the emergency mechanism.
That work must continue, because only by building relations and building dialogue between the peoples can we guarantee that there will be a resolution.
That resolution must be predicated on the same principles as 40 years ago: a two-state solution, a guarantee of secure borders and justice and equity for all peoples in Israel and in Palestine.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (ES) Israel won the Six Day War, but it has lost the peace with forty years of occupation.
We are now seeing a dangerous tendency towards the Iraqisation and tribalisation of violence in the Middle East.
The emergence of Fatah al-Islam in the Palestinian camps in Lebanon and the increasing fragmentation of the civil conflicts in Gaza do not bode well for the future of the region.
We are seeing the impact of the Palestinian problem spreading throughout the Middle East and becoming mixed up with the interests of the different players.
We are running the risk of hitting rock bottom very soon.
Are we going to wait around doing nothing until the Palestinian Authority collapses?
As I have said, we cannot allow that to happen.
How can we ensure that it will not?
Is the chaos and violence of war by everybody against everybody a 'death foretold'?
Gaza cannot wait any longer.
The European Union cannot carry on turning its back on the democratically-elected Government of National Unity.
This European policy has contributed to the popular discrediting of any hint of moderation on the part of Hamas and Fatah, because it demonstrates that the acceptance of the Mecca Agreement does nothing to change the embargo or improve the terrible living conditions in the huge prison known as Gaza.
Firstly, the European Union must begin a dialogue with all of the parties, including Hamas, in order to promote a stable unity government.
Secondly, we must restore direct financial aid to the Palestinian Authority and ensure that Israel returns the money from Palestinian taxes that it is keeping.
Finally, we must work to extend the Gaza ceasefire to the West Bank, with the creation of international guarantees, sending European and Arab troops under a UN mandate to Gaza and, if necessary, to the West Bank.
At the same time, we are calling for the release of the forty-five Members of Parliament and of the Israeli Gilad Shalit and for a halt to the launching of Kassam rockets and Israel's devastating responses.
(Applause from the left)
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FR) Mr President, Mr Solana, Commissioner, my group was very keen to hold this debate, particularly today, 40 years after the start of a war to which the international community, including the European Union, has shown itself to this day incapable of imposing the only just and lasting solution, that is, an end to the occupation, to the colonisation, to the oppression by Israel of the Palestinian territories conquered in 1967.
Mr President, I welcomed, in their form and substance, the strong words you spoke about this in the Knesset on 30 May.
I particularly remember three key sentences from your speech.
You stated that, 'international law is binding on us all'.
You are right.
We ask no more of Israel than that it should respect the Security Council resolutions, the Geneva Conventions, the opinions of the International Court of Justice and humanitarian law, as the United Nations Organisation (UNO) has just pointed out.
The violations of the law are flagrant, constant and massive.
They are in relation to settlements, refugees, prisoners, the wall and, primarily of course, the occupation of the territories and the annexation of East Jerusalem.
You have also pointed out, Mr President, that, I quote: 'a two-state solution on the basis of the 1967 borders is and remains the only way to a satisfactory solution'.
It is a fundamental truth.
The multiplication of settlements, the construction of the wall, the isolation of Palestinian areas of Jerusalem, however, serve precisely to make this solution impossible.
The Israeli authorities' disregard for the Arab League's peace plan confirms this strategy of making things worse.
You have rightly reminded us, Mr President, of this obvious fact: there is no peace without justice.
The famous Israeli historian, Tom Segev, recently echoed the thoughts of those of his compatriots who, for 40 years, have believed that, I quote, 'in 1967, Israel laid the foundations for future terrorism'.
Great men of State, such as Yitzhak Rabin, understood this, but the Israeli peace forces, who are a credit to that country, are marginalised by the current regime.
The conclusion to be drawn from this tragic experience of 40 years of blindness is, in the opinion of my group, as follows: laisser faire amounts to us making ourselves guilty.
Let us dare to stand up for truth.
I quote your words one last time, Mr President, you said, 'let us have the courage to make a new start together'.
(Applause from the left)
Thank you, Francis Wurtz, for the reference to what I said before the Knesset.
Mr President, I should very briefly like to reply to the contributions from the honourable Members representing the different political groups in this House.
I think that most of the speeches followed a line which is in a sense the same one that we have been defending for a long time: namely, the time has come to move on from the policy of crisis management - which is very important, but it is not enough.
We need policies, together with crisis management, to solving the conflict.
We need to work towards a political horizon to really begin to get into the business of solving the conflict that started 40 years ago.
That is basically the view everybody has expressed, and it is something that we will be trying to do in the coming days.
I told you that last Wednesday the Quartet met in Berlin, and I said that for the first time the Quartet is committed to starting a debate with the parties in order to begin to work towards a political horizon.
This means that, before the end of this month, the Quartet will meet with the Palestinians and Israelis in order to push forward the dialogue - which is still in its preliminary stages - that has begun between President Abbas and Prime Minister Olmert.
They are the two people who must find the way towards peace.
It is our obligation to push and to provide a catalyst for this process.
That is what we are going to do.
It is written very clearly in the statement produced by the Quartet last Wednesday.
I think that this is a profound change, and I would like to underline that, because someone asked whether we are going wait passively for a catastrophe to arrive.
The answer is no: we do not want to do that; you do not want to do that; the people in the region do not want to do that.
Therefore, under the leadership of the Quartet, we are trying to put forward this mechanism in order to move towards peace.
A few other ideas were put forward by some of the honourable Members representing the political groups, including the suggestion of an international force.
I would like to say that, for the first time in many years, the idea of an international force is not out of the question.
As you know, the idea was brought up in the Knesset by two members of the parliamentary groups, saying that this may be the time to call for an international force, at least at the beginning, in a peacekeeping role or to control the border in the south - the so-called 'Philadelphi Corridor' - where the Rafah Crossing is situated.
We are working on that, as you probably know, because information has already been published.
The Israelis are also considering that possibility, as are the Palestinians.
The Egyptians are also considering that possibility with different intensity.
For the Egyptians it would probably be very difficult to have an international force there, as it may give the impression that they are not able to control that part of the border.
However, I think that we can still begin discussions on these issues and perhaps eventually reach a solution.
This also ties in with what Mrs Napoletano said about the success of UNIFIL.
The fact that the international force has been responsible for UNIFIL - i.e. for the application of the UN Security Council resolution on Lebanon - and the manner in which it has been perceived - i.e. the efficiency of the force, of which the backbone is European - have also caused some in the Israeli Government, the Knesset and Israel as a whole to think that it might be possible for a force of that nature also to be applied elsewhere.
In a way, we have to link all the issues together.
It may be possible for us to use what we have learned from our presence in Lebanon in another place.
That opens the way to a monitoring presence which will be absolutely necessary if we want the peace process to come to fruition.
I would like to stress again that, as regards Lebanon, the resolution creating the tribunal is very important.
The tribunal is not against anybody.
There has been a very negative reaction in Syria, but I must stress that an international tribunal is not against anybody, any country.
It is a tribunal that is organised in order to see who is responsible for the killing of a good man - a friend of many of ours, Mr Hariri - who was assassinated in a manner that has to be clarified if we want peace and reconciliation in Lebanon.
Therefore we in the European Union have been working towards this, and last Wednesday the Security Council came to another important decision on setting up an international tribunal.
I would like to say once again that what we have striven to do in taking the Quartet in the direction that we are now moving is something that has many fathers - or many mothers - as always, but you can be sure that the Europeans have been working very hard from the very beginning to arrive at this moment.
Let us hope that we are able to continue working in that direction.
It will be difficult, but for the future I hope to have the support, help and understanding of the European Parliament, as always.
(Applause)
Mr President, yesterday I met a delegation of Israeli citizens from Sderot who related to me first-hand the terror in their civilian population from 300 random Qassam rocket attacks launched at them from Hamas-controlled sites in Gaza, which clearly constitutes a war crime in international law, with two dead and many injured to date.
Last week 33 people were detained by the IDF in the West Bank, including the Palestinian Education Minister Nasser al-Shaer, allegedly for their overt support for these rocket attacks.
The detention of an education minister is interesting as it tends to support the repeated allegations in this House that the Palestinian textbooks and school curriculum supported for years by EU funds are still aimed at fomenting a climate of hatred and distrust for Israel and a glorification of terrorist violence.
Many of the Hamas ministerial components of the Unity Government - like the Hamas 1988 Charter inspired by Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood - still believe strongly that the State of Israel has no right to exist, that all terrorist violence is justified through so-called armed struggle, and that they are not bound by previous PLO-signed international agreements.
Therefore, in my view at present the PA Unity Government clearly does not comply with the Quartet criteria, and the EU must not yet lift the ban on Hamas as a designated terrorist organisation, or directly fund the PA Government.
Neither should the TIM be abandoned for the delivery of humanitarian aid, which now totals over EUR 500 million yearly and has actually risen over the last three years, contrary to popular opinion.
I too support the Arab League's new proposals for a negotiated solution, although the right of return is totally unrealistic.
But again, and curiously, Hamas rejects their proposals for Israel's recognition.
Some hardliners on all sides reject peace or a two-state solution, but on the 40th anniversary of the six-day war it is clear that this is the only viable long-term solution for a lasting peace in the region.
But first the PA must ensure law and order on its territory and stop the dissent into virtual Hamas-Fatah civil war in Gaza, which is also being stirred up in Lebanon.
Once again I would like to call upon the House and the international community to put pressure on all those responsible for the release of the BBC reporter Alan Johnston, who we now know is alive and well, and the kidnapped soldier Corporal Shalit.
This will create a climate conducive to restarting the vital roadmap for peace talks.
(FR) Mr President, at the time of the legislative elections in 2006, I asked a Palestinian: 'Do you think that these elections will bring peace?'
He replied: 'No, not peace, but democracy.
And we are going to show the world that, even in the occupied territories, we are capable of holding free elections'.
Our response was pathetic.
Our disregard for the aspirations of a people, including their right to make mistakes, introduced just a bit more chaos still into a region that is now in ferment.
The establishment of a National Unity Government and the Mecca Agreement have not sufficiently altered the European Union's hard line or its sanctions.
Despite your efforts, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner - and I appreciate those efforts - in spite of what you have said to us, and it is encouraging, Mr Solana, I believe that we have not yet radically changed our policy towards the Middle East and that we have not properly understood that we are damaging the very notion of democracy with our response to these elections.
It is an attitude that has persisted for 40 years.
I believe that we are partly responsible for having allowed, for 40 years, a situation of total lawlessness to take hold in Palestine, with extra-judicial executions, theft of land, kidnapping, now, of legitimately elected representatives and ministers, the existence of a wall considered illegal by the Court in The Hague and the Geneva Conventions flouted, Francis Wurtz spoke about it: more than 400 children still held in Israeli prisons, more than 400 young Palestinians.
The United Nations Organisation (UNO) resolutions ignored the sealing off of territories and restrictions on movements.
And what else?
Of course, Mr Tannock, we condemn violence, we condemn the firing of rockets, we condemn the kidnapping of the soldier, Shalit, but there is at present an imbalance.
Look at the figures.
They are, alas, dramatically unfavourable to the Palestinian people and, I repeat, there is no equidistance.
International law - that is not equidistance.
Nothing today justifies our silence and I should like to salute, here, these new Just Men, those Jews who, in Israel and elsewhere, speak out and say 'That must be stopped'.
They say it amid the sniggering, the sarcasm, and sometimes the threats of their fellow citizens.
I see myself as a supporter of all those people, as I see myself as a supporter of our Palestinian colleagues who, regardless of parliamentary immunity, have been imprisoned.
I should like to say to you that in Belgium, all the leaders of the political parties are to meet tomorrow, at 1 p.m. at Berlaymont, to make a chain for peace and to ask the European Union to take on its responsibilities, not only humanitarian responsibilities, but real political responsibilities which are a credit to the European Union.
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, none of us questions Israel's right to exist.
We are aware of our political responsibility.
At the same time, I would like to remind the House of the message from a peace conference held in Palestine in the last few days.
Women, who are, after all, part of civil society, Palestinian and Israeli women, delivered a clear message to us.
You speak, they said, of the coexistence of two states.
That is good, but please take note that our existence is threatened in Palestine and in Gaza.
I believe that the crux of the matter at this time is the existence issue.
For this reason I am glad that Javier Solana said we had to consider whether we should not review the Lebanon experience as quickly as possible and possibly become involved in Gaza.
We must act before the situation slides completely out of control, because there will not be many more opportunities.
What you described as courage, Dr Solana, namely the hope we must have if we are to remain committed and explain our commitment to the people on the ground too, that hope has faded to a shadow in the region itself.
I wish to thank Mr Poettering on behalf of my group for having made that journey.
You said that the situation in Gaza is intolerable.
It is our duty to become more heavily committed than ever before to the right of people there to live in peace, and of course that also means criticising Hamas for its duplicity.
The statement made by Hamas to mark the 40th anniversary of the Six-Day War is unacceptable in our view.
At the same time, however, we must cooperate actively with the Government of National Unity.
We shall not get a second chance.
I second the criticism voiced by Mrs De Keyser just a few moments ago.
We in the European Union have indeed made mistakes in that region.
We have bitterly disappointed people's hopes and have failed to harness their willingness to look to the future.
I hope that the Middle East Quartet is now roused from slumber.
I hope it will go into action, and I hope there will be trips to the region.
It may be a last chance before we can no longer speak realistically of any hope of peace.
Mr President, I would like to begin with some quotes.
On 2 April, Prime Minister Haniyeh said on Al-Jazeera: 'As far as we are concerned, the issue of recognition of Israel has been settled once and for all.
It has been settled in our political literature, in our Islamic thought and in our Jihadist culture, on which we base our moves.
We will declare a truce, but never recognition of Israel'.
On Al-Jazeera on 27 April, he said: 'If the siege continues beyond a certain time, we will be forced to make a decision and there is no doubt that we will act'.
On 5 May, in a prayer, he said: 'I reiterate, on behalf of the Palestinian Government, that the security plan will not hurt the resistance.
We will give Allah the opportunity to grant us one of the two mercies, victory or martyrdom'.
As a fluent speaker of Arabic, I can assure you that the translation is correct.
The situation is grave.
We face not only the 'Iraqisation' of Gaza but the 'Iranisation' of the whole Middle East.
This is not just a threat to the Middle East.
This is a serious threat to our own security.
Europe must be a player and we must be absolutely unified.
Therefore Parliament should remain unified, supporting the Council, the Commission and the Quartet.
The Temporary International Mechanism must go on.
We have to continue humanitarian aid.
We may even use the PLO account.
However, the key issue is to bring the Palestinian National Unity Government to renounce violence, to recognise Israel and to honour international agreements.
Only then can we return to UN Resolution 242, clearly asking Israel to withdraw from territories, so that there are no 'deterritories' or occupied territories.
I therefore ask the Council and the Commission whether they consider that the preconditions for the recognition and direct financing of the Palestinian National Unity Government have been met.
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Solana, when 40 years have passed since the Six Day War and the nations of the Middle East are still suffering now from its tragic consequences; when reports by Amnesty International and the United Nations now seriously question the viability of a Palestinian state because of the persistent Israeli policies of occupation and colonisation; when unbearable misery is rife in Gaza and on the West Bank, feeding the fire between rival Palestinian factions, and the National Unity Government, the last rampart against civil war, is hanging by a thread; when the whole region is in ferment from Iraq to Lebanon, we can say that compassionate speeches are no longer enough and it is urgent to bring about change, an upheaval, a revolution, dare I say, in our Middle East policy and to take on the full extent of our responsibilities.
First of all, by recognising the Palestinian National Unity Government on which we have pinned our hopes and which has declared willingness to respect all of the UN and PLO resolutions, all of the previous resolutions, as well as the demands of the Quartet to restore credibility to the two-state solution.
Next, by reinstating our direct aid to this government, because it is unrealistic to count on the Israelis to release the tax revenues that were collected by right and which remain confiscated and because the temporary mechanism has fizzled out.
Furthermore, by deploying an international interposition force at the border between Gaza and Israel, the only measure that is likely to bring about a ceasefire the effectiveness and endurance of which have been demonstrated in Lebanon.
Finally and above all, by showing considerable ambition, perhaps, by taking the initiative for a European Camp David that has become necessary since the roadmap brandished by the Quartet comes down to nothing more than a pious hope.
Since 1967, we have lost our way in mistakes and injustices.
Do we have to wait another 40 years...
(The President cut off the speaker)
(DA) Thank you, Mr President, and thanks also to the Commissioner and the High Representative.
Simply put, however, I have my doubts.
We, in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, have attempted to discuss amongst ourselves what it is we have learnt here.
It is a top priority for us that we now recognise the Palestinian Government and that action be taken again.
I am quite simply unable to tell whether that is what we have been told is to happen.
It was not what Mr Solana told us; but was it what Mrs Ferrero-Waldner said?
That is - did she say that we would now grant recognition and go on from there?
It seems to me that we need a clear answer to this question because what frustrates the whole system is the fact that all we get is endless talk and no action.
The double standards and the paralysis of action are on the point of wrecking not only the Middle East but also the EU.
The other matter about which we need clarity is what is meant by the fact that we are now to support the Arab initiative.
I was unable to conclude from Mr Solana's presentation that this is actually what we intend to do.
All I could make out was that it was said that we must now engage again in negotiation.
We are well aware, however, of where we need to go.
It is a difficult process to turn this into a reality, but we know what has to be brought about, and we cannot allow ourselves to become notorious for mentioning the Arab initiative over and over and then letting all the steam out of it by saying 'now let us see what happens'.
We need to say that this is the point at which we are making a start.
We have, set out before us, the final result that we are all well aware is the only acceptable outcome if we are to make progress and that, to top it all, is what both the West and Israel have long been calling for.
It has suddenly been put on the table.
Can we not have clear answers?
That would be nice.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, High Representative, the fact that the Quartet now intends to act jointly in the region is good news.
That is an important message, because, as we have often said in this House, it is only through concerted action that the Quartet acquires the credibility it needs to be able to give all parties the essential security guarantees.
In the eyes of the region, no member of the Quartet can do that on its own.
May I congratulate you on this development and also on the fact that it can be combined with the Arab initiative.
If we want to advance - and we have discussed this so often - and avoid giving in to hopelessness and despair, we must be clear about one thing: the moderates on both sides must be able to create conditions in their own territories in which the foundations can be built for a peace process that will not be demolished by the provocations of the extremist minorities on the other side.
This must therefore be the starting point.
It is true, of course, that Israel must release the money.
It is also true that this patchwork situation in the West Bank, with checks and settlements everywhere, which nips any economic development in the bud, must be ended, and that conditions must prevail in which economic development is possible again.
We can pump as much money into the West Bank as we like, but the right conditions simply must be created there.
It must also be said, however, that what is happening in Gaza is a civil war between Palestinians.
The answer is not an international force deployed between Israel and Gaza but meetings between the warring factions to bring about a satisfactory end to the conflict.
All of these issues are plainly interconnected, but please let us remember that everyone is responsible for his own domain.
We cannot take over this responsibility.
Accordingly, we must demand an end to the civil war.
Anyone trying to resolve conflicts between the rival groups by military means is destroying the future prospects of his own people.
For this reason we must take care to seek our starting points here and thus create a platform from which the Quartet can operate successfully and give us a genuine chance of progress.
Mr President, sometimes I get very dispirited when listening to the debates in this House on this issue, particularly when I hear Mr Tannock and Mrs HybÃ¡Å¡kovÃ¡, who seem intent on laying down conditions in this House for a solution in the Middle East.
It is not for us to set preconditions for the Israelis and the Palestinians in terms of how they will address each other in the peace negotiations.
The only preconditions necessary for successful peace negotiations are a demonstrable commitment to peace on each side, a mandate to negotiate on each side and the capacity to deliver on the commitments made in the negotiations.
All other preconditions which MEPs in this House seek to apply to Israelis and Palestinians are so much hot air.
They have no effect and there is no possible likelihood that they will be met in a situation in which the Palestinian Authority, in particular, is at the point of collapse.
If that Authority, that Unity Government, collapses, then nothing we say and nothing the European Union does will prevent the appalling bloodbath that will follow, for the Israelis and for the Palestinians.
The role of the international community is to ensure that the patrons of each side in this conflict - the Quartet and the Arab States - set aside their immediate short-term interests and put the interests of the Palestinians and the Israelis first.
We must seek to ensure that they come to the table and address the outlines that are already there, and which have been for some time, as regards the possibilities and conditions for peace.
It is time we stopped talking and started to act in the interests ...
(The President cut the speaker off)
(SK) As Mr Solana and Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner have told us, the situation in the Middle East is indeed critical.
The situation is critical in Lebanon, and it continues to be critical in Palestinian-Israeli relations.
The very notion of 'critical', however, is dramatic, since it implies a situation of financial, economic and social decline, accompanied by terror attacks and activities, kidnappings and the death of civilians.
The mounting resistance and attacks against the state of Israel and her citizens breed fear and concern, resulting in measures which we find incomprehensible.
The region is a mess, conflict is intensifying and the ceasefire is not being abided by.
The meeting of the Quartet last week pointed out that our active involvement in the peace process was essential.
However, the degree of frustration on either side, be it Palestinian or Israeli, is just as great as our endeavours to further the peace process.
It is imperative, therefore, to beef up our diplomatic efforts, to make them more dynamic and, in particular, to make them balanced.
Our activities should not generate the impression that we stand on one side of the conflict.
It is our duty to demand that Israel release the funds; by the same token, it is our duty to ensure that the funds are indeed invested in economic and social development.
It is also our duty to guarantee for the citizens of Israel basic protection of their lives and the basic defence of their state.
(PT) This issue of the Middle East, and in particular the tragic situation in Palestine, has resurfaced several times in recent plenary sessions.
This should come as no surprise.
We have all seen on the ground what goes on there.
We have all seen the same thing, we have come to Parliament and reported a terrible and explosive humanitarian situation.
We have all seen Israel's illegal retention of some EUR 700 million in taxes - money that does not belong to Israel and that is generating interest by the day.
We have all seen in the eyes of those people - human beings with the right to justice and dignity just like us - the hope for a future in which they can live in peace.
This is a hope that remains alive despite the constraints, a hope that every day is severely put to the test by a lack of mobility and by the wall.
This is a wall that puts paid to any kind of local economy, either in its purest meaning of subsistence through farming, or in terms of something more ambitious like having enough produce to run a small shop.
In the face of the continuous erosion of that hope, despair takes hold and, as members of this privileged club of countries that won peace after enduring the bitter taste of war, we must not think that we can solve problems by throwing money at them.
Helping the Palestinian people is very important, crucial in fact.
Much more important, though, is helping them realise that their voice makes a difference in their country and that the credible manner in which they ran their elections and sought a solution to present to the world counted for something.
Authority must be restored to the Palestinian territories.
Let us hope that Finance Minister Salam Fayad can become one of the main spokesmen on matters of financial help to the people.
It is therefore vital to normalise institutional relations.
We must demonstrate that we are actually prepared to resolve the conflict.
We Europeans have a vital part to play in bringing peace to the region and to the world.
(The President cut off the speaker)
Mr President, we must give peace a chance in the Middle East.
We know how difficult it is and we all know about the challenges, but we all know about the new hopes and we have clearly explained the situation.
What is necessary is, on the one hand, to achieve a certain level of security, and a better security situation first to the Palestinians within Gaza, but also in the West Bank.
That is very true.
Both we and Americans are working with the Palestinians to come to such a solution, but unfortunately we are not yet completely there.
Second, there needs to be greater economic freedom in order to improve the daily lives of the Palestinians.
This is also what we are trying to do.
We also said very clearly that we want to engage with this national Unity Government according to the actions and the programme.
Salam Fayyad is, therefore, our preferred interlocutor to see what else can be done.
I have very clearly said what could be done.
I would like to repeat to you that in addition to from our continuous work with the temporary international mechanism - that I would have liked to phase out as soon as possible, but I cannot do so because there humanitarian assistance is still necessary - we offered Salam Fayyad technical assistance in the area of audit, revenue collection and customs.
We are currently working with the Ministry to define the delivery of assistance, but we are also resuming institution-building where it is important.
We are trying to go for development assistance in order to give more hope to the population, but it is true that a lot of political courage and political will is necessary, first and foremost on the part of the parties to the conflict. we members of the Quartet can only support them, we can push them, we can encourage them and this is what we are trying to do, but we cannot, unfortunately, take the decision for them.
That is the limit of our action.
I hope that the next meeting in the region will be a positive one and will be the trigger to this political vision and political horizon that we all have so much in our minds.
We hope and plead for the release of all the political prisoners.
That means the abducted Israeli soldier and the BBC journalist Alan Johnston, but also all the members of the Palestinian government and all the others that are still imprisoned.
I think this would be very good momentum that could be brought about in order to find the next steps towards this two-state solution that we all so clearly wish for.
Mr President, I am not going to repeat what I and others who have contributed to the debate have already said.
I would first of all like to thank all the Members of Parliament who contributed, those who are still here and those who have left.
I think it has been a very interesting debate, and I would like to make an observation on it.
When I come to the European Parliament to discuss the Middle East, I have the feeling that emotions run high, starting with my own.
But I think that our debates have to be about the events which are important at a given time.
Today we are in a very difficult situation, but at the same time, as has been said, it is a time of hope, which did not exist for a long time.
I have been involved in the Middle East for many years.
I was at the Madrid Conference and at the last Conference at Camp David.
Not since Camp David have I perceived us to be any closer than I feel we are today to the beginning of real, meaningful communication and exchange and therefore the beginning of a political horizon, and a debate and negotiations about that.
There are three reasons for this.
One is that the Arab League Initiative is something that was missing at the time of Camp David.
We have it today, and we have the engagement of the Arabs to embrace whoever the Palestinian negotiator is going to be, in order to sustain him and to give the support which, as you know, was not there at the time of Camp David.
Secondly, 40 years have elapsed.
I think everybody is exhausted: psychologically, physically and politically.
Out of this exhaustion I think that we have to muster new psychological and political energy in order to move forward.
Thirdly, we have a mechanism - the Quartet - and sometimes we do not realise how much effort goes into that.
For the first time we have the United States and the European Union at the same table negotiating with the parties, which has never happened before.
We have to recognise that.
This is the first time that the European Union has been at the negotiating table.
The Russian Federation was in Madrid and then disappeared.
There was also the Secretary-General of the United Nations - imagine for a moment what that means - the United Nations negotiated in this conflict.
It was impossible to imagine at that time.
I believe that to a certain extent all these elements change the horizon of what can be done now.
We must now try to move on, try not to falter and try to continue working in that direction.
Conditions have changed and therefore we have more hope that it can be achieved.
Will it be achieved in 24 hours?
No.
If you think that we will find the solution to all the problems by the end of this month, you are wrong: we will have to wait a bit longer than that.
But let us see whether we have the opportunity to move the process forward.
As a final thought, I would like to stress that we are Europeans here.
Everyone here is a member of the European Union.
Sometimes we have to be a little proud of what we do.
If you go to Palestine, as you do, you hear the criticism.
But probably, if you really talk in depth to the Palestinians and Israelis, you will find a growing sympathy and understanding - you have to agree with me about that - for the way in which Europeans are doing things.
I think that we Europeans have to recognise that every now and then.
Otherwise we will never move forward collectively, as we need to do.
Moving this process forward is not an effort for one or two: it is an effort for everybody.
We have an opportunity.
Let us see whether next time we meet we see progress.
We will not see the solution, but let us see whether we make progress.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place during the next part-session in Strasbourg.
Written statements (Article 142)
in writing. - (PT) This week marks the 40th anniversary of Israel's illegal occupation of the Palestinian territories of the West Bank, the (now violently under siege) Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem, the Syrian territories of the Golan Heights and the Egyptian territories of the Sinai Peninsula, which Egypt has since recovered.
40 years of...
violations of international law and non-compliance with countless UN Security Council resolutions by the Israeli authorities;
criminal and brutal occupation, colonisation and repression, and denial of the Palestinian people's legitimate rights by the Israeli authorities;
oppression, plundering, exploitation, unemployment and poverty, the imposition of the most degrading humiliation and inhuman living conditions on the Palestinian people by the Israeli authorities;
actual support and collaboration, or at least connivance and tacit acceptance, by the USA and its allies in Europe in the face of the Israeli authorities' considerable responsibility.
June 2007 is a time to reiterate the call for an end to the occupation of the territories that Israel occupied in 1967, for compliance with international law and for the implementation of the relevant UN resolutions, such as the Palestinian people's inalienable right to a viable, sovereign and independent State.
in writing. - (FI) Mr President, the Six Day War took place in 1967 and it had its winner.
In the last 40 years the loser has been human dignity.
The humanitarian crisis in the Middle East is one of the most tragic in recent history.
There is a vicious circle of violence in the region which no one has yet been able to break.
Generations of Israelis and Palestinians have lived with instability, violence and war.
Crisis management has been the tool used in practice to seek a solution to the Middle East conflict.
Step by step the aim has been a move towards permanent peace.
A ceasefire has been reached which will soon have collapsed and a new conflict begun.
It is difficult to believe in a successful path as long as the parties fail to understand that each act of violence destroys the future of a section of its own people.
There is also a lack of comprehension among the Palestinian groups.
There is a civil war going on in Gaza.
Scores of Palestinians have died in clashes between Fatah and Hamas.
Israel's military actions and human rights violations are to be condemned.
Each country must comply with international obligations and international law and should respect human dignity, something that can never be surrendered.
We cannot demand Israel's immediate withdrawal from the Palestinian territories, however, as long as the Palestinian authorities do not recognise the state of Israel.
The Quartet, the United States of America, the United Nations, the EU and Russia, must obviously continue with their efforts to achieve a lasting peace.
Parliament's job is to demonstrate European consistency and support the Commission and the Council.
There is one thing we surely cannot do: we cannot make the parties accept our desire to achieve a lasting peace.
We can encourage and put pressure on them, but we cannot force our will upon them.
United Nations Human Rights Council (debate)
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the fifth session of the UN Human Rights Council which will take place in Geneva on 11-19 June 2007.
Mr President, Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, ladies and gentlemen, from the very outset the European Union welcomed the creation of the United Nations Human Rights Council in 2006 but has always emphasised that it expects the Council to be an efficient and credible body making a genuine contribution to the global protection and promotion of human rights.
At the previous sessions of the Human Rights Council, the European Union has also attached importance to substantive debates on human-rights issues as well as to dialogue and close cooperation.
During the fourth regular session, the European Union and the African Group succeeded in securing the adoption by consensus of their resolution on Darfur.
This was the result of sustained efforts on the part of the European Union, and the outcome reflects not only the mandate of the Council but also the level of responsibility it should be expected to exercise.
The capacity of the Human Rights Council to fulfil its mandate is inextricably linked to its composition.
Allow me to recall once more that the General Assembly of the United Nations expects the member nations of the Council to observe the highest standards of human rights.
It has also called on all UN Members to elect to the Council only those nations with good human-rights records.
Although this ideal is still far from having been achieved, I should like to express the satisfaction of the European Union that the election of Belarus to the Human Rights Council was successfully thwarted in May.
This success was due in no small part to the opposition of the European Union to the candidature of Belarus.
Although it is in a minority in numerical terms, the European Union nevertheless plays a leading role in the Council and has established itself as a major player.
In spite of some encouraging developments, such as the adoption of an International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, more action is needed to equip the Human Rights Council with the working practices and instruments it needs to live up to the expectations of the international community and particularly those of the European Union.
The European Union attaches top priority to the institutional establishment of the Council.
It is therefore making strenuous efforts to ensure that this institution-building process is successfully completed by the end of the first year.
The forthcoming fifth session will therefore be crucially important.
At that session the Council will take its concluding decisions on the establishment of the institution and will thereby ultimately determine its own efficiency and credibility for the next five years.
The European Union is currently cooperating closely in Geneva with all participants in order to achieve an outcome that will enable the Human Rights Council to make full use of its mandate.
In the Presidency's contacts with the President and the other delegations of the Human Rights Council, we are trying to establish a central role within the United Nations system for an efficient and credible Council.
To this end the European Union wishes to insist on the creation of an effective and universal periodic review process and on the preservation of issue-based and country-based mandates.
The planned code of conduct for special rapporteurs must not impair their independence; on the contrary, it must guarantee that independence and focus on the obligations of the states with which the rapporteurs cooperate.
Moreover, we are pursuing the aim of establishing a suitable process for the selection of national representatives which will ensure that they possess the requisite expertise as well as guaranteeing their independence.
We are aware of the difficulties involved in the pursuit of these objectives.
Let me assure you that we will not relax our efforts to achieve them.
It also remains the firm hope of the European Union that the Human Rights Council, with its sessions held at regular intervals throughout the year, its new and improved set of instruments and its continuing commitment to the present dialogue with special rapporteurs and the High Commissioner for Human Rights, will develop into a cornerstone of the human-rights system of the United Nations.
It is now up to all members of the Human Rights Council to act responsibly and to work towards the achievement of these goals.
Mr President, President-in-Office GÃŒnter Gloser, ladies and gentlemen, since it was founded, the European Union, as you know, has been one of the main driving forces for the protection of human rights and has therefore played an active role in pursuing the aims of the Human Rights Council and ensuring that the new body represents a real improvement on the Commission on Human Rights.
The initial aims have therefore been to ensure that the Council sessions deal with urgent human-rights issues in the context of actual occurrences, to improve coordination within the EU and to step up the Union's outreach efforts, in other words its attempts to sensitise non-EU governments to human-rights issues.
In these respects real progress has been made, allowing us, on the one hand, to make a coherent and credible stand in the Human Rights Council and, on the other hand, to enhance our cooperation with partners in other parts of the world through bilateral meetings as well as in multilateral forums and through a broad-based campaign to raise awareness in many of the world's capitals.
Among the priority tasks in the course of the first year have therefore been the safeguarding of the mandates and mechanisms of the Human Rights Council in the framework of the review process and the establishment of the new system, known as the universal periodic review, for the monitoring of the human-rights situation in all countries.
The general compromise package presented only yesterday by the President of the Human Rights Council certainly points in the right direction; while it needs improvement, from our perspective it is nevertheless a very good initial basis for negotiation.
Next week's fifth session of the Human Rights Council therefore assumes very special importance as a key to the future of that body.
This is another reason why I am particularly pleased that a delegation from the European Parliament will be attending the session as part of the delegation from the European Communities.
What is the verdict on the performance of the Human Rights Council to date?
It is impossible to provide a clear-cut answer, but in my view the Council should be an ongoing project, a kind of work in progress, as it were.
Let me make a few brief comments.
The first Council sessions were certainly rather disappointing.
The old behaviour patterns resurfaced.
We were already familiar with them, of course, from the Commission on Human Rights.
The sessions on the Middle East in particular were truly marred by an uncooperative attitude on the part of the very states that had convened them.
The result was unbalanced draft resolutions which we in the European Union were unable to support.
Let me therefore make it clear that, while confrontation on human-rights issues may well be necessary on occasion when people's fundamental rights are at stake, it is a different matter when human rights are used as a cover for the pursuit of a primarily political conflict.
Just like the Council Presidency, however, we too have observed that the very good resolution on Darfur which was recently adopted there has mitigated these unfavourable impressions.
I firmly believe that it is the most important resolution the Council has adopted.
It was closely coordinated with the African Group in very protracted negotiations and was ultimately adopted by consensus.
That was a considerable achievement when we consider what a sensitive issue it addressed, coupled with the fact that the EU can now be easily outvoted in the Human Rights Council.
The monitoring body of five independent UN rapporteurs that was established by the resolution will present its first report to the Council in the next few weeks, most probably next week.
And let us not forget that the International Criminal Court recently indicted two Sudanese suspects.
In short, there is at least movement on that front in Darfur.
We very much hope that this will set an example as well as setting standards for the future work of the Human Rights Council.
Lastly, the interactive dialogues with the High Commissioner and the UN's special rapporteur have proved to be a very useful development.
They have enabled us to approach the human-rights situation in individual countries - often in connection with more general human-rights issues - in a highly visible as well as far less confrontational manner.
Our next step, however, is to find more ways of ensuring that these dialogues can be followed by practical progress on the ground.
However impatient we may be for rapid progress in the UN Human Rights Council, I would warn anyone against snap judgments on the Council at this stage.
All we can say so far is that there have been bright and dark sides.
We are convinced that the EU will continue its efforts to build on the encouraging developments that have undoubtedly taken place and to nurture, in the framework of an intensive dialogue with its UN partners, an effective UN Human Rights Council and above all one that acts in the interests of the people concerned.
It remains the main international forum for the treatment of human rights, and we in the EU have a responsibility to make active use of it to reinforce our values, our ideals and our interests.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (LT) First of all I would like to thank Council and Commission representatives for their reports about the first working year of the United Nations Human Rights Council and for the fifth United Nations Human Rights Council session.
Tomorrow the European Parliament will vote on a resolution concerning this issue, which sets out all the basic problems, such as our aspirations for the Human Rights Council's modus operandi, its mechanisms, special procedures, special rapporteurs, universal periodic review, and the role of the European Union.
The European Parliament has undoubtedly expected and still expects a lot from the Human Rights Council for the simple reason that human rights are a matter of particular importance, since respect for human rights and their defence are a fundamental part of EU ethics and statutes, and in general they are the foundation of Europe's unity and integrity.
The United Nations Human Rights Council can provide excellent possibilities for effective action in defending and safeguarding human rights, and for promoting them on behalf of the United Nations.
In this regard the fifth session is particularly important, since one year of activity of the Human Rights Council has revealed problems and shortcomings, which can and must be fixed straight away.
This is necessary so that the Human Rights Council can become a truly reliable structure - able to react adequately and, when required, quickly to breaches of human rights in any country of the world, and capable of finding effective means to influence the governments of those countries where human rights are being crudely violated.
The first year of activity of the Human Rights Council has permitted us to ascertain whether, in applying its planned procedures and mechanisms, the Human Rights Council will be able to implement the ambitious programme that it has adopted for itself.
The first year's experience, resolutions on Darfur, Iran and Uzbekistan, the application of confidentiality requirements when human rights abuses in the latter two countries were being discussed, as well as other decisions, have demonstrated that the procedures of the Human Rights Council must be maximally transparent, and that the special rapporteurs and experts need to be truly independent.
Furthermore, it is essential to apply clear criteria when choosing members for the Human Rights Council: simple logic indicates that countries, in which there are gross violations of human rights, should not be chosen as members of the Human Rights Council.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Mr President, I believe that we can be pleased with the consensus that has been achieved amongst the groups in the House in relation to the text that we are going to put to the vote tomorrow for the fifth session of the United Nations Human Rights Council.
Since this Council was created, it has not had a very easy time.
It is therefore important that the European Parliament should once again show consistency in terms of how to proceed with a view to promoting and protecting human rights and, specifically, how to facilitate and improve the work of the United Nations Human Rights Council.
On assessing its activities, it appears that there are certain deficiencies that need to be resolved and which are based on two fundamental problems.
On the one hand, the weakness and insufficiency of the responses to dramatic and urgent situations that require much more vigorous action.
I am referring primarily to the dramatic situation in Darfur, something to which everybody should be paying the greatest possible attention.
Secondly, the need substantially to improve the Council's internal mechanisms and to improve the dynamics of the relationship between the member countries for the sake of more effective and ambitious work.
There is a fundamental problem underlying both issues, and Parliament and the European Union can do significant work in this regard.
I am referring to political differences, which must not hinder the crucial common efforts to substantially reduce the vulnerability of the world's peoples to abuses and violations of human rights.
This aspect is vital, since Europe must be at the forefront in terms of treating all countries equally when it comes to dialogue on human rights.
We believe that this philosophy must be extended to the Council and that the next Romanian Presidency of the United Nations Human Rights Council can offer a good opportunity for these essential improvements to become reality.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, respect for human rights is of universal value and importance and is of course a fundamental principle of the EU.
This House, not surprisingly, pays particular attention to this principle, as shown by the regular production of reports and resolutions dealing with human rights violations around the world.
It was with great sadness that for years we watched the rather ineffective work of the Human Rights Commission, and it was with much relief that we welcomed, approximately a year ago, the replacement of the Human Rights Commission by the Human Rights Council.
In the words of a Human Rights Watch representative, the Human Rights Commission in effect became the abusers' club, because abusive governments were eager to be part of it in order to block action on themselves and on countries elsewhere.
Unfortunately, our hopes for changes for the better were somewhat shaken after the Council elections, when Angola, Egypt and Qatar gained seats.
Those three countries have a well-known, atrocious record of human rights abuses.
The non-election of Belarus to the Council was a relief, although this occurred only by a tiny margin.
During the Human Rights Council's first year, we have seen some changes which have improved its function, but it has to be said that these changes were not spectacular.
We expect and hope that more promising improvements are on the way.
The Geneva-based Council has so far shown eagerness to deal with worldwide problems promptly and repeatedly if necessary, but the effectiveness of its work has to be looked at more critically.
An example is the fact that last year the Council adopted no less than eight resolutions criticising Israel for its military actions in the Palestinian territories in Lebanon.
These resolutions had some, but not much, usefulness in practical terms.
This is not the fault of the UN Human Rights Council, but that Council has to assume some responsibility for not finding ways to make its voice heard more seriously.
Other examples include the Council's problematic dealings with Uzbekistan and Iran.
As the next session of the Council is due to ...
(The President cut the speaker off)
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, the European Union has now taken over from the United States as the guardian of human rights in the world.
Of all our many policies, this is the one that gains us the most popularity on a global level.
Unfortunately, the European Union is not always able to occupy its rightful place at meetings.
At the World Conference on Climate Change last November, for example, the Union's delegation sat in Finland's place, as Finland held the Presidency at the time.
We need to be able to occupy our rightful place as the EU to ensure our voice is heard clearly as we deal with the many problems in our contemporary world.
One area of concern is the Middle East, where Hamas is threatening to destroy Israel, whilst the Israelis are already engaged in destroying the Palestinian nation.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (ES) The Human Rights Council was created as a replacement for the Human Rights Commission and was faced with the by no means easy challenge of not falling into excessive politicisation and governmental interference in such an important area as overseeing universal respect for human rights.
Nevertheless, the progress made so far, at least in this field, is worrying to say the least.
Just yesterday we heard Jody Williams - the Human Rights Council's special rapporteur for Darfur - complaining about the immense pressure upon her to make her report acceptable to everybody.
We all know what that means.
It means removing, or at least toning down, the criticisms as far as possible in order not to upset anybody.
The most serious thing, however, is that these requests were made in order not to jeopardise the continuity of the Council.
Things are going badly if a structure such as the Human Rights Council puts its own survival before what should be its primary and main responsibility: to ensure the protection of human rights in the world, which involves, amongst other things, identifying the people responsible for violations, even if they are governments, or particularly if they are governments.
During this first anniversary of the Council's existence we must bear these risks very much in mind if we do not want this Council to become just one more structure whose only purpose is to hide the shame of those who constantly violate the most fundamental human rights inside and outside of their borders.
By means of this resolution, on which there is consensus in the European Parliament and I am pleased about that, we call upon, and encourage, the Council to take on a strong leadership role at the fifth session of the Human Rights Council, and we know that that will not be easy.
But there are at least two issues that we would like it to prioritise.
Firstly, the guarantee that special rapporteurs are selected on the basis of their independence and abilities and that they are able to continue operating as independent rapporteurs.
Secondly, that the periodic universal reviews also include the participation of independent experts.
That is the only way we can guarantee the credibility of this Council.
(FI) Mr President, the results of the work of the UN Human Rights Council in its first year are under scrutiny.
The expectations of the international community have not yet been met.
The most regrettable example is probably the resolution on the situation in Darfur, whose content was watered down partly as a result of the continuing compromises.
The work has, understandably, been hampered by the fact that the operation and practices are still being developed.
Our proposals for a resolution highlights, as it ought, the problem areas in the work of the Human Rights Council.
Two matters in particular need to be paid attention to.
Firstly, we have to learn from history.
The work of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights (UNCHR), as the representative of the Human Rights Council, lost credibility, as sitting on the Council were countries which have glaringly violated human rights.
The EU must continue doggedly to push through the condition that membership of the Human Rights Council is based on an objective criterion and that requirements for membership are sufficiently strict.
The concept of human rights covers a very wide area.
Certain fundamental human rights must be unconditionally incorporated in the conditions of membership.
I think that the countries where Sharia courts are part of the judicial system are especially problematic.
The EU must fight to ensure that this Human Rights Council does not become a club for abusers of human rights, in the way of the body which precedes it.
The other matter relates to the relationship between the Universal Periodic Review mechanism and the special procedures employed in individual countries.
The EU needs to insist strongly that the work of the special experts in individual countries in the UN will in future be kept separate from the UPR and genuinely independent of governments.
I regard it as worrying that Member States could use the indirect right of veto in the UPR in connection with a debate on the situation in a country, so that they fail to produce their country-specific report.
I understand the limitations the Human Rights Council assembly puts on the EU's powers of influence.
Just the countries of Africa and Asia together can, with their 29 seats, steer the Council's work in a direction which differs from the aims of Western countries in the area of human rights.
The EU must now demonstrate real leadership and a strong will.
We should try and use the talks to break any regional blocs.
I wish to thank the German Presidency, which has shown exemplary firmness in its call for prohibiting the death penalty.
(PL) Mr President, it is now more than a year since the European Parliament cautiously welcomed the creation of the UN Human Rights Council to replace the discredited Commission on Human Rights.
We hoped that the new Council would become an institution that would help reform the UN and that it would make a determined effort to ensure greater respect for human rights the world over.
The European Union, the Member States and European Parliament delegations have all been actively involved in the work of the Council.
It is now time to assess the first year of the Council's operations.
Unfortunately, it has to be recognised that so far the creation of this new Council has not marked a turning point in the UN's activities in the area of human rights.
The interests of various countries still take precedence over the defence of threatened fundamental rights and freedoms.
This can best be illustrated by the Human Rights Council's inability to respond appropriately to the situation in Darfur.
A report on the tragic situation in that region was adopted in March, yet the Council as a whole was unable to draw logical conclusions from that report and deal with the problem of the Sudanese authorities' political responsibility for the political situation in that country.
It is also the case that the Council has condemned Israel eight times.
This demonstrates the imbalance in the Council's work and its political bias.
The fifth session of the Council is due to commence in a few days' time.
A European Parliament delegation will be present.
The Netherlands, Slovenia and Italy have now joined the Council.
Another European country to become a member is Bosnia-Hercegovina.
Belarus, currently governed by Mr Lukaszenko's authoritarian regime, has not been elected to the Council in order to avoid controversy.
We should ensure that Member States of the European Union become more involved in the work of the Council so that the latter is transformed into a body truly devoted to achieving respect for fundamental freedoms.
At stake are an effective human rights policy in the contemporary world and UN reform.
So too is the credibility of the European Union itself, and we would do well to remember that.
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this Parliament has always followed the United Nations reform process constructively as an advocate of effective multilateralism.
We want a strong UN, we want security and stability, we want an incisive war on poverty, and we want effective protection of human rights.
As chair of the working party of the European Parliament on relations with the UN, I also have a very personal interest in the achievement of these aims.
When the Human Rights Council was established as a new UN instrument, we warmly welcomed its creation, because it came with a set of very enticing promises: genuine election of members, rational working methods and the universal periodic review of all members.
And today?
Our resolution is highly critical: Angola, Qatar and Egypt have come on board to join nations like China and Cuba, and elections with a choice of candidates are virtually non-existent.
We only just managed to prevent the election of Belarus.
Members of the Organisation of Islamic Countries are in the majority in both the Asian and the African regional groups.
This means that they control and effectively block the activities of the entire Council, from country reports to the universal review.
I am on tenterhooks, Commissioner, regarding the fate of the package that was presented yesterday.
I hope we have grounds for optimism.
One of your remarks was particularly significant.
You said that the European Union can easily be outvoted.
This raises the question whether the West has done its homework.
This is a question for the Council or, even better, the Member States.
They were short-changed at the negotiations and did not even notice.
This was clearly down to a lack of work on the part of our governments.
But we parliamentarians must also ask ourselves whether our scrutiny, and that of our national counterparts, was strict enough.
I believe it was not.
This further reinforces the point that we parliamentarians must not leave the United Nations to our governments.
We must strengthen the parliamentary dimension of the UN.
Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, I am delighted by your critical appraisal of the first year of the Human Rights Council, because that body did not fulfil the hopes which were placed in it.
But the fact is that the institution exists and is still the main international forum.
