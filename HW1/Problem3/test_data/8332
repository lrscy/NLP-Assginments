After all, life does not stand still and new challenges will certainly arise.
Â Â  The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place in a few minutesâ time.
Â Â  â The regions are the building blocks of Europe; cultural differences and the promotion of regional diversity are among the main characteristics of the Union.
I am therefore pleased that more than oneÂ third of the Unionâs budget has been allocated to the Structural Funds for the new 2007-2013 period.
Supporting regional identity while pursuing convergence at a European level with regard to development and improving conditions for growth and employment is, in fact, an essential precondition for achieving the Lisbon objectives and boosting the economy, especially at local and regional levels.
It is actually the small-scale realities in Europe that drive the market, and the idea of strengthening competitiveness and involvement at this level, by promoting the partnership between public, private and non-governmental actors operating at a regional level, can only foster economic recovery, and that would benefit the Union overall.
I hope that the regions will take up this challenge and be able to transform the suggestions and resources provided by these institutions into definite plans for economic and social development, aiming above all at full employment and at the intelligent, sustainable use of the abundant high-quality human, artistic and natural resources that are available to us.
Â Â  The structural funds are essential for ensuring that the enhanced prosperity engendered by the single European market is spread move evenly and that less prosperous regions are helped to catch up.
The creation of a market at European level implies a European responsibility to ensure that all regions benefit.
My own constituency of Yorkshire and Humber has benefited immensely from the European structural funds.
South Yorkshire has had the highest level of targeting â âObjective Oneâ.
Much of the rest of the region has also benefited.
We will be welcoming Commissioner HÃŒbner to the region later this year to see some of the impressive projects that have been financed.
Although the accession of the new Member States has meant a re-focusing of these funds, I am delighted that the new package agreed for the next seven years will continue to see a continuation of this funding for Yorkshire and the Humber at a substantial, albeit reduced, level.
Â Â  I would like to express my support for the Commission proposal on establishing a Community legal instrument in the form of the European Grouping of Territorial Cooperation.
I wholeheartedly support this initiative. It stems from a need to improve current solutions and overcome difficulties in territorial cooperation resulting from the different legal systems and procedures.
I am convinced that this new initiative will make cross-border, interregional and international cooperation easier and more efficient.
The Treaty objective of achieving greater social and economic cohesion became particularly important after 1Â May 2004, when the European Union welcomed 10 new Member States, including Poland.
The poorest regions of the European Union lie precisely within the borders of these new Member States.
However, we cannot look at them from a purely economic point of view.
We need to see the cultural heritage of these regions and how much they have to offer their partners in cooperation.
Legal and administrative problems should not be allowed to impede progress and should be solved in a more effective manner than they have been to date.
I hope that the regulation on establishing a European Grouping of Territorial Cooperation, which represents nearly two years of legislative work, as well as the common position drawn up by the Council and the excellent reports drafted by MrÂ Olbrycht and adopted by the European Parliament will allow us to achieve this goal and create a model for European integration based on solidarity and harmony.
Â Â  â The European Council in December 2005 laid the foundations for the programming of the Structural Funds until 2013.
The package devoted to the four French overseas departments has been maintained at the same level as the 2000-2006 period, thanks to a sum of EURÂ 2.83Â billion.
I would like to emphasise this almost completely steady figure, which is due to the eligibility of the French overseas departments for the convergence objective and to their status as outermost regions, at a time when all regions in mainland France, and many regions in the EU, have unfortunately seen their aid cut considerably.
France, Spain and Portugal managed to get a specific allocation created to take account of the additional costs associated with the disadvantages of the outermost regions.
I find the lack of visibility of this new measure in the general regulation regrettable.
I call on the European Commission to show a degree of flexibility in implementing this aid, the procedures for which are included in the ERDF Regulation, because these additional operating costs do not exactly lend themselves to arithmetic quantification.
The overseas departments perform extremely well when it comes to managing European structural aid, in that they use the funds provided to them regularly and well.
It is up to them to continue to make good use of those funds.
Â Â  The next item is the vote.
Â Â  . Mr President, it is just a small amendment to get rid of an error that had crept into the text of recital G. We just want to substitute the word âundertakingâ for the word âregulatorâ, so that the recital will now read: âwhereas the issues dealt with by the Committee of Inquiry have a general significance that goes beyond the particular concerns of the European citizens who are directly affected, in particular as regards the adequate functioning of the internal market for insurance products, the correct implementation of Community law and the adequacy of redress mechanisms available to citizens, in particular in cross-border situations where the undertaking concerned is under home-country controlâ.
Â Â  After the words âcalls for the setting upâ, enter the phrase âby the end of 2006 of a committee of wise personsâ. After this, the sentence continues as normal: âand report back six months after the establishment of the Committeeâ.
This amendment takes place after having also been circulated among the shadow cabinets.
Â Â  . Mr President, I just want to insert the words âin the context of structural and cohesion policyâ into this amendment.
The words should be on your voting lists.
Essentially we agree that isolated territories have problems, but we believe this would be better addressed through structural and cohesion policies, so I should like to move that oral amendment.
Â Â  . Mr President, I shall see whether I can do any better with this oral amendment.
I wanted to get rid of the word âeventuallyâ.
At the moment the amendment would include the words âincluding eventually NOx emissionsâ, but I would like to remove the word âeventuallyâ.
The GUE/NGL Group, which tabled the amendment, is content with that.
Â Â  Mr President, I am very much in favour of the extension of the EUâs emissions trading system, at an early date, to include the air transport sector, but I am unable to support the final version of this resolution on the grounds that certain paragraphs of it refer to the equal treatment of the various modes of transport and to the introduction of a kerosene tax.
I would therefore ask that I should no longer be named as a draftsman of an opinion in relation to this resolution.
Â Â  Mr President, I just want to make it clear that this does not represent the views of the entire ALDE Group.
Â Â  That concludes the vote.
Â Â  Mr President, in view of the real floods of migrants, illegal immigration into Europe and associated crime are increasingly becoming a burning problem.
The only way we will be able to save these illegal immigrants from perishing most miserably on the journey or eking out their existence in the EU under slave conditions is to carry out educational work in their countries of origin and be strict about sending illegals back home.
That is what is called for now, as we should conclude from the Cavada report.
Â Â  Mr President, decisive action needs to be taken against smuggling.
Smugglers now earn similar amounts to drug dealers.
The European Union has deployed a large number of measures to combat smuggling, but those measures are not enough.
I am therefore glad that the European Union is now negotiating with the United Nations and has signed a supplementary protocol guaranteeing that in future joint measures will also be taken with other countries beyond the European Union to combat smuggling.
I therefore backed the European Unionâs signing of the supplementary protocol because it creates a further weapon in the fight against smuggling and thus also against organised crime.
Â Â  MrÂ President, my declaration relates to the second subject area, namely traffic in human beings.
As in the case of the smuggling of migrants, the European Union also signed an additional protocol on trafficking of persons.
Human trafficking is another of the major crimes of the present age and generates millions in profits at the expense of individual people.
The European Union adopts appropriate measures but is not able to deal with the problem on its own, hence the need to seek cooperation with countries outside the Union.
The United Nations protocol gives us a new instrument of international law, enabling all states affected by the problem to adopt more appropriate measures than hitherto in their efforts to combat human trafficking.
In this way we are adopting a humanitarian act on the one hand while fighting internationally organised crime with a very efficient additional instrument on the other.
Â Â  . Trafficking in human beings has reached alarming proportions.
It is estimated that some 700Â 000 people around the world fall victim to this crime every year.
This is a transnational phenomenon that requires a joint response from the international community, coordinated between the various stakeholders involved.
There needs to be effective cooperation in the fight against organised crime, by means of, for example, harmonising definitions of individual offences in the different national legal systems, mutual legal assistance and joint investigations.
The international community took a major step forward with the adoption of the United Nations Convention Against Organised Crime, ratified by 121 countries, plus the European Community, which is the first legally binding global instrument designed to combat criminal networks.
I welcome the fact that Portugal is one of these countries and hope that the other seven Member States that have yet to ratify it will do so at the earliest opportunity.
I welcome the conclusion of this protocol, which provides for stringent measures to combat trafficking in human beings, especially women and children, by protecting such persons against slavery, sexual exploitation and illegal employment. It also offers victims legal and material assistance, and provides for their physical and psychological recovery.
Â Â  . â Human trafficking affects more than 800Â 000 people a year.
This 'trade', which is linked to organised crime, is as profitable as the international arms and drugs trades.
The aim of human trafficking is sexual or economic exploitation, and it thus constitutes a modern form of slavery, showing complete disregard for the basic right to human dignity.
It will be difficult and expensive to combat this scourge, because the traffickers' networks are often international, and they benefit from the disparities between national laws and from loopholes in the coordination system.
I voted in favour of the Council's proposal on the conclusion of two additional protocols to the United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organised Crime, because they strengthen the coordination and harmonisation of procedures.
However, even though some progress has been made with regard to stopping and prosecuting traffickers, it is still absolutely vital to give the victims better protection.
The fact that these people are victims, and the rights related to that fact, need to be better recognised and applied; we need to systematically put forward measures to provide legal, material and psychological aid, and grant temporary residence permits or provide repatriation assistance.
Those victims who have the courage to denounce their traffickers deserve particular protection, because they often live in constant fear of reprisals.
Â Â  â Each year, almost 800Â 000 tonnes of car batteries, 190Â 000 tonnes of industrial batteries and accumulators and 160Â 000 tonnes of portable batteries are placed on the market in the European Union.
These batteries contain heavy metals (mercury, lead and cadmium) that are harmful to the environment and to human health.
Despite this, only six Member States have so far implemented a national collection system with a view to recycling used batteries.
Of those six, Belgium is the star pupil: it collects getting on for 60% of batteries.
I am in favour of the directive on which we are going to vote, which aims precisely to set up a system of this kind throughout the EU by 2008.
Some of the proposed measures particularly deserve our support: the general ban on marketing batteries and accumulators containing excessive quantities of heavy metals; the setting of quantified collection and recycling objectives; the requirement to state the true lifespan on the label, in order to inform consumers; and support for research aimed at developing more environmentally friendly batteries and new recycling techniques.
Â Â  .
Given that in 2002 almost half of all portable batteries sold in the EU-15 Member States were eventually incinerated or disposed of in landfills, this report is an important piece of environmental legislation.
The main points raised in this report cover the most important measures of reducing the harmful effects of battery waste.
The report requires Member States to ensure that manufacturers design appliances in such a way that spent batteries and accumulators can be readily removed, and that appliances be accompanied by instructions containing consumer information.
Producers will now be required to finance any net costs arising from the collection, treatment and recycling of waste batteries and accumulators, regardless of when these were placed on the market.
The capacity labelling of all portable and automotive batteries and accumulators will be introduced no later than 12 months after the date of transposition of the directive.
I agree that the report should promote research to make batteries less environmentally harmful and to encourage the development of new recycling technologies and that a 50% recycling target should be set for non-hazardous batteries.
Â Â  . In the depths of darkest East Anglia, are the good burghers crying out for a directive making it compulsory for batteries to be recycled?
No.
I suspect that most people havenât even thought of it and even if they become aware of this latest over-zealous piece of EU legislation, they will place the dud batteries from their transistor radios in the dustbin.
In the preamble to this directive it states: 'It is desirable to harmonise national measures concerning batteries and accumulators'.
Who decided it was âdesirableâ?
It is certainly an odd expression to use in this context.
A woman may be desirable but another dopey set of rules for harmonising the way we deal with batteries and accumulators â I think not.
However, this legislation places the entire financial burden of introducing these new recycling and disposal facilities on the producer.
Surely, in a sane world, i.e. one without the EU, when someone buys a product, he becomes responsible for its safe disposal.
The 'producer must pay for disposal principle' is a part of the EU mindset.
Stop dreaming up new ways to increase the cost of producing anything.
Businesses will not be able to afford to pay these extra costs.
Â Â  . The report before us today adopts the Council common position of 12Â JuneÂ 2006 on the European Social Fund for 2007-2013.
I wish to state that there are some, albeit not enough, positive aspects in this position and others to which we object.
Among the positive points, we wish to highlight social inclusion and gender equality.
The common position falls short, however, on areas such as the promotion of the quality of work, and a more proactive contribution towards reducing income disparities and social inequality with the objective of genuine economic and social cohesion.
It is a position that continues to reduce the scope of application to policies closely related to the guidelines and recommendations in the context of the European Employment Strategy and the Lisbon Strategy, which we know has served to exacerbate inequalities and to promote the deregulation of the labour market.
It is up to the Member States to define their priorities and the areas to be funded; in other words, there is some leeway for the Member States to implement it correctly.
Hence our abstention.
Â Â  I voted for MrÂ SilvaÂ Peneda's report.
Three quarters of the amendments tabled by our Committee on Employment and Social Affairs were accepted by the Council, acting by a qualified majority, and then by the European Commission.
The Austrian presidency of the Council played a vital role in securing the compromise; once again, its good work has borne fruit.
It has breathed life into the concept of 'flexicurity', working for flexible labour markets while defending social security and winning the approval of people in employment as well as those affected by unemployment.
The European Social Fund contributes to economic and social cohesion and is compatible with the new Lisbon Strategy.
It fosters employability through the creation of local partnerships and job-creation companies, especially in structurally weak areas.
It helps to combat youth unemployment and long-term unemployment, to overcome the shortage of skilled labour and to reduce social exclusion and discrimination.
I welcome the signs of willingness to involve the representative bodies of management and labour more fully in the design and implementation of projects.
The ESF is to develop into a guarantor of quality that supplements national programmes effectively rather than replacing them.
It makes important contributions to efforts to meet the challenges posed by globalisation and demographic change and to kick-start urgent reform of Member States' economic and social policies.
Â Â  . Over the last programming period and now within the enlarged Union, there has been a sense of the growing importance of protecting the environment whilst ensuring economic growth, improving access for the disabled to publicly financed facilities ensuring equality of treatment and eliminating discrimination in all its forms.
This report has paid particular attention to enabling a greater number of disadvantaged and underdeveloped regions to catch up with those which are more developed.
The regional competitiveness and employment objective also remains a central element of regional policy and a high level of available resources will be concentrated on those priorities.
Parliament has cooperated in negotiations with both the Presidency and the European Commission and one of Parliament's main achievements was obtaining a substantial increase in the financial resources dedicated to territorial cohesion, an important objective in the context of enlargement.
Parliament has not only been successful in the above-mentioned points, but its voice has also been heard in the areas of partnership.
Under the General Regulation, greater involvement of civil society and NGOs is desirable.
The Commission will make a statement on the abuse of Structural Funds by organised crime.
Â Â  . â I voted in favour of MrÂ Hatzidakis's recommendation laying down general provisions on the Structural Funds, and I was pleased to see that the new generation of programmes will be able to start in early 2007, which is vital for the continuity of activities in the Member States.
I nevertheless find it regrettable that, following the agreement on the financial perspective, the funds allocated to the structural policy for 2007-2013 are below the initial demands of Parliament and the European Commission.
With regard more specifically to the regulations, Parliament can take pride in the fact that a number of its demands have been taken up by the Council, in particular greater consideration for disabled people and sustainable development.
The new regulations will allow us to pursue the European Union's cohesion policy, which aims to develop the poorest areas and to improve the competitiveness of the EU as a whole.
Â Â  . The adoption today of the legislative package on cohesion, namely the proposal for a regulation on the general provisions of the Structural Funds, is a vitally important factor in the EU Member States and regions being able to finalise the national frames of reference and operational programmes, and begin to use the European funds from JanuaryÂ 2007.
As a result of fruitful negotiations with the Council, the text of the proposed regulation welcomes almost all of the main points that Parliament had raised in its provisional report adopted in 2005.
It is regrettable that the amount originally proposed by the Commission, which had Parliamentâs full support, for specific funding for integrating the outermost regions into the internal market, compensating for their particular difficulties, has not been enshrined.
In addition to additional funding for the outermost regions, a maximum cofinancing rate of 85% of eligible expenditure has been provided for.
Most importantly, special transitional â and more beneficial â arrangements have been laid down during the phasing-in stage of the new Regional Competitiveness and Employment objective for the autonomous region of Madeira.
I shall therefore be voting in favour of this recommendation.
Â Â  Although I regret the fact that, on 17Â May 2006, the European Parliament validated the next Financial Perspective for 2007-2013, we now have to come to terms with the meagre sums that emerge from it if we are to define the role and determine the size of the Structural Funds for the next few years.
With this in view, I am delighted with the clarity of the way in which European regional policy has now been constructed, focused as it is on three new objectives that are more coherent and more easily identifiable.
I am also pleased that the significant reductions in the level of funds now available to the EU will not have disastrous consequences for the outermost regions whose specific handicaps, as well as their underdevelopment, make it crucial for them to receive the aid supplied by Community instruments designed to promote solidarity.
In this way, the outermost regions will remain eligible for such aid in terms of the âConvergence, competitiveness and territorial cooperationâ objective (formerly Objective 1).
The additional specific allocation of EURÂ 35 per inhabitant will also enable us in part to meet their needs.
Finally, the objective of âEuropean territorial cooperationâ will enable the outermost regions to extend the work already done on developing synergies with neighbouring states in the Indian Ocean and the Caribbean.
For all these reasons, I have voted in favour of the report by MrÂ Hatzidakis.
Â Â  . The common position adopted today sets out the interinstitutional agreement giving tangible form to the financial framework for 2007-2013, in which the Structural Fund is EURÂ 28Â billion down on the Commissionâs proposal, a reduction from 0.41% of Community GNI in the current financial framework to 0.37%.
This will undermine effective economic and social cohesion, real convergence and the redistribution effect of the Communityâs budget.
There has been a significant shift in the objectives of the Structural Funds, whereby the accent is placed on competitiveness and on business interests, in line with the neoliberal Lisbon agenda, at the expense of cohesion.
The key objectives of the Funds are therefore public-private partnerships, the commercialisation of knowledge and research and the adaptability and mobility of the workers.
The N+2 rule has been kept and there is no guarantee, at least on the Councilâs part, that the money from the Structural Funds that has been cut and not implemented will continue to be used solely in this area.
I also wish to point out that the concessions granted at the December 2005 European Council on the eligibility criteria for cohesion countries in exchange for a cut in funds can now be extended to the remaining Member States.
We therefore voted against.
Â Â  . There are three reasons why the increase in the Structural Funds which, between 2007 and 2013, will represent 35.7% of the European Unionâs budget, that is to say EURÂ 307.9 billion, is a sham as far as France is concerned.
Although more than 16% of Brusselsâs budgetary revenue comes from French taxpayers, the proportion of European regional expenditure allocated to France keeps on falling and has been reduced from 10% in 1994 to less than 8% today.
Thus, the cantons of Franceâs Hainaut region, despite being affected by massive unemployment, are no longer entitled to Structural Funds under Objective 1.
Moreover, the increase in the share allocated to the regional budget is at the expense of the common agricultural policy, of which France is still the main beneficiary.
European regional policy is, above all, an economic sham.
In France, the Structural Funds are mainly intended for industrial regions in decline and for the redevelopment of rural areas, in other words for the victims of policy made in Brussels. Such policy is heavily responsible for ruining our agriculture and destroying whole swathes of our industry.
Â Â  â I did not vote (abstained) on the amended Hatzidakis report, because in it Parliament basically departs from its initial positions on all the major issues and countersigns the Council's common position, which weakens regional and social cohesion policies.
In other words:
- the resources available have been reduced from 0.41% for the period 2000-2006 to 0.37% for the period 2007-2013.
Resources have been reduced by EUR 28Â billion compared to the Commission's initial proposal, which for Parliament was the minimum financing needed in order to support cohesion and the environment;
- it abandons Parliament's position on the recycling of appropriations lost due to the strict application of the n+2 rule for regional policy.
Thus, the lost appropriations, which are expected to be high, will return to the national budgets of the richest Member States, at the expense of the poorer states and regions;
- it accepts clearly weakened financial support, both for the 16 regions which will fall victim to so-called 'statistical convergence', which include three Greek regions (Attica, Central Macedonia and Western Macedonia) and for the 12 'natural convergence' regions, which include two Greek regions (Sterea Ellada and the Southern Aegean);
- it agrees to the extension of the n+2 rule to Cohesion Fund projects, which will cause additional difficulties and losses.
Â Â  These funds should only go to the very poorest parts of Europe.
As things stand, the money is going to regions that are relatively well off.
This is unacceptable.
Â Â  â The framework decision on the Structural Funds is being used by the ÎU and centre-right and centre-left governments in order to speed up the objectives included in the anti-grassroots Lisbon Strategy, strengthen competitiveness and increase the profitability of capital, which is being promoted through capitalist restructurings and by striking at the wage and social rights of the workers.
The resources of the Structural Funds are being channelled to sectors which are of interest to the profitability of capital and, at the same time, 'crumbs' are being given in order to 'defuse' grassroots indignation and bring the working and grassroots class movement under control.
While social and regional inequalities are worsening in the EU, the weight of the Structural Funds in its budget for the period 2007- 2013 is being reduced from 0.41% to 0.37%.
At the same time, use is being made of the enlargement of the ÎU and urban statistics to exempt from financing areas which have major economic problems and huge infrastructure deficits.
The group of the Greek Communist Party in the European Parliament will be voting against the framework decision.
Â Â  . Under the Council common position on the new Cohesion Fund regulation, in common with the previous financial framework the Funds remain contingent on compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact and the Maastricht nominal convergence criteria.
That is to say, a cohesion country with a lower level of economic development is penalised twice over.
Being in a state of crisis it will fail to meet the Stability and Growth Pact criteria, and it will also run the risk of having its money from the Cohesion Fund taken back.
This is tantamount to blackmail, which is unacceptable.
We are also very much opposed to the extension of the N+2 (N+3) rule to the Cohesion Fund, taking account of the specific nature and the objectives of this fund.
It should be borne in mind that this rule, imposed by Germany in the previous Financial Framework 2000-2006 on the remaining Structural Funds, involves a cut in the funds not already implemented within two years (three years).
This clearly runs counter to the objective of the Structural Funds.
This new condition could have an even greater impact than the Cohesion Fund, taking account of the funding of major projects, giving rise to bigger difficulties in implementation and financing.
Â Â  . Today we have had the debate on Structural and Cohesion Funds and cross-border cooperation.
As far as the latter is concerned we have had this experience in Northern Ireland for many years and it has worked.
However, recently this has not occurred.
ICBAN â one of the longest established funding bodies has through its make-up become unbalanced.
On the ICBAN board there are twenty members, only three of whom are now from the unionist community.
The body is no longer balanced and is now discriminating against the unionist community.
It no longer has the support of unionists in the area.
This body has responsibility to spend EUR 25 million in the coming years.
This is an unacceptable situation which must be brought to an end.
If this discrimination continues then ICBAN funds must be frozen until there is total fairness.
Â Â  We have voted in favour of two reports that are aimed at reforming the EUâs Structural Policy.
The work that is now under way on the reform of this policy area is an important step in the right direction.
Generally, however, we advocate a more restrictive stance on EU regional aid.
We do not support regional contributions being used to finance housing or tourist activities. Nor do we support the proposed approach to research, which would extend a single research area to various seats of learning, rather than concentrating it on a smaller number of sites.
Â Â  . I supported amendments in the name of the Verts/ALE Group which sought to adopt guidelines on fair competition, social standards and environmental protection for tramp vessel services.
These amendments also called for special account to be taken of the specific situation of small and medium-sized ship owners.
Unfortunately these amendments were defeated.
The resulting report overall goes against proposals by the Commission aimed at breaking down cartels in maritime transport.
Therefore I voted against the final report because I believe that in many respects the Commissionâs original proposal was better suited to lowering maritime transport costs, without endangering the reliability of services.
Â Â  Maritime transport represents approximately 45% of the European Unionâs external trade in terms of value and almost 75% in terms of volume.
Applying the general rules of competition law to international tramp services and cabotage does not in reality present any problem as these activities are already deregulated and operate on the basis of fair competition.
It is abolishing the exemption, granted in 1986, of liner conferences from the competition rules that, alone, has been the subject of genuinely bitter discussions between all the players in this sector.
I think that the solutions produced by MrsÂ Wortmann-Koolâs and my own reports in this regard are perfectly balanced and respect the interests at stake.
Indeed, there is not at present any evidence that the liner conference sector needs to be protected from competition in order to provide its services.
In order to preserve the legal certainty of the maritime sector, it seemed necessary, moreover, to lay down guidelines enabling operators to adapt to the new regulatory framework and to facilitate a smooth transition to a competitive regime.
If all the precautions taken by Parliament in this matter are respected, there is no doubt that maritime transport will benefit.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to explain why I voted against the Lamassoure report on the EUâs system of own resources. I voted this way along with the other MEPs from the Czech Civil Democratic Party (ODS).
I strongly believe that the reform of the EUâs system of own resources agreed between the Council and the Commission is a decent compromise, which Parliament should not have torpedoed.
On the contrary, Parliament would have been well advised to show its support for such progress.
Above all, we welcome the fact that no European tax will be introduced in the foreseeable future.
Broadly speaking, the current system works and guarantees proper funding of the Union.
There is therefore no real reason to jettison it and replace it with a new system.
Accordingly, I cannot accept the critical stance of the Lamassoure report.
Â Â  Even after the British rebate is taken into account the EU is scheduled to cost the UK Â£4Â 298 million in 2006.
Considering that the net cost has been of this order every year, it is staggering just how much of our national resources we have poured into the black hole of Europe.
And for what?
Think of the real infrastructural change this vast volume of money could have made if spent internally on the real needs of the UK since 1973.
Though there are now 25 Member States, the UK this year will contribute one eighth (12.4%) of the total budget revenue of Â£83 billion required to fund the EU in 2006.
Little wonder the tide of Euro-scepticism continues to rise.
At a time of acute pressure on our health service and vital education sector, it is appalling that we are wasting so much taxpayers' money on a failing political union.
With Blair having agreed to surrender the British rebate by stages and as the real cost of enlargement builds, the situation will only get worse.
Â Â  I voted in favour of the excellent report by my colleague, MrÂ Lamassoure, on the proposal for a decision of the European Council on the system of European Communitiesâ own resources.
In order to move ahead with the construction of a political European Union, we urgently need to reform its budgetary framework.
The difficult achievement of an agreement on the financial perspective 2007-2013 by the European Council in December 2006 and the Commissionâs proposals do not make the Unionâs funding transparent, since it appears that we are getting further away from the principle of budgetary equity which currently underpins the Member Statesâ contributions to the Unionâs operations.
The debate on own resources, against the backdrop of the prospect of a federal Europe, will probably be one of the thorniest political issues to be faced in the future.
Nevertheless, in the immediate future and in view of the current deficiencies in European finances and those of the main net contributing Member States, I wonder whether the time has come to set up a great European investment loan in order to fund all of the major infrastructures (space, motorways, high-speed railways, communication technologies, ports, airports, and so on) which are necessary for economic development and social progress.
Â Â  We have today voted against MrÂ Lamassoureâs report on a Council decision on the European Communitiesâ own resources.
While it is important that a budget process that is more efficient and transparent be created for the EU, we reject any notion of future tax-levying by the EU on the likes of energy, VAT or corporate income.
Â Â  I have chosen to abstain in the vote on the report on the proposal for a Council decision on the system of the European Communitiesâ own resources.
As problems and opportunities become more and more cross-border in nature, the European Union is becoming an ever more important forum for solving such problems and best exploiting such opportunities.
While I hope that the process of better legislating can clear up a whole raft of issues that I believe should be handled at the national level â and indeed why not even the regional level â I see that the majority of areas that are so important for European citizens need a common approach.
The issues in question are, amongst others, the environment, research and development and energy, these being areas where we can create healthier surroundings with more jobs and long-term growth.
In principle, I am therefore in favour of a new system of financing for the Community.
On the other hand, I do not believe that the current contributions from the Member States, which are more a reflection of the ability to negotiate rebates than of what the Member States see as the needs within the EU, should be replaced by a new form of own resources based on energy, VAT or corporate income, as proposed by the Commission.
That would not be a more equitable system.
I am, nevertheless, in favour of large parts of the report on which we are voting.
Clearly, simplification and greater transparency are things that I welcome.
Â Â  Over and above the political agreement on the Financial Perspective for 2007-2013, the negotiations that took place at the meetings of the Council on 15 and 16Â December 2005 confirmed the need to change the own resources system.
At a time when European integration appears to have stalled â due in particular to the tendency to take refuge in national self-interest and to the disjunction between the people and the Community institutions â the non-transparent nature of this bargaining and the fact that each Member State wishes to view the budgetary issue solely in terms of its own particular interests have highlighted the urgency of providing ourselves with a clear and unambiguous own resources system that, as far as possible, extricates the EU from current contingencies in relation to national budgets.
It is vital that the European Parliament, as the representative of the nations, take part in this process.
MrÂ Lamassoureâs report, which is being put to the vote today, is part and parcel of this process, and its conclusions â which tie up with a large proportion of the concerns expressed above â are along the right lines, designed as they are to bring about a Europe that is in control of its financial resources and closer to the people.
Even though I should have liked the possibility already to have been mentioned of a European corporate tax as a new own resource for the EU, I have therefore voted in favour of this document.
Â Â  The Lamassoure report is basically about the EU bringing about a situation in which it has comprehensible own resources that match its aspirations and that do not depend on contributions by the Member States and its doing so, of course, between now and 2008 and without waiting for the multiannual programming of the budget to come to an end.
It has to be deduced from all this that Parliament wants to see a European tax, and quickly.
What is it playing at?
This is a veritable assault on democracy in which the ground rules that have only just been established for the next six years are to be changed in barely two yearsâ time and to be so just after the expected changes in government in several Member States, notably in those whose populations rejected the Constitution.
An unspoken attempt is manifestly being made to create a state, because an organisation with tax-raising powers is effectively a state.
It may not have a constitution and it may lack legitimacy, but it is a state all the same, empowered, like the Member States, to put pressure on the taxpayer.
With its powers in the commercial sphere, the European Union has had properly coherent resources that have genuinely been its own, namely customs duties.
Ever since it was founded, the EU has been contriving to destroy those resources.
What it should, therefore, be doing is reinstating them.
This would be a sensible thing to do, increasing its resources and protecting the European economies against unfair competition.
Â Â  . As regards the system of own resources for 2007-2103, the Council opted to maintain the British cheque (except for enlargement expenditure) and to extend similar privileges to the other net contributors, namely Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and Sweden, by reducing VAT rates and direct GNI contributions and the increased rate of retention of traditional own resources, as well as âchequesâ under the Structural and Rural Development Funds.
These reductions will be paid for by the other Member States including cohesion countries, which will be penalised twice over. They will be paying bigger contributions to the Community budget and the Structural and Cohesion Funds will be reduced.
This situation is unfair and unacceptable and on its own justifies our vote against.
That being said, there are those who advocate a new system for own resources based on European taxes, which we oppose.
We feel that a fair system of own resources must be based on GNI and on relative wealth of each Member State, whereby the budgetary contribution effort should be the same for all citizens right across the EU.
This would deliver solidarity and redistribution, alongside spending, bearing in mind the objective of genuine convergence and economic and social cohesion.
Â Â  . I abstained on the Lamassoure report on own resources even though it included several good ideas for improving the present system.
I could not agree with the rapporteur's view about the UK abatement.
I remain convinced that this is justified under the present system and that wider reforms need to be undertaken before any further changes are made to the UK rebate.
Â Â  . Bearing in mind that the US budget, for one year alone, amounts to USDÂ 2Â 500Â billion, it is obviously untenable for the EU to have, for everyone, a budget of less than EURÂ 1Â 000Â billion for 2007 to 2013.
Initially, and in order to give itself some room for manoeuvre without increasing its budget, the European Commission is gradually eliminating the common agricultural policy and Europeâs small farmers in order to recover most of the EURÂ 45Â billion spent each year on the agricultural budget.
Hence, the unlikely position taken by the European negotiators who, at the meeting of the World Trade Organisation on 30Â June 2006, accepted, behind the scenes, a 50% reduction in our customs duties, thereby leaving Brazil with a monopoly on food.
The basic problem remains intact, however.
Everyone knows that, as from 2014, Brussels-centred Europe will be doomed to increase its budget and to create a European tax.
Behind the smoke and mirrors, the Lamassoure reportâs talk of own resources raises the political issue that has been dragging on since 1951 and that concerns the actual emergence, by way of a single market and then a single currency, of a political state.
What the euro did not do and what the Constitution failed to do, because the nations woke up to what was happening, taxation is set to do between 2014 and 2019.
Taxpayers have been warned.
Â Â  The discussion about the EU budget has hitherto focused exclusively on constantly increasing the size of the budget and seeking new sources of revenue.
Instead of clamouring automatically for a European tax, we should be subjecting the expenditure structure to close examination.
Billions of euros from our common budget continue to seep out into dubious channels or are cast aimlessly to the four winds.

For this reason, the first thing we need is a top-class anti-fraud system; secondly, we need to curb administrative expenditure through measures such as the abandonment of one of the seats of Parliament and the assessment of expenses on the basis of actual costs incurred; thirdly, there are billions to be saved by not foisting enlargements on our unwilling citizens.
Â Â  In the light of the very technical report by my fellow Member, MrÂ Lamassoure, concerning the EUâs own resources, I think it vital to draw attention to the idea put forward by Belgium and by Guy Verhofstadt a few years ago: that of giving the EU genuine financial autonomy via the introduction of what has been called a European tax.
An additional tax?
Surely not.
The idea is simply that, rather than pay what is due to Europe to their own nations, Europeans should be allowed to fund the EU directly, in the way that Americans fund the federal state.
For the individual European, it is a plan that would, therefore, have no great significance at all from a financial point of view but that would be pregnant with symbolism, since everyone would thus be made aware of the portion of his or her tax devoted to European integration.
I would point out, incidentally, that Europe costs each European 26 cents per day.
Although the plan is warmly welcomed by certain Member States (notably Austria and Luxembourg), others remain nervous about an instrument intended, nonetheless, to bring Europe closer to its citizens.
The plan would also enable us to leave behind the sterile debate between states that are net contributors and those that are net beneficiaries.
Europe would then, most certainly, have resources in keeping with its ambitions.
Â Â  . The current method of funding the Community budget has become obsolete, and in recent years the shortcomings have come to the fore.
Recent budgetary debates have turned into a humiliating exercise in which we end up discussing, one by one, who is and is not a net contributor.
The current system, with so many exceptions and derogations, has become complex and opaque.
In this context, the EU urgently needs to reform its funding system.
I therefore welcome the fact that Parliament has managed to introduce an interim review timetabled for 2008/2009 into the negotiations on the latest financial perspective 2007-2013.
This will provide a unique opportunity for a root and branch assessment of the system of own resources.
As MrÂ Lamassoure said in his report, I am in favour of a Community budget funding system that is transparent, fair and equitable, one that provides the EU with a financial framework that matches its current priorities and its legitimate ambitions.
The guiding principle behind any reform should be the financial independence of the EU in relation to the Member Statesâ current transfers, and the strengthening of the European character of the budget.
This will ensure that future debate will not once again descend into a battleground of Member Statesâ national interests.
Â Â  . The five biggest non-financial multinationals in the Top 7 since 1990 had assets of around USDÂ 1Â 280Â billion in 2003, in other words over 3% of the worldâs GNI.
The biggest financial multinational, Citibank, alone had that amount in assets, which demonstrates the power that the financial sector wields in the real economy.
The real aim of what is referred to as consolidating the financial services sector is to consolidate the internal market for financial services and to integrate the financial markets, with a view to scrapping the barriers to the free movement of capital that still exist, and to encourage company mergers and acquisitions, in sectors such as banking, to enable them to compete in the globalised market.
We are opposed to this trend, as expressed in the resolution before us, of which the euro is an instrument and the objectives of which are laid down in the financial services action plan.
The gradual financialisation of the real economy has not only led to significant job losses, it has also helped to turn the real economy into a parasite economy by diverting manufacturing investment, and to encourage financial, and subsequently economic, crises due to the extremely volatile nature of the financial markets and the speculative bubbles that they create.
This casino economy has only increased the profits of the major brokerage firms, especially in the banking sector.
Hence our vote against.
Â Â  . The UK Conservative Delegation abstained on the final vote of this report.
We endorse many of the proposals in the Szejna report on developments in and prospects for company law, in particular, the need to apply better regulation principles, the necessity to take account of the needs of SMEs and the importance of developing best practice which respects the different traditions and systems of Member States.
We also support many of the detailed proposals for improving transparency and the rights of stakeholders.
However, there are a number of proposals that we cannot support, as they would introduce additional EU regulations in areas where there would be no demonstrated benefits to the evolution of an effective internal market for financial services.
We also endorse the benefits for companies of involving their employees in workplace decision-making, but reject the imposition of any âone size allâ statutory model of participation.
We therefore voted against Paragraph 3 and Recital F.
Â Â  â Mr President, I wish to explain my vote on the Lucas report, which in common with the other MEPs from the Czech Civil Democratic Party (ODS) was a vote against.
Air transport has undergone rapid development over the past 40 years, which has led to a 40%-plus fall in emissions and noise.
There is no scientific evidence that we need the kind of excessive regulation proposed in the Lucas report.
Raising fuel taxes will reduce the competitiveness of Europeâs air carriers and raise prices for the end user.
Weakening the competitiveness of air transport will hamper the EU still further on the world stage.
This is simply further evidence of the current fashion for environmental concerns, which is why we voted against.
Â Â  Mr President, I voted on the Lucas report in support of measures to lessen the impact on climate change.
It is vital that all industries play their part, including the aviation industry.
However, we need to ensure that measures we propose are both sensible and practical.
Merely increasing taxes will not by itself reduce emissions.
Neither can the aviation industry trade emissions with itself: it needs to do so in cooperation with other industries.
Of course, air travel has increased over the years, as it is no longer restricted to just the middle classes and the rich.
For example, in the UK alone, 30 million people â i.e. half the population â travel by air at least once a year.
These people all welcomed the European initiatives that encouraged low-cost airlines and forced the major carriers to reduce their fares.
Thus the European public do not support the aim of some colleagues in the House to outlaw low-cost budget airlines or force them out of business.
This same public, though, is concerned about climate change.
They want a fair and sensible taxation system and measures that must be taken in cooperation between government and industry.
All these measures must be considered in relation to the needs and wishes of these consumers in a way that ensures that environmental concern is at the very top of the agenda.
Â Â  . I welcome the Commission Communication of September 2005, which begins to address the most effective ways of tackling the international increase of greenhouse emissions' increase of 73% from 1990 to 2003.
The extension of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) to the aviation sector may be the best way forward to limiting these emissions and to ensuring that aviation, like all other sectors, contributes to reducing harmful greenhouse gases.
The most important issue moving forward is to examine the effectiveness of the technical design elements for the policy to deliver its full potential for environmental and economic efficiency, while also giving special attention to the situation of Ireland and other isolated territories, which are so particularly dependent on air transport services, both capital and regional areas.
In addition, the impact on prices and the allocation of emission rights need further examination.
Given Irelandâs geographical circumstances, aviation is a critical element of our infrastructure, with air services being of vital importance for economic and social reasons.
Consequently, a competitive market between air transport operators is necessary for Irelandâs economic competitiveness.
Â Â  We Swedish Conservatives would like aviation to be included in the European Emissions Trading Scheme.
That would be an effective and fair way of internalising the environmental costs that aviation causes, in accordance with the âpolluter paysâ principle.
We regret the fact that the Swedish Government has chosen to implement a special arrangement for flight taxes in Sweden.
To do so distorts competition and weakens Swedenâs competitiveness whilst providing only small benefits to the environment, or none at all, in comparison with the introduction of emissions trading for aviation.
The fact that the report advocates the introduction of a separate emissions trading scheme means that we Swedish Conservatives are unable to support it.
A separate system means that we risk achieving a lower total reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, and, what is more, at a significantly higher cost than is necessary.
We Swedish Conservatives do believe that emissions trading should be introduced, but this must be done in the right way.
The dramatic reduction in the price of flying in Europe is a basically positive development that has brought prosperity, freedom of movement and interaction between people.
We regret the fact that the rapporteur and the majority in this House seem to be of the opposite opinion, and we do not, therefore, back the calls in the report for further tax rises of various kinds on aviation.
Â Â  . Labour MEPs fully support action to combat the climate change impact of aviation.
We support the principle of inclusion of aviation emissions in the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) and ask the Commission to come forward with workable proposals.
We abstained on some paragraphs in this report which were contradictory or whose implications have not been fully costed or worked out.
Â Â  . I will be voting for this report on reducing the climate change impact of aviation.
Aviation is one of the most rapidly growing sources of greenhouse gases.
In terms of raising this important issue, I agree with the rapporteur almost entirely.
Nevertheless some of her proposals, for example the immediate introduction of kerosene tax on VAT or all intra-EU flights or the establishment of a separate emissions trading scheme for aviation, have neither been costed nor impact-assessed.
Equally, the problems of peripherality in my own region of South-West England mean that special attention must be paid to the most isolated areas, such as, in my region, Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly.
In the case of Gibraltar, a particular complex of geographical and political isolation has been caused by the attitude of the Spanish authorities.
Therefore I look forward to the Commission using this report as the basis for bringing forward costed and workable proposals for action.
Â Â  . Yes, aviation is a factor in climate change.
Although aviation fuel has become increasingly efficient in the course of the last 40 years, total fuel consumption has at the same time increased because of the large growth in air traffic.
A situation must be prevented in which aviation emissions become a long-term major contributor to climate change.
There is no quick technical solution.
That is why it is vital to bank simultaneously on integrating the impact of aviation into the Community emissions rights exchange system and on pursuing research, improving the management of air traffic and introducing energy taxation.
This new sally against climate change should not, however, be engaged in at any price.
The system to be put in place must not penalise our European airlines in the world market, and any unfair competition with other forms of transport should also be prevented.
The choices shortly to be made by the Commission in its legislative proposal are therefore of vital importance, and the various options will have to be assessed very carefully.
I urge the Commission to propose solutions that are rational in both economic and environmental terms.
It must avoid at any price creating a pernicious system in which the weight of bureaucracy puts European aviation out of the running in the international market.
Â Â  . British Conservatives have voted in favour of this report because we recognise the impact aviation emissions have on climate change.
They account for some 4% of carbon emissions in the EU and air traffic movements are set to double by 2020 compared to 2003.
We are in favour of including aviation emissions in an emissions trading scheme, either by addition to the present scheme or possibly within a more limited scheme.
This would allow the airlines to cooperate with the national and EU authorities to apply rules that meet their aims of achieving the highest possible environmental standards without unduly penalising EU travellers and, if they are operated on flights into and out of the EU, operators would pay no more than their non-EU competitors.
Any EU scheme would best be operated eventually as part of a global approach.
We are not in favour of a kerosene tax or including air travel within the VAT system.
We do not want to damage the EU air transport industry and the publicâs reasonable expectation of cheaper air travel.
We look to the Commission to learn from its early mistakes in the emissions trading system and to pilot an ETS for the aviation industry.
Â Â  . Air transport is the most commonly used method of long distance travel, and this has had a serious environmental impact in terms of greenhouse gas emissions.
I feel that emission charging and emission trading licenses is an appropriate way of addressing the problem.
I also welcome the inclusion in this proposal of internal flights and flights starting or finishing in the EU, and the creation of a single European airspace, which will make it possible to cut down on air routes.
Nevertheless, I believe that the attention must be paid to the special case of remote, outlying regions that are difficult to access, and therefore highly dependent on air transport.
I am therefore only supporting the report because the amendment providing for special attention to be paid to the outermost regions and remote regions has been adopted.
Such regions would have been seriously harmed had the new aviation charges been applied uniformly across the European area.
Â Â  .
Air transport is the most commonly used method of long distance travel, yet the emissions from aviation run counter to the global objective of reducing emissions.
The measures proposed in this report, especially emission charging and emission trading licenses, strike me as an appropriate way of addressing the problem of the influence of aviation.
Another important proposal in the report is the inclusion of internal flights and all flights that start or finish in the EU, with a view to preventing market imbalances.
The report also proposes that a single European airspace be set up, which will make it possible to cut down on air routes, given that more direct flights will involve less gas emission.
There is one detail, however, to take into account, which is the unique context of the remote and outermost regions.
I am therefore supporting the report because the amendment providing for special attention to be paid to the outermost regions and remote regions has been adopted.
Such regions would have been seriously harmed had the new aviation charges been applied uniformly across the European area.
Given that access to these regions is difficult and time-consuming, air transport is extremely important to them.
Â Â  . I voted for the Lucas report on the impact of aviation on climate change.
I fully support action to combat the climate change impact of aviation.
I also support the principle of the inclusion of aviation emissions in the Emissions Trading Scheme and hope the Commission will come forward with a workable proposal.
I abstained on a number of paragraphs simply because I do not believe the impact of the proposals has yet been fully evaluated.
For example, I abstained on the call for an end to VAT exemption for air transport because it is not clear if this will help tackle climate change or merely hurt the less well-off traveller.
Â Â  . I fully support action to combat the climate change impact of aviation.
I support the principle of inclusion of aviation emissions in the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) and support the call for the Commission to come forward with workable proposals.
I abstained on some paragraphs in this report which were contradictory or whose implications have not been fully worked out.
Â Â  More than a year ago, together with 13 of my Belgian fellow Members in the European Parliament, I signed a petition in La Libre Belgique, asking the 25 Heads of State or Government to go beyond the objectives of the Kyoto Protocol.
Of the proposals put forward, the one to be given priority was about including emissions from the aviation and maritime transport sectors in the forthcoming climate protection plans.
That is why I am delighted today with your ambitious vote on the Lucas report, which anticipates a whole battery of measures to combat the environmental impact of aviation including, in particular, the end of the exemption of aviation fuel from VAT.
The current situation is worrying. Aviation emissions cancel out a quarter of the modest results obtained in the fight against greenhouse gases.
Let me be clear. It is not a question of imposing taxes indiscriminately but of bringing to an end an imbalance that does not sufficiently encourage the aviation sector to invest in the new technologies, with the environment being the first to suffer.
Global warming is the major challenge of the 21st century, and Europe must, emphatically, continue to set an example.
Â Â  . I agree with the general thrust of this report, but believe that there are still considerable problems with the result of todayâs vote: firstly, that the impact of the suggestions is largely uncosted and has a disproportionate impact; secondly, that the Emissions Trading Scheme should include air transport but that there should not be a separate scheme which runs by its side.
This would undermine the current ETS.
Some of this report contradicted the very workable proposals of the Commission and as such made little sense.
Â Â  Although the objective of reducing the climate change impact of aviation, notably by reducing CO2 emissions, is much to be commended, I think it vital for our Parliament to take account of the situation of the most remote regions of the EU.
If removing the aviation industryâs exemption from VAT and introducing a tax on kerosene were to become real options, the effect on the economies of the most isolated regions, as well as on the mobility of their populations, would be disastrous.
That would be true, in particular, for island regions, which have neither road nor rail links with the rest of the EU, and even more so for the outermost regions, in which people depend exclusively on air transport in order to get about.
I would thank Members of the European Parliament for having adopted my amendment asking that Community legislation give particular attention to the most isolated territories that are heavily dependent on air transport and, in particular, the islands and outermost regions, where the alternatives to air transport are either extremely limited or, indeed, totally non-existent.
Â Â  . I fully support action to combat the climate change impact of aviation emissions in the Emissions Trading Scheme and ask the Commission to come forward with workable proposals.
I abstained on some paragraphs in this report that were contradictory or whose implications have not been fully costed or worked out.
Â Â  I voted in favour of the excellent report by my colleague, MrsÂ Korhola, on the compromise reached with the European Council on the draft regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council in the field of information, public participation and access to justice in environmental matters.
I am pleased that wisdom has been applied to this difficult issue, the legal complexity of which has greatly delayed its political adoption.
The transparency achieved for programmes funded by the European Investment Bank is excellent.
The role of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) has quite rightly been defined in this measure by referring to âresponsibleâ NGOs.
The compromise achieved by Parliamentâs delegation led by MrÂ Vidal-Quadras is fundamentally satisfactory and well balanced.
Adoption at third reading is, in the end, a success for the European Parliament.
Â Â  The next item is the Commission statement on the economic and social consequences of business restructuring in Europe.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, record profits on the one hand, plant closures and relocations on the other.
Many people in the EU nowadays ask themselves the same vexed question every day: when will it hit me?
When will my job be on the line? When will it be my turn?
In the transformation process in Central and Eastern Europe alone, entire economies have collapsed, and millions of jobs have gone. People have understood this, however, because it was the result of Communist mismanagement.
Yet many are unable to understand what is happening in many industries in the older EU Member States: textiles, shoes, furniture, household appliances, pharmaceuticals and cars â manufacturing industries that have always been considered secure â are hitting the skids.
Very few people have been prepared for this structural change we are witnessing.
It is therefore high time to help the many people who have lost their bearings to reorientate themselves.
The significance of today's discussion extends far beyond the possible closure of a car-manufacturing plant in Portugal.
It is a discussion about the future of employment in Europe.
The time has also come to spell out a few home truths.
Firstly, we have entered a new phase of competition, and the pace of structural change is set to quicken still further.
We must not close our eyes to that.
Competition is a fact of life, whether we like it or not.
Nor is it a question of whether we can survive competition intact.
The great social question of our time is how many people's prospects will be ruined by this competition; to put it another way, the great social issue of our time is the future of our jobs.
It is time we faced up to that question.
Whoever still believes that other issues take precedence is out of touch with the world of today and its challenges.
We need more sustainable, environmentally safe growth, and we need more and better jobs, otherwise the social face of Europe will turn cold and cynical, which would be an affront to our European principles of shared responsibility between the individual and society, of solidarity, social justice and social cohesion.
The key word for a European society of the 21st century that seeks to offer its people new prospects is âcompetitivenessâ.
We are all well aware that Fortress Portugal, Fortress Germany, Fortress Poland or Fortress Europe is not an option in the open world of the 21st century.
We must embrace open competition; we must capture the high ground and draw competition upwards in search of the best solutions, the best technology and the highest standards.
Secondly, we have launched a common European policy for growth and employment.
This policy must now be vigorously pursued in Europe, nationally and regionally, otherwise we shall be gazing time and again in dismay at one breach after the other in our social model in the form of closed factories and research laboratories that have relocated overseas â which has already been happening.
I would warn anyone against the notion that we can easily put up with production facilities moving away because we still have research and development.
Once production has gone, research and development will follow.
A policy for growth and employment must be a policy that creates a favourable business climate for all companies.
It is in business, in companies, that jobs are created, and it is companies that axe jobs too. No edict from the government of a Member State or from the EU as a whole can change that in the slightest.
We can however pursue a policy that creates external conditions which make it possible and attractive for companies to do their work, to expand, to invest and to create jobs in Europe.
That is the meaning of the term âbusiness-friendly policyâ.
Thirdly, an active industrial policy that keeps industry in Europe is more essential than ever before.
The illusion that industry can now be consigned to museums is just as false as the notion that industry is first and foremost the worldâs chief polluter.
I advise anyone who still thinks in these terms to think again.
Those who would drive industry out of Europe are playing with the futures of the people who work in industry, the futures of the people who work in industry-related services â sectors that employ not only millions of people but many tens of millions â and the futures of the small and medium-sized enterprises all the way up the supply chain; in short, they are playing with the future of Europe itself.

We need to maintain a strong industrial sector in Europe with companies that perform in the global marketplace.
We are not simply looking for European champions; we need leaders in the world market, for our firms are effectively competing in a global arena.
No government can make them successful; that is down to the companiesâ own efforts.
We can, however, back them to the hilt.
This was the task of the High-Level Group CARSÂ 21. Twelve million jobs in the European Union are linked directly or indirectly with vehicle manufacturing.
We have spoken to all the stakeholders about what can and must be done to maintain a strong automotive industry in Europe.
I hope Parliament will understand why, on the issue of future exhaust-emission standards, I argue against a policy of âhead down and chargeâ and in favour of formulating proposals that we can put on the table when the time comes, secure in the knowledge that our high standards are technologically feasible and that they will also be affordable for most people.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are already able to build a car with zero emissions today, but there is nobody I know personally who could afford such a car, and I imagine no one in this Parliament could afford one either.
We must do our bit to ensure that it remains possible to manufacture and sell European cars â not for the sake of the cars, not even for the sake of those who buy and drive them but for the sake of the people who need those jobs.
Another thing is that an active industrial policy does not stop at the borders of the old European Union but encompasses the new Member States too.
Enlargement is not the curse of the European labour force, nor is it the cause of structural change.
The truth is that, in 17 out of 20 industries, the old EU has a huge advantage; only in three industries do the new Member States now have a competitive edge.
One of these, indeed, is the car industry. That, however, will only help us when China and other newly developed countries become more powerful competitors in the automotive market.
As for the automotive industry itself â which, of course, was the trigger for this debate â I wish to express my firm conviction that we shall keep our car industry in Europe in the long term, and it will be strong, but it will look rather different in ten yearsâ time than it looks today.
There will be consolidations.
You need only read todayâs newspapers to learn of transatlantic talks on that very subject.
What we can predict with some degree of certainty is a mixed picture â one picture for Western Europe and another for Central and Eastern Europe.
We shall no longer see any significant growth in vehicle output in Western Europe.
There will only be a slight increase in demand.
Productivity is likely to grow faster than demand, and anyone with any knowledge of economics knows what that means: it means that the pressure on car-manufacturing jobs in the older Member States will become even greater.
As far as we know, the major European manufacturers â and the same applies to General Motors â have no plans to shift any of their production capacity out of Western Europe.
They will, however â and this is the salient point â establish new production facilities where demand for their products is greatest.
This trend is already clearly observable throughout the entire European car industry.
On the plus side, however, we see that not only European manufacturers but those from other parts of the world too are starting to concentrate research and development capacities in Europe once more, especially in the old locations.
In this respect too, the European operations of General Motors are no exception.
Enterprises, ladies and gentlemen, bear a great social responsibility for Europe, and that must become apparent across the board.
I am not one to criticise every corporate relocation decision out of hand, nor am I entitled to do so.
Besides, it would be foolish to do so, for the globalisation of production and research is unavoidable if a company is to succeed in the long term in a competitive industry.
I do, however, criticise those who put short-term profit before sustainable solutions.
I criticise those who, when they come under pressure, choose to cut and run as the cheapest option, with no regard for the people they put out on the street.
I criticise those who pay themselves huge salaries but are not worth a penny as responsible managers, because they have driven their company to the wall and squandered the jobs it once provided.
I want to see companies in Europe that are constantly striving upwards, that take innovation to new levels, that can alter their profile, that train their staff to cope with new tasks too.
We, of course, have a duty to help them in all of this.
Yet we must also point out the limits of political action.
Corporate decisions to close or relocate plants are decisions taken by companies, and no government and no European Union can overrule them, whether in the case of Azambuja or in any other case.
We do, however, have some very clear rules, and we must insist vigorously on their observance.
These include the key issue of dialogue between management and labour, for example.
When a plant is to be closed or relocated, this dialogue must include the following question: what has the company done to give its redundant employees a new future, for example in terms of training, further education and industrial retraining?
From this follows another question: what have we done to help it?
We also have the instrument of aid for companies in difficulty, which was also used in the Azambuja case.
Aid awards were authorised in 2002. The plantâs difficulties, in other words, are not entirely new.
Let me make it very clear, however, that the payments of state aid which were authorised in that case and which took the form of investment support from the Portuguese budget were granted under European rules, which stipulate that the beneficiary company must remain at its location for at least five years after making the investment for which it has received support.
At the request of the Commission, the Portuguese Government is currently investigating whether the plant also received money from European funds.
If it did, this would be another point on which we should have to insist on strict fulfilment of our conditions, and I can promise you that the Commission will do that.
European tax revenue is meant to be used to stabilise plants in European locations, not to axe jobs.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the current process of industrial restructuring is largely the result of globalisation.
The first remark one is led to make is that this new era has helped to reduce poverty around the world.
It is worthwhile continuing to promote the free movement of goods, commodities and persons, if only in terms of economic growth, which many countries around the world are enjoying in a sustainable way.
Let us not, however, make the market a sacred cow; although the values that guide our political action acknowledge many of the virtues of the laws of the market, we also understand that the political authorities have a vital role in the regulation and functioning of that market.
This is a role that the EU and Parliament must not neglect.
In the draft report on the European social model to be debated here in September, we will urge the EU to adopt an attitude towards third countries with high economic growth that promotes democracy, freedom, respect for human rights, environmental protection, social justice and regulation of the labour market.
It will be Europe's responsibility, in our view, to play a key role in striking a balance between economic growth and the search for decent social and environmental standards in the emerging world powers.
If such guidelines are to prevail externally, the biggest concern internally will have to be the focus on increased competitiveness.
In this regard, I wish to welcome the Commissioner's remarks here today.
The next steps are contained in the Lisbon Strategy.
As regards the manner in which to proceed, I should like to reiterate that I still believe that it would be a very good idea to strengthen the Commission's role in implementing this strategy.
Although globalisation can be seen as an opportunity for European business, the same process, as the Commission has said in this Chamber, also entails risks within the European area. One of these risks is the possible disappearance from the industrial map of regions and sectors whose economic base is manufacturing.
I therefore believe that there needs to be intervention at European level in the definition and execution of public policies that promote regional and social cohesion, with a view to preventing the phenomenon of exclusion.
This is an extremely important point, because if we want to win over the citizens as regards the European project we cannot allow feelings of loss of hope and confidence to take root in certain regions outside the main population centres.
I therefore warmly welcome the Commissionâs initiative on setting up the Globalisation Adjustment Fund.
Businesses, just like people, are born, they grow and they die.
The important thing as far as employment growth is concerned is that the birth rate of business should always be higher than the death rate.
As regards the role of the EU and its institutions, I feel that they should not support political initiatives aimed at keeping alive industries or factories that are untenable in the medium term.
That would not be the right path to follow; rather it would be something of a false dawn that would feed meaningless illusions.
The right way forward, on the other hand, should be based on the competitiveness of the European economy, which depends on balanced public accounts, effective education and training systems, justice that works promptly, competitive tax systems, greater flexibility in the labour market and major incentives for research.
Without competitive economies there is no investment.
Without investment there is no employment or social justice.
Parliament should be channelling its efforts into discussing and defining policy instruments that could help increase competitiveness and regional and social cohesion in the EU.
We naturally support all initiatives aimed at monitoring the use of public funds by private companies and we feel that this kind of support should be associated with medium-term objectives on employment and regional development.
I believe that it is not Parliamentâs job to make judgments on individual cases, which seems to have been at the root of this debate.
In this regard, I should like to conclude by encouraging dialogue between the parties involved, with a view to achieving the best possible solution that, according to the latest information I have, could satisfy everyone.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very grateful to the Commissioner for his remarks. They went straight to the heart of the debate that we must conduct on the future of European industry.
Azambuja is an individual case, but it represents many others.
It is symptomatic of a wrong choice of course in European industrial policy.
There is no disputing that we must remain competitive and that rationalisations are part of this effort, that productivity growth is necessary and that, if higher productivity leads to job losses in one company, these must be counteracted by the creation of new jobs elsewhere or in the same region through innovative investments.
That goes without saying, and we must make targeted investments to ensure that it happens.
What our policies must not and cannot condone, however, and what we Socialists in Europe will fight, is the brutality with which multinational giants deal with the lives of human beings.
In the course of my political career, as the mayor of a German town, I experienced the cold, calculating way in which companies played off national, regional and municipal administrations against each other when it came to investing in locations.
The imagination of company boards is boundless when it comes to obtaining public investment support as a location incentive.
This is matched only by their complete lack of imagination when it comes to shouldering their social responsibility in times of crisis.
This is precisely what we are now observing on the part of General Motors.
I am grateful to you for what you have told us.
You will check whether European funds went to that factory; if they did, the company must stay at its Portuguese location.
That is good news.
But what happens then in Portugal?
It will be the same scenario we witnessed only a few months ago when the Swedish workforce was played off against the German workforce of the same combine.
Whoever lowers welfare standards furthest, whoever allows the lowest wages, wins the day.
Fewer social rights and less pay is the basic criterion for location decisions.
This is a form of capitalism that the people of Europe do not want, and we must fight it.
If, as in my country, a company â not a car manufacturer in this case but Allianz financial services â makes a profit of EUR 4.4Â billion, then decides to sack 8Â 000 highly qualified staff to maximise its shareholdersâ returns, that is not only immoral â I cannot expect morality of a capitalist, nor do I â but also socially irresponsible.
We must consider how we can use national and European legislation to curb that kind of corporate policy.
In the case of large groups of companies with global operations, these are, of course, corporate decisions taken by the group, and we have no influence over them.
But the impact of these corporate decisions affects the whole of society. For this reason, we believe that the application of democratic principles to such decisions is part and parcel of economic democracy.
Hedge funds buy up companies as assets nowadays.
We live in an economic world in which major funds buy large companies, de-list them as quickly as possible in order to reorganise them as quickly as possible and sell them on at a profit as quickly as possible.
The company, its location and the entire region are thus reduced to commercial goods.
That cannot be the economic future of Europe!
Accordingly, the way in which the European economy is restructured will determine the future social cohesion of Europe.
In the second half of the 20th century, the idea behind the European Union, the idea behind the single market in which we live today, was that economic and technological progress should go hand in hand with social progress.
We have reached a stage today in which maximisation of profits goes hand in hand with diminishing social security.
If we do not halt this trend and return to what we did successfully in the second half of the 20th century, namely combining economic growth with social security, we shall forfeit the social stability of our European societies â and social instability is always at the root of political instability, which leads in turn to a loss of security.
For this reason, the restructuring of companies in Europe is a challenge to which we must respond on the social level.
Â Â  . Mr President, the feelings of those who lose their jobs need no explanation.
It does not take much imagination to understand the hopelessness, the fear of the future and the financial worries they go through, day after day.
In that, Parliament stands united: across the political parties, across the European countries there is support for the European social model and the support of the workers and the unemployed.
When it comes to what concretely should be done, our opinions differ greatly.
I firmly believe it is a serious mistake to try to protect jobs by preventing modernisation, restructuring and globalisation.
It may be good for today, but it is disastrous for tomorrow.
Our answer to globalisation must not be evasion and conservatism but to embrace it and prepare our citizens for it.
It must not stop restructuring from happening but make the transition for those affected easier.
That is the starting point for the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats in Parliament when addressing the challenges presented to us by industrial restructuring and globalisation.
We believe that the European Union can and should play a role, but one of facilitating transition rather than one of obstruction.
We are not against change. We are for change.
Otherwise, in ten years we will have all our jobs in China or other nice regions outside Europe.
We are for cooperation, education and economic growth, but they should be brought about with social and environmental responsibility.
That is our task in Parliament.
There are a number of issues where we need European politics, not only to keep but to create new jobs all over the Union.
At the very heart of that we find the Lisbon Agenda.
First and foremost it is about strengthening the individual.
Europe can help by encouraging and funding programmes for lifelong learning, language skills and cultural exchange, to mention a few examples.
They help prepare for a labour market in transition where few jobs can be guaranteed for life.
There are no jobs for life anymore but there could well be work for life.
Secondly, it is about strengthening European industry to be competitive in the 21st century.
By giving access to an even greater internal market supporting European research and innovation, we open new opportunities that will eventually create new jobs.
Thirdly, to accomplish that, we need strengthened social dialogue addressing issues of change such as the need for companies to facilitate transition for those losing their jobs, and environmental rules for sustainable economic development.
It has a lot to do with European leadership, about explaining the challenges we are facing and about doing what we can to facilitate the journey into the future by preparing individuals and businesses; but not about making false promises, protecting jobs and hoping for short-term political gains.
That is the Liberal answer to the challenges of globalisation and industrial reform.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, Commissioner, I have listened to you carefully.
I have also read in the press agencies that the Commission declared that the restructuring and relocation process carried out by Opel was considered to be above-board and was in keeping with the rules of the various European funds.
I actually believe, and your intention was clear, that there is not really much point in Parliament and some of our fellow Members repeatedly criticising, month after month, global capitalism or total capitalism: we live in a world in which competition is becoming tougher and tougher and in which the future of the car industry is undoubtedly determined more by Renault-Nissan-GM alliances such as those announced, than by processes about which we are speaking today.
That being said, if we do want to have a role, I, for my part, should like it if you were able to respond, as Commissioner and as the person responsible for these issues at the Commission, to four precise questions:
Question one: we have always championed the idea of the European Works Council and industrial relations observatories when it comes to anticipating this kind of change.
We, in this House, wanted arrangements of the European Works Council kind to be strengthened.
Do you not believe, from this perspective, that initiatives are steps for the Commission to take with a view to strengthening this legislation?
Question two: the Barroso Commission has proposed an adjustment fund for cases of globalisation-related restructuring â I am not sure whether the Opel case is included in this â but what exactly is this fund about?
Can you assure us that, during a transition period, this fund will really help workers that are penalised by this type of process to rebuild their careers thanks to training schemes?
Question three: you rightly referred to the CARSÂ 21 programme and to the Commissionâs focus on research and development programmes and on the cars of the future.
Supposing that people believe - which I do not â that private cars are a means of sustainable development for the 21st century, particularly for our European cities, it is all the same astounding to note, when we know that environmentally-friendly cars will have to have a hybrid engine, like the Toyota Prius model, for the next 25 years, that European manufacturers are still lagging behind in this area.
What is your assessment of the research and development programmes in this area and of the marketing of this type of product?
My fourth and final point: it is quite clear â and the Opel example is obviously shocking from this point of view â that we are witnessing competition between neighbouring territories: Portugal and Spain.
Do you not believe that, while respecting the competition rules, it is the duty of the Commission and of the European Union to impose common minimum rules on businesses operating on EU soil, and, while I am not saying that it would be a perfect solution, I am specifically thinking of company tax harmonisation?
There you have four forms of action that the Commission, as guardian of the Treaties and promoter of the European general interest, ought to encourage.
In that regard, I regret to tell you, Commissioner, that we still do not find your Commission either proactive enough or ambitious enough on the various points that I have just mentioned.
Â Â  . â This debate is vitally important, but it will be even more so if it yields measures to ensure that it is not always the workers and the people who have to bear the brunt of restructuring and relocation of businesses and large economic groups with profits in the millions, as has happened in Portugal.
At this time, workers from Opel Portugal, part of the General Motors group â and we salute those workers via their delegation here in this Chamber â are going through terrible anguish, as they follow this debate with great interest and hope that they receive from Parliament and the Commission the kind of solidarity that they have had from General Motors workers from EU countries such as Sweden, Germany and Spain, whose futures are also under threat.
Whilst news appears in the media about talks between businesses in the car industry involving General Motors and others, the Opel Portugal workers, their families and the people and local and regional authorities of the Azambuja region and surrounding areas are living under the threat of unemployment and hindered development that may lead to closure.
This situation is all the more dramatic given that we are talking about a country in which unemployment and poverty are on the rise.
MrÂ SilvaÂ Penedaâs remarks are therefore all the more appallingly insensitive.
Much more attention needs to be paid to industrial mergers and restructuring.
Community aid must be contingent on long-term agreements on employment and local development.
Priority must be attached to protecting the workers whenever manufacturing companies are restructured, including complete guarantees that the workers will be fully informed, will be fully involved and will have a decisive influence throughout the process.
We know that there are alternatives to closing down Opel Portugal.
We know that with the political will, the company can continue to function as normal.
It is a company that has the conditions in place for productivity and in which undertakings have been made that the workers have observed.
General Motors must keep its side of the bargain and the Commission must take the measures needed to ensure that Opel Portugal functions as normal and that employment with rights is guaranteed.
Â Â  . Mr President, the restructuring of firms in Europe is due to an increase in manufacturing capacity, the implementation of new technology and the globalisation of the whole economy.
This process has serious social and economic consequences.
Production becomes concentrated in economically and technologically stronger regions, at the cost of less developed regions.
This is particularly visible in the new Member States where whole sectors of industry have disappeared.
In Poland, for example, light industry and, to a significant extent, the car manufacturing, electronics and mining sectors have disappeared, and with them jobs.
The progressive globalisation of production and the liberalisation of markets have resulted in a further deepening of economic and social divides.
Regions which have high levels of agricultural production and a developed network of agricultural and food industries such as sugar, fruit and vegetables and refrigeration in particular, lose out the most.
Poland is again one of the countries that have suffered most and is located in one of the worst affected regions.
So who benefits?
The âoldâ Member States and economically powerful industrial regions benefit and will continue to benefit, especially as the European Union is directing most of its efforts towards achieving profits from trade with third countries in manufactured articles, which make up 85% of turnover in goods. Agricultural products only make up 15% of turnover.
This begs the fundamental question: what relation does the policy of the EU authorities in the field of enterprise bear to the basic principles of the European Union, such as European solidarity, equal opportunities, sustainable development or human rights?
Â Â  Mr President, may I start by thanking the Commissioner for his wise and thoughtful comments in introducing this debate and, in particular, for putting the main emphasis on people, because that is central to the subject we are discussing.
I should just like to highlight two of the important points that he made.
One was about structural change.
I totally agree that structural change is here to stay and indeed it will accelerate.
So the issue is not how we stop it, but how we harness and manage it.
The second important point to highlight is that the answer is not protectionism, either by countries trying to put up barriers or within companies trying to protect old jobs when the market has moved on.
I agree with Mrs Ek that nowadays people might not have a job for life any more, but I think people still have a right to expect that they can have a life with a job.
The question, therefore, is what can be done to help and what should not be done.
I believe that, as MEPs, we should not have this kind of debate every time a major company closes or downsizes, so that we politicians can show that we care â even though of course we do â and can be âseen to be doing somethingâ in each individual case, highlighting named individual companies.
I do not think regular debates on this basis are helpful.
It should not be about us trying to grab headlines back home.
What I think we can do, and should do more, is to make sure that we help set a regulatory climate in which entrepreneurship can flourish, so that more new jobs can be created and genuinely; as one door has to close, other doors can be encouraged to open.
I also believe that the greatest form of job security any individual can have is in the skill set they can develop, and that is where our priorities should lie.
We have to make sure that, when people talk about investment, companies recognise that their investment in people is the most important investment they can make.
Investment in people by countries is also the most important investment that countries can make.
If we get that right, we will go a long way towards managing the challenge of change.
Â Â  Mr President, my focus, and that of my contribution, will be on the main aspects of restructuring.
However, I would like to say that I support the Portuguese workers in their efforts to retain and develop their employment.
I also know from past experience that, as MrÂ Schulz has mentioned, GM has not always been good at conducting social dialogue, an example being its relations with its factories in Germany and Sweden, when it played the workers in the different countries off against each other.
That is not a way of behaving that I am fond of.
I share the view that restructuring is not new.
Rather, it is something we have always lived with.
In my home town there was once a rubber factory, but it is no longer there.
In its day, nearly everyone in the town worked there.
There will continue to be restructuring in the future as well.
In some cases, restructuring is badly handled. This leads to job losses, and the region in question is hit hard.
There are, however, also successful examples of restructuring where new jobs have been created and regions have been able to survive and even progress, with longer-term employment.
So, what is the secret?
Well, there are a few key factors. They are social responsibility, participation and a long-term approach.
Firstly, then, the long-term approach.
I do not have a high regard for companies that do not themselves have some form of long-term plan of how they are to tackle global competition successfully and that only take subsidies in the short term before then leaving the region in question.
In addition, participation is needed, by which I mean participation by the most important asset that companies have, namely their staff.
Employees are companiesâ most important resource and should not merely be given information and consulted when changes are being made.
Employees should be a part of the restructuring process. They should be able to be involved with it and influence it.
That way, there is no need to go out on the streets and demonstrate. That way, new jobs can be created.
There is also a need to demonstrate social responsibility from very early on and to train staff so as to be able to meet the long-term challenges of the future and for the regions, as it is often companies that play a large role in regions where there is a need to demonstrate social responsibility.
As far as the automotive industry is concerned, it is an industry that has become increasingly globalised and that consists of an ever decreasing number of companies.
Restructuring will be needed. There are a number of things that we can do at the European level.
We can, as MrÂ Jonckheer said, strengthen works councils and the directives concerning these.
We can work on information and consultation.
I believe that we need framework agreements between industries and trade unions at the European level in order to be able to manage the changes that will come in the future.
This will be increasingly important.
Restructuring is something that we have to live with, but it can be made a success if employees are allowed to participate actively and if the companies involved demonstrate social responsibility.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, it is worth pointing out that we are talking about real people, who are also listening to us and who therefore require practical responses.
A year ago, I took the floor in Parliament to talk about the iron and steel industry and about Terni, an Italian city that was witnessing its own livelihood being threatened by the operations of a multinational.
The opinions expressed by this Parliament were very useful.
Today, I must come back to this subject by talking about another factory, the Eaton factory, in Piedmont: here, too, the workers are at risk because of the behaviour of a multinational; I should also like to mention Getronix, and others, as we have heard, have talked about Opel.
In all of these cases, as in the case of Terni, we can and must help.
We must also intervene so as to prevent all of this from happening again, that is to say, to prevent multinationals â which, I might add, garner profits and even enjoy public funds, including European ones â from using Europe by directly pitting one country against another country, workers against other workers.
We must decide that dumping and relocations need to be combated with specific rules, because they have nothing to do with competition and the market, but actually undermine social cohesion and burden us all with unbearable costs.
In order to combat them, practical responses are required: one of which is to genuinely strengthen European works councils.
Granting more powers to workers and trade unions will also help us to build up an idea of what kind of development Europe must have.
Some people regard this speculative market as reliable, believing that there might eventually be a positive net outcome in terms of employment, which in fact there is not; I believe that politics must deal with what needs to be produced in this Europe and that we must therefore take action in this field too.
I believe that those who want to integrate Europe must recognise that the unity, rather than the division, of European workers is a vital asset when it comes to building this united Europe and that it is therefore not dumping, but the upwards harmonisation of rules and rights, that represents a firm commitment for this Parliament.
Â Â  Mr President, it is no coincidence that my colleague, Mr Bushill-Matthews, and myself have asked to speak in this debate.
We come from the West Midlands region of the United Kingdom, a region that has historically been very dependent on the car industry, which has been through many cycles of plant closures and change.
The other day I went to speak at a school in Coventry and I said to the children: âYou know where that Blockbuster video store and that supermarket are?
In the 1980s I worked in a car factory there that employed 20Â 000 peopleâ.
There is nothing new about this.
We are treating it as if it were new.
Investment will create jobs and deliver the solution to the problems that many colleagues on this side have talked about: investment in new cars, investment in new factories, investment in robots that will cut the cost of production, and investment in quality.
I ask Mr Schulz where that investment is going to come from.
It is going to come from profits.
What the car industry is short of is not bleeding hearts; it needs more profits to invest in those new products.
That is going on in the successful companies.
Another factory I worked in during my 30 years in the industry â the Oxford plant of what was the British Motor Corporation â is now one of the most successful car plants in England, which produces the Mini.
You see them all over the place, you see them in America.
BMW â the owners of that plant, a German company â is investing GBP 250 million to make a new car there and we thank BMW for that.
It is going to create another thousand jobs.
An engine that was made in Brazil is now going to be made in Birmingham, in my constituency.
I say to my friends in Portugal â and many of them will be speaking shortly about these issues: come and talk to those of us who have lived through that problem before.
One of the saddest days of my life was when I went to the Longbridge car plant to meet the receiver of that plant, which had gone bankrupt.
I started work there in 1967 when it employed 25Â 000 people, and now I walked into an empty factory.
That is the reality of industrial life.
It has been there for a long time.
The issue is how we deal with it.
We need better employment, we need full employment, we need retraining, and we need to help people who are made redundant to get new employment.
If something cannot be saved, we have the responses to it.
We have been involved at Longbridge, where 5000 people were made redundant.
We are working at Peugeot at the moment and in other areas.
Come and talk to us about the practical things that we are doing and stop complaining in this Chamber about the problems.
We have all been through them every day.
Let us not have another debate like this.
Let us think about a positive way forward.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I am tempted to go back over MrÂ Harbourâs remarks.
While he has experienced redundancies and restructuring, I myself have been made redundant three times due to economic developments and restructuring in the Nord Pas-de-Calais, in France.
The Socialist Group in the European Parliament is in favour of a policy enabling businesses to create jobs, to modernise and to promote economic development.
Yet, when it talks about economic development, the PSE Group is also talking about social support, with a view to creating wealth, but to redistributing it too.
Europe must demonstrate its European social model.
That is the reason why we have worked collectively and why more than 80% of us voted in favour of a report on restructuring and employment, in which we state that we certainly need to provide for a form of support, but that we also need to enlighten Europe about what we are and about what we do.
We voted in favour, by a very large majority, in an effort to say that, if Europe provides economic aid and public money and if it becomes clear at any given time that a form of âsubsidised tourism' exists, then that money must be reimbursed.
General Motors, where last year more than 500Â 000 employees were affected by restructuring, is one such example that is of concern to us today.
We are not complaining, but we do believe that everyone must be respected, and employees in particular.
Restructuring is necessary in order to keep our businesses economically competitive.
It still has many consequences for all that.
In the case of General Motors today, as in many cases of restructuring, Europeans are awaiting a strong response from the Union.
MrÂ Barroso gave us this response by calling on the new Finnish Presidency to embody the Europe of results.
Well, the Europe of results starts here, in this Chamber, with a strong signal sent out to the employees who are currently in difficulties.
Support measures must of course be taken, concerning training and aid, but we must ask ourselves as from today how the public money that has been distributed will be paid back.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, plant closures like this one in Portugal are not isolated cases.
In 2005, more than half a million jobs were lost in the European Union through restructuring measures.
Quoted companies, in whatever country they are based, are registering all-time record profits.
Sales are going through the roof, and workforces are being drastically pruned.
Over the last three years, the productivity of companies featuring in the German share index DAX has risen by an average of 6.5%.
Surely that means they are competitive!
When we discuss what to do, we must ask whether the basis on which we grant aid is the right one.
I shall make you a few proposals, most of which have not yet been given any consideration.
Is it not safe to assume that aid is primarily awarded for innovative products and processes, for new research and development rather than for plant and equipment?
I believe this categorisation can be used to restrict aid awards.
My second question is this: is it wise to limit the recovery to five years?
The amortisation period for equipment is usually 10 to 15 years.
Logically, companies should repay the money for as long as it takes to write off the capital expenditure.
Thirdly, when it comes to assessing whether or not support should be granted, should we not insist and verify that companies operating globally comply with the guidelines of the World Health Organization, the International Labour Organization and the applicable emission standards in all their locations?
Any company that does not would simply be ineligible for aid.
Fourthly, is it wise to support companies which are not bound by a collective agreement and which trade unions are unable to influence?
In such cases, European taxpayers are paying double.
We fund the companiesâ research and development and their expenditure on equipment, and afterwards they make employees redundant, and European taxpayers are supposed to foot the bill for unemployment benefit too.
That is surely bad economics!
One final point: if we intend to pursue a genuine structural and regional policy, a far closer link must be forged between the companyâs need for support and the beneficial regional impact of such support.
Â Â  â General Motors is making thousands of European workers redundant.
Last year 9Â 000 jobs were lost in Germany.
This year 900 job losses have been announced in the United Kingdom, and more recently the closure of the Azambuja factory in Portugal, which has been in operation for decades and where 1Â 200 people work, was announced.
I should like to take this opportunity to greet the representatives from the Azambuja factory who are in the Chamber today and to express our solidarity.
When we speak about thousands of redundancies, these are not just big numbers, not just statistics, not just percentages, they are human, family tragedies, and I am appalled that some Members of this House have shown a lack of awareness of this situation.
The closure of the Azambuja factory affects us all as it could be another stepping stone towards the dismantling of other General Motors factories in the EU and the subsequent relocation of those factories to the east â to Russia and to Asia.
This is why this debate is worthwhile.
It is a good thing that Mr Schulz took the initiative of scheduling the debate, to give us a chance to obtain some answers.
Firstly, what can be done to prevent the closure of the Azambuja factory?
This debate should also help multinationals to realise that they cannot simply use and discard; they cannot receive incentives such as Community funding or tax breaks in one Member State and then head off to another in an attempt to obtain further support and more benefits.
Closing down factories cannot be normal.
It must be something avoidable and we, and the Commission, must of course do everything possible to ensure that this does not happen again and that the globalisation adjustment fund be implemented when things take a turn for the worse.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the questions posed in the Commissionerâs communication are very important.
Faced with the changes that have taken place, and that are still taking place, within national and European industry, Europe has the problem of managing industrial restructuring processes, which have an extremely serious effect on workers and on the various regions.
MrÂ Harbour was wondering just now what the topic of the future might be.
This is my answer: âThe topic of the future is how to manage these processesâ.
There are many cases nowadays in relation to which problems are arising, problems that go by the name of relocation, non-compliance with trade union agreements, and job losses.
They range from the case of General Motors to that of so many small and medium-sized enterprises right up to what is taking place, for example, in the Eaton factory, in Piedmont, a business in which the restructuring process and the failure to comply with trade union agreements are seriously threatening jobs.
In order to deal with this, we need to adopt a firm, Europe-wide stance, involving the effective management of these processes, and this will also increase the consistency of the Lisbon objectives themselves and the social dialogue itself, which is regarded as one of the pillars of this strategy.
I therefore call for a common position to be adopted in order to give strength and substance to the very action of the European institutions, beginning with Parliament, in this field.
I should like to highlight one final aspect: it now seems entirely clear that the issue of restructuring requires a review of the Community instruments available.
Here is just one example â and I should like to hear the Commissionerâs opinion on the matter â if we really want to manage these processes, then we cannot avoid the need to strengthen and reform European works councils.
We need to update the directive if we want to meet the new requirements in this regard.
I hope that Parliament as a whole and the Commission can adopt a common position on this.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Azambuja situation is alarming.
Thousands of workers, some of whom are here in the Chamber today, are under threat of redundancy.
This applies to thousands of support businesses and workersâ families in Azambuja and neighbouring areas, as well as to the General Motors workers themselves.
I recently met with the Portuguese Workers' Commission, the Mayor and with my fellow MEP MrsÂ Madeira, but I should like to say at this point that the issue has a broader, European-level scope.
We know that General Motors has had strategic difficulties and that it has called for Renault Nissan to step in and help with the management.
This does not, however, exempt the company from their responsibilities.
The resolution that we have tabled confronts General Motors with its European responsibilities, and states very clearly what is happening in Azambuja.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, strategic changes and business restructuring must take into account the fact that workers are human beings and not just factors of production.
The EU needs to have a clear strategy, a more appropriate means of dealing with such problems if it wants to have a European social model that functions properly.
The resolution that we tabled is a step in that direction.
Â Â  â The situation to which previous speakers have alluded is very real for the workers of General Motors in Portugal.
It is also, unfortunately a familiar story in recent times in the EU, as has been mentioned in this Chamber before.
Businesses receive Community and State aid and incentives to set up in a given region and country, and then relocate, flying in the face of the rules of conduct in place, without any compunction or respect for the hundreds or thousands of workers, and often whole families, who are laid off at the drop of a hat.
The easy quest for maximum profits and the phenomenon of globalisation cannot justify the economic and social tragedy of the weakest links in the business chain.
Commissioner, the Globalisation Adjustment Fund, adopted at the December European Council, has neither the remit nor the capacity to prevent all of the situations that have arisen in Europe.
This is an international fund geared towards a small number of redundancies and countries on account of the changes happening in world trade.
More needs to be done.
For this to happen, the EU must define clearly the plan of action that should be pursued by manufacturing companies in Europe and those businesses seeking to reach this market of 455Â million consumers with their products.
In order for us to be in a position to set an example to the world, we have to begin to demand compliance with the European social model and respect for human rights, and to do this differently.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, let me make two more brief remarks.
With regard to the individual case that has featured so prominently in the contributions to this debate, namely Azambuja, the allegation that the company is making enormous profits on the backs of its workforce and the European taxpayer would be rather hard to substantiate, for the days when General Motors recorded profits are long past, both in Europe and in other parts of the world.
If I remember rightly, the last annual loss amounted to ten billion dollars, which is not by any means chicken feed.
This case therefore needs to be assessed rather differently from those that MrÂ Schulz, for example, had in mind when he referred to certain forms of modern capitalism which do indeed have socially damaging effects, as no reasonable person can deny.
Secondly, there is clearly agreement in this Parliament that structural change is inevitable, and there is also agreement here that it must not be meekly accepted like sunshine or rain but that something can be done when structural change occurs â and indeed something must be done, because peopleâs well-being is at stake.
The vital thing that a modern economic policy can do now is to shape structural change in such a way that people are not left by the wayside as its victims.
That is precisely the aim of our policy.
A number of very interesting proposals have been made here.
I should like to focus on at least one of them and strongly emphasise that I, too, am firmly convinced that the reinforcement of employeesâ rights in Europe would make it possible to shape structural change in a more beneficial manner.
Â Â  In accordance with Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure, I have received five motions for resolutions(1) at the end of the debate.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6â0204/2006) by MrsÂ del Castillo Vera, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on Implementing the Community Lisbon Programme: More Research and Innovation â Investing for Growth and Employment: A Common Approach (2006/2005(INI)).
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, the report to be debated next is very closely related to what has just been debated.
Until now we have been debating the consequences of essentially industrial restructuring for the European economies and, in particular, for workers.
The report we are going to debate next relates to those measures, approaches or policies that may have a positive effect in terms of resolving the employment situations faced by workers belonging to industries that close or relocate.
The report that we are going to debate now relates to the factor that is fundamental to any possible solution to these situations and that has a decisive effect on the development of the European economies and hence the European societies' prospects for progress: it is simply the concept of innovation.
Innovation is the key word; innovation is the concept that could offer us a possible solution to the problems that were being discussed in the last debate and others or, alternatively, take us further away from that solution.
Within that context and within the broader perspective of revitalising the Lisbon Agenda, the Commission presented a report that was intended to integrate a whole series of decisions that had been taking place since 2000 and until recently, which relate to innovation and which propose a series of measures for improving innovation in the European economies.
I would like to comment on three essential aspects which are dealt with in my report.
Firstly, education and training â and I would add mindset, since there is a huge problem here in terms of attitudes to dealing with innovation. Secondly, organisation, with a view to ensuring that innovation takes place more effectively.
And thirdly, funding.
With regard to education and training, I believe that they are fundamental â as certain Members pointed out during the previous debate.
Life-long training, flexible training, training that enables people to adapt to the new needs of the market, are absolutely crucial if we want a society in which there are genuine opportunities for everybody at all times of change.
Furthermore, I believe that there is a fundamental problem of attitude.
A society that banishes the values of capacity for enterprise, of effort, of being self-demanding and, ultimately, of innovation which is linked to all of those factors will not be able to survive.
In this regard, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we must be very aware of what we are facing.
Others are behind us, others have been successful for a long time, but European society, or a large proportion of European society, licks its wounds constantly, it complains constantly, with the paradoxical result that those with the most wounds are the ones that end up in the worst situation.
It is therefore essential to promote a change of mindset, in order to restore those values that made European societies great societies that strove forward and that were in the vanguard of all of humanity's activities.
I genuinely believe that this is fundamental and, of all the aspects that we could discuss and which appear in this and in other reports, I would like to focus on this essential dimension: we in the European Parliament, in the Commission and the Council must reach a great agreement, a great pact, in order to ensure that the values of effort, of being self-demanding, of taking action, of enterprise, are instilled in Europeans from their birth and in their training.
If not, we will be left behind.
The clock is ticking here as well.
If we do not move forward, European societies will be left behind, and we will be largely responsible for that.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this debate runs on seamlessly from the debate that we have just had on the automobile industry as an example of restructuring.
We all agreed that structural change has been with us since a long way back and will continue to be with us for a long time.
I also got the impression that most people here in this House were of the opinion that the right answer to structural change is innovation.
Structural change takes place when a product or a process is no longer modern enough.
The answer cannot be to take it lying down and to leave it up to others; instead we must face up to this competition through innovation.
The Commission would like to get to the point at which the capacity and readiness for innovation are understood as a leading political, social and economic principle of the European Union.
This is not merely a technical exercise; innovation is in fact something that first has to be mentally understood, something that has to be willed.
This also requires the readiness to accept change.
We have put innovation at the centre of our strategy for growth and employment for good reason: because a non-protectionist economic order, one that is based on freedom, can only succeed by means of innovation.
It needs a society that supports and promotes innovation, and it needs a political framework that promotes innovation.
That is precisely what we are doing, and on two levels.
We are doing this on the level of the Member States, and it is very important that there is a wide-ranging emphasis on innovation policies and initiatives in the national reform programmes for the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy, and that the Commission accords the highest priority to innovation in its reassessment of the Lisbon Strategy this year.
On the level of the European Union we have recently set out a great number of initiatives, all of them aimed at promoting innovation: from the subsidy rules that as was specifically requested earlier in the debate are specifically directed towards innovation, through to the general financial tools for setting up new and innovative businesses, all the way to means to enhance the use of intellectual property and to develop capacities for research and development.
We are striving for an innovation policy that forms an integrated whole.
I am glad to be able to tell you that, at the Commissionâs meeting with the Finnish Presidency yesterday in order to prepare the programme for the Presidency in the second half of 2006, innovation was at the top of the agenda, and was treated as the most important theme.
I am very confident that this Finnish Presidency is especially suited to advancing the theme of innovation, because Finland is a prime example of how an innovation policy that is willed, focused and intelligently carried out can achieve the extensive modernisation of a country, making it competitive on an international level.
I always think that we should learn from the good examples of others, and in this case we should do just that.
Â Â  â Mr President, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I should like to start by congratulating the rapporteur and to thank her for including the position of our committee in her report almost as it stood.
The promotion of technological research and the acquisition of scientific knowledge are the major challenge facing Europe in the 21st century.
Nonetheless, research, development and innovation are defined as complicated, demanding and costly procedures which require special political, economic and social management.
Thus, in order to achieve this specific objective, we need, among other things, to implement pioneering decisions and design high-risk investment programmes.
However, what is mainly needed is the creative mobilisation of communities and the dynamic participation of the workers, both in the production and reproduction of scientific knowledge and in the new potential that it offers.
This finding could very soon be proven in the following four lines of action:
- by constantly upgrading the infrastructure of and action by educational institutes and research centres, given that the driving force behind development is the acquisition of knowledge by man;
- by disseminating scientific knowledge in the field of production, by redefining both the infrastructure and workers' skills and qualifications;
- by applying a policy to increase jobs and to redistribute income fairly, given that high productivity and poverty result in recession and unemployment;
- by fundamentally reducing working times, so that workers can regain their creative spirit and redress the balance lost between work and family life.
The technological revolution presents two diametrically opposed economic and social prospects: on the one hand, the creative challenge and, on the other hand, the threat of extended inequalities.
Whether we will produce and use scientific knowledge in a way that highlights once again the Europe of development, knowledge, solidarity and equality will depend on our political choice.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to take my turn in congratulating the rapporteur, MrsÂ del Castillo Vera, on the work she has just done on this subject that is so important for the future of the Union, and, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, I should like to draw your attention to three points.
The first point concerns research.
I should like once again to point out that the Union has fallen behind in implementing the Lisbon Strategy in the area of education and training.
I did, moreover, stress this point in my report entitled âEducation as the cornerstone of the Lisbon processâ, which was adopted last October.
It has to be said that things are moving too slowly in this area, which, as the Commissioner was highlighting, ought to be a priority for the future of the European Union.
My second point concerns the role of universities in research and the brain drain.
I believe that it is more important than ever to highlight the major role assigned to universities in terms of creating and disseminating knowledge.
As such, we strongly recommend that more importance be attached to them by means of developing synergies between the higher education sector, research, lifelong learning and the production sector.
There is an urgent need for the European Union to stem the brain drain effectively and to put in place all appropriate measures to attract excellence to EU soil.
Finally, the last point that I wanted to highlight concerns job creation.
There is also an urgent need for the Member States to make better use of the European funds allocated to them.
I wanted to draw your attention here to the Member States that have rightly made job creation a key feature of their projects by investing more than 35% of the ESF funds in modernising their education and training systems.
Â Â  . Mr President, we are talking about growth and employment, namely the Lisbon Strategy.
Research and innovation are an integral part of the success of the Lisbon Strategy, as is collaboration between science and industry, in other words a knowledge-based economy.
Mrs del Castillo Veraâs report, on which I congratulate her, and the European Commissionâs proposals accurately highlight what we lack in Europe.
First of all, we lack financial resources.
In the 2007-2013 budget, paragraph 1a, competitiveness, was cut the most.
It was cut almost by half.
Let us reiterate: we cannot achieve success for Europe without investment in research and innovation.
We need to increase funding for science and new technologies in all countries.
This task is the first and foremost objective for the whole European Council and future presidencies.
National budgets are just as important as European budgets.
Secondly, we lack ways of expanding knowledge and sharing knowledge.
It is vital to create a real partnership within and between Member States and to exploit the potential of the whole Union within the framework of large consortia.
It is vital to create a European research and innovation area, as innovation is an important word here, and to make optimal use of resources.
Only transparency and exchange of information can ensure synergy between different programmes at Union, national and regional levels.
In order to achieve this, it is necessary to create a single information technology programme for the whole Union.
There is, however, another key to the success of the Lisbon Strategy, namely a real single market for goods, labour, services and capital.
Without a single market it will be difficult for us to achieve success in research and innovation, science and new technologies.
Only a real single market will give us better opportunities for growth and employment.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, research and development are of crucial importance to increasing Europeâs growth potential and to creating new jobs.
The EU cannot become competitive by reducing wages but must instead pin its hopes on developing new technology and human capital.
In spite of the Lisbon Strategyâs objective of turning Europe into the most dynamic, knowledge-based region in the world, Europe constantly limps behind the United States and Japan when it comes to research and innovation.
I think that, in this report, we have put our finger very precisely on those areas in which Europe fails to live up to its own objectives.
Europe does not create enough knowledge and neither shares it effectively nor funds it sufficiently.
Research is important, but we must also bear in mind that most European companies are not high-tech gazelle companies.
Instead, they are small, traditional businesses.
Those businesses too must also be innovative and become better at exploiting new market opportunities for new products and at devising new business processes that make better use of employeesâ potential.
The report succeeds in offering a broad perspective on the development of knowledge.
I am particularly pleased about the integrated access to labour market and education policy, since it is only by combining businessesâ conditions for innovation with social, labour market and education policy that we can create space for employeesâ creative potential.
A highly qualified workforce adapts better to businessesâ quickly changing needs, and education also helps to spread knowledge.
Europe has a need for more and better investment in education.
I should also like to emphasise that I consider equality to be a crucial dimension of the EUâs Lisbon Strategy.
We cannot afford to ignore the equality perspective if we are to achieve our objectives for the competitiveness of the EU.
It is estimated that the EU must attract and train between 600Â 000 and 700Â 000 new researchers in order to fulfil our research needs, and this figure does not take account of many older peopleâs withdrawal from the labour market.
We simply cannot afford to ignore the research potential to be found in the female half of the population.
Last of all, I should like to point out that, in our innovation strategy, we should, in my view, incorporate sustainability in relation to both the environment and social inclusion.
Sustainability should be the basic principle, enabling us to ensure that the EU moves forward and thinks both in the long-term and globally.
In this area, Europe clearly has a head start, which can in itself help ensure that we achieve the goals we set in the Lisbon Strategy.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner Verheugen, you have spoken on the theme of innovation.
At a time like this, when the Football World Cup is on, the image that comes to mind in connection with this topic is that of the Japanese: they played wonderfully up to the penalty area, but then they did not score a goal.
Then there was the match between Brazil and Ghana, where the Ghanaians gave perhaps the best showing of any African team, but did not score any goals.
It is much the same with we Europeans when it comes to innovation: we are brilliant at inventing things, and we are brilliant when it comes to reaching the penalty area, but we cannot convert this into goals.
I am therefore grateful to you, Commissioner, and to the rapporteur as well, for this report and for your statements.
I would also like to give my compliments to the rapporteur, who had to deal with shifting majorities in the committee, which led to there being light and dark aspects to this report.
I will start with the darker aspects.
Let us take for example the problem posed by patent law.
The law clearly demands that the Member States end the dispute about languages so that we can have a European patent.
This formulation is too weak: since then it has become a question of much more than languages.
What is needed is to find a skilful, interesting and intelligent combination between the London Agreement and the patent litigation system, in other words a litigation system where we very clearly have to create a court that would be responsible for dealing with patent law.
Another important point is the reporting responsibilities that we demand for SMEs.
We are asking the Commission to define a responsibility to report on how innovation potential is being measured.
In doing so, however, we are quite clearly creating more bureaucracy.
If we ask the Commission to demand these reports then it will do so from small and medium-sized enterprises, and they will thus be additionally burdened with bureaucracy.
That is the wrong way to go about things.
The correct way to proceed, however, would be to adopt those points that will find a broad majority in this House: for example, if we were to promote business enterprises in Europe in such a way that failure in business were to become a genuine possibility, one that we could recognise and accept - as we can see in Anglo-Saxon countries.
We should introduce measures to prevent the best researchers and innovators from leaving Europe, and we must create infrastructures so that European researchers can once again be at home in Europe, since there are indeed many researchers in the world who would gladly move back to Europe.
We could also arrange additional subsidies for especially creative small and medium-sized enterprises.
Together with the Commission, this House has adopted the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme, the CIP and I am grateful to everybody that this succeeded in first reading in which we make pre-seed money, that is, risk capital available for these particular initial stages.
Of course, there are standards too.
I am glad that we have turned to the issue of standards, since through standards and better standardisation mechanisms we could reproduce the success story that we saw in the case of GSM â CommissionerÂ Bangemann was the one who initiated this.
Lisbon is not dead, but I would prefer Liverpool, since the Liverpool Process would mean that we could be three-nil behind at half-time in the Champions League Final and yet still win.
That is precisely where we now stand.
Â Â  . â Mr President, to continue with the football metaphor, we have seen teams like Brazil, which has fielded great players â superb players â but which has not played as a team.
When it comes to innovation, the large and the small must play together.
The team is Europe, and we all need to combine our efforts in order to succeed.
I would like to congratulate MrsÂ delÂ CastilloÂ Vera on her excellent report and thank her for her open and inclusive attitude to drawing up this proposal.
I would also like to emphasise three points.
Firstly, when it comes to innovation, small is beautiful.
If we want to create stable employment, if we want to instil a new culture that favours innovation, then it has to be instilled in the thousands and thousands of SMEs throughout Europe.
The report therefore recommends that particular attention be paid to this point, in order to ensure the participation of small and medium-sized businesses and in order to achieve the necessary change in the field of innovation.
Secondly, I would like to point out that innovating also means opening up.
It means promoting the flow of information, it means that we need an innovative strategy, in which there is a balance between the protection of industrial property and the free dissemination of technical knowledge and free and unhindered competition.
In that way we will be able to promote solidarity, knowledge and greater social cohesion.
Finally, I wish to say that innovation is green.
Innovation means new methods for strengthening energy efficiency, ecotechnologies and clean production, in order to achieve a more competitive economy that creates more environmental and social well-being.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, I shall not continue the themed link with football.
I do, however, wish to express my view that the Lisbon Strategy has failed in respect of growth and employment.
Politicians often put blame on globalisation as if it were an anonymous phenomenon that cannot be influenced.
It is not.
At heart, it is political decisions that govern the impact of globalisation.
As regards research and development, they are an investment in the future.
This report, however, refers to area after area in which the EU has thus far failed in research and development.
The report highlights factors of significance in changing this situation.
I would like to point out that the basis for all successful research and development is a large degree of freedom within research, with as little regulation and control as possible.
This means freedom for individual researchers, but also freedom for state and regional aid for research and development.
That is often where the knowledge is.
For this reason the comprehensive regulation proposed gives rise to a certain amount of concern.
What research needs is not more regulations but more freedom and resources.
Like all other policies, the policy on research and development is not gender-neutral.
Female researchers have great difficulties in terms both of the recruitment of new researchers and of access to research capital.
This uneven distribution obviously has serious consequences for research and development.
If the Lisbon Programmeâs research and development programme is to be a success we must exploit the skills of female researchers.
I support the idea put forward in the report that future research must prioritise the environment and sustainable development.
This, together with the exploitation of female skills in research, could mean the difference between success and failure.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, in an age of innovation continual further development and research are necessary, since trusted technologies become out of date all too quickly.
We cannot remain static; instead, we need continual advances.
That is a truism, and one with which we are all familiar.
It is known that for many years our work in research and development lagged far behind that of the frontrunners, USA and Japan.
Even if this is, in the meantime, slowly beginning to change, there still remains a lot to do.
We have to create better conditions for innovation.
To this end we require an up-and-coming generation of researchers capable of competing on an international level.
The low proportion of graduates in technical and scientific disciplines, combined with the brain drain towards competing economic systems that offer the temptation of self-led research should give us cause for concern, as should the problems that our universities have in retaining qualified lecturing staff.
We will also, finally, have to stand by our small and medium-sized enterprises, with which the greatest potential for innovation and job creation ultimately lies.
If we fail to do this, these small and medium-sized enterprises will reduce their research and development activities, because they will be unable to take advantage of our complicated EU investment programmes.
Â Â  â Mr President, I welcome the Commission's new approach in examining European research in conjunction with what is happening in innovation.
Allow me to congratulate MrsÂ delÂ Castillo before commenting on two points which, in my opinion, could strengthen the momentum of innovation in Europe.
Point one: small- and medium-sized companies need to be networked with large companies and industry.
Why?
Because small companies are especially innovative, often more innovative that big companies.
However, they are usually short of stable and suitable financing, while industry and big business have the capital, but are not always open to investing time and human resources in experimentation.
Consequently, such joint ventures could have huge advantages both for small and large companies.
Point two: greater emphasis is needed on public procurement contracts.
Why?
Because public procurement contracts can, I believe, increase demand and function as a remedy to market vacuums and failures.
Because, among other things, I consider that we need to seriously examine the promotion of open European competitions in line with the corresponding American model.
Consequently, the Member States and the Commission must sound out the opportunities that exist.
Finally, Commissioner, I should like to take the opportunity of this report to ask you: what European structures are presently supporting innovation in the European Union?
Is there or is there not a need for more initiatives?
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for an excellent report.
Despite all the fine speeches, we still do not invest enough in European research and development.
The most recent data show that we still lag behind both the United States and Japan, and as for the new competitors, they are catching up with us, as was mentioned a moment ago.
Top-level research will not be transformed into innovation and employment with money alone, however; we need to create an innovative climate, which the Commissioner also spoke about.
That will be the main feature of a modern industrial society.
It will not come about by kicking a ball around, and it will not matter who runs the fastest, but rather who thinks the fastest.
It is a matter of our attitude and willingness to embrace a coherent strategy in order to achieve results.
When there is no innovative climate, money or strategy, you do not need anything else for failure.
Public administration, universities and business should pool their strengths and specialise.
Actually, the problem is that the differences between the Member States are enormous, and the speed at which things travel varies greatly.
The creation of a single market in researchers would be a goal worth supporting.
The best researchers need to be where they can do the best research and innovation work.
Several special Union programmes, such as Descartes or Aristoteles, have increased the mobility of researchers, but there remain barriers, which actually drive researchers overseas.
European research policy must cover investment in the working conditions of researchers.
This way we will establish innovation-based competitiveness.
By its own example, Finland has shown that it is possible to build competitiveness founded on research and innovation based on a welfare society.
Â Â  I would like to thank MrsÂ PilarÂ delÂ CastilloÂ Vera for the initiative shown in raising matters which are so important for Europe.
I would like to stress that information is a fundamental factor which Europe can exploit to increase its international competitive advantage.
Providing resources and ensuring a competitive environment is the best way for the EU to help improve scientific research potential in Europe because it is not only ineffective for Member States to implement such programmes on their own, but it is often too expensive.
The EU should more effectively combat the brain drain by offering its best USA-bound scientists better scientific research conditions and funding.
I agree that the universities play a vital role in establishing and spreading information, and so, cooperation between higher education, research and the manufacturing sector should be consolidated.
In order to increase investment in scientific research, improve European competitiveness and create more jobs, we need increased and more effective contributions to information and innovation.
Although, generally speaking, each state is responsible for encouraging increased and improved investments, in striving for a common market, the EU should contribute to these efforts with funds from its own budget, and thus, stimulate the more rapid development of scientific research and innovations.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I should like to congratulate our rapporteur, who has addressed the key points and who spoke, in her speech, of an improved climate.
I believe that the climate of creativity goes even beyond the climate of innovation.
MrÂ Verheugen has banked on the inventiveness of the Finnish Presidency, and rightly so: there are grounds for examining the Finnish education system, and, in doing so, one would see that this country has dared to go beyond âemployability', that monstrous term that European bureaucrats have coined in order to promote entrepreneurship, and this from as early an age as possible.
Next, Commissioner, I believe that the Lisbon Strategy is a fine example of the European Council's way of behaving like the Sandman.
In 2000, the Council launched a prestigious idea, and, five years later, it has to be said that nothing has come of it and that the budgets have not taken account of the will of the Heads of State or Government to increase the research appropriations.
So, above all, let us do our work.
I am grateful to the rapporteur for having mentioned the European Councilâs annual report calling for monitoring of these appropriations, which we are promised year after year but which do not materialise: it is time that the national budgets were adapted so that we might finally succeed in creating synergies in research.
I should like to launch a new appeal in this connection.
It has come to my attention that the new European Research Council, which is due to be created by the Seventh Framework Programme, was going to give rise to a huge amount of bureaucracy.
MrÂ President, Commissioner, I believe, if such is the case, that that would be going beyond what both the Council and Parliament wanted.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating the Commission on the timeliness of a document that provides for practical and important actions aimed at creating a scientific and technological policy that is effective in terms of achieving the Lisbon objectives.
I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur on her report, which provides a very realistic diagnosis of the obstacles that the European Union needs to overcome in order for those actions to achieve the desired results.
I shall refer to three issues.
