It is important for this to be clarified, and perhaps the minister could tell us a little more about it.
As we know, and he has stated, the source of this terrible mutant virus is still to be identified and we need to know more about what causes it.
Sadly, SARS is here and it is here to stay.
We can do everything possible through research, early warning systems, disease control centres, education and information, but this should be a wake-up call to everyone concerned with public health.
We need to work together across the EU and the globe to protect public health in the future and we must think seriously about how to do this.
Mr President, SARS may not be a cause of hype in politics, but it certainly is for our citizens.
The response of the Council and the European Commission last week was, I think, adequate.
However, those of us who know what possibly should have happened were rightly disappointed.
It is true that there have not yet been any deaths attributable to SARS on our European Continent.
But I would like to join my fellow Members Mrs Roth-Behrendt, Mr Maaten and Mr Liese in making the point that this does not mean and it seemed rather like this that everything is therefore all right at the moment.
We actually know far too little about where it comes from and how it is transmitted.
We have no knowledge of any vaccines.
All these things were held over at the time at that meeting of the Council.
I regret that.
The second thing that I regret is that it has been agreed not to take any additional measures to check everyone leaving an aircraft, because that would be a false security.
What do I see?
Days later the Italian Government is busy enacting these very measures.
What security can I offer citizens now?
I think that this is also the background to much of the criticism of my fellow Members.
As a second element I should like to mention the sixth action programme on public health.
This programme was based on two things: rapid alert and prevention.
What must I now actually conclude?
That the Commission points out to us for the first time actually to have done something in the area of health, even though it is not within its competence.
In this regard I note that the Commission did in fact already have this competence through that sixth action programme.
Then I come to the remarks of my fellow Member Mr Maaten, Mrs Roth-Behrendt and Mr Trakatellis who ask why no extra money is being released immediately for tracing the connections, for making vaccines, for doing something.
Mr President, in my opinion that means we have fallen short and we must now immediately try better to support and to trace the problems and the ignorance, not only with SARS, but everything else that comes our way, to respond more alertly, as we set out in the sixth action programme.
But, Mr President, consider also the competences in the area of public health.
They are needed more than ever.
Mr President, Mr Stefanis, two Dutch hospital workers who had been working in China voluntarily went into quarantine on their return to the Netherlands.
Their sense of responsibility should be an example to the authorities, not only those in the Netherlands, but also to their European counterparts.
The measures against SARS are inadequate.
Unfortunately no other conclusion is possible at the moment.
SARS is a disease whose risks and dangers are still largely unknown.
The mortality rate was initially estimated at 4%, now there are estimates of 19%.
Infection was originally thought only to occur through the air.
Now it seems that the virus can enter the human body in various other ways.
We must take the greatest of care in dealing with SARS.
Firstly, and it has been said many times before, there must be joint action.
Confidence in the government is important.
We cannot have one country maintaining that there really is nothing the matter and another making quarantine compulsory, that does not create confidence.
We must also have joint travel advice because there certainly is something the matter.
Secondly, the measures must, of course, be convincing.
The disease has proved more serious and more infectious than was thought.
It is a good thing to trace people who may be carriers, but our first concern is, of course, to prevent infection occurring in the European Union.
Italy is quite right to make quarantine compulsory for people coming from areas of risk.
Everyone who says that draconian measures do not offer definitive protection are right as well of course, but this does not make it the false security that is being suggested.
These measures do help to reduce the number of carriers.
You prevent panic by taking adequate measures and not by acting as if there is nothing amiss.
Mr President, the European Union and the Member States must now take responsibility.
Cases of SARS have also been discovered in Greece and Finland.
We cannot allow quarantine to be an individual decision of responsible people.
Let the sense of responsibility of some hospital workers act as an example.
Finally, Mr Stefanis, you have heard in this debate that there is a very great consensus for a stricter and clearer approach.
What are you going to do as a result of this debate?
Mr President, all the signs indicate that SARS is here to stay.
In the developed western countries the situation remains under control, as things stand, but for the poor, less developed countries it might turn into a new scourge on a huge scale, one which, both directly and through its economic impact, will increase poverty, misery and the death rate.
The epidemic is already now threatening what was already poor economic growth in Asian countries and, through a series of reflex actions, the entire global economy.
We must also prepare for what will be a huge demand for humanitarian aid.
The epidemic has been going on for only eight weeks, but one thing is certain: the decision-makers have a major role to play.
There has to be a guarantee of global stability and order, because that will be crucial from the point of view of health care systems and prevention.
In Finland, just one case of the disease has been reported: it was someone who fell ill having returned from a trip to Toronto.
A high-ranking health official in Canada, however, has been quick to deny the possibility of infection.
In a report in the Toronto Star, for example, it says that unless someone had managed to slip into a hospital to see a SARS patient in quarantine it was totally idiotic to claim that anyone had caught an infectious disease in Canada.
Opinions such as these vividly bring to mind the attitude of leaders of the former Eastern Bloc countries, which was that people could not catch infectious diseases in their countries.
It is incredible that the Canadian health authorities should succumb to a childish, face-saving quarrel about where the disease has come from.
This sort of attitude does not help anyone.
If cases of the disease are found, the health authority should have other things to do than protect its country's business and tourism.
At a general level, this shows how badly the authorities in the Western countries have prepared themselves mentally for the spread of new and dangerous infectious diseases.
The extraordinary meeting of the EU Member States' Health Ministers, with its recommendations for action, was nevertheless an important first step, but we expect more.
The EU needs more powers when it comes to infectious diseases.
One more detail with regard to the SARS situation deserves comment. Italy was dissatisfied with the decision of the Council of Ministers concerning action to prevent SARS, and decided to break away temporarily from the Schengen Agreement so as to be able to conduct checks itself on the state of health of people coming into the country.
Whether the decision by Italy was necessary or a case of over-reacting, it none the less shows how flexible major EU agreements can be in exceptional situations if a Member State is able to propose its non-compliance with them justifiably.
In this respect the EU has passed a practical test with good marks.
Mr President, there are two things that are giving rise to fear at the moment: the absence of a vaccine for the virus that has been found and a fear that the authorities, both national and European, are not properly geared for dealing with a virus which knows no boundaries.
No virus has the capacity to comprehend the notions of subsidiarity, proportionality and territoriality.
It simply passes around as it chooses.
Therefore Member States should drop the notion that they are in some way protecting their populations by defending the idea of sovereignty, or indeed the idea that they are protecting their economies by pleading subsidiarity and proportionality.
It is important that we back the Commissioner's proposal for a centre for communicable diseases, but we should be insisting that every Member State put money up front for this centre.
It is nonsense to try to ensure that we have a body which in the long term will deal with communicable diseases but which will not have the resources to do its job effectively.
What I have not heard today - perhaps I missed it because I was a bit late for the President-in-Office's speech at the beginning - is what progress has been made in relation to finding a vaccine.
I know some progress has been made in identifying the virus, but what progress has been made in identifying a vaccine for us?
I know that there are concerns in Greece in relation to the Olympics due to take place in 2004, and that various discussions are taking place on this matter.
In my own country, Ireland, we have the Special Olympics in June of this year; around 7 000 athletes will be travelling from 166 states across the world.
500 of these 7 000 athletes will be coming from areas affected by SARS.
There are clearly concerns in Ireland, especially in those towns hosting these particular athletes.
I for one am not calling for a ban on the Special Olympics.
I want it to go ahead, but I want to reassure people that adequate measures are being taken at European and national levels to ensure that the SARS virus does not spread.
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen, for your very interesting questions, which I shall try to answer.
I cannot answer them all in detail because, as far as I understand, time is limited, but I shall try to do what I can.
First, the general state of affairs as far as atypical pneumonia or SARS is concerned.
As I said, we know from the Commission and from Mrs Brundtland herself, who has a global view of the matter, that although it has been identified - and this is a fact - in record time compared with what has been done in the past and we have identified the molecular structure of the virus on the one hand; on the other hand, however, no substantial progress has been made in the field of its natural history, in other words on how the virus is transmitted, and there is at present no visible progress on an efficient vaccine to prevent the disease or any anti-viral medication to treat it.
Consequently, treatment is merely palliative and what we really need, for patients at least, is for them to be isolated so that the virus does not spread and cause hospital infections, meaning that we need to recommend that every country that does not have negative pressure chambers should acquire them.
This is a very basic measure in order to restrict the spread of the virus and prevent hospital infections.
I would just like to offer some clarification on the cases in Holland and Greece.
There has been a suspected - not a confirmed - case in Greece since yesterday, which is being investigated.
In all events, the fact is that there are also cases in Europe.
Luckily, however, as we said, no case has yet been fatal.
I am especially pleased that there is a broad consensus about the need for public health to be given top priority in the EU Treaty and in all EU activities in general.
I listened to Mr Panella talk of the paradox, and it is indeed a paradox, that we have protection from zoonoses and no protection for human health.
This is something that must also be addressed at the Convention; but perhaps there could be joint actions in this direction even now.
This prospect is now a possibility and we, the presidency, agree with - and we do not just agree, we are backing - the Commission's efforts to promote the foundation of a disease prevention and control centre in general, not just for communicable diseases.
There are diseases which are as important and harmful as communicable diseases.
Something like the Centre of Disease Control in the United States.
I should like to say something about what was to be expected from this Extraordinary Council and what ultimately came of it.
To start with, I think that it was very positive that this Council was held and that, as a result of SARS, public health was the focus of attention not just of the ministers but of public opinion in Europe.
Secondly, as a text of commonly accepted conclusions had somehow to be drafted, it was only natural for this text not to contain contradictory positions.
The text in general was the result of compromise.
Nonetheless, there were recommendations on important measures, such as air travel.
Emphasis was put, and is being put in the World Health Organisation, on departure controls at exit points.
However, this does not mean that there should not be controls.
The Commission and the Council recommended that there should at least be some sort of administrative - not public health or medical - control, as the Italian minister, Mr Sirchia insisted.
But however many controls we conduct at entry points, when we are up against a virus with a ten-day incubation period, it is only natural that we should have limited results, because people entering the country are healthy.
Almost all cases in countries other than the basic countries, by which I mean China, Hong Kong and Singapore, are people who entered other countries as healthy people and later manifested the disease.
Consequently, any entry controls will restrict considerably but will not wipe out the danger of bringing in the virus.
A great many topics were touched on.
However, everyone agreed on the need for a common European policy on the issue and on health matters in general.
The presidency believes that it is possible, on the basis of the specific conditions which prevail in the country and how the dangers which come from outside are perceived and evaluated, for every Member State to take the corresponding measures.
However, there are some which should be joint measures for all the Member States of the European Union and, first and foremost, there is a need for coordination, at least at the information level.
A common compulsory information centre, as is the case now with the network for compulsory registration of all probable and possible cases is, I think, an important step because this will give us the epidemiological picture on the basis of which certain measures can be taken to deal with the situation.
On the subject of research, the presidency agrees with maximum possible support for research activities at European level.
There should be a common fund, in addition to the fund already set up in Directorate XII, a special fund to deal with this sort of emergency.
However, we should not forget that most research is carried out in universities and large international pharmaceutical companies.
On the other hand, there can be no doubt that we also need European research activity.
Another question arises, the question of support for those areas affected by the virus, so that they can take the necessary measures.
As Mr Liese said, we must not overlook the fact that, if the cases in China had been reported promptly, we probably would not have reached this point.
This is something that should serve as a lesson to us all from now on; that there are no borders and that, whatever happens anywhere in the world needs to be reported, there should be a reporting centre and that is precisely what the World Health Organisation is.
However, we need similar centres at regional level, such as the surveillance network of the European Union, to which we should report.
To conclude, may I say that, generally, what happened at the Extraordinary Council on 6 May was a very good beginning.
The ordinary Council of Ministers will meet on 2 June, by which time more facts will have been gathered, account will be taken of all the observations made by the honourable Members of the European Parliament and, I think, the Member States of the European Union will be in a position to be more coordinated and more specific about the measures which need to be taken at European level.
Thank you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council.
The debate is closed.
Mr President, I wish to begin by taking this opportunity to welcome the observers.
I am delighted to see them here in Strasbourg.
We have spent many meetings discussing the arrival of observers in the Committee on Budgets.
It is good to have them here to be able to listen to this important debate.
This is one of the first issues in budgetary terms to affect them directly.
I would also like to thank all my colleagues and the budget secretariat for their work and cooperation in producing these estimates.
2004 is an 'E-year': it is a year of enlargement, an electoral year and, if the 1999 election results are anything to go by, the end-of-term year for over 56% of Members.
All these factors will have significant political, structural and budgetary implications.
Thus these estimates for 2004 involve some profound changes that make budgetary planning a little more challenging.
In addition to the challenges posed by enlargement and the elections, Parliament will also face considerable changes in 2004, such as the possible adoption of the Statute for Members, the increase in the total number of Members, the revision of staff regulations and a reform of its administrative structure with a view to improving service to Members.
The precise budgetary implications of some of these changes are not yet determined and, therefore, are not fully incorporated into these estimates and will have to be taken into consideration during the first reading of the 2004 budget in the autumn.
However, I would like to expand on some of the issues I have just touched on.
Firstly, the Statute for Members: I very much hope that we will have a Statute for Members in effect next year.
The lack of transparency in the travel regime and the general allowance regime does more to undermine the credibility of this House than any other factor.
Therefore, I would urge this Parliament to do its level best to ensure that the appropriations put in reserve are actually utilised for this purpose.
Whilst I am on perks and privileges, I would like to refer to the amendment by the PPE-DE Group on the extension of the health insurance scheme to former Members.
I am astonished that the right-wing British Conservatives have tabled this.
They always claim that they are the champions of the fight against the gravy train and here they are, in complete contradiction, asking for an extension of the scheme, which is totally unjustifiable, which will only benefit a few Members at enormous cost to the taxpayer, and which will be extremely difficult to administer.
What is even more disappointing is that the Quaestors have sent an e-mail to all Members urging them to vote for this.
It is an absolute disgrace.
I do not know how Mr Balfe and others can justify this particular expenditure to their constituents.
The Bureau has had serious reservations about this, has not entered any funding for this and, owing to legal reasons, has referred it back.
There are also important budgetary considerations.
We cannot simply look at the immediate impact of such a measure, but need to examine what this could cost in the long run.
It could be very expensive.
It is not just the question of the wisdom of agreeing a special deal for the outgoing Members of this Parliament that could be open to all sorts of legal challenges from every other former Member, but it is also morally wrong for us to go down this route.
Therefore, I am advising this House to vote against paragraph 3 in my report, or to support the amendment tabled by the Verts/ALE Group.
Let us not fool ourselves.
These two issues are not just technical internal matters; they will run and run in the press of many countries leading up not just to next year's election but for many years to come.
Next year's election - apart from a huge turnover of Members in this House, combined with the increase in its membership by a fifth - will be one of the biggest transitions in the history of this Parliament.
Whilst we have made preparations in our physical environment and our linguistic regime, in the hemicycles and so on, we have not adequately addressed many very important issues concerning information, communication and IT strategies.
We need to ensure that we counter the democratic deficit argument in terms of our say in legislation.
Therefore, for us, the electoral turnout is of paramount importance.
We need to do more to make the citizens aware of Parliament's work, to increase their interest in our work and to ensure greater participation.
For me, information policy is of key importance.
I know that the Bureau has now adopted a report of activities with a view to the European elections.
However, this lacks ambition and innovation.
Clear strategies and plans need to be in place now if they are to have any effect.
This is not just Parliament's role.
I have to tell the Commission frankly that I have been disappointed with the lack of progress the Interinstitutional Working Group has made.
It has failed to get our key priorities and messages across to the citizen.
The Commission and the Member States have let us down.
I urge them to act together and make greater progress in this area.
Whilst one of our main objectives in the last few years has been to get closer to the citizen, our technology is still somewhere in the 20th century.
We appear to have a very slow, tortoise-like evolution in our information and communication policy, whilst our costs are haring away.
Given that IT expenditure in Parliament is one of the highest compared with other institutions, I would like an explanation as to why the Europarl site is not state-of-the-art or very user-friendly, and why we have limited access to technology and video-compositing facilities.
Where has this money gone?
Having said that, I am pleased to note that we are finally making progress in Internet broadcasting.
I believe that our proceedings in this Chamber today are being broadcast live.
We have temporary multilingual information panels across Parliament's building here.
This is an important step forward on the eve of enlargement next May.
However, concerning other issues, such as canteens, the environment in Brussels, accessibility of the buildings and the car service, we need to be a lot more ambitious.
In the context of all of this, I welcome the efforts by the administration and the Bureau to modernise not just Parliament's staff policy but the way we deal with staffing matters.
We need to move from a pure administration aspect of staff matters to a more modern, strategic and forward-looking staff management and also recognise that information technology has changed the way we work and look at our administration.
Although this will not have a major impact on the 2004 budget, I would like to invite the Secretary-General to continue to pursue his efforts in this area.
I know there are some very difficult decisions that will have an impact on establishment plans, but it is important that we continue to evolve and look at the best way we can use our human resources.
That brings me to budgetary rigour.
If this is to have real meaning, we have to have more rationalisation and leaner management structures and grasp the nettle of multilingualism to improve efficiency across a number of areas.
Parliament must continue to apply this policy and provide the best value for money for the European taxpayer as well as to continue to make the best use of available resources in the current budget.
We can only convince people externally that we are applying budgetary rigour if we can demonstrate it internally.
We can achieve this through improved presentation and transparency of the budget.
Yet there is very little evidence that a number of our requests have been taken seriously.
We have a classic situation here where ideas are crushed not by suppressing them but by ignoring them.
There are two main areas I want to touch on briefly: we need to improve the presentation and accountability of the budget in every area, and that applies equally to the political groups.
Finally, before we begin the vote I will announce a technical adjustment, namely the fact that we have reached an agreement with the Council on the adjustment of the financial perspective.
There is no need for this phrase in the text any more.
Mr President, I endorse the fact that this budget for Parliament and the other institutions is indeed a very important matter.
With enlargement we have to be most careful that we use money to the best advantage, right across the board.
I would like to go through one or two detailed matters before I tackle the issue of health insurance.
The car service is often abused and we have to make sure that it is very carefully controlled indeed.
Concerning languages, technology and the Internet, we need to expand the services to ensure that we are ever more efficient and put our money to the best use at all times.
Regarding staffing, we have already helped, as far as the PPE-DE is concerned, to trim down some of the expectations.
This relates to assistants to the vice-presidents, where there was going to be considerable extra cost amounting to several hundreds of thousands of euros.
We are making sure that whilst there will be upgradings in line with the promotion aspects of the service commitments, we will not be allowing the fast-tracking that was destined to lead to this enormous extra cost in the coming year or two.
We will also be making sure that there are no assistants helping out committee chairmen.
We see no need for that.
We will also be very carefully monitoring the number of assistants helping out Quaestors.
I would like to make sure that Amendment No 7 is adopted.
This repairs some damage that was done in the earlier versions of this report by Neena Gill.
It concerns the Association of Former Members.
They have produced all the necessary reports, but they have to have meetings in June, which does not tie in with our budget calendar.
It is no place of ours to criticise them and therefore I hope that we can pass Amendment No 7, which welcomes the decision of the Bureau, concerning the costs of meetings of this association.
It is doing an excellent job in keeping former Members informed.
I turn now to the contentious matter raised and the reference to the Greens' amendment on health insurance.
If we as Parliamentarians do not safeguard against illness of our Members, I do not believe we are doing our duty.
We must ensure that the onerous duties placed on us of travelling extensively, lengthy debates and discussions and busy programmes in our regions and our countries throughout the European Union are reflected in a proper health insurance which is up and running and cost effective.
I would like to read clause 3 in full, to show that this is not a final decision, but simply open-mindedness with a view to keeping this matter under review.
I quote: '?is willing to consider entering appropriations for the extension of the current health insurance scheme to former Members and looks forward to detailed proposals being submitted in due course.'
I would emphasise also that if the MEP Statute comes in, as mentioned earlier, this would probably be embraced within it.
The final decision is one for the Bureau of this Parliament.
All I am saying is that we, as the Committee on Budgets, should take the necessary steps to ensure that we have some allowance and that we will consider the figures in the next few months.
Mr President, firstly I would like to express my sincerest thanks to Mrs Neena Gill for her excellent estimate of the European Parliament's revenue and expenditure for the year 2004.
It is difficult to make estimates because parliamentary elections are to be held during the year and the EU will enlarge.
In general, with parliamentary elections half the Members change, and next time it will perhaps be more, as the old Member States will have 56 fewer seats.
At the same time we will have 162 new Members from the new Member States.
Both these factors will increase Parliament's expenditure, and at the same time they cause uncertainty with respect to estimates.
The aim is to keep Parliament's share of administrative expenditure below 20%.
The target is an ambitious one because a further EUR 46 million is to be budgeted for the Statute of Members.
This expenditure item is new.
For that reason exceeding the ceiling by this amount may be justified because it would not actually alter the old way costs are distributed between the EU and the Member States, as the Member States have been responsible for salaries up till now.
The rapporteur is trying to improve services to Members in core activities, which is to say those duties that relate to legislation and the budget.
The focus is the right one.
Likewise, the rapporteur is calling for improved planning of meetings to avoid overlapping.
This would cut costs, for example, through a simultaneous reduction in the number of interpreters needed, which would make interpreting arrangements for the new Member States easier in particular.
At the same time that would allow Members to participate more in the work of all their committees.
For that reason, the appropriateness of the constituency weeks must be assessed more precisely in the future.
In this connection, however, we have to view new benefits for Members with some reservations.
For example, there will be no possibility of expanding transport services, not at least before we have some definitive experience of the other new areas of expenditure.
Extending the health insurance scheme to apply to former Members does not seem justified and my group is not in favour of this.
Each Member State has been responsible for its previous Members' social security matters when salaries have been paid.
If Parliament applies the health insurance scheme to the current Members it is only reasonable, as they work outside their own countries and it counts as occupational health care.
This argument does not apply to former Members, however, and it would be just another, somewhat covert, privilege.
Multilingualism will increase in Parliament, as the number of official languages will grow from 11 to 20.
This means that the practice of using two separate interpreters to translate what someone is saying will increase.
We should investigate whether we could impose special obligations to translate many languages directly into the 'big' languages, such as English, French and German, in which case most of the Members of Parliament would be able to listen to a speech that has been translated by just one interpreter.
Mr President, I too would like to thank Mrs Gill very much for all the work that she has put into this report.
She has made it the essence of her work to give the taxpayer value for money and I would very much like to support her in this.
One of the most controversial points, as is evident from this debate, is health care costs.
I am really hoping to be able to persuade Mr Dover not to extend the health insurance scheme to former Members.
What is so wrong with it?
The costs may and Mrs Gill has already gone into detail on this point be limited now, but over the years these costs will of course increase enormously.
But then that is the financial side of the matter.
There is however also a matter of principle to consider, one that Mr Virrankoski has already touched upon.
Until we have a Statute for Members, Members of the European Parliament will continue receiving the same salary as the Members of Parliament in their country of origin.
The Court of Justice has decided that pensions and health insurance all fall under the heading of salary.
I am not even in agreement with the present Members of Parliament receiving this health insurance because I think that it is a bonus on top of salary.
But now to extend this bonus is really unacceptable, it is simply old-fashioned grubbing about in the European cashbox and that we must not do.
Once we have a European Statute, it will be a different matter and then we can talk about it again.
Until that time there is simply no question of us being able to assent to it.
Mr President, since we are talking of waste, the city of Strasbourg suddenly comes to mind.
Which brings me to the fact that last time, during the voting on the calendar of meetings, we took the democratic decision in this place that next year there will be only 10 sessions in Strasbourg.
Now I know perfectly well that a whole box of tricks is going to be opened up to ensure that it will again be 11 or 12, but this democratic decision that only 10 sessions have been scheduled continues to exist until that time.
I therefore propose that tomorrow the President or the rapporteur actually corrects recital G. It must be stated under G that next year there are not 11 sessions scheduled here in Strasbourg but 10, as decided by this plenary.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like, first of all, to greet our fellow Members from the states which are no longer candidate countries but are not yet full Members.
We are delighted to have them here, to complete what has been a lengthy, at times difficult process, but at the end of which, I am glad to say, the desired result has been fully achieved.
The preliminary draft budget presented today by the Commission is, by force of circumstances, an atypical draft, in that it is to be considered to be in two separate parts. The first part will enter into force for the current 15 Member States on 1 January 2004.
The second part, however, will apply to the Union of 25 and will enter into force as of 1 May 2004. Assessing it is therefore not an easy task, and there are some political aspects which, in my opinion, must not be underestimated: first and foremost, the age-old question of payment appropriations.
At EUR 100.6 billion, the volume of expenditure has been increased by hardly 3.3% of the 2003 figure; moreover, the 2003 budget related solely to the Europe of 15.
This extremely small increase is explained by a reduction of approximately 2% in the volume of expenditure laid down for the European Union of 15.
All this is absurd.
Indeed, not only does the Commission not intend, once and for all, to concentrate on resolving the problem of the RALs, which has been one of Parliament's priorities for years, but, what is more, it is presenting a draft which will lead to exactly the same situation being repeated with regard to the countries joining the Union as of 2004.
Then there is the question of heading 3.
The increase in the ceiling, obtained by Parliament, is a significant result, which will allow us to finance some particularly sensitive policies with an easy mind, but I still feel it is not sufficient.
If we genuinely want a political Union, a direction for all the political groupings present in the Chamber - which we can all endeavour to follow - then we must also give them the working tools they need, the instruments necessary to achieve our goals.
Mr President, we can broadly support Mrs Gill's thorough report.
We warmly endorse the plea for strict budgetary discipline by the European Parliament.
In view of the forthcoming enlargement, Parliament will have to apply itself to its core activities more than ever.
The primary task of this House, the supervision of the European Commission, must have priority, in addition to the responsibility for legislation in which the Parliament has the power of codecision.
Reports and resolutions falling outside this scope should take up less agenda time and staff effort.
An important theme in this report is Parliament's multilingualism.
Diversity as an essential characteristic of European cultures finds expression in the existence of many languages.
The accessibility and comprehensibility of European political debate for citizens from all the Member States is crucial for the quality of the democracy.
Of course this does not affect the fact that we look critically at the expenditure for multilingualism.
The Bureau of this Parliament should verify whether the scale of the translation and interpreting service for each language is indeed tailored to actual need.
The workload for each language must be divided proportionally.
I have the impression that it varies somewhat from one language to another and is certainly not proportional to the number of Members who speak a language.
I understand for example that the degree of use of Dutch and Italian in this House is of the same order of magnitude.
Any overcapacity must be scrapped or redistributed.
Another point, Mr President, is the very high average salary level of officials working for Parliament.
The payment system conceals elements that for the most part stem from the early days and that are now no longer valid.
The salaries of official staff should bear a reasonable relationship to the payments that the Members of Parliament receive, on which point I have to note that there is still no sign of the Statute for Members - a disgrace, for both the Council and the Parliament.
Closely tied up with this are travelling expenses, a topic in which voters have considerable interest.
The importance of tighter criteria that are as objective as possible for allowances is evident.
In view of the experiences in the current session, this House must make a critical review of the weeks in Strasbourg, which must, among other things, consider the additional costs involved with no additional results in return.
Mr President, I too would like to congratulate Mrs Gill on her excellent report. I fully agree with the majority of her views and proposals concerning this intermediary stage of the parliamentary budget.
I would congratulate her in particular on having wanted to emphasise most firmly her wish to see increased use of new technologies in our institution, as well as in the institutions in general, in particular with a view to enlargement.
In this regard, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Gill, my dear friends here today, I strongly recommend that, tomorrow, we adopt the amendment concerning precisely these new technologies, which we in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance tabled together with Mrs Buitenweg and which was adopted by a narrow majority in committee.
What does it involve?
Our institution respects the principle of public debate.
Moreover, the House is half-full today.
We are pleased about this, as we feel less alone, but there are 150, maybe 200 people here, whereas an enlarged Europe will comprise between 300 and 350 million inhabitants.
The Internet is a wonderful tool that is available to us. It is not an information tool in the strictest sense of the word, it is not for advertising, but it is a working tool for those who are interested.
Even today - we did not know this, Mrs Gill - Parliament is broadcasting our plenary session on the Internet.
What are we asking?
We, like you, are asking for the use of new technologies, including the Internet, to be encouraged, in order to allow each and every citizen to follow our plenary session from their own homes should they wish to do so.
Why should our Parliamentary committees not also do this?
Some have an interest in our debates on the environment.
This way, they will be able to follow them.
It is not very expensive.
You have already expressed your desire to set a fixed sum for the 2004 budget.
We call, by means of this amendment, for Parliament, from this year on, to be able to carry out tests to determine the cost - which we believe to be very low (other parliaments are already doing this) - of broadcasting committee meetings, not, I would emphasise, on topical subjects of major importance, but, I reiterate, on our daily work.
In universities and other environments, there are always people who have an interest in all our debates, whatever the subject.
That is the recommendation I would make to you for tomorrow, and I congratulate Mrs Gill once again on her report.
Mr President, allow me firstly to thank Mrs Gill for the work she has put into the 2004 budget.
It has been major, important and time-consuming work, because we in actual fact have demanding and important tasks ahead of us.
During my time as budget rapporteur a year ago, I observed that we were in practice concerned with three priorities.
The first of these was the preparations for the forthcoming enlargement, which was less certain then than it is now.
The second was necessary institutional reforms.
These reforms are just as important now as they were then.
The third priority was to deal with all these matters within the budgetary framework.
A year ago, we gave Parliament and other institutions the ability to engage in the long-term financial management of these matters, especially by means of the frontloading carried out during the autumn of last year.
The priorities were then to be converted into figures and the calculations into euros and cents.
The situation is now exactly the same a year later.
When, last December, the Copenhagen European Council decided to adopt a big bang approach, there were no doubt many of us who thought that this was one of the finest moments of all in the entire history of the EU, with a further ten countries in line to become members in time for the next elections to the European Parliament in 2004.
This was subsequently followed up by decisions here in Parliament on 9 April, the signing of the accession treaties in Athens a week later and a number of successful referendums, most recently in Lithuania, something that imposes extraordinarily large demands, especially upon Europe's elected parliaments.
We have no greater challenge than this.
We have just had the great pleasure of welcoming 162 observers from all those candidate countries that have carried out their negotiations successfully.
All this is taking place in accordance with the timetable we discussed a year ago.
That the EU and the European Parliament must put these things into effect is, of course, self-evident to all of us who see the reunification of Europe as the most important task of all.
This applies especially, of course, to the present generation of politicians.
There were therefore no great difficulties in supporting the majority of the proposals tabled by Mrs Gill.
I have just one thing to say by way of warning: it is our priorities with which we must be concerned.
We sometimes see a tendency on the part of rapporteurs, as well as on the part of other MEPs, also to want to smuggle in other aspects.
This leads to a risk of the budget's possibly becoming difficult to manage within the framework set.
It is in this situation that both budgetary authorities need to be firm and decisive.
I at least hope that Parliament and the Council will reach common, early agreement this year, in the same way that we did a year ago.
Mr President, as this report rightly observes, next year is an election year and our electorates will be asked once again to vote for their MEPs.
Those who seek re-election will no doubt be seeking to justify themselves on the basis of their record and new entrants will be of course arguing that they are better alternatives.
Looking at this report, the phrase that stands out is 'best value for money'.
How many prospective MEPs will be standing on this ticket?
As a rule of thumb we calculate that each British MEP costs UK taxpayers about Â£1.2 million annually - that is of course pounds sterling - or just short of Â£100 million a year for them all.
When one considers value for money, however, this must be considered not only in relative terms, i.e. whether one or another MEP provides more value than the other, but in comparative terms, in comparison with what else could be bought.
Given the great concern in the UK about health services, one comparison might be with the cost of health provision.
For the price of our national representation we could afford to provide and equip and service a major teaching hospital - with some change left over.
Another interesting comparison is that the money British taxpayers are spending on their MEPs would cover the entire operating costs of the police force of a medium-sized British county.
Alternatively we could keep in service ten complete infantry battalions.
I wonder which would give Britain more influence in the world.
We could even pay for three Eurofighters a year, if they ever reach squadron service.
On the other hand, if this House actually prevented some of the more insane regulations created by the Commission from reaching the statute books, thus slowing down the growing burdens on business, there might be an economic argument for MEPs.
As far as I can see, this House acts mainly as a rubber stamp, but here again I could get one of those in a stationery shop for approximately Â£3.00 or EUR5.00, which would be slightly cheaper.
In all, therefore, I have the greatest difficulty in arguing that this House or the British representation provide best value.
That is the message I intend to take to my electorate.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
The next item is the presentation by the Commission of the preliminary draft general budget for the 2004 financial year.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, rapporteurs, observers from the accession countries, it is a great pleasure to be here today to present the 2004 preliminary draft budget in this new setting.
The 2004 Budget is a truly historic one.
For the first time it covers 25 Member States.
From 1 May 2004, the new Member States will participate in all of the support programmes in the European budget.
It is also the first time that an enlargement is not taking place on 1 January of a particular year, but rather later in the year.
This presents a particular challenge for the budget.
From 1 January to the end of April we will have a budget for an EU of 15; thereafter it will be increased for the EU of 25.
The budget plans therefore contain both the figures for the EU of 15 and those for the enlarged Union, but all of our deliberations will from the outset be in respect of the European Union of 25 Member States.
The third exceptional feature of this budget is that the European Union's budgetary reform is now fully in force and for the first time the official budget will be broken down by policy area, that is in accordance with the principle of activity-based budgeting.
The budget is however still available to the budgetary authority in its traditional form for information.
In addition, you also have a new working document, which states the targets that are to be met over the next year for each policy area.
This 2004 budgetary procedure will therefore certainly be an innovative one.
The Commission's preliminary draft budget was subject to the framework that was newly established for the financial perspective in view of enlargement, as adopted by the European Parliament on 9 April, which of course incorporates the results of Copenhagen, that is the results of the negotiations between the Council and the applicant countries, as well as the results of the negotiations between the Council and Parliament.
At this stage I should like once again to thank all of those who were involved in the negotiations.
It was very good that nearly all of the issues surrounding the financial framework in connection with enlargement were cut and dried before the accession treaties were signed and before the beginning of the 2004 budgetary procedure, so that all of the decisions regarding the framework had been made.
What then are the key figures for the 2004 preliminary draft budget?
In 2004, commitment appropriations will increase to EUR 112 billion, of which EUR 11.8 billion are earmarked for commitments in the new Member States.
According to our proposal, the European Union of 15 Member States will only receive an increase of 0.7%, which takes into account the political priorities of stability and sustainable growth.
Expenditure, that is payments, will, according to the Commission proposal, total EUR 100.6 billion in 2004.
That is a moderate increase of 3.3% on the 2003 Budget.
This relatively moderate increase is possible because of a 2% fall in the budget provisions for expenditure for the EU of 15.
The reason for this is that fewer payment appropriations are needed in the Structural Funds next year than have been this year because the final payments for the old programmes are entered in this year's budget.
Of the total budget of EUR 100 billion that we are proposing, payments of EUR 5 billion are set aside for the new Member States.
In addition, payments from the pre-accession programmes will also continue to flow into the accession countries next year, so that overall we guarantee that all of the new Member States are net beneficiaries, as was of course intended at the beginning of the negotiations.
Agricultural expenditure - I now turn to the individual categories - is estimated at EUR 48 billion.
Incidentally, in 2004 the reform of agricultural policy will only be visible in a few specific areas, for example in the milk sector; all of the other effects will only be felt later on.
Of the total of EUR 48 billion, EUR 6.5 billion is earmarked for supporting rural development, EUR 1.7 billion of which for the new Member States.
Overall, next year's agriculture budget has two unusual features as far as the new Member States are concerned: firstly, the fact that direct payments to farmers in the new Member States will only take effect in the budget in 2005, because of course we have a time lag in the rules here.
The second unusual feature is that support for developing rural areas in the new Member States is substantially higher - disproportionately so - than it is in the EU of 15.
A further peculiarity is that the programmes providing support for rural development in the new Member States are so-called differentiated expenditure.
This decision takes account of the fact that the administrative capacity to manage the programmes first has to be built.
As regards the agriculture budget, I might say that, as it does every year, the Commission will also be tabling a letter of amendment to the 2004 Budget in October. This will take into account the latest assessments of developments on the markets and of course also the fact that at the moment there is a great deal of movement in the euro-dollar exchange rate, which of course also influences overall agricultural expenditure.
In the enlarged Union the Structural Funds as a whole will play a very significant role.
They are of course the main instruments through which we grant financial support so as to speed up and support the process of economic convergence.
That is why we provide for an overall increase in commitment appropriations of 20.8% for the Structural Funds.
A large proportion of this is allocated to the Cohesion Fund, which of course provides funds specifically for cofinancing transport and environmental protection infrastructure.
The greatest increase is for internal policies, in what is termed Category 3.
Overall, an increase of 27% in commitment appropriations is provided for here.
This is partly due to the fact that Parliament asked for additional room for manoeuvre in this particular area.
Category 3 of the budget is of course characterised by all of our political priorities: enlargement, stability and sustainable growth.
For the new Member States, funds are, in the first instance, made available to enable them to participate in existing Community programmes, which they already do in some cases.
In accordance with the decisions made in Copenhagen, funds will also be made available for completely new programmes in the enlargement countries: EUR 317 million for implementing the Schengen Agreement, that is, for building the necessary infrastructure to secure the external border; EUR 221 million for increasing administrative capacity in the accession countries and EUR 138 million for decommissioning nuclear power stations.
Overall, the preliminary draft budget provides for very high increases for promoting an area of security, freedom and justice.
Research expenditure is also permitted to grow next year to EUR 4.8 billion. This shows that, in the enlarged Union too, supporting the Lisbon objectives of developing a knowledge-based society enjoys a very high priority in the European budget.
Many support programmes such as research, environmental protection and youth exchanges, to name but a few, are multiannual programmes that are adopted by codecision.
That is why new provisions will have to be made for the coming years, that is for the time that these programmes have left to run, to take account of enlargement.
The Commission has tabled proposals for topping up these programmes and we should aim to make the decisions on adapting them to enlargement as quickly as possible, so that we can plan for this.
This is of course particularly important for the accession countries.
In its proposal the Commission has taken into account Parliament's priorities as set out in the opinions of the individual committees and contained in the report by Mr Colom i Naval and Mr BÃ¶ge.
As regards foreign policy measures, the Commission is proposing to enter into commitments worth almost EUR 5 billion, which is in line with 2003 levels.
For the Balkans, just to mention a few points, the level of aid should stabilise after the years of reconstruction.
The funds are available for this.
This is also a clear indication of the European Union's commitments in this region.
In the interests of having a more intensive neighbourhood policy, the Commission is also proposing to increase funds for the MEDA Programme, namely by 14%, and for Afghanistan the funds are to be adjusted in line with pledges made at international level.
Two countries, Bulgaria and Romania, are still in the pre-accession category of the group of countries with which negotiations have not yet been concluded.
All of the institutions have pledged to grant more aid to these States, so that they can achieve their aim of joining the Union in 2007.
In the coming year, an increase of 20% in the aid for Bulgaria and Romania is provided for.
For Turkey, the funds in the pre-accession strategy are also being substantially increased, and I very much hope that the funds for supporting reforms will be able to be used.
Finally, I should mention that next year so-called freestanding lump-sum payments, or cash facilities, of EUR 1.4 billion will be made to the new Member States.
Administrative expenditure will have to be adapted to the new requirements.
The Commission's proposals contain 780 new posts for the Commission; this is in line with the plan that we presented to you last year and is intended to ensure firstly that we can manage expenditure on enlargement, secondly that colleagues from the new Member States can gradually be incorporated in the administration and thirdly that we can also cope with the extra languages.
Although the preliminary draft budget contains, as a whole, some very ambitious spending programmes, the principle of budgetary discipline also needs to be observed, and the Commission proposal does so.
Overall, the Commission's proposed preliminary draft budget is EUR 3.4 billion below the ceiling for commitment appropriations and is well below the ceiling for payment appropriations.
With the exception of the Structural Funds, the preliminary draft budget leaves margins, that is room for manoeuvre, in all areas.
The budget as a percentage of the EU's economic output, that is the European State share, will even fall this year compared with last year, below 1%.
This shows that both ambitious spending programmes and enlargement on the one hand and budgetary discipline on the other can be accommodated.
Ladies and gentlemen, there are going to be very many new aspects to the budgetary procedure that lies before us.
This will require all of us to make a great effort, but the decisions that have already been made in the past mean that we have a good basis on which to work, and I think that the wonderful fact alone that this will be the first budget for the enlarged Union will spur all of us on so that we can achieve a good outcome in December.
Thank you very much!
Mr President, I should like to thank the Commissioner for her explanation and I should also like to say that I am very pleased that we are able to hold this first debate on the budget that affects the new countries in the presence of the observers from these new countries.
The budget procedure, as the Commissioner has already said, will apply to 25 countries.
Parliament's aim - as we have explained in the guidelines - is to vote on a budget for 25 countries in December, on the understanding that the budget for the ten new countries will not take effect until 1 May of next year.
How that will all come about from a legal point of view we shall have to sort out in the course of the year.
Activity-based budgeting, as described by the Commissioner, has many advantages.
The committees will be able to see which budget lines concern them individually and how they can amend them.
I think that it is also important for Parliament to know, and I shall also be referring to this, what relationship this new system bears to the prospects, because we shall always as far as possible have to respond to what was agreed in all the categories in Copenhagen.
Another general point: as a Parliament we consider it important for the budget powers, the budget procedure, to keep pace with the legislative procedure as developed by the Commission in the course of the year.
When I look at the guidelines adopted by this Parliament in March during the vote on the standpoint of the Parliament, then at first sight the Commission has acted wonderfully well in accordance with those guidelines.
The Parliament had sought an austerity budget.
As the Commissioner has already said, the payment credits are currently 0.99% of GNP for 25 countries, last year they were also 0.99%, but then for 15 Member States.
So in this regard they have remained the same.
How things pan out though we shall only see in the course of the year.
Parliament has the same priority as the Commission: to make a success of enlargement.
The Parliament mentions a number of points in this regard, including in particular the enlargement of the administrative capacity of the Member States.
They must be able to make the plans for receiving the money, they must be able to put them into effect and the financial control must be effective.
We shall most certainly see whether the 221 million that the Commission has set aside for this is sufficient.
As the Commissioner has already said, a great many parts of category III must be determined under the codecision procedure.
We shall have to see whether or not the 2.5 billion that the Commission has proposed is sufficient.
A third point, also made by the Parliament, is the elaboration of the Lisbon strategy.
The Commission devotes a whole page to everything it can do.
We shall also be looking at this item by item.
Now I come to the individual chapters of the financial prospects.
Agriculture: at present, we find little in the Commission's proposals of what the Parliament proposed in the guidelines.
It may come later.
Development of marker vaccines, insurance systems, things of that kind, are not to be found.
We have noted that there is a 1.4 billion margin in the budget.
We are hoping that it is sufficient even if the euro rises more in relation to the dollar.
Structural policy: the slogan is that we must do what we have promised.
The big question is whether that is possible with the current level of payment appropriations.
They are not being increased very much.
There is still an enormous amount as yet unpaid.
What relationship does it bear?
This too is an issue for Parliament.
The biggest increase, as the Commissioner has already said, takes place in chapter III: internal policy.
Strengthening of border controls, the position of Kaliningrad, attention to nuclear safety and so on and so forth. One thing we have not yet mentioned since Parliament's guidelines and since the budget was printed, is the disturbing development of SARS all over the world.
Perhaps Europe will have to do something about it.
The Commissioner has already gone into detail about Chapter IV, on foreign policy.
As far as Afghanistan is concerned, we shall probably have to adhere to the international accords.
No mention has yet been made of Iraq.
What does the Commissioner - or what do we - expect to happen there?
This we shall also have to discuss.
My final point, Mr President, has to do with administrative costs: a very sharp increase in staffing levels with 780 new posts and also a very sharp rise in the costs of buildings.
In all categories, in all policy areas, we see a steep increase for buildings.
It cannot come from Berlaymont alone.
Where it does come from, we shall also have to sort out in the course of the year.
Finally, category 7, the title of which has been changed.
We do not yet know precisely what implications this will have, what kind of openings might still come.
I do not know if it will be the case as soon as next year, but it could be.
We have noted the increase for Turkey, Romania and Bulgaria, which are quite diverse countries.
This too we shall examine critically.
Mr President, I can only express the hope, as did the Commissioner, that by December we shall have a good level of cooperation between Commission, Council and Parliament to produce a good budget for 25 countries.
Mr President, I just want to raise two points: one concerns the extra money in category 3 that we negotiated with the Council at the last Conciliation Committee meeting concerning the deal at Copenhagen, mainly concerned with the codecision procedures.
I would like to remind the other committees that what we are trying to do, or at least what we and the Commission are trying to do is to ensure a legislative proposal is presented to Parliament and to the Council this year, hopefully between July and September, so that we can actually enshrine in legislation the amounts needed between now and the end of 2006.
That of course means the committees which are involved in codecision reacting rather swiftly to make sure that we have that information so that we can make sure that this budget is complete.
This is because what we want to do is to have a trialogue and a conciliation meeting with the Council in July to formalise this, not just for the 2004 budget, but also for the other two budgets.
The other point I want to make concerns the format in which the budget is now presented.
This is the new ABB format which Parliament asked for and insisted upon and which the Commission has now presented.
The trouble is we do not know how to use it.
We had a presentation last year to inform everyone, which we all conveniently forgot, and have had another presentation this year, but now we have the reality of the situation.
We have actually seen the documents in their real true-life format, which means that we do not know how to make amendments to them.
The fact that we work to financial perspectives within different categories or with different categories means that if we use the ABB system we will not know what the ceilings are within the different categories.
So in the next 20 minutes, when we meet as the Committee on Budgets, Members - because we are simple souls after all - will have the new budget presented in two formats: one in the ABB which we have insisted upon, and one in the old format which we can understand.
What we have to decide, when it comes to the votes later in the year, is how we are going to vote.
This is an important issue and I want to thank the Commission for presenting the budget in the new format, whatever problems we have with it.
I am sure it will give a lot more transparency and enable a lot more understanding in the long run.
When we have a new financial perspective - who knows - it may even be in line with the ABB format of budgeting.
Who knows?!
That concludes the item.
The next item is the Commission communication on Euromed cooperation in the energy sector.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today the College of Commissioners has adopted an initiative which corresponds to a three-fold challenge relating to energy, which involves no more and no less than establishing trans-Euro-Mediterranean energy networks.
The three-fold challenge relates firstly to the use of energy as a stability vector, of strategic importance to our relations with neighbouring countries, with our partners - we are talking about the 'ring of friends', which President Prodi mentioned - including the countries of the southern rim of the Mediterranean.
Secondly, we want to project our acquis and the principles which govern our internal market as a model for our regional neighbours to follow, based on the fact that our acquis and our operative system are being shown to stimulate economic development, growth and peoples' well-being.
Thirdly, we must establish a range of projects for common energy networks which allow us to specifically define our priorities and thereby facilitate investment, both public and - in particular - private, in the energy sector in the future and on the part of the various European Union players and the different European Union governments.
This Communication is the first specific step we have taken since the positive reception of our communication, inspired by the President, in relation to the policy of cooperation with the ring of friends.
We must not forget the conclusions of the Green Paper on energy, which clearly demonstrate that Europe depends on its neighbours to guarantee its energy supply.
By means of this Communication, the Commission intends to respond to these three challenges and proposes four specific objectives: firstly, increasing the European Union's security of supply, but also that of our neighbours; secondly, to extend the benefits of the enlarged Union's internal energy market to a Europe beyond our borders; thirdly, to support the modernisation of energy systems in the countries surrounding us; and finally, to promote the implementation of energy infrastructure projects which correspond to the Union's strategic interests.
I would like briefly to comment on a series of important issues in this communication, which will surely be dealt with within the public debate which will subsequently take place, particularly when Parliament gives its opinion.
Firstly, the geographical area means that we must restrict ourselves to our closest neighbours - the Mediterranean in the south, Russia, Ukraine or any other country of the ring of friends - and that, in some cases, we must also deal with partners who are somewhat further away, but which border our neighbours.
I am talking about Iran and the Caspian region, which are of unquestionable strategic importance from the point of view of energy for the European Union's supply.
Secondly, the chapter dedicated to our relations with Russia is complete and is not restricted to aspects relating to the dialogue under way.
Within this context, I would like to remind you of the importance of the proposals which are being developed within the framework of Euratom and which must lead the Council to issue a mandate to the Commission allowing us to negotiate all the aspects of energy exchanges within the context of global reciprocity and balance, which is absolutely essential given that we are on the eve of an enlargement involving ten countries, of which seven have nuclear installations, practically all of which - with one or two exceptions - involve Russian technology - originally Soviet - and are therefore supplied with fuel of a Russian origin.
Finally, with regard to the infrastructures and energy network projects jointly established with these countries - I would like to insist on this point - I would like to stress that they are still of crucial importance, since they allow us to work towards clear objectives which we have decided jointly with the countries in question.
Our cooperation must prevent a sort of list of demands - what we call in English a shopping list - in which there are no planning or financial priorities.
However, all these projects are of an indicative nature, they do not commit the Commission during this phase and their maturity will be determined by means of studies and depending on the interest of the private sector and hence their economic viability.
The Communication I am presenting to you today will be officially presented next week during the meeting of Energy Ministers, Euromed-Energy, to take place in Athens.
I intend to take advantage of this important initiative to support the communication whose content I have explained briefly and which I hope the honourable Members can analyse and study closely very soon, given its importance for the European Union's security of supply, and also in order to support and promote a stability plan and greater cooperation within the Union.
And, by means of this greater cooperation, the economic development and the concept and models we maintain, according to which energy efficiency, respect for the environment and other aspects of this nature are of key importance.
Mr President, Commissioner, I think that is an extraordinarily bright idea, but we will first have to read your document and see what is proposed in detail.
I could envisage us concluding treaties with the states surrounding the European Union, and all the technical integral parts of the Treaty on European Union or of our future constitution then applying to these states as well, so that - in the area of energy, for example - these states would have a share in the liberalisation of the energy market, in the projects for trans-European networks, and so on. If that is what it is to boil down to, then it is a very good idea.
I do, though, see this as raising a number of questions, to some of which you have referred.
For a start, why, if there is to be cooperation with the Mediterranean - for the thing is called Euromed - then why not with Russia and with other states?
Why, in point of fact, is this cooperation to be only in the field of energy?
Are there no other integral parts of the Treaty that could be used in exactly the same way?
It is unfortunate that we will then, in accordance with our own Euratom Treaty, always have to divide our activities into nuclear and non-nuclear, so it would appear that we need two different treaties.
Far from the least important question is whether this sort of cooperation in competition - and competition is what this is about - has to be backed up by joint undertakings in research, and whether there is also financial support for one project or another.
So I look forward with eager expectation to what you are going to put before us on this; perhaps you could respond to one or other of these questions right now?
As I have said, I think this is a brilliant idea, one that needs specific elements added to it.
I am sure that we will have discussions on that in Parliament as well.
Mr Linkohr, although it was not a question, you nevertheless made a very helpful statement!
Mr President, I would like to point out that, behind all these elements, there is a strategy: to extend action to a broader market than merely the European market, in the field of energy, a field in which we believe we can make progress, particularly given that we have association agreements with most of these countries, such as the twelve countries of the Mediterranean rim and of course guaranteeing the balances and ground rules of fair competition between everybody.
It is not just energy.
That is the first step.
The second step is that I will present, before the autumn, and quite possibly before the summer: Trans-Euro-Mediterranean transport networks, which include sea motorways, which relate to the Mediterranean and also to the border countries of an enlarged Union.
In some cases, it is a matter of facilitating co-funding for certain existing programmes and, in other cases, simply of promoting, by means of co-funding, studies on the projects which will be carried out if their economic viability can be guaranteed.
I do not want to be a bore, but, as you said I had not put a question, let me ask what response we have had from these countries.
Are they interested in such a solution?
I am sure you have had talks with some of them.
Perhaps you could say something further on the subject.
Yes, they do have a great interest.
As I have said, on Wednesday of next week we will present this communication to all the countries of the Mediterranean Rim.
As is well known, we have a structured dialogue with Russia in the field of energy.
And with other countries as well, such as Norway.
In the case of the Balkans, the whole issue of the electricity market has been raised; in relation to the Balkan electricity market, we expect to be able to ensure that it is continued with a similar integration, by means of gas.
I could also mention the dialogue we are holding with all the other countries, which have an interest in this whole global approach, which provides a picture of what the objective is and will facilitate the rationalisation of investments in the future.
There is clear interest, not only on the part of the Mediterranean countries - I would insist - but also on the part of all the other countries, including those with which there is already a structured dialogue in place.
That concludes the item.
(The sitting was suspended at 5.22 p.m. and resumed at 5.30 p.m.)
The next item is Question Time (B5-0089/2003).
The following questions are addressed to the Commission.
The Commission proposes that Question No 25 by Mr Collins be taken following Questions Nos 26 and 27.
I imagine there is no problem with this.
It will make the order more logical.
Part I
Question No 26 by Paulo Casaca (H-0254/03):
Subject: Storm of 11-12 April 2003 in the Azores
On 11 and 12 April 2003, the Portuguese Autonomous Region of the Azores was hit by a severe storm which caused substantial damage to housing and public infrastructures on all the islands of the archipelago, and had a particularly destructive impact on agriculture.
The author of this question was able to ascertain in person the extent and severity of the damage caused to the various forms of greenhouse cultivation, especially to the pineapple greenhouses on the island of SÃ£o Miguel.
Fruit and vegetable production (above all, bananas, oranges and passion-fruit) is severely affected, and the vineyards have been all but wiped out.
In view of the frequency of such storms in the Azores, the regional programme under the Structural Funds (PRODESA) already provides for specific actions in case of natural disasters.
However, there remain two aspects for which further information from the Commission would be helpful.
Can the Commission state whether the impact of this storm will be taken into account in the decisions to be taken on the regional allocation of the programming and efficiency reserves under the Community support framework?
Can it also state whether, on similar lines to those applied this summer to Central European farmers affected by bad weather conditions, it is considering specific measures for the farmers affected with a view to minimising the adverse effect on their income?
Mr President, I will say firstly that I very much regret the storm that has taken place in the Azores.
Unfortunately, there have recently been various climatological disasters in different parts of the European Union, but I would like to point out that some of the measures in the regional operative programme of the Structural Funds provides for aid which can alleviate the damage caused by the bad weather conditions referred to by the honourable Member.
I would like to point out that the problems suffered on 11 and 12 April in the Azores - which the honourable Member has mentioned - do not in principle allow for the allocation of supplementary sums from the effective reserve.
As the honourable Member knows, this is an instrument intended to promote the efficiency of operative programmes.
Its allocation is based on indicators defined by the Member State, in agreement with the Commission, which reflect the efficiency, management and financial execution of programmes and allow the results to be measured, in relation to the objective defined by the programme.
In other words, they are intended to stimulate the different European regions of the different countries of the European Union to manage the Structural Funds available to them in the best and most efficient way possible.
However, by allocating the programming reserve proposed by the Member State at the time of the programming of the Community support programme, the special needs of the agricultural sector in the Azores can be taken into account.
This would provide a margin for the reallocation of funds.
Portugal can therefore propose that the bad weather conditions referred to by the honourable Member be taken into account, but, I would insist, by means of the programming reserve
With regard to the possibilities of aid to farmers, certain measures may be adopted, at the request of the Member State in question, within the framework of the Common Agricultural Policy, although, as the honourable Member knows, the Commission has not so far received any communication or request for intervention from the Member State or the regional authorities in relation to the events in the Azores.
If the Commission is consulted in this regard, it will of course study the measures which may be adopted in order to deal with the consequences of this bad weather within the framework of the legislation in force.
Mr President, I wish first of all to thank the Commissioner for her words, which of course express the Commission's position on the disastrous effect of the storms that we experienced in the Azores on 11 and 12 April.
I should like to say first that it is extremely hard to put into words the things that I witnessed over those few days, because this was a storm made up of incredibly strong cyclonic winds, which caused extremely widespread damage, both to buildings and to fruit trees and forestry in general.
Above all, however, because this storm led to an invasion of salt, which covered the entire lower part of all the islands in the Azores.
This salt completely covered Graciosa, for example, resulting in the chemical destruction of practically everything that lived there.
The losses to farming as a whole are enormous, with vines and vegetable crops being totally destroyed.
I know, as the Commissioner said, that the regional authorities have not yet sent the Commission a report on this disaster and I know that this report will reach the Commission very soon, but I wanted to note now what has been said about the programming reserve and I also wanted to note the willingness demonstrated by the Commission to adopt measures for the agricultural sector.
I just wish to say that we are awaiting this information and we will of course give it our full attention.
As a result of my professional experience, I am well aware of what can happen with disasters in the agricultural sector and that there is particular fragility in this sector.
In this regard - as I said before - I would like to express my solidarity and I am sure that, at the appropriate moment, the Commission will make every effort possible within the framework of the relevant legislation.
I would remind the honourable Members that this is a time for specific questions to be dealt with in one minute.
It is not a time for statements or debates, although I understand that this serious storm warranted an additional explanation.
Question No 27 by Cristina GutiÃ©rrez-Cortines (H-0289/03):
Subject: Discharges of oil in Gibraltar
For years now, the area around Gibraltar has been the scene of constant discharges of oil into the sea during the refuelling, loading and unloading of vessels. This has enormous environmental and economic impacts on nearby areas in Spain, since the economic activities there centre fundamentally on fishing and tourism.
This is just one example of highly polluting substances being discharged, but there are many others.
These discharges create eyesores for the public, have major economic repercussions and cause incalculable damage to the environment since they make any kind of normal activity impossible in the contaminated zone for a long time afterwards.
In view of disasters of this type and the Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council on improving safety at sea in response to the Prestige accident (COM/2002/0681 final), when will the Commission present the assessment of whether current legislative and policy instruments for protecting the environment should be adapted in order to minimise the risk of accidents and the damage associated with them occurring?
ESPart II
As the honourable Members - and Mrs GutiÃ©rrez-Cortines - know, on 13 December the Commission adopted a Communication on increasing maritime safety, following the Prestige accident, a text which reminds the Member States of the need to apply in advance and to speed up the application of the Erika I and Erika II legislative packages, as well as proposing new measures.
These new measures were given impetus at the last Council of Ministers in March, because, without waiting any longer, the Commission has applied certain provisions proposed in its Communication.
All the measures necessary for the establishment of the European Maritime Safety Agency have therefore been adopted: on 29 January its Executive Director was appointed and its activities are already beginning in Brussels, with a provisional headquarters while its final headquarters is decided upon.
The Commission has also begun to establish a Community system for the monitoring of ship traffic, the SafeSeaNet, and has also asked the Member States to define in advance national plans for receiving ships in difficulties in ports or areas of refuge before this summer.
Two coordination meetings have already been organised in this regard and I would like to point out that the Commission has also, apart from addressing all the neighbouring countries of the Mediterranean Rim, but also Russia and Norway, held talks (it has not only addressed all these countries in writing) to stress the importance for maritime safety of the control of oil tankers by port authorities, but that, also, specifically with Russia, Norway, Algeria and Morocco, we have dealt with these issues in the bilateral meetings with the relevant ministers and, in the specific case of Russia and Norway, we are looking at the possibility of establishing a control system for maritime traffic in the Baltic and the North Sea, which allows us to increase safety and prevent any kind of problem.
I must add that, on 20 December, the College of Commissioners adopted a Regulation prohibiting the transport of heavy fuel by single-hull oil tankers, to or from European Union ports, and according to which, the replacement of single hull ships with double hull ships is speeded up, a proposal which furthermore has been agreed in the Council and examined at first reading by the European Parliament's Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism and which therefore should enter into force next June, if the agreements within the Council are maintained.
I would finally like to point out that, on 5 March, the Commission delivered to the European Parliament and the Council a proposal for a directive on pollution from ships and the introduction of penalties, including of a criminal nature, for pollution crimes.
This proposal relates to illegal, accidental or voluntary dumping - because there is also wilful dumping: the cleaning of hulls and of bilge, which the honourable Member refers to, establishing responsibilities throughout the chain from shipowners, charterers, classification societies, etc which will allow us to resolve the gaps in Community law on deliberate or accidental pollution by ships and which will oblige the Member States to adopt the corresponding legislation.
Finally, the FIFG Fund, which we have seen in the case of the Erika, but also in the case of the Prestige, which is patently insufficient with its current sum, must be increased to a maximum ceiling of responsibility of a thousand million euros, in accordance with the Commission's proposals, and in accordance with an agreement in the Council of Ministers, which has agreed that, if this fund is not increased within the framework of the International Maritime Organisation, at least in the European region, a Decision will be adopted at European Union level to establish a supplementary fund which allows these levels of compensation to be achieved.
On the 16th of this month there will be a diplomatic conference, within the International Maritime Organisation, and I hope that this proposal of ours will be accepted, that is, simply that the European Union should receive equivalent protection to a country such as the United States for example.
Commissioner, I am able to express my satisfaction with all these supplementary measures, because in reality the conservation of the environment and the prevention of risks within the field of the trade in hydrocarbons is a process consisting of many supplementary measures which are gradually being taken.
However, the questions I would like to ask are: to what extent are the responsibilities in Gibraltar defined, and also, to what extent does the Commission's Directorate-General for the Environment - and I do not know whether I can receive a reply at this moment - will accept this series of measures so that it may genuinely be a transversal operation of guarantees, which includes environmental responsibility for these problems?
I agree with the honourable Member that this is a process.
When it comes to the cleaning out of bilge for example, we can demand that there should be no dumping at sea because we have approved - and this Parliament supported this proposal - a Directive which obliges all the Member States to establish, in all Union ports of a certain level, the installations necessary for cleaning hulls and bilge in port, so that it is not necessary to clean them at sea, which has been the normal practice a for all these years and which is the cause of more than 90% of oil pollution year after year.
Hull pollution is not the result of great disasters such as the Erika, the Prestige, the Amoko CÃ¡diz or the Mar Egeo. These have a terrible effect locally, as we have seen, but furthermore, every year tonnes and tonnes of oil are intentionally dumped at sea causing nine or ten times more pollution than these huge disasters.
With regard to Gibraltar, I would like to say to the honourable Member that in the Directive and Regulation adopted, in relation to the requirement on double-hull vessels, the transport of heavy oil, the modernisation of the fleet and other issues, it is stated very clearly: it is applicable in all ports, quays or anchorage areas in the European Union.
Gibraltar is in the European Union and is therefore also affected, like any other place - such as Algeciras - to mention the opposite port.
Naturally, the Commissioner responsible for the Environment fully agrees with the measures we have proposed, although we are establishing a specific definition in relation to oil and pollution by hydrocarbons.
A specific definition which relates to the fact that the FIFG Fund provides specific and differentiated cover and insurance for pollution by hydrocarbons - which other possible types of potential pollutants lack - and furthermore, in the field of criminal penalties, we also believe that pollution by hydrocarbons or by the cleaning out of bilge has a component which requires a specific type if penalty or which, at least, can require that other types of ecological crime are not treated as such a crime, with criminal penalties in some countries.
But in this case, in which there are clearly the wilfulness and serious effects on nearby populations and the marine environment, it is clear that this criminal definition of this type of action, which are entirely unacceptable, is required.
Mr President, I have asked for the floor, on the one hand, to congratulate the Commissioner on this vast and intelligent range of measures being adopted on oil spills and, at the same time, to ask a supplementary question about vessels cleaning out their hulls, which is becoming a real scourge on Portuguese coasts.
All countries which, like Portugal, are fortunate enough to have long coastlines, occasionally experience spills that turn up on beaches with no indication of where they have come from or of who is responsible.
I know that the measures that are being drawn up and which will be applied address this problem.
There is, however, a fundamental issue; vigilance and monitoring.
The difficulty lies in identifying those who are responsible for spilling these substances.
I wish to ask the Commissioner whether measures are also being considered in the field of vigilance and monitoring.
What we are talking about is proposing that the Member States of the Union - and this is what I have presented for debate in the Council and in Parliament - define, including from a criminal point of view, with custodial sentences, sea pollution resulting from dumping, including the cleaning of hulls, when it is carried out - as the honourable Member says - deliberately at sea.
We are talking about this being a crime within 200 miles, within the exclusive economic zone.
As I said before, this is supplemented by increased controls of maritime traffic.
I believe - and we are going to begin some studies in this regard - that we are currently carrying out control of maritime traffic in relation to certain types of vessel, specifically oil tankers, and also in certain areas.
I believe that it is a matter of going a step further, of controlling all types of ships sailing, apart from traffic close to the coast, within three, four or five miles; that, from a certain distance from the coast, all traffic must be controlled.
This would mean greater safety in a sea which is increasingly being used for maritime transport and recreational activities, but also in a sea which is increasingly polluted and which must be protected more thoroughly.
What is being done in the sky in relation to aircraft could also be done, with the appropriate modifications and variations, in relation to the sea, and that is what we are working on, beginning - I would insist - with the control of the oil tanker traffic entering European Union waters and of all traffic in certain areas of the European Union.
Question No 28 by Carlos Lage (H-0222/03):
Subject: Appointment of a Portuguese official as Director-General for Press and Communication
During a parliamentary debate held on 26 March this year, in connection with a motion of censure, the Portuguese Prime Minister interpreted the appointment of a Portuguese as a director-general in the Commission as a diplomatic coup for his government and criticised the previous Socialist government's alleged inability in this sphere.
Subsequently, the Commission's representation in Portugal publicly explained that senior appointments in the Commission are based on merit and competence, the principle of equal opportunities and geographical balance.
The choice of a Portuguese for this position was doubtless due to a favourable judgment of his merits.
However, the statements made by the Prime Minister may give rise to doubts.
In view of this, can the Commission say whether the appointment of a Portuguese as Director-General for Press and Communication was based solely on an assessment of his abilities with reference to the relevant criteria or on diplomatic pressure on the part of the Portuguese Government?
The Commission can confirm that the appointment of a Portuguese official as Director-General for Press and Communication was firmly based on the principles that were set out by the Prodi Commission when we took office in 1999, and specifically those principles which require that merit is the prime consideration in taking appointment decisions and that every effort should be made consistent with the provisions of the staff regulations, to respect the need for a balance of nationalities in senior management positions.
Following the transfer of an A1 official from the position of Director-General to that of Head of Cabinet in September 1999, Portugal had two A1 officials at the Commission, neither of which held the rank of Director-General.
Since that time, Portuguese Governments have felt that there was a geographic imbalance which should be corrected and the Portuguese authorities raised the matter with us on a number of occasions.
The House will be aware that it is not unusual and not irregular for Member States to raise these types of issues from time to time.
The Commission listens to such views and gives them proper courteous consideration.
The Commission nevertheless takes appointment decisions independently and solely in the interests of the institution.
It would be entirely wrong for anyone to believe that the submission of views imposed pressure on the Commission.
The Commission can confirm that the nomination and appointment of the new Director-General for Press and Communication fully conformed with the requirements of the Staff Regulations and with the Commission's internal procedures for the meritocratic selection and appointment of senior officials.
Mr President, I wish to thank Commissioner Kinnock for his answer.
It was clear, precise, and rigorous and I already believed that this senior official's appointment had been inspired solely by criteria of merit and of geographical balance.
My question was clearly not intended to question this appointment, which gives me great pleasure, since it involves an extremely talented Portuguese citizen who will be occupying a key role in the Commission's structure.
It is also clear, however, from the words that the Commissioner has just spoken, that no government, no prime minister, can claim any praise for this appointment or can claim it to be a matter for national self-congratulation, as if this were a heroic achievement.
I know perfectly well that governments and prime ministers, sometimes getting carried away on flights of rhetoric, like to pin European medals on their own chests.
This harms no one and I felt the form, content and subtleties of the Commissioner's answer to be extremely enlightening.
Question No 29 by Christopher Heaton-Harris (H-0267/03):
Subject: Commission disciplinary procedure
Could the Commission state when Marta Andreasen was suspended from her work at the Commission?
When were disciplinary proceedings started?
At what stage are these disciplinary proceedings?
How many other Commission staff have been suspended on full pay for over six months during the past four years?
Questions to Commissioner Nielson
A disciplinary procedure relating to Mrs Marta Andreasen was opened on 2 July 2002.
Mrs Andreasen was suspended from duty by a Commission decision of 28 August 2002.
The Commission has recently received a report from the Hearing Officer who was appointed, through the proper procedures, to give consideration to all relevant information in Mrs Andreasen's case.
Having now received that report, the Commission, as the appointing authority, will reflect on the appropriate steps to be taken in this procedure.
In particular, the appointing authority will have to decide whether to refer the case to a disciplinary board.
During the last four years there has been one other case in which an official was suspended from duty on full pay for more than six months.
Looking back on the events of the last year, does the Commissioner now accept that the Commission has a lot to learn in its handling of internal disputes between high-ranking members of staff?
Having accepted the urgent need to reform the Commission's accounting system along the lines suggested by its former Chief Accountant, Marta Andreasen - who was in post just four months and working in what was supposedly a hostile environment - and with your understanding, as Commissioner for Reform, that reforms often take longer than expected to deliver, conceive, plan and actually put into action, surely now you can accept that it is time to stop victimising Marta Andreasen and stop these ridiculous disciplinary proceedings against her.
Perhaps then common sense can prevail once again within the European Commission.
I am grateful to the honourable Member.
Firstly, whilst the Commission does exercise the natural modesty of any responsible authority, I could not accept from the honourable Member that we have a lot to learn about internal disputes.
He is familiar with the background to this case and has been good enough to accept the accuracy of the description that has been provided to him in this House.
What occurred by the late weeks of May last year was a very manifest and severe breakdown in working relationships, which meant that action had to be taken with rapidity simply because delay would have prolonged the difficulty without bringing any prospect of reconciliation.
In those circumstances, with regret, but nevertheless assuming responsibility, the Commission - in the person of myself, who has the portfolio responsibility for personnel - had to act.
In the course of these events, Mrs Andreasen has definitely not been victimised.
As part of the evidence for that, I would suggest one item: it is the way in which I insisted - and my colleagues in the Commission readily accepted - that when Mrs Andreasen's suspension came she should be suspended on full pay, partly in order to make it absolutely, abundantly clear that the Commission was not in any sense prejudging her case - a case that is still under consideration because of prima facie evidence that she allegedly may have committed serious breaches of staff regulations.
The disciplinary procedure as it has been conducted has been undertaken in scrupulous observance of the rules and with scrupulous defence of Mrs Andreasen's rights of natural justice.
It is therefore regrettable, certainly - as all disciplinary procedures are - but it is certainly not ridiculous.
As the author is not present, Question No 30 lapses.
Firstly, as regards drinking water in developing countries, the Commission proposed in its communication on water management in developing countries that priority should be given to ensuring a supply to every human being - especially the poorest - of sufficient drinking water of good quality and of adequate means of waste disposal, with the general objective of reducing poverty and improving people's health and quality of life.
This focus on access to safe water and sanitation was further reinforced in the context of the World Summit on Sustainable Development with the launch of the EU Water Initiative and the signature of the EU-Africa Strategic Partnership on Water Affairs and Sanitation.
After Johannesburg we started to concentrate on a long-term effort to translate these political commitments into action on the ground and, for sewerage, action under the ground.
We are engaged in a dialogue to anchor the process at country level.
The core of this action is to catalyse and support the engagement of all partners at the local, national and regional levels, from central and local governments to civil society users and private professional actors, reflecting the multi-stakeholder partnership approach under the Water Initiative.
A key objective is to focus on the millennium development goals and the targets for access to water and sanitation for the poor.
We negotiated this in Johannesburg and we are now trying to tackle the problem.
The Commission is also exploring the opportunities to increase financial support for these objectives, including the possible creation of a specific water fund using development aid as a catalyst to attract other financial resources in response to the countries' prioritisation of water in their poverty reduction and sustainable development strategies.
This proposal by the Commission is presented in the recent communication on the establishment of an EU water fund.
Secondly, concerning drinking water in industrialised countries, the European Union started more than 20 years ago to take steps to secure drinking water quality.
The Drinking Water Directive of 1980 established quality standards for drinking water as well as regular monitoring obligations, thus ensuring a high level of protection throughout the Union.
In 1998 the Drinking Water Directive was amended to check the parameters and related values and, where necessary, tighten them up and ensure greater transparency and more information to citizens.
In order to comprehensively protect water resources, the European Union has recently thoroughly restructured its water protection policy by adopting the Water Framework Directive: protection of all waters, rivers, lakes, ground waters and coastal waters, establishing a binding obligation to achieve or maintain good quality for all those waters by 2015 at the latest; ensuring a broad participation of citizens, stake-holders, NGOs when developing the necessary protection measures; and underpinning the environmental objective by economic instruments such as economic analysis and water pricing, reflecting cost recovery and thus promoting the wise use of water and the protection of our water resources.
Environmental policy in the field of water is complicated and supported by targeted efforts in research policy, where the Sixth Framework Programme is devoting considerable effort and budget to the issue of water resources and their protection, and in regional policy both for the existing Member States by instruments such as the structural and cohesion funds and in candidate countries by instruments like ISPA and Phare.
Mr President, I would like to warmly thank Commissioner Nielson for his statement, which was both informative and extensive.
The idea of establishing a water fund strikes me as very positive and, I believe, highly conducive to enabling the developing countries to be helped in a very special way, as this is direct, on-the-spot aid for specific projects, some of which give vast stretches of land the prospect of a future.
As regards the situation in the industrialised countries here in the European Union, I believe it to be an absolute necessity that, along with this new Water Framework Directive, we give priority to stepping up the monitoring, so that, when involving all the decision-makers and - as you said - coordinating policies on the environment, research, and the regions, not only will all the stakeholders be brought together, but the benefits will also be checked as they need to be.
Very briefly, the fund will not mean that we are asking for new money, additional money, from Member States.
It is mainly a method by which we would hope to accelerate the actual use of the funds which are already allocated for the 9th European Development Fund.
But I agree and I am happy about the support given to this idea.
On monitoring, I think it is quite clear that in our European Union framework it is really for Member States to deliver on the important issue of monitoring what has been decided carefully and highly professionally.
Commissioner, I wanted to put a question supplementary to Mr Ebner's, one concerning development aid, which is your core responsibility.
To what extent does water policy, relating not only to drinking water but also to water for agriculture, play a pivotal role in two especially important war zones that we have to deal with at present, namely the area around the Euphrates and the Tigris - which also involves Turkey - and the Palestinian problem as a whole?
I wanted to ask you whether you are conducting separate negotiations in these areas, where water both has an important part to play in peacemaking and could also trigger armed conflicts.
Mr Posselt is absolutely right.
Regarding Africa, we are starting by carrying out very broad analyses at ten river basins, precisely with view to preventive, even peace-related, activity.
Regarding Palestine, the whole region has for generations been trying to cope with this problem.
It is true that this is both part of the problem and part of the solution.
Much of the peace dividend between Israel and its neighbours will relate to a better and more rational use of water.
For the Iraqis, this is not such a burning issue in the list of problems they are facing; but a better use of water and its agricultural potential are not matters to be neglected.
Oil is not the only resource in that country.
Question No 32 by Bernd Posselt (H-0224/03):
Subject: Reproductive health
What is the Commission doing to actively prevent abortions from being funded under international population and health programmes and related measures encompassing the area of 'reproductive health'?
Can the Commission rule this out with absolute certainty?
The Commission's policy on abortion is clear.
We adhere to the Programme for Action adopted at the International Conference on Population and Development held in Cairo in 1994.
Chapter 8.25 of the Programme for Action states that 'In no case should abortion be promoted as a method of family planning.
All governments and relevant intergovernmental and non-governmental organisations are urged to strengthen their commitment to women's health, to deal with the health impact of unsafe abortion as a major public health concern and to reduce the recourse to abortion through expanded and improved family planning services.'
In January this year I wrote to the European Parliament in response to a letter from 47 MEPs on the issue of abortion.
In this letter, which is available on my website, I stressed that we aim to prevent the need for abortion, through our support for reproductive health programmes.
However, we recognise that unsafe abortion is a reality that causes the unnecessary deaths of many women each year.
The Commission regards national legislation as paramount when it comes to the question of abortion services within the formal health service.
Furthermore, in countries where abortion is legal for given indications, it should be safe.
The Community's programmes and actions in the field of reproductive and sexual health and rights in developing countries aim to reduce maternal mortality and contribute to achieving the respective Millennium Development Goal.
The stakes are high, maternal mortality rates have remained unchanged and are even on the increase in countries such as Malawi and Afghanistan.
I would prefer Community aid in the areas of reproductive and sexual health to be judged on whether it delivers in reducing the unnecessary deaths of women in developing countries.
This is what I find most important.
Just two more brief supplementary questions: firstly, does the Commission check to see that all the organisations that are promoted or supported do not, in fact, fund abortions?
Secondly, does development aid comply under all circumstances with the laws of developing countries on abortion, or is the attempt being made here to exert influence on legislation in those countries?
Mr President, we do monitor these organisations and considering the kind of global debate that is taking place on this issue, it is quite clear that organisations like UNFPA or IPPF which are being criticised have to be very careful how they work.
In our judgment they do live up to their responsibilities.
With reference to your second question, we are not influencing the legislation of any one country or another; that is not our business.
I very much welcome the Commissioner's remarks and the fact that he says the Commission is doing everything possible to lessen the number of unsafe abortions taking place in the world, and indeed to reduce the need for abortions by giving and encouraging access to family planning and reproductive health matters.
I agree with him that there are a large number of NGOs doing sterling work.
Would he agree with me that women have a right to choose how they organise their lives?
Abortion should of course be the last resort, but it is my belief that sometimes the teaching and doctrine of the Catholic church and its refusal to countenance family planning have done untold damage to the lives of millions of women in some of the poorest countries of the world.
I hope that on this issue and related matters we can move forward as a result of the response by the Commission, and help reduce the number of abortions, by giving women access to the services they wish, should they wish them.
I do not think we need the Commission, or myself for that matter, to point to any other basis of policy than the Cairo Plan of Action.
That is what we stand for, that is what we are defending, that is what we are implementing and, in fact, that leaves it up to the legislation of each country to establish what is legal and what is not legal.
The place for discussion is at national level and inside every individual, especially inside every woman.
We have the global contour of the structure of this debate.
I do not see a need to specify what role I see one or another player performing, but I do see an emerging excess of bigotry which I think we should take due consideration of.
As the author is not present, Question No 33 lapses.
Question No 34 by JosÃ© Ribeiro e Castro (H-0244/03):
Subject: Angola: current situation and outlook for democracy
In view of the changing situation in Angola and its strategic importance at regional and international level, it is a priority to develop a range of policies which will contribute to the consolidation of peace, the development of democracy and the reconstruction of the country.
What is the Commission's assessment of the current situation in Angola and its immediate future?
What consideration is being given to the most serious humanitarian problems and the reintegration of ex-combatants?
Has the Commission continued and strengthened the dialogue opened with all the political parties represented in the National Assembly, and with the churches and civil society?
What is the state of play with regard to the Donors' Conference?
What progress has been made as regards the transparency of public accounts and revenue accruing from the exploitation of the country's natural resources?
Has the Commission been monitoring the specific situation of Cabinda, and what prospect is there that here too it might be possible to find a basis for democratic dialogue?
What specific information does it have on the process of preparing and monitoring democratic, free and fair elections?
What are the main measures being taken or prepared by the Commission in the context of cooperation with Angola in the following four areas: humanitarian aid; social development; reconstruction; training for democracy?
How does it see the future development of these programmes?
The Commission considers that Angola has made substantial progress towards consolidation of the peace process since the signing of the peace agreement in April 2002 and that a return to war seems unlikely at this stage.
However, several challenges persist which may threaten the stability of the country.
These include the critical humanitarian situation, the reintegration of ex-combatants; the resettlement of internally displaced persons and returning refugees; democratisation and the reconstruction of the country - roads especially have been a very big problem.
Furthermore, the presence of landmines continues to be a major threat.
In fact, when people started moving after the peace agreement had been signed, we saw an unfortunate increase in the number of accidents due to landmines - a terrible consequence.
The Commission is continuing to assist the government and society in general to address these challenges.
As regards the situation in Cabinda, may I refer to the answer to the question from the Member, written question E-640/03 on this subject.
The Commission is following the developments in the province closely, and there have been indications of some positive developments in the conflict recently.
The overall humanitarian situation, while still serious, continues to stabilise.
Emergency pockets and areas exist throughout the interior of the country, particularly in areas where mines and damaged infrastructure still limit access.
The Commission considers the successful demobilisation and reintegration of ex-Unita soldiers to be crucial for national reconciliation.
There have been problems, but given the difficult circumstances, the demobilisation process can be qualified as successful, although reintegration has not yet been fully achieved.
In March this year I visited Angola and also one of the biggest camps of ex-Unita soldiers, and had a thorough exchange of views with them concerning their prospects in this situation.
Everything seemed relatively well organised.
The Commission is in contact with the political parties, although a regular dialogue really is not up and running yet.
It is intended to strengthen the effort to create such a dialogue.
As regards churches and civil society there is an ongoing dialogue as well as co-operation on a number of specific projects.
Concerning the donors' conference , which will take place in Brussels , there is still no confirmation of date, modalities and agenda.
The success of the conference is strongly linked to the establishment of a credible government plan for rehabilitation and reconstruction of the country, including a poverty reduction strategy, as well as to an improvement of the relationship between the Government of Angola and the IMF.
The Commission has repeatedly offered to assist in the preparation and organisation of the conference.
Transparency of public accounts and revenues from national resources, oil and diamonds, could improve definitely with the new economic team in place since the December cabinet reshuffle, although concrete results are not yet visible.
The diagnosis of the oil sector, which the government is currently undertaking with KPMG should be an important element and the Commission awaits its publication with great interest.
I raised these issues very directly with the government during the visit I just mentioned.
The Commission and other donors are working together to encourage the government to increase transparency.
The next presidential and legislative elections will be a crucial test for the government's commitment to democratic practices.
The Commission will follow developments very closely and has offered to assist in creating conditions for free and fair elections.
The priorities for the European Community's co-operation with Angola are spelt out in the recently signed Country Strategy Paper.
In the short to medium term, priority is given to funding the measures necessary to support the peace process and national reconciliation, including creating the conditions for free and fair elections.
In the medium to longer term, the Commission will gradually increase the focus of its support, concentrating aid on health, education and food security as the three main focal areas.
Angola has also been included as a focus country under the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR).
Commissioner, I thank you for your extensive answer to my question.
I wish to encourage the Commission to pursue a more wide-ranging and more open dialogue with all political forces represented in the Angolan parliament and indeed with all forces in civil society and the churches.
This open dialogue is our best chance of helping to consolidate pluralism in Angola and this, in the long term, is our best chance of consolidating democracy and freedom in that country.
This has been demonstrated recently in a project with the Inter-denominational Committee for Peace in Angola (COIEPA), and I would encourage the development of other Commission-funded projects.
On the other hand, the situation of the UNITA ex-combatants is extremely worrying.
I was part of an EP delegation that visited one of the camps and our feeling was that whilst the camps are working, things are more or less all right.
Difficult, but all right.
The worry is what will happen when the camps close, since things are extremely fragile, and it is taking a very long time to implement reintegration measures.
My question is whether the Commission would be willing to direct resources specifically to programmes for the vocational training and social reintegration of UNITA ex-combatants and for these programmes to be monitored by both sides.
This could be a way of following up the agreement of April last year in a practical way and of consolidating confidence and stability in Angola.
Firstly, I agree with the view expressed that this broad, open dialogue, which can consolidate pluralism, is important at this stage.
Fortunately, owing to the structure of the peace agreement and the way in which the two opposing movements are in general able to talk and do things, we are now at a point at which peace is irreversible.
However, we should not rest on our laurels.
The demobilisation and the reintegration of ex-combatants is a huge problem.
The offers we and others can make have to be suited to the individual, and this is not an easy thing to do.
Many of them should go back to agricultural activities and this is the key to doing what needs to be done concerning the majority of these people.
I see the focus on health education and food security in our programme in Angola as something which will be useful for precisely this endeavour.
Commissioner, you should not be surprised by the fact that I too am congratulating you on the answer you have given us.
The Portuguese Members closely follow everything that happens in Angola and the European Union must pay particular attention to Angola, given that other countries, such as the United States, are extremely interested in Angola's natural wealth.
It would also be rather negligent of the European Union not to view that country with solidarity in mind, which is crucial, but also bearing in mind the interests of the EU itself.
I genuinely believe, Commissioner, that the major test of Angola's situation will be the presidential and legislative elections.
These elections will give us an accurate reading of the democratic and civil situation in Angola, and will be decisive.
We must therefore pay the utmost attention to them.
Lastly, Commissioner, I wish to ask a question on Angola's intervention in neighbouring countries - because the Angolan Government and its armed forces have indeed been involved in various conflicts in neighbouring countries.
Have there been any developments?
Has Angola retreated to its borders and stopped intervening actively in the affairs of its neighbours?
It is true that the increase in known reserves of oil in Angola points to a very interesting future for the next years and the question of licensing and who gets what gain from the large potential of oil production in Angola needs to be followed up very carefully.
The Commission supports the UK initiative.
Others are involved in this too, but the UK has been the leading player here, in regard to declaring what you pay and creating more transparency about revenue in industries such as oil.
It is absolutely necessary to discuss this with Angola.
I have raised this matter myself in very clear terms.
I agree that the elections are the big test.
That is where we also have to invest in terms of capacity-building and strengthening the system.
Question No 35 by Glenys Kinnock (H-0250/03):
Subject: Convention on the Future of Europe
Would the Commission outline its views on whether the Convention on the Future of Europe is giving sufficient emphasis to the EU's development cooperation priorities?
The Commission believes that the draft text presented on 23 April contains many valuable elements.
In an effort to restructure, simplify and streamline texts some serious improvements were made.
As for the development cooperation priorities, draft Article 1 provides a good basis, but at the same time we sympathise with the draft amendments proposed by Parliament's Committee on Development and Cooperation, notably where it suggests introducing references to good governance, environmental aspects and prevention of HIV/Aids.
The Commission believes that further improvements in the text are necessary. The Commission submitted on 5 May suggestions to the Convention to do so, including the following important points.
Firstly, policy coherence (Article 1(3)), where we want the text to say that the EU will respect - this is the word - the principles and objectives of Article 1 in the development and implementation of external aspects of other Union policies.
Secondly, poverty focus (Article 25), where the Commission has proposed to make an explicit reference to the primary aim of eradicating poverty for EU policies in the sphere of development cooperation.
Thirdly, budgetisation of EDF (Article 26(4)), where the Commission wants to terminate the exceptional position of the ACP countries by deleting this paragraph and bringing, as a consequence, the EDF into the Union's budget.
We have also noted the idea to set up a European voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps.
It is not clear at this stage how it would operate.
We should not forget that the delivery of EU humanitarian aid is a serious business, which requires technical expertise, experience and a high degree of professionalism.
We work in dangerous corners of the world, where even the best-trained professionals are exposed to risks.
Therefore, it will not be easy to create this sort of peace corps.
We are committed to deliver effective support to people in often desperate situations, and we are working through the organisations we are funding.
We are capable of doing this better than most other donors.
Much needs to be done to bring this idea of a European voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps into the arena of what I would recommend.
For the time being I remain sceptical about the idea.
I certainly welcome what you say about Article 35.
I have also tabled an amendment expressing great concern about this idea of inexperienced European volunteers going into what are often very complex humanitarian situations, where some degree of sensitivity - as you suggest - is needed; a degree of sensitivity that they would not have, which would be dangerous both for them and for others involved in such exercises.
The issue of budgetisation again is something of which this Parliament's Committee on Development and Cooperation is, as you know, in favour, and has been for some time.
Would you support my view that, in order to protect the European Development Fund, we should ringfence EDF money when it is budgetised in the way that we have suggested, to ensure that it is protected for ACP countries and does not slip into other areas of the world?
Mrs Kinnock's remark is important.
It is one of a number of elements in this discussion that we have to take up directly.
It is not a simple matter where everything is fine if we budgetise.
The precise predictability and stability of the system is partly why it has become too rigid.
We have to very carefully weigh the pros and cons in deciding how we go about this.
We may push for budgetising - not least for reasons of parliamentary influence, and this is a matter of democratisation, of how we work - but we have to keep these other aspects of the reality of ownership in the south clearly on the agenda.
Could I associate myself with the comments made by Mrs Kinnock and in particular support what she has said about good governance within developing countries.
May I ask about another priority within the Convention in relation to development, and something that he has prioritised, which is the causes of migration from developing countries, and that we maintain an emphasis on Commission activity in this area, that we understand the causes, extreme poverty and instability of migration from developing countries and we incorporate this continually in the debate on the causes of migration to the European Union, including applications for asylum.
We realise there are real development criteria here to be looked at and a need for an emphasis to be maintained.
My first reaction to this is to warn against talking about migration in general and then getting into the aspect of applications for asylum.
It is very important to keep to a high level of linguistic clarity.
The best thing we have done in several years to address the causes of migration was the decision and announcement in Monterey a year ago about increasing official development assistance from the Member States of the European Union.
This is reality.
The point about governance and democracy is also true.
People do not only want to get out of countries that are poor; they also want to leave, even as asylum seekers, to get somewhere else, away from countries that do not deliver governance.
This is another aspect we have to work on.
It is about money but it is also about decency and safety.
Question No 36 by Mihail Papayannakis (H-0253/03) will not be replied to since it is included in the agenda for the present part-session - in this week's debate on Iraq.
Question No 37 by Margrietus J. van den Berg (H-0260/03):
Subject: Recommitment exercise and support for the Fast Track Initiative
What progress has the Commission made to date in its exercise to identify and recommit dormant EDF resources for ACP countries to the Fast Track Initiative (FTI)?
Has the Commission prioritised those countries whose FTI plans have already been approved?
Is the Commission planning to undertake this exercise in all ACP countries now that all countries are part of the Analytical Fast Track?
What is the timetable for completing this exercise and, once all dormant commitments have been identified, what is the process for recommitting them to the Fast Track Initiative?
How long does the Commission estimate that such an exercise could take?
Questions to Commissioner Schreyer
We cannot launch anything in today's world without making a new acronym.
This is the FTI - which, by the way, is also supported by the IFIs - but I am a member of Acronyms Anonymous and so are many other people.
I think I will talk about 'education for all' and the 'fast track initiative'.
The objectives set in Dakar and the Millennium Development Goals in this field of education are the basis of our policy in developing countries.
Overall, the Community has allocated an estimated EUR 1.3 billion to education in developing countries for the next 5 years.
This is the global figure.
It is also providing substantial financing to ACP countries under the 9th EDF in the form of general budget support - EUR 1.66 billion - part of which will benefit the education sector.
It is difficult to say exactly how much, and with what sort of direct focus, but one part of this is clearly relevant.
In this context we devote full attention to the fast track initiative as a means to accelerate progress towards education for all.
So far only 10 countries have an approved proposal for the fast track initiative, including 7 ACP countries.
Unfortunately these 7 ACP countries have not chosen education as a priority sector in their cooperation with the Community.
The Commission is therefore looking into the possibility of using old, dormant funds to support the fast track initiative in these 7 countries.
The initiative has been prioritised as one of a number of possible so-called 'fast disbursement' mechanisms for the use of dormant amounts of old European Development Fund money.
This process is now being discussed with the ACP partner countries.
In addition to the 10 countries that have an approved proposal for the fast track initiative, all other developing countries that meet the eligibility criteria for this, such as a full poverty reduction strategy paper and a credible sector plan, can expect further support to implement their plans.
Where possible, the Commission will participate even through existing mechanisms or by recommitting dormant funds.
This is now an ongoing effort.
As far as the analytical fast track is concerned, its exact role is still being defined.
A specific working group has been set up to further develop this concept.
The timetable is also part of the issue.
We recognise that further efforts are required this year and next year to ensure that the implementation of European Development Fund resources is managed in the most efficient manner possible.
To this end, seminars were organised in February and March 2003, bringing together the different players in the project management cycle within the process.
Delegations, DG-Development and AIDCO.
During the seminars, in order to free up idle resources, a substantial effort went into identifying dormant commitments lying under previous EDFs.
Targets were agreed with all delegations for decommitments to be achieved by the end of this year.
Decommitments imply an administrative procedure that also involves the headquarter.
The same goes for recommitting the money, which will take place in the annual reviews.
Partner countries of course have the final say on decisions to use these dormant funds for the fast-track initiative.
This is not the only use of the money that we try to free up and accelerate the use of, but the fast-track initiative is clearly identified as one of the priorities.
Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for the intensive effort to secure the availability of the dormant funds for the initiative.
I believe that even in its technical form, in its institutional form, in the cooperation with the World Bank and a number of countries in Europe and the role that Europe can play in it as coordinator or initiator, the fast track initiative can be exceptionally effective.
Perhaps the Commissioner could say something more, without specific reference to each of these countries, about the role that he envisages for the European Union.
I understand that he also says that we are prepared to play a coordinating role so that we can deliver added value to the relations with - for example - the ACP countries.
I am rather curious about this added value role, not just in financial terms, but also in terms of political leadership and institutional support.
I would maintain that the budget support which the Commission and Parliament discussed in great detail a couple of years ago is an extremely important tool where a partner country has reached a reasonable level of quality in its sector policy for education.
We have a basis that is good enough to inject money through budgetary support relating to the more detailed work carried out by Member States or other donors working very directly at a technical level in that country.
On this issue of money, we are doing important things.
In addition, in having this initiative organised as broadly and energetically as it is, we are inspiring - not to say pushing - African and other countries to lift education higher up the ladder of priorities.
Our water initiative has the same effect, and we offer real assistance to those governments that face up to this.
It is quite helpful but, again, successful coordination and approaching the problems via sector programmes is exactly what this initiative can also accelerate.
Mr Nielson, I congratulate you and thank you for your cooperation since you have not spent just twenty minutes, but forty-eight minutes replying to the honourable Members.
Thank you very much.
In accordance with the Rules of Procedure, Questions Nos 38 and 39 will be replied to in writing.
Question No 40 by Dana Rosemary Scallon (H-0286/03):
Subject: EU Regulation on reproductive and sexual health and rights in developing countries
Could the Commission clarify the position of the Commission proposal with regard to 'reproductive and sexual health and rights in developing countries', where Item B7-6312 has been increased from EUR 55.8 to EUR 73.98 million increase, as announced by the 'Council of Ministers'.
Could it please inform me if the above-mentioned increase was actually proposed by the Commission or not?
How will this increase be funded, given that the general budget of the EU for 2003 has already been implemented and in the light of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets.
The Commission's recent amended proposal (COM/2003/0083 final) states that 'the financial framework adopted by the European Parliament for this regulation can be accommodated within Heading 4 of the Financial perspective and, in particular, within the increased envelope foreseen for ABB Policy Area Development 'and that 'the Commission can therefore accept in its entirety Parliament's position at first reading': is it legitimate to approve such funding from next year's budget been applied before the normal European Parliament procedure has first been applied?
Mr President, the Commission proposal for a legal basis for reproductive and sexual health and related rights in developing countries was put before the legislative authority - in this instance, the Council and Parliament in a codecision procedure - on 7 March 2002.
In accordance with item 33 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999, it is the legislative authority that lays down the financial framework for the entire duration of the programme.
The amount mentioned by Mrs Scallon relates to the budget allocation for the four-year period from 2003 to 2006.
The estimate proposed by Parliament was in excess of the amount originally proposed by the Commission, and so the Commission was asked to check whether this greater amount could be funded under the revised programming for heading 4 of the Budget without exceeding the upper limit imposed on this heading in the Financial Perspective.
The Commission was able to give a binding assurance to the budgetary authority that, in accordance with the policy priorities for future expenditure, as redefined by a resolution of 5 March 2003 in the course of annual strategic planning, such funding was very definitely available.
First, I should like to thank the Commissioner for her response.
I would like to make a special reference to the people of Ireland.
Remembering that funding of any kind of abortion is unconstitutional and illegal in Ireland and that so-called safe abortion is included within this development aid programme, yet also remembering that Ireland has the lowest level of maternal mortality in the world - two in every 100 000 births - what is the response of the Commission to the majority of Irish citizens who are deeply concerned at this unconstitutional use of Irish tax-payers' money?
Mr President, Mrs Scallon, all funds from the European Budget are spent in accordance with the Treaty bases.
The programme in question has to do with the protection of health, both reproductive and sexual, and I believe that my fellow Commissioner Mr Nielson, in anticipation of further interventions by you, has also stated in writing in his letters to you that the relevant programmes are in accordance with the overall international programming in this area.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
We have come to the end of Questions to Mrs Schreyer.
We thank you for your cooperation.
In accordance with the Rules of Procedure and with the well-established customs of this House, the remaining questions will be replied to in writing.
In any event, Mr Alavanos has the floor.
Mr President, these are oral questions.
We still have 10 minutes left.
The first question is my question.
These are not second class questions, nor is there any such practice.
It is that usually we run out of time and, in this sense, I should like to put my question, hear the Commission's answer and proceed to the secondary question to which I am entitled under the Rules of Procedure.
Look, I will explain it to you: I believe I said 'in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and with custom', because never before has a question from the third part been answered in this Parliament.
What has happened is that the Commissioner only had one question to answer.
I believe that the Commission is not in a position to deal with this question as such.
If the Commission is prepared to do so, I will immediately give the floor to Mrs Schreyer, because we are going to set a precedent.
Mrs Schreyer, does the Commission have a response to the question by Mr Alavanos, Question No 41, which is a very interesting question dealing with support for the tourist industry by means of the budget?
I repeat that this is the first time this problem has arisen in all these years.
Mr President, this was not planned to be included in Question Time, and so we will of course provide a written reply.
I am going to give the floor once again to Mr Alavanos so that he can express his opinion and to all the Members who have raised a point of order.
Mr President, I shall not insist, despite the fact that I think that, as a matter of principle, this part of Question Time is included if there is time.
I shall not insist because I know that you always demonstrate flexibility on matters to do with questions and the Members of Parliament.
Nonetheless, however, I have one query: the very title of the question mentions a matter to do with the budget.
Why was it included in part three, rather than with the questions to Commissioner Schreyer?
Nonetheless, as I say, I have no general wish to insist.
As a former Member and an expert on this House - and an even older one than me, and that is saying something - you will know that it is not we temporary Presidents who give the questions their names, but they come already named, already christened, and I can therefore only take note of the issue and explain that we always lack time, but today we have had five minutes left over, and I do not believe - and you will excuse me if I speak to you as just another Member - that we should deal with every debate on the basis of just one five-minute experience.
But I have taken good note of what has happened today and it provides a precedent so that there may be a solution on future occasions.
Three Members will take the floor.
Firstly, Mr RÃŒbig, in accordance with the order in which the floor was requested.
Mr President, I would like to put a question.
As it is the case that various questions are submitted for question times, what method is used to determine the order in which the questions are taken?
I would be interested to know how it is done.
If the Commission draws up the order for replying to questions, it designates the Commissioners who are to reply specifically during their turn, as you can see.
Three Commissioners are designated in turns of twenty minutes, and first the Commission has classified certain questions which are considered urgent and which are also replied to on behalf of the Commission by the Commissioners present.
That is how the order is decided.
In any event, we can send you an explanation in writing for your further information.
Mrs Ahern has the floor.
Mr President, on a point of order, I support Mr Alavanos in what he says.
If you are not going to allow him to take the floor, I would like to put a supplementary question to Commissioner Schreyer on Mrs Scallon's question.
So either you give the floor to Mr Alavanos, or I would like to ask the Commissioner a supplementary question.
Excuse me. Mrs Ahern, Mrs Scallon's question ended several minutes ago.
You had the perfect right to put a supplementary question.
Now, if you want to put a supplementary question to Mrs Schreyer and she wishes to reply, I have no problem with that, of course.
Mrs Schreyer?
Mrs Ahern, please put your question.
I should like to refer to the question referring to 'misuse of the budget to fund abortion'.
This was a really dishonest question, because the funds go into the reserve and they are used for purposes such as HIV.
Abortion rates in Ireland were referred to.
Everybody knows that if you want to have an abortion in Ireland, you go to London!
This is just a completely dishonest expression of the reality.
I just want to make it clear to Mrs Schreyer that, as far as I am concerned, if the money goes into the reserve, it is perfectly reasonable for them to be funding things such as HIV and AIDS in the developing world, particularly in Africa.
I understand that was what the money was actually used for.
Can Mrs Schreyer confirm that?
Mrs Ahern, this Budget line was discussed in depth in the debates leading up to the resolutions on the 2003 Budget.
It is the case that this programme is now in the hands of the legislative authority, that discussions are ongoing, and I believe it to be a matter of general consensus that the European Union should continue to give support in the health sector.
Indeed, this was one reason why we have, among other things, made provision for the European Budget to endow the Global Health Fund with substantial sums, and the programme we are discussing makes an important contribution to putting health care in the developing world on a firmer foundation.
I have nothing to ask the Commissioner. It was an internal point of order.
I think the decision you have made is fine, Mr President, but what I do not understand is why, after the questions set for each of the Commissioners, there is a chapter named 'Other questions'.
I ask this because if I had known that these questions were never going to be answered, I would never have spent so long here; I would have been in my office working.
I therefore believe that we should organise our work better and there should either not be an 'Other questions' section, or, if there is, the Commission should be warned so that it is in a position to answer them if there is time.
Mrs Ferrer, I am going to give you the explanation which, in this case, I can give you.
The Commission is perfectly well informed, because it has received the questions and has put them in order.
The situation is that questions which are not personal and which have not been scheduled have never before been answered in this Parliament.
Why do they appear in the document?
So that they can be answered in writing.
That is why they are there.
And today is the first time this has happened, and we take very good note of the fact.
If I had allowed Commissioner Nielson to speak for five or six minutes more - something which I had intended, or at least imagined doing - we would have used up the time, but the Commissioner, rather than speaking for 20 minutes, has spoken for 48 minutes, and we have therefore given him permission to leave, because he has spoken for an extra 28 minutes and we would have been asking too much of him.
In the question put to Mrs Schreyer, nobody asked supplementary questions, and we therefore had five minutes left over.
Then, a Member who had not asked any supplementary question, when the debate had ended, said, 'then I will put a supplementary question now'.
You witnessed that just as I did.
I believe I have given you a full explanation in accordance with my competences, but I agree with you that there should be prior warning of the questions which are going to be replied to in writing.
And other Members, like yourself, must be aware that these questions are not scheduled to be replied to orally.
In accordance with the Rules of Procedure, since the time allotted to Questions to the Commission has elapsed, Questions Nos 41 to 74 will be replied to in writing.
The next item is the Commission statement on the search made of the Ankara headquarters of the Human Rights Association of Turkey.
Mr President, honourable Members, I wish to make a statement on behalf of the Commission. The Commission is greatly concerned about the Turkish authorities' most recent raid on the offices of the Human Rights Association in Ankara, in the course of which documents and other material were seized.
The persecution of associations such as this one is difficult to understand at a time when, as has happened recently, political reforms have taken place and the fundamental rights of free expression of opinion and freedom of association have been extended.
The Commission has mentioned similar cases in its regular reports, and it takes the view that such incidents are contrary to the objectives of current efforts at reform.
This demonstrates anew how great a gulf there is between political reforms on the one hand and, on the other, the attitude taken by the executive and the judiciary to their implementation.
In connection with this, I would like to emphasise that the implementation of these reforms will be a determining factor in evaluating to what extent the Copenhagen political criteria have been fulfilled.
I will be pointing this out to the Turkish foreign minister, Abdullah GÃŒl, when I have talks with him on Thursday in Brussels.
I have information to the effect that the Turkish minister of justice has, in the meantime, publicly expressed regret for the what the Turkish authorities did in the offices of the Human Rights Association, acknowledging at the same time the great importance of political reforms being implemented across the board.
He also made it clear that any future recurrence of such incidents would not be tolerated.
I would like to expressly draw attention to the fact that the Turkish Human Rights Association enjoys the Commission's active support, having, in the period from 1992 to 1999, had funds to a total of EUR 309 000 made available to it.
Further funding is planned for as part of measures to support fulfilment of the political criteria.
Only recently, on 25 March, the Commission submitted a revised communication on an improved pre-accession strategy for Turkey.
I cannot do other than re-emphasise at this point how vitally important it is that Turkey should, fully and without exceptions, implement all legal reforms as part of everyday practice.
