Could we find a more user-friendly name, such as hello.com, so that people could access it quickly?
Mr President, I wanted to identify the website that I had visited this morning just before this debate.
I can assure the President-in-Office of the Council that the name of the representative of the European Parliament on 7 March is not mentioned in the English version. I would be grateful therefore if you could align that with the Swedish version which is presumably up-to-date as you told us this morning.
I admire all the honourable Members with so much time to surf the Net.
Wish that I could do likewise.
Preparatory work for the Stockholm European Council (23/24 March 2001)
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the preparatory work for the Stockholm European Council on 23 and 24 March 2001.
I shall now give the floor to the President-in-Office of the Council, Mrs Lindh.
Madam President, we have just discussed the future of Europe.
It is really a new Europe, a new Union, which is in the process of being formed.
The greatest change is naturally expansion - the EU is now forging a path for the historic reunification of Europe.
Furthermore, we have just begun the debate on the future and are asking the question of what kind of Europe we want.
Now, however, we will be discussing the third large process of change, namely the modernisation of the European model, in which the European Council in Stockholm on 23 - 24 March will play a central role.
It is about full employment within the EU.
It is about quality of work and lifelong learning.
It is about social and economic reforms.
Last year in Lisbon, the Union made an historic choice in addressing these questions.
They are vital to the citizens and thus also for the political legitimacy of the Union.
14 million people in Europe are still unemployed - a gigantic waste of financial resources and an insult to human knowledge and ambitions.
Having a job and being able to earn a living creates a feeling of participation, security and dignity, while unemployment leads to uncertainty, exclusion and xenophobia.
The road to full employment and increased competitiveness encompasses financial and social reforms such as increased education and lifelong learning, greater equality and modernised social security, strong welfare and quality at work.
It demands open and functioning markets, a healthy macroeconomic policy and a commercial climate which facilitates investment and the establishment of new businesses, especially within growing areas such as IT and biotechnology.
We need a balance between social and economic reforms.
All these areas are dependent on each other if the Union is to achieve its high targets by 2010: creating the world' s leading knowledge-based economy, creating 20 million new jobs and combining competitiveness and greater social cohesion.
The meeting of the European Council in Stockholm is the first in a series of summits this spring in which we will openly and self-critically asses the progress which has been made and make new strides.
The work will be carried out both with community law and the new open coordination method.
It is important to focus our measures within the framework of the Lisbon Process, something emphasised by many people in Parliament.
We must not undermine this process by adding far too many new questions.
We do not need any new processes. Instead, we should point out certain prioritised areas.
In Stockholm, we will firstly further reinforce the ambitious employment targets of 70% of the entire labour force and 60% of women by 2010.
We should consider setting up targets for as early as 2005 and add special targets for the employment of the elderly, a group with enormous potential - only 38% of those aged 55 - 64 are currently in work.
As people are living longer and longer and becoming even healthier, many older people feel unwelcome in the labour market - this situation is slightly absurd.
We will seek to establish a number of important social objectives for equal opportunities, diversity and participation in the workplace.
"Quality of work" - developing quality in working life - is both a welfare issue and the best way of making use of the capacity of employees.
We will seek to confirm the central role of lifelong learning, both for individual development and for European competitiveness, and invite the Commission to also draw up objectives for lifelong learning.
Secondly in Stockholm, we expect that important strides will be made in terms of modernising the European economy.
We will seek to forge ahead with the reform of the financial markets and achieve a common market for financial services by 2005 at the latest and for risk capital by 2003 at the latest.
Achieving this, as Baron Lamfalussy points out in his report, requires a more efficient decision-making process.
We hope that agreement on this will be achieved at the summit.
We also need to continue work on opening up the electricity, gas and postal markets, as well as rail and air traffic.
Opening up product and capital markets is not just an aim in itself.
We are not only doing this for the sake of growth and increased employment, but also because it is good for consumers.
It means lower prices and a wider range and better quality of goods and services.
In this context, external trade policy is also important - free and fair world trade is in the interest of European consumers.
Thirdly in Stockholm, we must address the demographic development of Europe.
Low birth rates and an increasing proportion of elderly people threaten to greatly increase the support burden for those of working age from around 2010 onwards.
We therefore need a wider-ranging overview of pension systems and a discussion of the design of childcare and possibly also health care and care of the elderly.
The social insurance systems must make it easier for people to combine work and family life.
We also need measures for increased participation in the labour market, greater equality and lifelong learning, to address the demographic challenges.
Fourthly in Stockholm, we should facilitate new technology with the aim of creating growth and improving the lives of citizens.
We want to develop the opportunity for creating better drugs with the help of biotechnology, naturally taking moral and ethical dimensions into account.
We want to develop eEurope and combat the digital divide so that IT benefits everyone.
Talking of the previous debate, I can state that it is the Commission which is responsible for the website.
You can therefore contact them with your comments.
Fifthly in Stockholm, we must include the ecological point of view which was lacking in the Lisbon strategy and build a bridge to the summit in Gothenburg.
We would like environmentally-friendly technology to also be seen as an important factor for growth and employment, and we would highlight the importance of the efficient use of resources.
The Councils of Ministers are now investigating how the candidate countries can be linked to this process on all these issues.
I would also like to emphasise the importance of the successful development of Economic and Monetary Union.
In its presidency, Sweden will actively work to ensure that the introduction of euro notes and coins, which is to take place in the currency union in early 2002, is an unqualified success.
This is in our common interest.
I would also like to state that President Putin of Russia will visit Stockholm in connection with the summit on 23 March for an informal working lunch with the Heads of State and Heads of Government of the EU.
We assume that the discussion will primarily focus on financial and social issues.
As usual, the European Council will also discuss current issues in foreign policy, such as the Middle East, the western Balkans and the Korean peninsula.
Madam President, employment and welfare are the most important issues for the citizens of Europe.
If we fail, we face, besides increasing unemployment, xenophobia and greater divisions in society, a crisis of confidence in the Union.
The Lisbon Process is therefore a prerequisite, not only for sustainable growth, full employment and social cohesion in Europe, but also for confidence in European cooperation.
The European Parliament has constantly been a driving force in all these issues and, through its combination of a popular mandate and Europe-wide responsibility, will also play a central role in the work for the future.
I look forward to hearing your opinions.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by congratulating the presidency on the excellent work it has done in preparing for next week's summit in Stockholm.
As has been announced, the presidency has even organised a meeting between European Union leaders and President Putin, on similar lines to the meeting planned with President Bush at Gothenburg in June.
This will be an excellent opportunity to review the main aspects of our partnership with Russia and our partnership with the United States as well.
In particular, I hope we will be able to take stock of the progress of Russia's economic reform programme and improvements in the investment climate that are vital for the success of our energy dialogue and our dialogue on all issues, including matters of citizens' rights, extremely serious issues that we are to discuss.
The second topic I want to focus briefly on today is the Commission's 'Spring Report' .
When I stood before this House just a year ago, it was to present to you the Commission's contribution to the Lisbon Summit.
What the Commission proposed at Lisbon was a detailed strategy for making Europe dynamic and competitive, while, at the same time, promoting social inclusion and solidarity: a strategy for ensuring that economic progress and social progress in Europe go hand in hand.
The outcome of that summit was very positive: the Member States unanimously adopted almost all the Commission's proposals.
The strategy adopted at Lisbon is important in two ways. Firstly, it is an integrated strategy; far from there being tension between the social and economic agendas, they actually support each other.
Secondly, it sets specific tasks for the different players to carry out within specific time frames.
Responsibilities and targets are therefore clear and we will be able to measure our progress clearly.
The Lisbon strategy is designed for a ten year period, and progress is to be assessed annually at the Spring European Council.
As a basis for this assessment, the Commission will produce an annual progress report (known as the 'Synthesis Report' ), which I shall present to this House every year at about this time.
It will become the Commission's key instrument for coordinating social and economic policy.
If the Gothenburg European Council agrees, we shall add an environmental dimension, giving Europe an overall strategy for sustainable development.
The synthesis report will outline our successes since Lisbon, but also identify areas where swifter and more determined action is needed over the next twelve months.
Among the initial successes I am particularly pleased with this year are the adoption of the Social Agenda at Nice, the endorsement of a strategy on social exclusion, and our progress in combating discrimination and ensuring equal opportunities.
These successes should give us great satisfaction and this year's report records them, although it touches only lightly on these particular issues, for we must concentrate on the areas where progress is not satisfactory.
Our report this year highlights ten areas where progress has been unsatisfactory and fresh or greater impetus needs to be given.
Sometimes this is because Member States have been dragging their feet - it has to be said - lacking a sense of urgency or political will, or both. Sometimes it is because circumstances have changed and a new scenario confronts us.
Our report therefore makes very specific recommendations, and at Stockholm I shall make every endeavour to urge the Member States to follow them.
Moreover, these are commitments that these States have made and therefore European leaders need to deliver on them. Two examples are the Community patent and the GALILEO programme.
Let me say just a little more about these two issues, which I consider to be particularly important.
Firstly: the Community patent.
There is an urgent need for a single patent that is legally valid throughout the EU, and there should be a single jurisdiction.
This would cut business costs, encourage innovation and provide a clear legal framework for settling disputes.
Industry and science are clamouring for it, as it will boost competitiveness and employment - especially in the new sectors we need most.
The Lisbon and Feira European Councils recommended that the Community Patent should be available by the end of 2001.
I repeat: the Lisbon and Feira Councils called for this.
The Commission tabled its proposal last autumn, but the Council has been unable to reach agreement on it as we saw again just this week at the Internal Market Council and this can only be alarming.
Above all, we cannot continue to hold Councils where, even in cases in which a majority vote is acceptable, unanimity is strived for and the adoption of proposals deferred.
The Member States must act consistently and show a greater sense of responsibility if this project is to succeed.
Secondly: the GALILEO programme.
The Kosovo war showed only too clearly Europe's total dependence on the American GPS satellite navigation system.
If this is switched off for military reasons, European businesses are forced to suspend many of their operations and there are a number of other examples.
Now then, the GALILEO project offers an alternative that would make Europe self-sufficient in satellite navigation signals for all civilian, military and scientific purposes.
It is an opportunity we simply cannot afford to miss.
It would take only a modest injection of public funds to trigger massive private investment, although I recognise that this private sector participation has yet to be explored in depth, as some governments have been requesting and as, moreover, we undertook to do.
This project, which I see many countries almost do not want to be involved with, could generate more than 100 000 high-level scientific jobs.
I therefore urge this House and the Council to come to an agreement very soon on the next stage of development of this important project.
The Commission, for its part, will display the necessary flexibility as regards the participation of private capital.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would now like to expand on one of the ten priority areas we identified.
I will not go into the whole caboodle, to coin a phrase, just the last point: 'Effective social protection for an ageing population' .
I have picked this topic because it is particularly close to my heart and because it has huge scope; because it has far-reaching implications for all our policies and because it will take us from Stockholm to Gothenburg, which means sustainable development; and because it is an issue that will stay with us for many years to come.
The Lisbon agenda is set against the background of a major challenge: our ageing population.
I am happy to say that Europeans are living longer, but they are also having fewer children and working less.
In the European Union, at present, for every person of 65 or over there are four people of working age.
In 20 years' time, there will be only three and in 40 years' time only two potential workers to every pensioner.
These are the actual data, given that those who have not been born cannot be born in the future: these are the current demographic statistics.
This also applies to almost all the candidate countries as well as the Member States.
In other words, a shrinking workforce will have to support a rapidly growing number of non-working people even in the enlarged European Union.
These are stark, statistical facts that we have to take into consideration.
Do we want Europe to remain a fair, caring society, which is our goal? Do we want our children and grandchildren to enjoy the kind of social security we have come to expect?
Then we must modernise our welfare and pension systems, making them sustainable in the long term.
We need a strategy for consolidating Europe's long-term competitiveness without giving up the social inclusion that characterises our societies.
I want Europe to be not only the most competitive region in the world, but also the region with the highest level of social inclusion.
The post-war era has brought unprecedented prosperity to all the States of European society.
Today, our societies are - on average - the wealthiest in history.
At the same time, well-developed welfare and pension systems have distributed our wealth so as to ensure a minimum of social justice: not the level we had hoped for but still a minimum level of social justice.
However, these systems were built on the criteria of expanding or at least stable populations.
Now that our working population is shrinking, we are facing a potential structural crisis in the distribution of wealth, a crisis that could, in the space of a few decades, severely undermine the European Union's competitiveness, Economic and Monetary Union and our social model, given that our objective is to preserve a sound social protection model.
We must therefore take action now.
We need to develop a long-term policy mix and start to think very hard about what sort of social justice and intergenerational equity we want, and what our political criteria for achieving it should be.
Social protection systems are, of course, a national responsibility, and, I would stress, it is primarily up to the Member States - not the European Union institutions - to bring about the necessary reforms.
There are, however, four key areas where we have to develop appropriate strategies. They are intergenerational equity, distribution of work, social and family policy and immigration.
Although the national governments are free to act autonomously in these matters, we must give thought to their development here.
Firstly: intergenerational equity.
The ageing of our societies is placing a substantial extra financial burden on certain generations.
If no adjustments are made, today's younger generation will have to pay not only for their parents' and grandparents' retirement pensions but also for their own, because by the time they retire the pension system will have become unworkable.
If adjustments are not made to take full account of the demographic factor, parts of today's adult generation could fall into poverty.
Secondly: the distribution of work.
Not everyone of working age actually works.
Quite apart from the difficulties preventing young people from entering the labour market early enough, there is a trend towards early retirement that shortens people's working lives by 10 years or more.
This aggravates the long-term strain on the pension systems.
Moreover, as of about 2007, our workforce could be too small to meet our economic needs.
We shall be facing a labour shortage in the Union.
In future, therefore, all generations will have to work longer.
We need to keep older people active in the economy, at least part time.
We must ensure they have the skills needed for types of work that may be new to them.
Therefore - and this is our duty - we shall urge the Member States to invest much more in education and training for young and old alike.
Lifelong learning is essential in order to update people's skills constantly and enable them to adapt to change.
This policy should help ease labour shortages, improve intergenerational equity and give the citizens a more satisfying old age.
Thirdly: social and family policy: There are far too few women in work.
The employment rate for women is only just over 70% of the employment rate for men.
In its report for Stockholm, the Commission urges the Member States to make it easier for women to enter or re-enter the labour market.
Women must, of course, be given the same job opportunities, working conditions and pension schemes as men, and we must make it easier for both sexes to reconcile work and family life, especially if we want to encourage people to have children.
In short, we need to take ever better care of our increasingly depleted human resources.
Fourthly and lastly: immigration.
Bringing young people with the right skills into the European Union is another way to increase the size of our workforce.
We have a frontier-free, Europe-wide labour market: we urgently need a Europe-wide immigration policy to match.
The basis for this policy should be the 'shared assessment of the economic and demographic developments within the Union' which the Tampere European Council called for.
Last November, the Commission issued a communication on this subject, and I hope that this House and the Council will examine it as soon as possible.
Madam President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, I said just now that pensions and social protection systems are essentially national responsibilities and that it is for the Member States to bring about the necessary reforms.
Nevertheless, the European Union, and the Commission in particular, does have a responsibility in this field.
To conclude my speech, let me therefore outline what the Commission is doing to provide adequate responses to the problems linked to the ageing population.
One of the great successes of Lisbon was that the Member States agreed, for the first time, to coordinate their action on welfare reform, exchanging experiences and best practices.
This process must be enhanced.
They also mandated the High Level Working Party on Social Protection to study the sustainability of social protection and, in particular, of pension systems, on the basis of a Commission communication.
Thus, welfare reform is part of the Lisbon agenda and the Commission is playing its part.
It will make clear the true scale of the demographic problem so that the European public can understand it.
In the first place, our public finance accounting systems do not give a true picture at present.
We need to develop indicators that show the long-term implications of our social spending and tax decisions, in particular with regard to pensions.
Secondly, we need to bring the single market fully into play with regard to pensions.
At present, unlike insurance, pension funds are not covered by a European Union legal framework.
However, the Commission is fully committed to bringing the single market into full play here.
We have already tabled a proposal for a directive and I hope the Council will act swiftly on it.
This directive forms part of our Financial Services Action Plan that the European Council agreed should be implemented within five years.
I urge this House and the Council to speed up their work on this plan.
A properly regulated, pan-European pension fund market will increase the mobility of workers and pensioners and give them better value for money.
At present, pension provision is unnecessarily expensive, and this is a waste we can no longer afford.
Pension schemes must therefore be made fully portable within the European Union.
At Stockholm, Member States will have to sweep away the tax barriers that obstruct the cross-border payment of pension contributions and the cross-border management of pension funds.
We are not talking about a tax revolution here: this is a matter of an extremely sensible adjustment, to which the citizens have every right.
Coordination of national tax systems is essential here, and the Commission will be tabling its proposals.
Thirdly, it is vital that we address the effects of ageing on public finances.
The effects of ageing on our social systems must reinforce our commitment to reducing public debt.
The interest saved must be used to support pensions and healthcare.
This is a matter of social justice, and the Commission's Synthesis Report will urge the Member States to continue the reforms already under way along these lines.
The citizens need time to make provision for their old age.
Action is required now to prevent social systems from losing public credibility.
Fourthly and lastly, we need to incorporate the long-term sustainability aspect of public finances into Economic and Monetary Union.
The current 'close to balance' rule in the EMU Stability and Growth Pact has done a great service to the cause of safe pensions.
We must acknowledge this fact and be proud of it, but the long-term sustainability of public finances is not included in the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact.
Imagine, for example, that a particular Member State is currently running balanced budgets but that its spending programmes will mean increasing deficits and debt within the next ten years.
In a situation of this kind, the European Union can do nothing to induce that country to change course because the European Union does not possess the necessary instruments, nor does it possess the instruments to influence the quality of the adjustments undertaken, yet that country's chances of long-term success basically depend on their getting the adjustments right today.
This was less important in the run-up to EMU, where action had to be taken in the short to medium term, but the ageing of our population makes long-term action on public finances essential.
What we need, therefore, is a renewed commitment to maintaining stable public finances that can sustain social protection in the longer term.
Indeed, sound public finances must be an integral part of the strategy for sustainable development in Europe.
The Commission will be proposing just such a strategy, and it will be the main subject of the Gothenburg Summit in June.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the subject I have chosen to raise in this House today is a difficult and technical one, but it is crucial for the prosperity of future generations in Europe.
There is not, and there never will be, one single model of social inclusion in Europe.
Each Member State will make its own choice, reflecting its own traditions, culture and the will of its people.
Nevertheless, we have to establish an overall framework, and this can only be done at European Union level.
This House is, of course, the European institution where the democratic debates on the fundamental aspects of our fellow citizens' future have to take place.
Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, my Commission is ready to fully play its part together with you.
Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, President Prodi, the target the Union set itself a year ago in Lisbon to become the world' s most competitive and dynamic economic area, which could achieve both sustainable growth and create new and better jobs, and greater social cohesion, hardly lacks ambition.
There may be unanimity regarding the aim; there are, however, clear political differences when it comes to the choice of remedies and how they are prioritised.
We, the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, would like to emphasise that the following are some of the most important ways of fulfilling this aim: full implementation of the Single Market, the speedy liberalisation of monopolies, such as the electricity and gas boards and the Post Office, and opening up public procurement to genuine competition, without letting the question of local employment blur the issue.
We would like to stress that employment targets will be achieved by encouraging entrepreneurship, SMEs being the most significant employers.
We would like to stress that excessive regulation, too much faith in the omnipotence of legislation, and burdensome taxation are the worst enemies of employment.
We would also like to emphasise that an innovative and information-based economy, in which everyone is given equal opportunities and individuals are given the right to get ahead and live their lives according to their own goals, means making the European labour markets a lot more flexible.
It is this very lack of flexibility that separates us from the efficient US economy.
Another way of increasing efficiency is to strengthen our educational systems by making them more adaptable to the needs of individuals.
We must have educational establishments maintained by the state, but we also need private ones so that a competition situation may develop, based both on the students and the choice of different educational approaches.
In our opinion, modernising the European social model must be made to move up a gear by making it less dependent on publicly financed collective solutions that aim to maintain social cohesion.
If we want to become the world' s best economy, we have to ask ourselves a few questions.
Has the US economy grown as a result of restrictions there, over-taxation, legislation introduced with the apparent aim of giving protection, artificially preserving unproductive jobs, restricting competition or seeking to increase federal bureaucracy?
Not at all; just the opposite, in fact!
Have Sweden, and Finland too, seen success as IT countries in Europe and achieved peak growth because they have imposed more and more regulation?
No. It is because for just over a decade both countries have invested in training and research and their conservative governments reduced the hold the state had on the economy.
Has Ireland succeeded through regulation?
No, it has deregulated and supported external investments by means of tax concessions, doing so well that we even have to give it a telling off for its success.
The remedies for improved employment levels are simple.
They are those I have mentioned, and not the well-intentioned but ineffective remedies of guardianship, control, and planning, which our socialist friends so greatly favour.
In the run-up to the Stockholm meeting Parliament must, however, voice a concern to the Commission and the Council.
The gulf between the targets set and the measures taken to implement them is widening on a daily basis, although there are certainly differences between the various countries.
The Council must achieve results quickly in its continued programme of liberalisation and improving the business climate, especially now that we are clearly headed for a period of uncertainty, with the USA in the lead, as prices on the stock markets fall and confidence weakens in companies and amongst consumers.
If confidence goes, the strong economy goes too, and who will then give us guarantees of better jobs, better education and greater social cohesion?
The Lisbon process is not the only one which has seen a hiccup in the European machine.
Although the decisions taken at Tampere on a common security area have remained in the background in the debate, their implementation has been just as slow, if not slower, than the Lisbon process.
If we do not effectively prevent crime there cannot even be a real Single Market or Schengen area.
A viable Single Market also requires, to mention just one detail, a viable, effective and safe air traffic system.
At the moment, two countries, Spain and Britain, could torpedo efforts to achieve air safety and increased efficiency by squabbling over the insignificant airport at Gibraltar.
It is hard to believe that the same countries are advising how to solve the Balkan crisis or the situation that has flared up in the Middle East.
I would also like to thank - as Mr Poettering did - Mrs Lindh for her very constructive approach to the Stockholm meeting. I might even say you are welcome to join our group when your ministerial term has finished, as what you said was so much to our liking.
And now I will switch to the other official language of Finland, and say: Mrs Lindh, actual measures are what we need, and not just talk about objectives.
That is very reassuring, Mr President. I thought that a flying saucer was just about to take off.
Madam President-in-Office, President of the Commission, in view of the generally illegible resolutions that Parliament is in the habit of adopting, let me formulate a few simple ideas.
First of all a discovery: the European Union is not doing too badly.
Of course, unemployment is still too high, but 2.5 million new jobs have been created.
In 2000, we saw satisfactory economic growth and Europe became the pole of growth for the global economy.
Inflation is lower in Europe than in the United States. Public deficits have been reduced.
Salary increases have been in line with productivity gains. The internal market and the imminent launch of the euro will protect us even further against external shocks.
Therefore, the US economic slow-down will affect us less than usual because trade exchanges between the fifteen Member States constitute nine tenths of our joint domestic product.
Of course, there are deficits in Europe especially in new technologies, this being less marked for information technologies than for biotechnologies.
In 2000, European investment in the ICT sector was higher than in the United States, even though some countries are still lagging well behind.
The leading exporting force in the world, in 2000 the European Union achieved one fifth of its exports in the high tech sector.
Not everything is perfect in Europe, of course. We do not invest enough in education, training and lifelong learning.
There is not enough investment in research. Our public spending is at the same level as in the United States and the private sector must make more effort.
We can do better in many areas.
Stockholm must give the necessary impetus, particularly in employment and social affairs, as Mrs Lindh has just underlined.
By making the right choices in Stockholm, we will be able to set a virtual circle in motion which will also benefit our partners in the rest of the world.
Making the correct choices is not about choosing unbridled liberalisation and deregulation without regard for our social model and our environment.
Structural reforms still need to be carried out; corporate and protectionist reflexes still need to be surmounted. It will not, however, be by demolishing a universal public service that we will obtain a better service and lower prices for consumers.
Deregulation does not mean the lack of regulation.
Deregulation always results in new rules, which do not always benefit consumers, as electricity consumers in California have just discovered.
The liberalisation of the telecommunications sector above all has seen positive results because it took place at the same time as the technology revolution with mobile phones and the Internet.
The new economy has nevertheless experienced problems.
Any new technology is just a tool.
Simply prefixing an e to customary economic terms does not eliminate the long-established rules of supply and demand and of the need for profitability.
The world' s stock markets are currently paying dearly for the lack of respect shown to elementary economic rules.
The end to irrational exuberance on the financial markets paradoxically offers us the chance to turn our attention to the real economy and to influence the factors which are fundamental for the well-being of our citizens.
Mr President, I will finish by saying, as President Prodi has just said, that the priority at Stockholm must be to invest in people, education, information and research into the infrastructures that we have for improving the quality of life.
Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioner, representatives of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, in making an assessment of the observable results during the first year of implementation of the Lisbon agreements, we reach very limited conclusions.
Lisbon established a process to run throughout this decade aimed at turning the European economy into the most competitive, best trained, and most socially balanced economy in the world. However, we note that, at least at the end of this first year, which takes us from Lisbon to Stockholm, there are very few tangible results.
We are not satisfied.
We believe that, although the objectives were clearly established, we have neither made quick enough progress on the process of liberalisation, which should improve competition between markets, nor have we implemented the structural reforms necessary to better equip the infrastructures. Nor have we implemented the instruments necessary to become more competitive and to bring us into line, particularly with the United States, in terms of levels of training in areas in which we have the greatest advantage, that is to say technological development and scientific research.
We believe that we have to proceed much more quickly in these areas and we wish to focus on three fundamental questions which I will try to summarise in my few remaining seconds.
Firstly, structural reforms and liberalisation.
Secondly, incorporation and interest on the part of the private sector in the fields of high quality education and training. Thirdly, a significant reform of the labour market which, on the one hand, will promote the incorporation of workers and the least-favoured groups into the labour market and, on the other, will provide greater and better mobility in employment within the European Union.
Mr President, Minister, President of the Commission, I would just like to make a few brief comments on the Lisbon European Council and on the resolution we have just signed on behalf of the group, without a great deal of enthusiasm it must be said.
Mr Prodi, I should like to address the following comments to you.
It is clear that in Lisbon the European Union set itself a very ambitious objective, that of achieving a competitive economy.
We support this project but we would like to draw your attention to the needs of our citizens.
A genuine project for the 21st century must take on board the real needs of our citizens.
I read in a newspaper yesterday that the mobile telephone market has reached saturation point with approximately 50 to 60 million surplus mobile telephones.
Yet, in the European Union, not every citizen has the possibility of finding decent housing.
Meeting the needs of our citizens is therefore crucial.
In this respect, we also support the idea of environmental indicators and we deplore the fact that we will have to wait until the Barcelona European Council in 2002 before we actually have an integrated strategy.
We wish your communication on sustainable development every success but we would like matters to proceed more quickly.
My second comment is about the instruments.
Liberalising sectors is good but it must go hand in hand with obligations to provide services of general interest.
From this perspective, and while respecting the principle of subsidiarity, we support the idea of the European Union having a framework directive on its obligations to provide public services of general interest, which is not the case at the moment.
I would like to make one final comment on the public finances you mentioned. I would ask you to pay attention, in the development of public spending, to the fact that there are perfectly legitimate areas of public spending, such as investment and education, which are sine qua non conditions if we want to meet the future challenges of society.
The role of public authorities and public spending is therefore of paramount importance within the context of the Lisbon strategy.
Mr President, the Lisbon decisions were unique. On the one hand, they were characterised by a clearly right-wing financial policy of deregulation and privatisation and, on the other hand, by a left-wing policy of full employment, which thus, for the first time, became an official goal for the EU.
There was talk of a social agenda, social cohesion, combating poverty, lifelong learning for all, etc., in other words natural elements of left-wing policy.
At that time I was very surprised.
I wondered how it was possible to unite - or balance, as Mrs Lindh said - right-wing and left-wing policy at the same time.
Now, the picture has become clearer, and I see that disagreement on financial policy remains.
Right-wing policy is clearly dominant ahead of the Stockholm Summit.
The focus is on stability policy, liberalisation and deregulation of the internal market.
The social profile is very weak.
The Stockholm Summit was to have employment as its main issue, but there are no proposals for meaningful action to combat the major unemployment which currently affects 14 - 15 million people.
One aim is to encourage women to enter the workplace.
This is good.
Another aim is to increase employment of the older population, raise the retirement age, etc. However, the proposals are primarily aimed at increasing the level of employment, not at lowering unemployment.
These are two different things.
The 15 million people who are unemployed in Europe today but already count as part of the labour force will not benefit to any great degree from new groups joining that labour force.
My political group considers that this is very serious.
The Swedish Government should naturally also be concerned but, unlike France and Portugal, it has chosen not to create its own profile but instead to implement what the Commission and the large Member States want as loyally as possible.
When, in the past, the Swedish Government was heading the campaign for Sweden to join the EU, it said the goal was not only to retain the Swedish welfare state but also, together with other left-wing forces, to pursue a social welfare policy throughout Europe.
Now, we are heading in the opposite direction.
Right-wing policy is promoted in the EU, and the Swedish welfare policy is at risk.
This is taking place despite the fact that the economy is sound, despite a majority of left-wing governments in the Council and despite a left-wing majority in the Swedish Parliament.
Not even given optimum conditions have we in the last year approached a social Europe.
What will happen if the economic situation deteriorates and the Council gains more right-wing governments?
Time has run out for the Swedish Presidency.
To conclude, I wonder whether there really is nothing which the Swedish Government could prioritise ahead of the coming employment summit for those who are unemployed here and now.
Mr President, the forthcoming Stockholm Summit will address many of the European Union's key social and employment problems.
This is very timely, when new information technologies are ensuring that small, medium and large enterprises within the Union will now have to change their administrative structures.
I support the agenda set by the EU leaders at their summit in Lisbon last year.
The Union must continue to implement uniform and rights-led programmes of education relating to new information technologies, so that all citizens of the Union can be properly integrated into the workplace.
This presents us with two challenges.
First, those who are unskilled and lack the necessary training or educational qualifications must be given new opportunities.
I am referring in particular to the young and long-term unemployed still concentrated in certain urban and rural areas of the European Union.
The European Union Social Fund is a key financial mechanism which has been used very effectively, particularly in Objective 1 regions, to provide new training opportunities for the unskilled.
Secondly, it is equally important that the existing workforce is retrained in the skills demanded by new and changing information technologies.
Benefits can accrue for business from the use of the Internet and the related e-commerce opportunities.
Certainly the Commission, Parliament and Member States' governments have all worked closely together to ensure that the Stockholm Summit will be a success.
I recall that the Nice Council before Christmas set out a number of guidelines for new social policy measures.
EU leaders want to promote more and better jobs and worker mobility, anticipate and manage change in the working environment, combat poverty, exclusion and discrimination, modernise social protection systems and promote equality.
They also want to focus on the external implications of employment and social policies, particularly in relation to the enlargement process.
Parliament has been at the forefront of promoting these measures.
The Union has an unemployment rate of 8% and the target of full employment is attainable.
Those who say that it is not must not be listened to.
Mr President, in order to crank up the political-social debate on biotechnology, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands have asked for this topic to be added to the agenda of the Stockholm Summit.
These Member States have indicated that the European Commission must think of a strategy which will lead to the European Union rubbing shoulders with the greatest in the global bio-industry and biotechnological research.
However promising the results of biotechnology may be, an ethical boundary remains necessary.
In January 1998, we held a debate on the Council of Europe' s Protocol, which included a ban on cloning humans.
I then expressed the fear that countries such as the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, which then refused to sign the protocol, probably did not want the ban to be so stringent.
In December 2000, the House of Lords in the United Kingdom gave the green light to the therapeutic cloning of human embryos in laboratories.
Although reproductive cloning is not permitted, research carries on.
There is the danger that permitting therapeutic cloning will leave the door open to the discussion on reproductive cloning.
The argument will then be that, at the end of the day, the same technique is already being applied, only for a different purpose.
There is a doctor in Italy who already wants to clone people reproductively, and 60 volunteers have already come forward for this experiment.
I see each new human life as a gift of God.
Every form of human life must be treated with due respect.
That is also the only way to protect human dignity.
The use of human embryos as consumer items, in the so-called name of research, is hence something that goes against the grain as far as I' m concerned.
In the discussion on human genetics, I call on the Council to maintain the ban on therapeutic cloning, as already expressed by the European Parliament in September 2000.
Mr President, it is almost impossible to discuss this issue in this arena.
I wonder whether Mr Suominen' s statement regarding 'not words but deeds' also applies to you?
What sanctions do you impose on people sabotaging this system?
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, I asked you to be patient for ten minutes and that was half an hour ago.
Indeed, the problem does not seem to have been resolved.
We have been talking here this morning about high technology and it seems we still have some way to go.
I have asked the appropriate departments to take quick action but I, like you, am impatient for this noise to stop.
Mr President, the Lisbon Process is to create the most dynamic economy in the world.
Open coordination has been chosen as the method, and I would like to share my experiences.
Sweden has taken part in a number of summits and processes.
Ever since the Essen Summit of 1994, there has been talk of the importance of lowering taxes on work and increasing flexibility.
In practice, Sweden has done the opposite.
Just as with its self-imposed exclusion on the question of the euro, it ignores what has been jointly decided.
Instead, the tax burden is increased and entrepreneurs continue to be hampered.
In Stockholm, we must make comparisons and learn from each other.
So how will that work?
It is true that there is talk of increased employment but the truth in Sweden is that, despite three years of economic growth, more people remain outside the workforce than was the case in the early 1990s when we experienced the worst recession since the Second World War.
At the same time, real unemployment is hidden by labour market policy and temporary mass training initiatives which do not lead to quality jobs.
Furthermore, the statistics include a frightening rate of sick leave.
If we add latent job-seekers and the under-employed, unemployment in Sweden covers 17% of the workforce - compared with the official statistic of 5%.
The Lisbon Document talked a great deal about knowledge.
Despite all the talk of lifelong learning, in terms of knowledge, Sweden risks meltdown as we are failing right from the start.
34% of young people in upper secondary schools lack satisfactory qualifications in mathematics, Swedish and English.
At the same time, raising quality within education through independent schools and increased competition is being thwarted - exactly contrary to the intentions in Lisbon.
Swedish universities are in crisis.
It is true that Sweden has many people with degrees, but it lacks people with real cutting-edge expertise.
Therefore, the socialists are lowering taxes for rich specialists that have been flown in and raising taxes for permanently resident, poorly-educated Swedes.
Talking and planning is one thing - especially if you can do it in a meeting room somewhere else in Europe - but implementing and changing requires greater conviction.
Power to act is needed now, not least for national structural reforms and increased liberalisation at EU level.
Instead of devoting myself to meaningless compromises and fine words, I intend to continue to criticise the European model, which has so far not been able to create many new jobs but instead sentences far too many people to long-term unemployment, social exclusion, poverty and marginalisation.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe has a very good chance of achieving the major objective set in Lisbon, i.e. of becoming the most competitive area with full employment.
The economic indicators are good, but this objective will not achieve itself and it will not implement itself. We must have the courage to set decisive priorities.
Lisbon gave us clear guidelines within which to find the courage to set decisive priorities and move forward using a method of open coordination between the Member States.
These guidelines are clear and unequivocal.
They mean investing in people and in their skills and we have good cause to do so.
On the one hand, we talk of the new opportunities offered by information and communications technologies and of the millions of jobs which they can create.
But on the other hand, fewer than 22% of our employees are given specific training.
We talk of the opportunities of a new European labour market and mobility for the young generation, but we stop short of creating the right conditions for it in our schools and on our vocational training programmes.
We talk of already having bottlenecks on the specialist job markets, but we seem unable to implement a specific integration policy to help the unemployed - and there are well over 14 million in the European Union - make their own contribution to the working population.
I ask you, Mr President of the Commission, and I ask you, Madam President-in-Office: there has been talk here of the stability pact, which was supposedly a success.
Why are we unable to apply the same rigour, the same clear method of open coordination so as to ensure that every young person on the European labour market has a suitable chance to get started in a new European future?
That is the brief for Stockholm, that is the brief for the following summit, which is precisely why Stockholm must not degenerate into a one-sided liberalisation summit.
I know that the balance spoken of here is in jeopardy, which is why I call on you, Madam President-in-Office, to summon up the strength and courage in the Swedish Presidency to put the integrated policy of economic reform, social cohesion and job promotion which we welcomed into practice.
This is precisely why we need clear, uncompromising interim objectives, both for the employment process and for the new public budget guidelines.
Mr President, we welcome the Lisbon Summit's emphasis on dealing with social exclusion.
That emphasis recognises what is already clear. Despite the gradual increase in economic growth within the Union over the years, there are still millions of people who have not benefited.
Indeed, in some Member States, such as my own, which have tended to follow the American model, the gap between rich and poor has been widening.
We are also seeing significant numbers of working poor, those who have jobs but cannot afford to live on their wages.
There is a still a huge gap between the incomes of men and women, which continues into old age and must be an important issue in the discussion on pensions.
Growth alone is not the solution to social deprivation and it never has been.
Distribution and equality of opportunity are also important, hence the need to include social criteria alongside the economic goals and the use of appropriate indicators to look at the combined effect.
As we have heard, however, Stockholm will not just deal with the Lisbon follow-up.
It will be a first step towards explaining how the European Union is going to deliver on sustainable development.
It is obvious to us that unless we factor the environment into our economic thinking there will no chance of having a sustainable economy.
We have to find an economic path that does not strip the world of its natural resources and produce toxic or greenhouse emissions.
That means we have to look at the quality of the economic growth we seek and not just the amount.
If 3% growth depends on depleting fish stocks, increasing car travel or cleaning up after crime, it is not the sort of growth that improves the quality of life or quality of the environment for anyone.
It is not sustainable and that is why we have urged the use of appropriate environmental indicators alongside the social and economic ones.
We can then adopt a coherent approach to sustainable development and see if we really are achieving the results we want.
Mr President, the headlong and often uncontrolled development of society and the economy calls for an extra effort at the Stockholm Council.
The crisis in food production, incorporating the collapse of stock-rearing and the distribution, processing and sale of meat is a priority issue, as are consumer anxiety and apprehension about the consequences of eating food contaminated by disease, deterioration or adulteration. There is the ever-increasing scandal of food fraud, and mass distribution has an enormous responsibility for guaranteeing the distribution of food that is safe for consumers to eat and for preventing the systematic destruction of the whole of small and medium-sized distribution - which is an essential factor for local speciality products and preserving jobs.
We are wondering, too, whether Stockholm will mark the birth of the Food Safety Agency, announced long ago and always postponed, and we put forward the city of Parma as the most appropriate candidate for its location.
We are also wondering about safety with regard to the use of wholly or partly genetically modified foods, and about the weight of that problem with regard to baby foods, pharmaceutical products or products on general sale such as vitamins or integrators containing animal gelatines.
Other questions relate to scientific research into BSE, the disposal of tens of thousands of animal carcasses, slaughtered and burned, or slaughtering methods that often fail to show even minimal respect for the animals themselves and the environment; and again, natural catastrophes, often not so natural, when bridges collapse, houses crumble and rivers burst their banks, destroying men and property because the people who built them were negligent and disregarded the law and the safety of the territory.
The Stockholm Summit should address all those issues along with other factors, such as the on-going unregulated use of the Internet, at least as far as the European Union is concerned. Regulation is needed to guarantee that the network is about freedom and not about abuse and violence, as in sites promoting paedophilia, drug trafficking and so on.
The record companies and the economy have closed Napster down.
When will the European governments close down the paedophile sites? And last but not least, there is the pollution of the Mediterranean and other seas.
And we wonder if the Stockholm Council will at least take an interest in the slump in the new market and the consequences for consumers.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, my point concerns the liberalisation of postal services, which you too referred to, Madam President-in-Office.
The postal services are one example of just how inefficient Council meetings are.
It was decided in Lisbon to speed up the liberalisation of postal services.
We adopted our position in the European Parliament before the end of the year, in the hope that the Council would adopt its common position by the end of the year.
What happened?
Not a thing!
The Council did not adopt a common position.
We should in fact admit to ourselves that the Council does not want to adopt a common position.
Germany has decided to extend the post office monopoly because everything has ground to a halt in Europe.
Madam President-in-Office, we call on you to ensure at the Stockholm Summit that the Heads of State and Government instruct their ministers to proceed with the liberalisation of postal services without delay.
Only this will prove that Council meetings make any sense or any headway.
And then you should pass a second resolution, Madam President-in-Office, stating that the Heads of State and Government must evaluate structural policy, post haste.
We must be in a position to reform structural policy in 2003 at the latest, for two reasons.
Firstly, because structural policy is extremely important to labour market policy in numerous countries and, secondly, because we have to tell candidate countries what to expect in the new period if they accede after 2005/2006.
In this respect, Madam President-in-Office, please make sure that the summit passes specific resolutions on the liberalisation of postal services and the evaluation of the structural funds so that we can make headway for the period after 2006.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your attention.
Thank you, Mr Jarzembowski.
The debate on this issue is suspended and will be resumed at 3 p.m.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Mr President, I would like to present the House with a point of order.
Yesterday afternoon, during Questions to the Commission, there was a Question No 91 from the Spanish People' s Party MEP, Mrs GarcÃ­a-Orcoyen.
The last question answered during those Questions to the Commission was Question No 61.
Today, certain sections of the Spanish press are publishing the 'question' and the supposed reply from Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m.
This morning, after becoming aware of this information, the Socialist Group made a written request to the Parliamentary services to issue that reply.
At 11.28 this morning we received the following written reply from the services of this House:
'I must inform you that the reply to the said question from Mrs GarcÃ­a-Orcoyen, which was communicated to us when Question Time had ended, is awaiting translation.
Once translated and sent officially to the author you will be sent a copy by e-mail.
Signed: JoÃ£o Correa' .
How is it possible, Mr President, that we MEPs do not have the reply - and nor did the author of the question - when it is already in the hands of the press, not only the supposed reply, but also an explanatory communication of the response from the Spanish People' s Party, explaining it?
Mr President, this is the second time in one month that something like this has happened and supposed replies are being leaked to the Spanish media before the MEPs themselves - and, I repeat, even the authors of the questions - have heard the reply.
How can this happen?
Is it pure chance that on these two occasions the supposed reply supports the positions of the Spanish Government?
Does the Spanish Government have a mole somewhere in the Commission or in Parliament?
Mr President, as an MEP, I would ask you for protection for Parliament and respect for MEPs.
As you clearly indicate in your comments, the services of this House were not in touch with the media in any way.
If there has been a leak it has come from the Commission and we will certainly take this matter up with them.
It is unacceptable that the media should receive an answer before the Member who tabled the question receives such an answer.
Mr President, I simply wanted to point out that the Spanish media are very professional and that it therefore does not surprise me that they have this ability to access sources of information.
I always like hearing about people who are good at their job.
VOTE
Mr President, on this important report, I would like to say that the Commission is able to accept Amendments Nos, 3, 4, 7, part of 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, the second part of 13, 14, 16, part of 17, part of 18, part of 19, 21, 28 and part of 29.
We are able to accept Amendments Nos 39 and 40.
In addition, Amendments Nos 1, 2, 5 and 23 are acceptable in principle.
However, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is unable to accept Amendments Nos 6, the first part of 13, 15, 20, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, 31, 32, 33, 35, 36, 37, 38, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50 and 51.
(The President declared the common position approved as amended)
Recommendation for second reading (A5-0067/2001) by Mrs Myller, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council directive on national emission ceilings for certain atmospheric pollutants (10674/1/2000 - C5-0563/2000 - 1999/0067(COD))
Before the vote:
Mr President, on this report the Commission is able to accept Amendments Nos 2, 11 and 12.
We are in principle able to accept part of Amendments Nos 3, 7, 8 and 9.
However, we are unable to accept Amendments Nos 1, 4, 5, 6, 10 and 13.
After the vote on Amendment No 13:
Mr President, I think a mistake was made in the vote a moment ago.
The second part of Amendment No 10 did not receive a majority, which means that there was no need to vote on the second part of Amendment No 13.
As a result of this, the second part of the Council' s text remains unchanged.
Actually I disagree with you but there is no need to debate the issue.
Given the vote, the outcome is the same.
(The President declared the common position adopted as amended)
Recommendation for second reading (A5-0055/2001) by Mr Miller, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council directive relating to heating systems for motor vehicles and their trailers, and amending Council Directive 70/156/EEC and repealing Council Directive 78/548/EEC (7074/1/2000 - C5-0615/2000 - 1998/0277(COD))
Before the vote:
Mr President, as my colleague, Mr Liikanen, said yesterday, the Commission is able to accept Amendments Nos 1 and 2.
I am glad to see the Scots getting one hundred percent.

(Parliament adopted the resolution)
President.
That concludes the vote.
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTEJackson report (A5-0041/2001)
Mr President, I voted against the Jackson report on the environmental inspections conciliation.
I voted against it just now as I voted against it during the conciliation, in which I was pleased to participate as a substitute member.
Once again, I ask why on earth we cannot have a directive controlling environmental inspections.
All that means is that our Member States do not want to be controlled in implementing Community environmental standards.
Remember, the war in Iraq began because President Saddam Hussein did not want controls on his own territory.
I would not want Europe to suffer the same fate.
Recommendation for second reading Oomen-Ruijten (A5-0068/2001)
Mr President, why do you think I voted for the report allowing pensioners and old folk to breath clean air?
Well, as you know, today is 14 March 2001, and I heard someone calling me: 'Mr Fatuzzo, Mr Fatuzzo!'
'Who' s that?'
I replied.
'It' s me, don' t you recognise me?'
'Me who?'
'Me, Carlo Fatuzzo!
I' m Mr Fatuzzo the man.'
'Ah, and you only remember me once a year?'
'Yes, I know, every time your birthday comes round I wish you a happy birthday, because today is my birthday!'
'Okay, thank you, just let me get on with my work, I' m presenting my explanation of vote.'
'Mr Fatuzzo, your should remember that this is your 57th birthday and that means you are getting close to collecting your pension.
I just wanted to say that I am very pleased that Mr Fatuzzo the MEP is looking after pensioners, because that means he is looking after me as well, Mr Fatuzzo the man, who is getting another year older every year and who is getting close to collecting his pension too.'
Mr President, I think it is quite absurd that the European Parliament deals with certain issues in such a technical way.
We have seen amendments that would be difficult even for an expert to understand, so imagine what they are like for people who are not experts in the field.
Also, with all the will in the world and no matter how hard the amendments are studied, no one without a certain kind of knowledge can possibly understand them properly.
I repeat, it is an absurd, illogical thing which should make those in power - and I certainly do not mean the Members of this Parliament - think about changing things so that technical matters are left to the technical experts and political matters are dealt with by the politicians, because we have codecision on those things, and then other things, more comprehensible and more political, are decided by someone else instead.
The amendments that have been tabled are largely based on correct assumptions in the context of effectively reducing emissions of pollutants and of protecting the environment and public health, which do not justify the derogations put forward by the proposal for a Council common position, because:
desulphurisation processes are not as onerous these days as they once were and tend to bring about considerable reductions.
Furthermore, significant progress has been made in this area;
there is a clear commitment to methods for improving the energy efficiency of combustion plant, using catalytic systems, which contribute not only to reducing carbon compounds but also to reducing other pollutants.
This is why I am voting in favour of this report.
It is down to the European Union to regulate emissions from combustion plants.
The wind does not recognise borders, and pollutants emitted by large combustion plants pass over all the Member States as well as the candidate countries.
The main problem is to be able to fix ambitious limit values which will protect the health of all our citizens while acknowledging the possibilities of the different plants and power stations.
Setting ceilings which are too high would reduce to nothing the efforts envisaged to improve the situation.
Although I voted in favour of amendments which would considerably improve the Council common position, I nevertheless declared my opposition to all the measures which, it was judged, could not be implemented at present.
Although I am in favour of reducing polluting emissions, we must be pragmatic and we must not impose criteria that industry cannot meet at least for the time being.
The credibility of the European Parliament depends on the realistic objectives that Members of Parliament are invited to vote on.
Recommendation for second reading Myller (A5-0067/2001)
Mr President, as a representative of pensioners and the Pensioners' Party, I voted for this report, which establishes the national emission ceilings for certain atmospheric pollutants: sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds and lastly, Mr President, ammonia, NH3.
I remembered - and this made me all the more inclined to vote in favour - that, when the Fatuzzo home is being cleaned, like every other home, with various people helping, like wives and daughters, a smell of ammonia always wafts its way to my nostrils.
Ammonia is surely used for cleaning in every household!
So why on earth do we not use this document to ban the use of such a harmful pollutant as ammonia for cleaning our houses?
This report offers very limited options for effectively reducing emissions of pollutants and for protecting the environment and public health, since the limits that are proposed, which are extremely modest, are a clear compromise in favour of economic interests. The proposals retreat from the values recommended by the World Health Organisation and, consequently, from the need to protect the environment and public health, which the report is supposed to be upholding.
The amendments that have been tabled are not likely to add a great deal to the proposal for a Council common position, since the only benefit they offer is to establish time limits within which the objectives must be achieved.
Nevertheless, both in terms of emission values and of exceptions, this does not represent any major difference to the document that was tabled previously.
The Council' s compromise proposal is likely to lead to increased emissions of all four air pollutants in the directive.
Throughout the EU, these emissions ceilings are 6% higher for sulphur dioxide, 10% higher for nitrogen oxides, 17% higher for volatile organic compounds and 10% higher for ammonia.
So far, no analysis has been carried out of the environmental consequences of the Council' s proposal, nor have the costs and economic benefit been calculated.
However, it is clear that the Council' s compromise ceiling will not reduce emissions sufficiently for us to be able to achieve the interim environmental objectives by 2010 at the latest.
The Gothenburg Protocol to the Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution was signed in December 1999, i.e. six months after the Commission submitted its proposal for national emissions ceilings.
All Member States have signed the protocol.
In some cases, the emissions ceilings in the protocol are lower than those proposed by the Commission.
Consequently, the Council' s compromise ceiling is, in a few cases, also lower than the Commission' s proposal and can be seen as anything but ambitious.
The critical loads and levels in relation to exposure to acidifying air pollutants will still be exceeded over large areas throughout the EU, and a large share of the EU population will still be exposed to air pollutants exceeding the air quality guidelines of the World Health Organisation.
Consequently, there is no justification for lowering the level of ambition even further by watering down the text in the way proposed by the Council.
For this reason, we supported the rapporteur' s line in the vote and voted for Amendment No 10.
Recommendation for Second Reading Miller (A5-0055/2001)
Mr President, I voted for Mr Miller' s report on heating systems for motor vehicles, partly because many lorry drivers and articulated lorry drivers are older people working as long as they possibly can.
Moreover, we have heard the Commission say that, in 2050, we might have to work until we are 99 in order for there to be enough money to pay people' s pensions.
Well, I would like that work to be done with breaks, so that older drivers of articulated lorries can have a rest, if only to warm themselves up.
And then another question popped into my head: why not also think about proper heating for people' s houses in the North of the European Union, so that the old people there do not have to pay more for their heating than those in the South?
Korhola report (A5-0074/2001)
Mr President, the charming and beautiful Mrs Korhola, the rapporteur of this document, has drafted a fine report on environmental information, or rather on public access to environmental information, which I voted for because it is right to provide information.
However, I am prompted to wonder when the European Parliament will, at last, approve a directive on public access to social security information, including pensions information.
I believe it is very important for Europeans to have full information on the environment, but I believe it is equally important, if not more so, especially for elderly people, to be informed about pension rights in our countries.
There is still a lot to be done in this sector and I hope that Mrs Korhola will soon produce a report on pensions information in the Member States of the European Union.
In the ten years since Rio, targets have yet to be reached.
The environment is under enormous pressure.
Poverty is increasing throughout the globe.
It is vital that next year's world summit is successful in strengthening measures which ensure that development is undertaken in a sustained manner that protects existing communities.
The Fifth Environmental Action Programme safeguards people from the adverse effects of air pollution.
The Action Programme's long-term goal will not be attained easily; therefore the Commission has rightly decided on a step-by-step approach setting out interim environmental targets for the year 2010.
I am glad that the report has been amended to include nuclear fuel and energy and financial as well as economic analyses.
It is essential that we include the tracking of nuclear fuel information, and in particular subsidies for nuclear fuel and energy.
Local authorities must also freely give information when requested.
I have recently had representations from constituents in Kilkenny, Ireland, because of the difficulty they have had in getting information with regard to developments in Archer's field.
I have requested information myself from the local authority and the regional Commissioner but so far without success.
If European money has been used inappropriately to divert a road, and a development is being built on the route of the old road, this would be an absolutely scandalous occurrence and we need an explanation for it.
The new directive incorporates the relevant provisions of the Aarhus Convention, vastly improves on Directive 90/313 by limiting the derogations, cuts the deadline for replying to a request to a month and meets the demand for the information requested to be provided in the required format.
It does, of course, take the use of modern information technologies into account but it also needs to take account of the fact that the number of requests will rise.
There are, of course, problems as a result of a lack of organisation, inappropriate staffing of departments, especially at local level, and huge differences in the level of sophistication of information and communication systems.
However, I should like to take this opportunity of pointing out that we MEPs receive numerous complaints about shortcomings and unfinished business in connection with ecological legislation and its transposition into national law.
Take, for example, Directive 92/43 (otherwise known as NATURA), which states that the Member States should already have official catalogues of areas in need of protection, as a result of which the Commission is being inundated with a flood of questions concerning interventions in these areas.
With all this unfinished business, it will be hard to apply the new legislation on "environmental information" .
Nonetheless, I shall be voting in favour of the report because it helps in a small way to develop society' s environmental conscience, which we shall achieve by disseminating the provisions of the directive and the rights which derive from it.
The time when political movements, pressure groups and governments denied the existence of environmental problems is over.
Despite this, new cases of environmental pollution keep appearing and old cases are not being addressed adequately.
Many of the existing environmental problems are the result of secrecy.
Companies keep their production processes secret, and with it, the production of waste substances which end up in the atmosphere, water or soil.
Disclosure could cost them money.
Under pressure from businesses, governments also act mysteriously about their permits and checks.
Files are drafted, but nobody knows what is in them, except for the officials involved.
Under those circumstances, the true risks often remain unknown to those living in the vicinity, workers, environmental activities and those controlling disasters.
Only when something major goes wrong does immense indignation arise and everyone wants to know that went wrong.
Environmental problems can only really be solved when there is disclosure at the highest level.
The Korhola proposal is a step in the right direction and superior to what the Commission proposes, even if it still regrettably provides for exemptions and secrecy at some level.
I wholeheartedly support measures to allow public access to environmental information.
Our citizens across Europe must see that the European Union is transparent, democratic and open.
The directive aims to adapt existing legislation to reflect developments in IT such as the Internet.
Rapid and widespread access to the Net is crucial for giving people access to information on air and water quality.
At a time when consumers are unsure about what exactly they are eating, it is important that they have as much knowledge as possible about the air they are breathing and the water they are drinking.
The internet revolution has transformed the world.
PCs can be found in many households, schools, colleges and offices.
It is high time that as much information as possible is available to our citizens, and environmental information should be at the top of the list.
Many MEPs including myself have set up websites to let constituents know what we are doing and how measures in the European Union affect them.
The dot com world is too important to ignore.
Information and communications technologies are developing at a rapid pace and we must keep up with these changes and ensure information continues to be disseminated efficiently.
Access to information is the very least our citizens deserve and we in the European Parliament must act so that this access is promoted and not denied.
Angelilli report (A5-0070/2001)
Mr President, last Sunday, I held a meeting for pensioner members of the Pensioners Party in the Loreto district of the city of Bergamo, my home and constituency.
When they heard that I was going to be debating this report on the European crime prevention network in the European Parliament, they all cried out in unison: 'Mr Fatuzzo, you must ask for the introduction of the European policeman, the local European bobby.
We believe crime must be combated here, in our neighbourhoods, with the flesh and blood presence of the policeman, an authority which ensures respect for the law in the city' s districts.'
That is why I was happy to vote for the report, in the hope that the European policeman will soon be introduced.
Mr President, I have abstained on this report - as I did on the previous one for which I presented an explanation of vote - because Parliament is only called upon to express an opinion on this highly important issue and has no power of decision.
On such a sensitive issue, one the citizens are particularly concerned about, we are simply consultants - well paid, of course, but without any decision-making power.
I feel the time has come to change that.
I think Parliament should have full powers of decision on all issues of interest to European citizens, on a par with the Council, at the same level of dignity and competence.
Let me end by wishing Mr Fatuzzo a happy birthday.
No one disputes the fact that we need to take measures to prevent what is called urban crime, child abuse and drug-related crime.
Nor does anyone dispute the causes of this type of crime.
Every modern criminologist agrees that the causes are primarily social: poverty, unemployment, social inequality, the promotion of rampant competition and the quest for maximum profit, which today' s world order hopes to impose as the ultimate ideal, all foster crime.
Consequently, as long as we have a socio-economic system based on the exploitation of man by man, crime will thrive.
One would have expected to find proposals for measures - mainly social and economic measures - to relieve this situation or, at the very least, to stem the rising crime rate through prevention.
Instead, the French and Swedish initiatives on which the report is based propose creating a network so that Member States can exchange information on measures taken in this area.
Even worse, the report makes a scientifically unacceptable correlation between small-scale crime and organised crime.
Preventing common crime means, first and foremost, taking measures to reduce the social causes of crime or, at the very least, measures which make crime more difficult to commit.
In organised crime, however, the emphasis is on suppression.
This correlation has not come about by chance and proves once again that the real need to combat common crime is being used as a pretext to curtail people' s rights and freedoms and create an even more authoritarian institutional framework.
And let us not forget that the recent resolutions of the European Parliament on organised crime contain measures which completely restrict any civil or liberal rights in the criminal justice sector.
A Greek bill is currently being debated along precisely these lines; in it the government has strengthened mechanisms to suppress popular movements on the pretext of "stamping out terrorism and crime".
For these reasons, the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece will be voting against the report.
In the Commission communication to the Council and Parliament dated 29 November 2000, on the prevention of crime in the European Union, problems such as crime, delinquency, violence and lack of public spirit are all grouped together.
This is an extremely dangerous approach.
This is not surprising given that the proposal to create a European prevention network is structured not only around public and judicial authorities but also the private sector, with links to Europol, OLAF and the European Drugs Observatory.
The creation of this information exchange network, which purports to be a pilot project and whose priorities are juvenile delinquency, urban crime and drug-related crime, apart from running the risk of the establishment of European files, cannot but contribute to the criminalisation of young people who are already victims of the security policies adopted in the guise of the fight against the feeling of insecurity.
As far as prevention is concerned, no concrete proposal has been formulated other than the award of a European Crime Prevention Prize!
At a time when European policies on employment more often than not condemn young people to unemployment or to insecure employment, and when entire neighbourhoods of towns are places of economic and social exclusion, a genuine policy of prevention must be introduced with social workers and public services.
For all these reasons, I voted against the report.

I fully support the establishment of a European crime prevention network by the last French Presidency and the current Swedish Presidency, which demonstrates the EU's commitment to combating crime and protecting our citizens.
We must be tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime.
It is not enough for any Member State to work alone in combating crime.
We need to work together with our European neighbours to tackle this issue.
We must develop contact points and crime prevention strategies, and support crime prevention activities at local and national level across the European Union.
It is important that we pay special attention to juvenile, urban and drug-related crime.
These crime-busting measures must be implemented from Blackburn to Barcelona.
Only by working together across Europe can we combat the social evils of crime.
Therefore, our children will be protected whether they are in north-west England or the South of France.
The British Labour Government puts crime at the top of its agenda, and is reducing violent crime and disorder.
The Tories, on the other hand, offer nothing but rising crime and falling investment.
Crime is a major concern for our citizens; we must ensure it stays our number one priority in Europe.
Thank you for your birthday wishes, Mr President, and my thanks, as well, to Francesco Enrico Speroni.
As regards the report on cooperation between the courts of the Member States in the taking of evidence, I want to say that, yesterday, I was waiting for the lift on the tenth floor of the Tower, when a beautiful young European girl came up to me - confidentiality prevents me from telling you her name, I can only say that it starts with the letter M - and she said: 'Bravo Mr Fatuzzo!
I listen to your explanations of vote with great interest because, although I am young, I too am interested in older people and pensioners.
I have had a problem with the courts, a civil case which has dragged on and on.
So if you vote for the report on cooperation between courts, I will always enjoy listening to you even more.'
BÃ¶sch report (A5-0078/2001)
Mr President, the BÃ¶sch report has received the support of Mr Fatuzzo, the representative of the Pensioners' Party, who is concerned about protecting the Communities' financial interests and combating fraud.
But I would be glad to see the interests of employees of the European Community protected too, because, from what I heard yesterday, they have very little pensions protection, especially if they have been working in countries outside the European Community.
In my opinion, European civil servants should have the same rights as those who live in any State of the Union.
I therefore hope to be able to vote soon for the protection of the Community' s social security interests.
Clearing up once and for all the very serious cases of fraud highlighted in 1999 is both a test of the credibility of the European Commission and a test of the efficiency of OLAF.
The Commission will have to convince us and the people of Europe of its determination to see its statements followed up by action in the fight against corruption and fraud.
Our group supports the request of the Committee on Budgetary Control regarding its call for greater operational independence for OLAF and its director, towards the European Commission, in exercising its powers of investigation.
By the same token, to be able to carry out its controlling function, the European Parliament must have access to OLAF reports without any special difficulty and whenever it wants.
We vehemently reject, however, the federalist demand for the speedy appointment of a European prosecutor, as called for in the report by Mr BÃ¶sch, even though the most seasoned supporters of a federal system acknowledge, amongst themselves and on the quiet, that it would be wiser to wait for another ten years at least.
As regards Community fraud and judicial matters, it would be preferable and far more judicious to have recourse to Eurojust. This is a structure of intergovernmental cooperation within the Council and is made up of three officers from each of the fifteen Member States of the European Union: one judge, one representative from the Public Prosecutor' s Office (prosecutor) and one police superintendent.
This option would be much more respectful of national wishes.
If we also take into account the very serious cases of fraud which were brought to light in 1999 and which still have to be cleared up, we cannot fail to be astonished by the double standards of a unilateral approach which only highlights certain matters (such as FlÃ©chard I, which is being used in an attempt to destabilise certain top-ranking civil servants in France and to put the spotlight on Ireland and France by artificially dragging out the issue, or FlÃ©chard II, in which German, Italian and Belgian companies are now involved).
(Intervention shortened pursuant to Rule 137 of the Rules of Procedure)
I supported the overall impact of the BÃ¶sch report.
It is incumbent on all of us to ensure that we can strengthen the fight against fraud and protect the interests of all taxpayers in Europe.
My only difference with the rapporteur is in relation to paragraphs 7 and 10, where there is a call for the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor's Office.
I have had a long-held opposition to the establishment of this office, which has been raised, not only in this context, but also on the question of cross-border criminal proceedings.
I believe that there is no legal basis for this office and due to the different legal systems in the Member States there is no guarantee of the presumption of innocence and also that the probable success of prosecutions would be no quicker or more successful than the present system.
However, despite these concerns, I have voted in favour of the report and I congratulate the rapporteur.
The Santer Commission was forced to resign following suspicions of fraud which I will not go into again.
During the hearings of the present Commissioners, all of them, led by Mr Prodi, promised to reform their departments and to establish a genuine European Anti-Fraud Office which would be independent and would have the necessary resources to carry out its tasks to the best of its ability.
OLAF is now a reality but we must keep going along this excellent path.
We still have to define certain operating procedures and to guarantee the full independence of the Office.
The report presented by Mr BÃ¶sch clearly highlights the problems which remain and ways of solving them.
So we insist that the OLAF reports are sent to the competent committee of the European Parliament.
More importantly, however, the report launches an urgent appeal for the establishment of a genuine European Public Prosecutor' s Office charged with scrutinising every case of fraud perpetrated against the financial interests of the European Communities.
This is an essential element in the necessary fight against fraud which, together with the Commission, we must see through to a successful conclusion in the shortest possible time.
The credibility and the image of the European Union are at stake.
Finally, in his explanatory statement, Mr BÃ¶sch floated the idea of inviting the future Belgian Presidency to do everything in its power to ensure that serious progress is made in the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor' s Office.
I fully subscribe to this idea.
The report by Mr BÃ¶sch is ambitious, resolute and realistic.
I therefore voted for this report in the fervent hope that the Belgian Presidency might set the European Union on the path chosen by the European Parliament.
Whilst endorsing the proposals in the resolution on protecting the Communities' financial interests, we abstained on the paragraphs concerning the appointment of a European Public Prosecutor.
The establishment of a European Public Ministry was not agreed at the Nice European Council and is therefore not mentioned in the new Treaty.
Yet, in order to establish a new authority with judicial powers and to provide it with the necessary authority in all Member States, an indisputable legal basis would have to be created.
As long as this basis does not exist, it is undesirable for the European Parliament to invite the Commission to put forward a proposal in this direction.
This is also true when the powers of the prosecutor are limited to offences committed by members and agents of the institutions of the European Union.
The European Union collects and distributes funding.
It is predictable that such a large-scale and centralised distribution circuit will attract the attention of fraudsters.
If money is doled out, people try to be one of the recipients.
Some businessmen assume that they are entitled to subsidies from a government which is ostensibly overflowing with funding.
That notion is reinforced by stories about enormous unsalable supplies for which there is seemingly no market which have been doing the rounds for decades.
These stockpiles are partly the result of subsidies.
It started 40 years ago with the scrap fraud and continues until this day.
In the case of the strong growth of the flax production in Spain and the subsequent burning of superfluous supplies, even the name of the then Agricultural Minister, now a member of the European Commission, has been quoted in connection with this case.
Only by halting the unnecessary flow of money can such frauds be brought to an end.
National and regional governments can make more accurate assessments and manage that money far more effectively than the European Union, which is too remote from everyone and which gives the impression that it has too much money anyway.
I voted for the BÃ¶sch report but I did so with some reluctance as I share along with many of my colleagues doubts about a European Public Prosecutor and its role.
However, as this role has been confined to criminal offences committed against the financial interests of the European Communities by members and employees of EU institutions, then I felt this restricted role is worth supporting.
The location of this office in Luxembourg is sensible due to the proximity of the European Court of Justice.
The widening of the scope of the European Public Prosecutors office will have to be carefully monitored so as not to encroach into the Member States competence.
The Conservative Party is fighting hard to attack fraud within the EU but we cannot support this report because of its references to a European Public Prosecutor, which we believe is an incursion on national sovereignty in the area of criminal justice.
We have therefore abstained on the final vote in order to reflect our support for the fight against fraud within the EU, whilst protecting our position on the European Public Prosecutor.
. I congratulate my Socialist colleague Mr Bosch for his report which pushes for stronger measures to step up the fight against fraud and makes the zero tolerance principle a reality.
We have come a long way since the fraud and mismanagement report of the Commission which led to its resignation in 1999, but there is still much work to do.
Not least there is the problem of trafficking in adulterated butter using vegetable and animal fats and even chemical substances, leading to an estimated loss to the EU budget of some EUR 45 million.
There is also the highly irregular matter of the flax case and EU subsidies for flax growing in certain Member States.
I welcome the fact that many Member States have joined the action brought by the Commission in the case against the big American tobacco companies before the European Court of Justice.
Today is UK Non-Smoking Day, and it seems apt to support this case which is intended to combat large-scale tobacco smuggling which causes revenue losses of several billion euros every year to the EU and Member States' budgets.
Madam President, we must tackle the root causes of maladministration and fraud.
Commissioner Kinnock is leading the way, at the forefront of these reforms in the Commission.
I am sure that Neil Kinnock is precisely the right person to help restore public confidence in the EU institutions and their actions.
We in the European Parliament should support him in his role.
How anyone can endorse or allow fraud is beyond me.
All of us, the EU institutions and the Member States themselves have an important role to play in ensuring that our citizens regain confidence in the European Union.
Wijkman report (A5-0054/2001)
Mr President, I am prompted to say 'How cold it is!' This is the second report in which we take an interest in warming up people in our Community.
Earlier on, we were thinking about warming up the drivers of articulated lorries, and now we have this report - I voted for it - which seeks to improve energy efficiency in the European Community. It also covers all forms of energy saving such as district heating in cities - something I hope for warmly, the right word in the circumstances.
In fact, a lot of energy can be saved with district heating, because a single boiler can heat the homes of ten, twenty, a hundred, a thousand city dwellers.
So, with this system, there could also be more heating in the houses of pensioners, who are often cold because of their modest pensions.
We would hereby point out that the reason we voted in favour of the original text in Mr Wijkman' s report, A5-0054/2001 paragraph 26 (viii), was not because we want to see common, supranational taxes at EU level.
Instead, the reason is because we want the Commission to take account of this issue so that, in the future, we might be able, if need be, to agree upon intergovernmental solutions when it comes to the taxation of fuel.
We are in favour of using a climate tax on a national basis to achieve targets without putting any additional burden on individuals or companies.
This does not mean introducing a European tax; it is a call for national tax rates in this area to be harmonised.
This should strengthen international competitiveness in the long term.
The economy is based on secure energy supplies.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
(The sitting was suspended at 1.12 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
Preparatory work for the Stockholm European Council (23/24 March 2001) (continuation)
The next item is the continuation of the debate on the Council and Commission statements on the preparatory work for the Stockholm European Council on 23 and 24 March.
Mr President, I would like to begin by welcoming Mrs Lindh to Parliament.
The Lisbon Summit was held about a year ago.
Everyone, including myself, considers that Lisbon was a major success.
The summit linked together a number of policy areas - economic policy, employment and social policy - making them mutually dependent.
We know that both employment and welfare depend on economic growth.
But there is also dependence in the opposite direction: the way in which we design welfare is important for employment and growth.
Social policy is a productive factor.
A year ago the Commission submitted an excellent document ahead of Lisbon.
This time, there is also a document which in some respects is excellent but I do have to criticise the Commission on one point.
I have no objections to the factual content, but I find the document unbalanced.
The speech of President Prodi today was balanced, but the Commission' s document is far too focused on the economic aspects.
I would have liked to see more attention paid to employment and social policy.
In the same way, I hope that economic policy is not allowed to dominate at the Stockholm Summit.
It is important to address questions such as full employment, employment in general, quality at work - which encompasses the working environment, skills development and influence on the part of employees - lifelong learning, which is incredibly important, and the demographic development which should result in older people also being given the opportunity to develop and to retain their jobs.
Finally, the Stockholm and Gothenburg Summits should also be linked and, in the future, environmental issues should be integrated in this process with economic policy, employment policy and other policy.
It is particularly important to incorporate the ecological issues.
Mr President, I naturally want to thank Mrs Lindh, the President-in-Office of the Council, and President Prodi for their presentation of the agenda they intend to present to the Stockholm Summit.
However, we may be forgiven for presuming to think that it is not so much a question of the excellence of that agenda as of its proper implementation nationally, in other words how the Member States carry through the processes of change, how they reconcile them with quality of life and work, and how they apply the strategy of greater social cohesion.
Because the Commission admits, if only indirectly, that those are the real problems, when it talks about the 14 million who continue to be jobless and wonders whether enough has been done at national level.
Equally, when it condemns the low skill levels of the labour force, one has to wonder whether the national training systems are put together properly, and whether educational reform, where implemented, is consistent with exploitation of the particular features of an area and whether it helps it to achieve greater cohesion, so that opportunity is open to all.
The Commission likewise condemns the existence of poverty and marginalisation in the Union.
It would therefore be appropriate to check, in the area of employment policies, whether local partnership initiatives capable of producing investment in initial stages in order to speed up bureaucratic processes, infrastructure allocations and negotiated labour flexibility are consistent with national employment plans and are actually being implemented.
It would also be appropriate to check, with regard to the same policies, whether the State aid granted, even if increased in the future, is really consistent with the local employment system criterion adopted.
Finally, with regard to the liberalised public services, pending verification of the final benefits to the user, it would be appropriate to consider whether the new jobs are numerically and qualitatively equal to those lost and whether the opening up of the markets involved is at least consistent with the integration of rural, remote, and mountainous areas with urban centres.
Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, in my short remarks I want to address one of the priorities that President Prodi outlined this morning.
This concerns the right regulatory environment; colleagues will have copies of the text.
Now it is not surprising that, in the ten pages here, the section on the right regulatory environment is by far the shortest.
The Commission has not even been able to find one page of good things to say about it!
And why, colleagues, is that?
Because despite all the fine words about having a deregulatory model, about creating jobs, about freeing up business, about - I quote - making the European Union the cheapest and the easiest place to do business, in the year since Lisbon we have seen a catalogue of failure on almost every front.
Take my own country, which claims to be in the lead of the new economy.
Every business organisation and every survey confirms that more and more regulation and red tape has been piled on British business over the last twelve months.
When I go and see companies in my constituency they say to me: "Mr Harbour, we have reached the stage now where politicians are spending more time sending us new regulations about protecting and looking after our existing employees than actually encouraging us to create new jobs".
I took notes throughout the speech by the President of the Council this morning and the question of deregulation was not mentioned once!
But what did she mention?
On top of everything that was agreed at Lisbon we are going to have a new ecological dimension to this programme and, far from the virtuous circle that Mr Goebbels was talking about this morning, we have a vicious circle.
Once we actually created new jobs; we are now looking for new burdens to place on business in the new ecological dimension!
I would just like to mention one point to President Prodi concerning an important conference on the economy two weeks ago, to which he kindly invited me along with other Members.
(He might have invited me in December, by the way, when he invited everybody else but I did get my invitation about two weeks beforehand).
I was able to go to a short part of it and, across the European economy, businesses from every country were saying if we are going to achieve the e-economy, do not over-regulate it.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the meeting of the Stockholm European Council is a very important stage for us as it will reconcile two of our major concerns: a competitive economy and the defence of a social model.
However, it seems to us that the documents which will be submitted to the Stockholm European Council may be excessively numerous and that we may have to make more progress in preparing for these meetings.
A large number of documents is not necessarily the best guarantee of a future strategy.
From this perspective, I would like to recall the proposals made by Parliament for a merger between the Economic and Financial Committee and the Economic Policy Committee.
I think there is food for thought here.
We are gratified moreover by the adoption of a restricted list of structural indicators.
It is the right course to follow for progress to be made at European level.
To simply talk about structural reforms does not mean very much; we need to know which reforms we are talking about.
And it seems to us that everything that concerns human investment must be of paramount importance.
Structural reforms must be based first and foremost on the notion of human investment.
Faced with an ageing population, which you referred to, Mr Prodi, it seems to us that we neglect at our peril investment in education, in mobility, in languages, in lifelong learning, and in research too, which you mentioned when you spoke just now on patents and Galileo.
President of the Commission, allow me to remind you, however, of the commitments we undertook, especially in Nice, regarding the social agenda.
It seems to us that this is a very important issue on which we must make progress in the European Union, including at the Stockholm European Council.
Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate the presidency of the Council and the presidency of the Commission, who have always promoted this initiative, on taking up the Lisbon debate.
This is an extremely important debate because less than a year ago we committed ourselves to nothing less than turning Europe into the most competitive and dynamic area of stability in the world.
Nothing less than that.
However, the 2010 horizon is looking stormy because the reticence of some countries to carry out liberalisation programmes approved by everybody and the resistance of States such as France to losing some of the flagships of its public sector are creating a two-speed Europe, a Europe in which countries which fulfil their collective commitments see their progress threatened by suspiciously aggressive strategies from companies, which are still public, in relation to recently liberalised sectors.
Ladies and gentlemen, a lot is at stake, but above all the legitimacy of the Community institutions is at stake in the eyes of the European citizens, who see the spread of a dangerous dynamic which favours the directors of powerful companies and which yields few results.
That is why I think Stockholm is so important.
Stockholm must mark the beginning of a thorough debate on public participation in key industrial sectors. This debate must take place within the framework of a mutual process of evaluation and learning which will contribute to improving the operation of the single market.
Based on a scoreboard of objective indicators for privatisation, this debate must bring together the different attitudes to the principles of competition, freedom of establishment and free movement of capital. This debate is being demanded by the European citizens who, having accepted competition as an effective method for allocating resources, are seeing their markets subjected to inefficiencies imported from countries which are ideologically allergic to economic reform.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to highlight four social accents which seem to me crucial in the strategy for Stockholm.
First of all, Madam President-in-Office, Stockholm must hold on to the objective of full employment.
That also means that that 3% growth must remain on the agenda and that hence productive investments must be made, not only in the knowledge society but also in social services and in people.
This must be clearly reflected in the employment guidelines.
I welcome the interim goals but these must also be included in the economic guidelines.
Secondly: full employment, to us, means quality jobs.
And however important coordination methods are, it is important that a clear link is established with the social agenda, social legislation and social agreements in this connection.
I set great store by the fact that you have invited the Commission to formulate objectives for the right to lifelong learning, but it would be equally important, Madam President-in-Office, if the Council were to invite the social partners to at long last reach agreements on that score.
Thirdly: Stockholm must be the summit where quality equals equality.
That means that we should not only talk about labour participation of the elderly, however important that is, but also of women.
Stockholm should therefore focus on improving the quality of the so-called atypical jobs, on reconciling work and family, redistributing the work, a strategy of equal pay for equal work, and child care.
Lastly: Stockholm must first and foremost be a social summit which does not reduce everything to labour market policy, however important that may be, but also maps out courses for the future with regard to social cohesion and solidarity.
I so much hope, Madam President-in-Office, that Stockholm will prove crucial in the strategy of open coordination in terms of social exclusion and social protection, so that the Belgian Presidency can outline clear and ambitious objectives in this strategy.
Mrs Lindh, the texts are, in my opinion, not wholly satisfactory, but I hope that in the time left available to us, the missing pieces of the jigsaw puzzle will fall into place.
Mr President, at least the European Union surpassed itself at the Lisbon Summit.
The Council decided to create the most dynamic economic area in the world.
That was a year ago.
Are we any closer to the plans?
We have certainly become more competitive, including in new technologies.
The Member States have started on numerous structural reforms.
Unemployment has been reduced to a large - but not by any means full - extent.
Unfortunately, adequate economic and social cohesion between the regions has still not been achieved.
What we expect of the Swedish Presidency is an initiative to develop intelligent instruments for investigating qualitative and quantitative progress.
Benchmarking and gender-specific statistics should give us information which needs to be evaluated every year.
What we certainly do not need is to adopt the Swedish social model for Europe.
What we need are real measures to increase employability and ensure that the younger members of the workforce, women wishing to return to work and the long-term employed are better qualified.
The socially disadvantaged must be better integrated into working life and discrimination in employment and the workplace must be nipped in the bud.
Just how important it is to stop excluding older employees is something which you felt deserved a mention here today, Mr President of the Commission.
We must work and act across the generational divide and we must convince young people that it is worthwhile working together with older people on this project, so that we can create social insurance systems which are fundable, meaning that balanced budgets are needed in the Member States.
All this presupposes the full support of the social partners. Anne Van Lancker is right, however; we also need agreements between them and NGOs, the representatives of civil society and, of course, the European Parliament.
Mr President, because I only have a minute and a half I will make only one point and that too has to do with social dialogue and the social partners.
Next week in Stockholm, on the eve of the summit, there will also be a summit of the social partners.
It will be taking place in the midst of something of a crisis for social dialogue, because the employers seem set to walk away from attempts to negotiate improved employment rights for workers placed by temporary employment agencies.
That is a very serious issue.
In the framework of Stockholm we need to look very seriously at the importance of the social partners in improving flexibility for our enterprises, whilst at the same time safeguarding workers in or moving between those enterprises.
That is what we are promised in the adaptability pillar of the employment strategy and what should be delivered by the Lisbon process.
But unfortunately the reality in my region and elsewhere in the Union is that workers placed by temporary employment agencies are placed at a severe disadvantage.
They are paying the price of improved flexibility for enterprises.
Employers have to be made to recognise their responsibilities.
If they are determined to walk away from these negotiations, the Commission must make it absolutely clear that it will take immediate legislative action and the Stockholm Summit should make it clear that the Council will do everything it can to expedite the legislative instrument to cover workers placed by temporary employment agencies.
Mr President, when the UK Prime Minister went to Lisbon he quite arrogantly lectured other European leaders about how they should be running their economies.
Not content with trying to control us at home, he is trying to do that in Europe as well.
He came back to the UK saying that Europe is going our way and that he had changed the agenda.
However, as far as I can see, the only way in which Europe is following Mr Blair's agenda is by piling yet more red tape on business and more regulation, and making Europe an ever more expensive place in which to do business.
Mr Blair's government introduced about 3500 regulations last year alone - a record increase.
The lessons of Lisbon have not been learned in London or Brussels, because we still see every day in this House more regulation and more red tape being produced.
I challenge both Commissioner Prodi and Mrs Lindh to come up with one example of where a burden on business has been removed or repealed since Lisbon, one example of an EU measure which makes it easier and not more difficult and more expensive to employ people and one example of a proposal for a regulation which has been dropped as being too expensive or disproportionate to the aims sought.
I hope that I will be proved wrong in my assessment of the success rate from Lisbon being very low indeed.
We still have directives on how to climb ladders. We still have directives on lawnmowers, fluorescent ballast and one on electrical waste which is quite simply going to be a tax on computers.
How is that going to promote the e-economy in Europe?
Regulation may feel like cost-free political points to politicians, but someone has to pay the bill.
The people who pay the bills are the customers of these companies, who pay them in higher prices and, above all, the people of Europe, who are priced out of jobs.
I call on the Commission and the Council to live up to the fine words of Lisbon with action: remove red tape and, above all, make it easier, not more difficult or expensive to employ people in Europe.
Mr President, if we genuinely want a knowledge-based economy there are preconditions: you need a critical mass of numerate and scientifically trained citizenry in the workplace, expenditure of at least 3% of GDP on research and development, research infrastructure and networks of expertise and a rapid system of dissemination and exploitation.
These preconditions are generally not met in the EU, despite the Lisbon Declaration.
First, we are very short of engineers and scientists: retraining in science is an essential part of lifelong learning.
Secondly, only two Member States - Sweden, luckily, and Finland - spend more than 3% of GDP on research and they have the industrial competitiveness which accompanies that expenditure.
Foresight and dissemination will, of course, be helped by the forthcoming Sixth Framework Programme and even more by the creation of the European research area, with its networking of centres of excellence.
Without Member State commitment at Stockholm, the knowledge-based economy simply will not happen.
So I say to Member States: "Over to you at Stockholm.
If you want it to happen, put your money where your mouth is".
Mr President, it is a pity that the conservative group in the European Parliament prevented Parliament from taking part, even indirectly, in the Council summit in Stockholm by voting against the Bullmann report during the last part-session, thereby reducing us to the present alternative.
The Council summit in Stockholm will have to take decisions on matters relating to education and research.
We need to speed up the rate of development of the electronic learning sector.
Innovations and new multimedia and Internet technologies will give us the tools we need for distance learning both for general education and for training and lifelong learning.
At the Stockholm Summit, we shall need to start systematically monitoring electronic learning, bringing together indicators to control equal access of pupils and non-pupils to information and communications technologies and taking measures to combat geographical, social and cultural inequalities.
On the other hand, lifelong learning is a prime means for the European economy of allowing the human resources which we need for a knowledge society to respond and develop.
We need to bear the social cost of these policies in the conviction that they will bring in maximum returns, for the benefit of the European social and cultural model.
Finally, the European research area must be given form and substance by coordinating activities and policies in the research area and supporting both basic research and pioneering technologies.
We need to increase spending in order to catch up with the USA and we need better, more efficient relations between research and science and public opinion and the citizens of Europe.
Mr President, I would like to start by saying thank you for an excellent debate with many important contributions ahead of the European Council in Stockholm.
Allow me to comment on some of the issues.
Firstly, I would like to say that I agree with Mr Suominen that it is important not only to have words, but also to have action.
For this reason, I believe that an annual assessment and follow-up of the targets is a new and unique process which will hopefully mean that we really become better at ensuring that words are translated into action.
I would like to thank Mr Goebbels for such a positive picture of Europe.
I agree that it is important also to spread the view and picture that things are going well for Europe.
I agree that it is important for us to combine economic and social measures.
That is, in fact, what this whole debate has been about.
Some speakers have talked about economic aspects, others about social aspects.
What will make us able, in fact, to modernise and not just liberalise Europe is our ability to combine economic reforms and social reforms.
Herman Schmid addressed the problem of there being a "right-wing policy" when we talk about economic goals and economic reforms.
I cannot understand this.
Obviously, a strong economy is vital for welfare.
In addition, we have clearly prioritised the fight against unemployment and we emphasise the importance of raising employment targets, which I see as crucial issues for the future of Europe.
I agree with what Mr Andersson, Mrs Van Lancker and Mrs O' Toole said.
They stressed that, if we are to be competitive, we must also ensure that we focus on education and social issues.
Lifelong learning is an important issue for Europe.
Our citizens must receive sufficient training and so achieve good skills.
We have already talked about the participation of older people in the labour market.
Mrs Van Lancker also mentions the position of women in the labour market.
Mr Andersson mentions environmental technology.
All this is vital if we are to achieve our targets regarding competitiveness.
Mr Harbour complained that I did not address the issue of deregulation.
In my statement, I nonetheless said that we must open up the markets for electricity, gas, post, rail traffic and air traffic and that we must have a common market for financial services by 2005 and a common market for venture capital by 2003.
If Mr Harbour does not feel that this is important for economic development in Europe, I really do not know what he feels is important.
Thomas Mann addressed the significance of our also evaluating our targets, which I commented on in the introduction.
I agree with this, although we do not perhaps agree entirely on the Swedish social model, but we will no doubt continue to discuss this.
Mr Hughes addressed the important issue of workplaces which do not meet basic requirements regarding labour law, safety, etc. This applies to matters such as temporary agency work.
This is an important issue which we are mainly discussing on a national basis, but which obviously also has to be discussed with regard to the future.
Particularly when we talk about quality of work and the importance of establishing social targets, I believe we have the opportunity to take up this issue of temporary agency work within the framework of the European Council in Stockholm.
I would like to conclude by thanking you for an excellent debate.
I hope that we will have a good summit in Stockholm.
I am also convinced that Parliament will continue to ensure that there will be action, not just words.
Madam President-in-Office of the Council, a few brief words, because it seems to me that the debate has revealed a very clear line: firm, general agreement on the project to be pursued, the great importance of the path set out at Lisbon, and the need to continue in that direction at Stockholm.
But everyone is also in agreement in warning of the crucial need to accelerate the rate of progress.
We are going too slowly, we have missed opportunities, and so, Madam President, what I ask is that we press on together, at Stockholm, at a rapid pace and with a minimum of anger and tension because, although we are in agreement, all too often commitments made are not put into practice.
So I thank you for your speech and I leave you with that commitment, in the hope of a positive summit.
I have received six motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 37(2).
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken on Thursday at 12 noon.
Conflict prevention and crisis management
The next item is the oral questions to the Council and the Commission (B5-0012/2001) and (B5-0013/2001) by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the strengthening of European Union capabilities for conflict prevention and civilian aspects of crisis management, including statements on the situation on the border between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Kosovo and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I appreciate the opportunity afforded by today' s debate because the triad of conflict prevention, civil crisis management and military capabilities needs to be seen in a wider context, ensuring of course that conflict prevention and civil crisis management are given a high ranking.
All three concepts are interconnected.
Credible civil crisis management and prevention are only possible if all sides are aware of the military capabilities.
On the other hand, developing our potential for conflict prevention and crisis management will ensure that we never need to use military force.
Hence the high ranking.
With the resolutions of Cologne, Helsinki and Feira and the conditions created in Nice, we have a clear brief to forge ahead with the civil aspects of crisis management. This includes developing the capacity to plan and implement policing operations, cooperation with the United Nations and questions of coherence and efficient improvement to Union policy in this area.
In the meantime, we have seen - and we still see time and again - that the present artificial separation of powers - some of which rest with the Commission and some with the High Representative - is damaging us in the long run and the Council should consider if it would be better in the long term for the vice-president of the Commission to have special relations with the Council and take over these matters, and for this to be used as a springboard for bringing greater transparency to these three areas.
The point is, we should really like to know that a check has been run on the extent to which these various capabilities are available in the institutions of the European Union.
We need to do something about improving the European Union' s information and analysis capacities.
We must be careful not to develop dual structures; instead we must combine the resources of the Council, the Commission, the Member States and other institutions so that we really can benefit from them.
I do not intend to go into all the details, but I think that it is immensely important in this context for the Commission to take more of an initiative in these areas and play a central role in planning crisis prevention and crisis management, so that we can create the political awareness needed for all these capabilities to be brought under one roof.
We specifically call on the Member States to provide the capacities and resources needed so that the European Union can be quickly deployed in the four areas defined in Feira, although this will depend, among other things, on defining specific objectives in advance, possibly with a timetable, as we did during the discussion on police forces.
The example of Kosovo shows just how badly we need these capabilities; it also shows that we can act in a coordinated manner under uniform guidance.
Even though the Council, the Commission and the Member States have done a great deal of good over the last two or three years, we still have to admit - more' s the pity - that we are far too backward in coming forward in certain areas and taking on tasks which we need to tackle directly, which is why we feel it is so important that we make progress here.
In doing so, we shall certainly need proper coordination with organisations such as the UN, the OSCE, the Council of Europe, financial institutions such as the IMF and the World Bank and non-governmental organisations.
I need only remind you of the status quo here and the fact that the old principle still applies to Kosovo: now at last we must find the coordinator for the coordinators.
A great deal still needs to be done here and I think that, given the problems, especially for individuals, we really must overcome the difficulties, power struggles and vanities between the institutions and develop European capabilities which enable us to foster and contribute to peace and freedom, both within and on the edge of the European Union.
Mr President, Mr Brok, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank Mr Brok for addressing this vital issue.
I would like to take this opportunity to give a general answer on the way the Swedish Presidency approaches preventive work within the Union.
"All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights."
This is the opening of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights - the cornerstone of our work for individual freedom, safety and dignity.
As we know, war and armed conflict destroy all fundamental principles.
Instead, the law of the strong rules through firepower and oppression.
The 20th century was the century of war with the world wars and wars in the Middle East and the Balkans.
Each time alarm bells rang, but the international community often reacted too late.
Now we can show that we are learning from the past.
By actively focusing on preventing armed conflict, we can help make this century different.
The EU has a key role to play in this regard.
Let me quote what Mr Hume said in Parliament when he was awarded the Nobel peace prize: "Let us not forget that European Union is the best example, as we have learned, in the history of the world of conflict resolution."
Today, conflict prevention is also a central element of the developing Common European Security and Defence Policy.
The ESDP is based on three pillars: military crisis management, civil crisis management and conflict prevention.
These are closely linked.
At the same time, prevention is different to military and civil crisis management in that it is not about reacting to a crisis that has already flared up, but about promoting in good time the fundamental values on which we all agree: that children should be able to go to school instead of to war and that democracy must be established at all levels.
The EU has an extremely large number of instruments which can be used to prevent armed conflict and manage crises.
We must use these in a more considered and coherent way, both in the field and in Brussels.
These issues must involve the whole Union and all institutions.
We already know that the EU can make important interventions.
Our unarmed monitors in Presevo and the police mission in Albania are just two examples.
Experience from the Balkans has clearly shown that conflict prevention must be based on long-term involvement.
The basic causes of armed conflict must be removed.
Therefore, development work has a key role.
The decision of the Commission and the Development Council to integrate prevention into development work is central and must now be turned into practical guidelines for projects and programmes.
It is a matter of strengthening human rights and democracy in the long term and of the way crisis management and humanitarian aid gives way to development work.
The Commission' s upcoming communication on conflict prevention, on human rights and democracy and on humanitarian aid, reconstruction and development will, therefore, be significant.
We must also identify potential conflicts at an earlier stage.
One example is the way water issues are often a source of conflict nowadays.
However, we can see a telling example right next to us of the way the EU can mean that resources of common interest can create partnership and development.
The river running through Strasbourg used to be a poisoned watercourse, a barrier.
Now it is a common waterway and source of fish.
The EU must also develop sustainable and effective partnerships with other important players.
The UN is our most important partner.
We are trying to establish close long-term cooperation at all levels between the EU and the UN.
Similarly, we are strengthening relations with the OSCE.
In Africa, we are seeking partnership with the sub-regional organisations SADC, IGAD and ECOWAS, which also work on conflict prevention and crisis management, in order to help them build up their capabilities and support local processes.
ECOWAS' small arms moratorium is a good example.
We are also setting up a joint expert group for conflict prevention with Canada and developing contacts with the G8 group.
Partnership with others naturally has to be driven by real needs and comparative benefits.
When I recently visited the Southern Caucasus with Mr Patten and Dr Solana, it was an obvious occasion to build on the OSCE' s and the European Council' s knowledge of, and presence in, the area.
Now, we are discussing how the EU can work with the OSCE to develop monitoring of the border with the Northern Caucasus. The Troika' s visit to the Caucasus in February and to Israel and Gaza in the past two days is another example of the EU' s role in conflict prevention.
I would also like to point out that relations with civil society and NGOs are crucial if we are to succeed.
There has been a request for a Council declaration on the situation in Northern FYROM, and I would like to take this up as an example of the way the EU can work:
For several years, we have taken measures to try to prevent conflict through unarmed monitors, aid for political and economic reforms and for central and local institutions, the 1998 Trade and Cooperation Agreement and the Stabilisation and Association Agreement which is expected to be signed shortly.
On 22 February came the first reports that an armed Albanian group had entered Northern FYROM.
Their purpose was unclear, but there was clear resistance to ratification of the border agreement recently signed between FYROM and FRY.
In order to prevent increased violence, the EU and the presidency representatives in Skopje established a close dialogue with FYROM' s government.
The Troika called a meeting of the leading Albanian parties and urged them to vote for ratification of the border agreement, which the majority did.
Following the gun battles, explosion of mines and exchanges of fire, the EU has condemned the violent attacks and urged all parties - particularly representatives of the Albanian minority in FYROM - to distance themselves from the violent actions.
We have said that it is important to have closer cooperation and have also welcomed the cooperation between KFOR, UNMIK and the FYROM authorities and expressed support for FYROM' s sovereignty and territorial integrity, while also urging restraint.
The important message to the public has been that FYROM' s future lies in closer ties with Europe and the EU and that stability and security is a vital condition of this.
The desire of the people of the Balkans for integration and cooperation with Europe means that the EU can play a vital role - including a crucial role in forming opinion.
We have started an important process in carrying out the proposals the Commission and the High Representative presented in their report to the European Council in Nice and will hopefully be able to go on to approve a programme for conflict prevention in Gothenburg in June.
In preparing the programme, we will naturally be carefully studying the proposals from Parliament, including the important LalumiÃšre resolution of last year and the resolution which will be adopted tomorrow.
Let me finally say a few words about other elements of the cooperation surrounding the Common European Security and Defence Policy.
I have not addressed the subject of military capabilities today, but I believe that they have an important role to play.
The knowledge that the EU has military capabilities also plays an important role in preventive work.
With regard to civil crisis management, we have to press on with what the European Council addressed - civilian police, the judicial system, civil administration and rescue services.
We are working hard to turn the target of 5 000 police into reality.
Member States have been asked to state their national contributions.
An initial reconciliation will take place in May.
We are putting a great deal of energy into developing the ability to plan and manage police initiatives and into common standards for equipment, training, etc.
We have also started work on other areas of capability - strengthening the judicial system and civil administration during crises and conflicts, and the Council Working Group for Rescue Services is drawing up concrete targets in its area.
We know that armed conflict damages all vital functions in a society.
Crisis management must therefore include support for everything from the judicial system to refuse collection.
Human rights, international agreements and humanitarian principles must be defended, especially with regard to safe access to help those suffering.
We will therefore also open discussions on areas of capability other than those which we have previously identified, e.g. observers and experts in human rights and disarmament.
Of course, we also have to solve the issues of how we are to achieve effective cooperation between civil and military crisis management.
It is almost always the case that we solve these issues jointly when it comes to practical work in the field.
If it turns out that I have to leave this debate early, I would like to emphasise that this in no way means that I am not interested in hearing the thoughts of all Members of Parliament.
The fact is, I am going to Murmansk to discuss important nuclear safety issues in Northern Russia, and getting to Murmansk is not easy.
Mr President, Madam Foreign Minister, Commissioner, first I should like to pass on apologises for absence from Doris Pack, our top expert on crisis regions.
She is on her way to Sarajevo and has asked me to stand in for her.
It is true that, once again, we are right up against the concepts of "civil crisis management" and "conflict prevention" in the crisis region, and we pray that we shall not have to deploy the third option, i.e. of putting our military capabilities to the test.
Recent developments in the region have been both positive and extremely negative and I think that we have taken account of both in Parliament' s compromise resolution which will be put to the vote tomorrow.
On the positive side, I would point out that efforts to keep the peace in Macedonia really have worked over recent years and the Georgievski government has made a special contribution here by including representatives of the Albanian minority in the coalition.
And if you take a closer look, you will see that this is not just a formality and that many important positions in Macedonia have been given to members of the minority.
We have all the more responsibility for stabilising this country and it is good to hear that relative peace has now been restored on the fifth day, including in TanusevcÃ­, which was temporarily occupied by UCK extremists.
I should like to raise another point in this connection.
Croatia has also made good progress and the MesiÃŠ government currently in power in Croatia - unlike the previous government - is not under any suspicion of encouraging Croatian extremists in Herzegovina who want to interfere with the successful community in Bosnia-Herzegovina and try to impose their own agenda there.
In this respect, the appeal to the HDZ in Herzegovina is justified, but should be seen in isolation from these trends.
As proof of our trust - and I think as justifiable proof of our trust - towards the new Yugoslavian Government, we had allowed Yugoslav troops to start patrolling the Presevo valley in order to keep UCK extremists there under control and, in return, NATO has also stepped up border controls.
This is, I think, an important point.
But what must we do when we demand that communal representatives in Kosovo and the local authorities fight the extremists?
I think that it is important to say in this context that we must strengthen the legitimacy of moderate forces in Kosovo and that we strengthen Mr Rugowa - to name a name - by making it possible for elections to be held in Kosovo.
I think that is an important political point.
