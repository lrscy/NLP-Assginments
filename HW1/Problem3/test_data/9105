At least 75% of all maternal deaths and injuries could and should be prevented through reproductive health care.
Reproductive health in the context of this report covers all areas related to reproduction and associated diseases such as HIV-AIDS.
Through long-term investment in reproductive health supplies, services and the appropriate counselling much can be done to stop unwanted pregnancies and to go some way to controlling the spread of sexually-transmitted diseases.
I sincerely hope that honourable Members of this House will support this report.
Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate Mrs SandbÃŠk on her work and secondly I would like to express my indignation and condemn the harassment which the Members who have supported this report from the outset have once again been subjected to.
In recent days we have once again suffered - as also happened during the committee procedure and as also happened in this House in the case of the Van Lancker report - the bombardment of our e-mail systems with messages which have always been threatening, aggressive, laden with insults and furthermore always, without exception, lacking in arguments or a rigorous analysis of the content of the report, which is solely attributed with the aim of imposing mass sterilisations, and I will read out a fragment of an e-mail I have received: 'If this report is approved, the European Union would become one of the major promoters of abortion and the culture of death, and its approval would mean accepting the annihilation of the poor'.
Accusing this Parliament of wanting to annihilate the poor leads me at least to entirely reject the content of such positions and virulent expressions which attempt to conceal a complete lack of arguments, because these groups who harass us and who claim to be pro-life, resorting to their religious convictions, are the ones who condemn poor women to the illness and death resulting from their reproductive role.
In order to explain the true significance and importance of approving this report it is necessary to highlight certain crucial aspects. On the one hand, the importance of women as the main promoters of health, and on the other, the ratification - as has already been said - of the idea that there can be no social development without a healthy society and that the health of women is directly related to their reproductive role.
Currently, 20% of the world's population is at the reproductive stage of their lives and it is therefore crucial that information on their sexuality and their reproductive capacity is available, in order to ensure that that population is protected from unwanted pregnancies and sexually-transmitted diseases.
By ignoring the reproductive rights of women and denying them the power to chose, we are condemning them, their families and the communities they live in to illness and poverty, because we must not forget that health is undoubtedly a decisive element in the fight against poverty, a fight which the European Union advocates and is committed to.
That commitment - made many years ago by the international community - must be reinforced at this time when we are faced with a cut in the funds allocated to sexual and reproductive health by certain governments which take a false and hypocritically moral approach to life.
It is not possible to be in favour of life and then deny women in developing countries their right to information and to controlling their sexuality and reproductive capacity.
In the developing countries female mortality relating to pregnancy and childbirth is 33 times greater than that in the industrialised countries.
Reproductive health services are included amongst the indicators selected for evaluating the millennium development objectives.
Improvements in reproductive health lead to lower pregnancy rates and reduction in dependency.
Bad health leads to higher pregnancy rates and condemns families to poverty.
In 2015 there will be 742 million people requiring sexual and reproductive health services or supplies.
Control of their sexuality is a woman's right, but this is only recognised in the rich countries.
The illnesses and consequences which women in the poor countries suffer principally originate from their reproductive role.
Feminine health is an essential element if the poor countries are to make progress.
Mr President, this is indeed an issue of the utmost importance.
The relationship between poverty and low levels of development and sexual and reproductive health is very close and makes it incumbent on us to adopt measures that will enable us to end or at least to mitigate the extremely worrying situations we are seeing today in this field which, unfortunately, are growing worse.
Hence the importance of this proposal for a regulation and the report by Mrs Sandbaek.
I must point out, with regard to this report, the rapporteur's efforts to improve and to achieve a compromise, even at first reading, which enabled a broad consensus to be achieved on the proposals we are studying today.
These efforts are all the more noteworthy because of the vague suspicions and frustrated attempts to include groundless justifications in the guidelines in question.
Fortunately, the rapporteur, the political groups, the other committees involved and also Commissioner Poul Nielson, and everyone who has worked on this issue have been able to focus on the essential and I am sure that plenary will adopt the same approach.
The essential lies in what has been acknowledged by the various international conferences on population and development, in understanding that access to reproductive and sexual health services forms a crucial part of the fight for development and against poverty and consequently the prevention of communicable diseases such as AIDS.
Nor should it be swept under the carpet in this context that pregnancy and childbirth are the main causes of death and disability of women in less-developed countries.
Nor should it be forgotten that a major proportion of maternity-linked deaths in those countries are closely linked to abortions carried out in unsafe conditions.
These are undeniable and enormously serious occurrences that must be ended by means of appropriate measures, such as those now being responsibly proposed.
This is also why means are also necessary and these have been clearly insufficient.
This is why it is essential to make an effort, with the European Union leading the way.
This is also why I believe it is crucial for Parliament, in accordance with its powers and responsibilities, and in the spirit of consensus and balance, to now earmark the amount proposed for this purpose.
Mr President, we are all deeply concerned about the plight of women in developing countries, many of whom have to confront the real problems of famine, disease and war.
I fully support efforts by the European Union to improve health and sanitary conditions for women in these countries.
Throughout the developing world, particularly in the poorest countries, hundreds of women are dying in childbirth because the health systems in those countries cannot afford proper medical care and appropriate services.
This is why it is so important that the European Union helps to improve the health facilities in these countries.
I should like to state for the record that I fully support the agreement reached at the Cairo Conference on Population and Development in 1994, which was updated in 1999.
The Cairo agreement states that abortion cannot be promoted as a family planning method, and that regulations regarding abortion are solely for individual countries to decide upon.
I am fully satisfied that this draft regulation on sexual and reproductive rights fully complies with the requirements laid down by the Cairo agreement.
I will be monitoring this legislation very carefully, at all stages of its enactment, so as to guarantee that it is in full conformity with the provisions of the Cairo agreement.
I am aware that the Irish Government is very vigilant in monitoring the terms of this proposal.
I also want to state, in the clearest possible language, my strong commitment to defending the rights of children and the unborn.
The European Union has no power whatsoever to deal with the issue of abortion, which rightly remains the sole preserve of individual Member States.
There is nothing this report can do to propose a change in this legal position.
Mr President, I should like to thank the Commissioner for what he has said, and also Mrs SandbÃŠk for so eloquently defining why this is such an important and urgent regulation for us to deal with tomorrow.
The WHO estimates that 88-98% of all maternal deaths are avoidable if women have access to proper reproductive and obstetric health services.
Recently on a visit to Rwanda I learned that 2 000 women die per 100 000 live births.
In my own country, the United Kingdom, that figure is seven.
Maternal mortality continues to rise in developing countries.
Women die from haemorrhaging, from infections, from high blood pressure, from obstructed labour.
They also die from unsafe abortions.
The last speaker talked about the rights of governments to choose.
I would emphasise that women in these situations also have the right to choose.
If women in a country like mine have that right, then I would also argue that a woman who wishes, because of a variety of different circumstances, to make that choice, then that should be her right.
Providing for reproductive health is not a euphemism for abortion services.
Women have the right to reliable information and to compassionate counselling.
We must at all costs avoid being drawn into debates which are only about us reflecting United States domestic policy.
The reality is that if we do not receive a positive vote tomorrow, there will be no budget line.
We will be guilty of turning our backs on a maternal carnage such as we see in developing countries.
Is that the signal we want to send from this Parliament to the suffering women of the developing world?
Now the European Union - and I emphasise also the governments of the south - needs to do more on maternal mortality, on HIV, on reproductive health and on contraception.
North and south need to work together on everything from the country strategy papers which we produce with developing countries to prioritising gender issues and reproductive health and rights.
Finally, I should like to say that it is very important that we have an understanding of gender and reproductive rights as a cross-cutting issue.
We must invest more resources and interest to ensure that women can bear children in safety and with the freedom to choose if, when and how often to do so.
(Applause from the Left)
Mr President, the explanatory memorandum to this report implicitly constitutes a real indictment of the current economic and social order as reflected in the areas of health and rights concerning reproduction and sexuality.
It is revolting, in fact, that pregnancy and giving birth should be among the principal causes of death and injury among women living in developing countries.
Of the 600 000 deaths which occur following a pregnancy, 99% occur in developing countries, a dreadful figure, to which we then need to add the 50 million women who suffer serious complications.
It is also revolting to find that AIDS and, more generally, sexually-transmitted diseases, affect poor countries much more than developed countries.
Consequently, the proposals which have been put forward seem quite derisory as a means of dealing with this situation.
Moreover, the failings noted in these proposals are not merely connected with the insufficiency of the funding proposed for the implementation of a health policy for poor countries.
Even more serious is our inability to lay the blame at the door of the pharmaceutical trusts which, in order to preserve their profits, are even opposed to the idea of marketing generic medicines.
The dictatorship exercised on society by industrial and financial groups, which is unbearable in all areas of society, has drastic consequences in areas involving the health and physical integrity of human beings.
In the face of this dictatorship, all these proposals merely serve to illustrate the powerlessness of the European institutions as soon as it is a question of an area which touches the lives of women and men.
Nevertheless we shall vote for those amendments which are likely to lead to a certain amount of improvement or which at least confirm certain human principles, including the right to contraception and abortion.
Mr President, Commissioner, a society that calls itself civilised and that prides itself on its defence of human rights cannot accept as inevitable the high maternal and child mortality rates of the developing countries and the suffering of so many women.
Therefore, within the framework of a global policy to combat poverty, the aspects relating to sexual and reproductive health demand special attention.
Hence the need for a proposed regulation of the type we are debating, in the understanding that, when we talk about the right to sexual and reproductive health, we are talking about the right to health services which ensure safe pregnancy and birth, for both mother and child.
We are talking about the right to information and guidance on family planning methods which are safe and acceptable to everyone, the right to an education which teaches people to live their sexuality in a responsible manner and to combat sexually-transmitted diseases, particularly AIDS.
Under no circumstances must this Regulation - and this is what I believe - open the door to the practice of abortion in the developing countries, and this is not for religious or moral reasons and far less for sectarian reasons.
It is a question of prioritising the right to life, particularly the lives of the most vulnerable beings, because this right is more important than any other and is the basis and the principle on which all other rights stand.
Therefore, within the framework of the fight against poverty, it is very important that the Community commit itself to carrying out actions in the field of sexual and reproductive health in line with the proposals of the SandbÃŠk report, because these actions are instruments intended to drastically reduce maternal and child mortality and to prevent, as a consequence, the resort to abortion, since they are also instruments intended to protect the right to life and health.
And I would hope, Commissioner, that you also share this approach.
Mr President, I congratulate Mrs SandbÃŠk and also Commissioner Nielson for his clear political direction on this issue.
His very significant decision to substitute the funding through UNFPA that the Bush Administration wrongly withdrew is a hallmark of his distinguished record as Commissioner for Development.
The European Union and Parliament, this week, have been subject to fundamentally misleading lobbying and publicity concerning the purpose of this regulation.
For example, this e-mail from one of my constituents in Cambridge accuses us of 'obliging EU Member States to fund abortions', and adds the labels 'mad', 'irrational' and 'politically correct' for good measure!
As colleagues across the House have made clear, the regulation clearly incorporates the Cairo Agreement that specifically prohibits abortion as a method of family planning.
Instead, these people, sadly given succour by some in the House tonight, want to prevent good reproductive health for women in developing countries, where 600 000 entirely preventable deaths of women in childbirth still occur each year.
This is also absolutely essential to halt the spread of HIV-AIDS, which currently kills 8 000 people every day.
This is about saving lives, not about losing them.
Men as well as women must take responsibility for sexual health.
As a man, that is why I joined with other men and women in this House to seek extra money this year for the reproductive health programme, in my role as budget rapporteur.
One has to recall that 160 Members denied us the qualified majority, and EUR 6 million was lost.
That money would have helped over 2 million women around the world to have safe pregnancy and birth.
I hope that tomorrow we will be able to reinstate this funding, subject to the agreement of our budget colleagues.
In April my own partner is expecting our second baby.
I hope and pray that it will be a safe birth, knowing, as I do, that in Europe we have access to the best medical facilities, trained staff and health services that minimise the risks to mother and child.
I do not see why any mother, anywhere in the world, should not have the right to the same protection.
That is why I will support this vote and call on others to do so.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission and Mrs SandbÃŠk have my support when they propose that the European Union should seek greater involvement in the areas of contraception, the fight against sexually-transmitted diseases and improved gynaecological provision in developing countries.
I myself spent some time working as a doctor in Guatemala, an impoverished developing country, where I could see how necessary such aid is.
Throughout these discussions, I have had in my mind's eye a woman who was one of my patients at the time and who had her eighth child at the age of twenty-four.
I believe that we are under an obligation to bring to these women's attention what options are available by way of contraception.
We are also, for example, under an obligation to increase the availability of condoms.
Let me remind you, Commissioner, of how Mr Schmid of the Group of the Party of European Socialists proposed - all of two years ago - the establishment in Africa of a factory to manufacture condoms, enabling these to be made available there at low prices.
I would ask the Commissioner to reconsider that.
It is also my belief that 'contraception and birth control' is not just an issue of concern to women alone.
I do believe that we have to give more support to science in its search for contraceptives for men.
An international consortium has submitted an application in this area to the 6th research framework programme, but the Commission has, unfortunately, not considered it yet.
One example of why I consider this very important is the medical fact that many women have an intolerance to the contraceptive pill, so alternatives are a matter of necessity, and this is one area where men cannot go on holding back.

I do believe, though, that we have to make a very clear distinction between the issue of abortion and that of birth control, as well as the other issues discussed in the report.
Abortion is a sensitive subject, and rightly so.
I do not think it would be a good thing for the European Union to allocate to something like that any of the limited resources we have at our disposal for the support of people in developing countries.
When I was, for five years, a member of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, I constantly heard the Commission saying that there was not enough money.
That was why they rejected many projects put before us by NGOs - projects that were not in the least controversial, and which everyone said we should support.
As a result, I would have preferred it if this report had expressed, more clearly than it had done, that we support a great number of things - things that Parliament does not regard as controversial - but not abortion.
I think Amendment No 53 expresses this very appropriately.
I am glad that this report has been successfully focussed on the prevention of unwanted pregnancy and on the provision of real help for women.
Above all, I wish to thank Mrs Martens for her great commitment.
I would have liked us, however, to have put things in more precise terms - and perhaps tomorrow will find us managing to do that - so that we can indeed be united in our endorsement of this programme and of this report.
Mr President, I am glad that Mrs Scallon is in the House tonight and that she is listed to speak.
I want to hear her apologise to this House for the scurrilous lies that she told in the Irish media about this report: claims that EUR 50 million was being taken from Irish fishermen in order to promote abortion in the world; claims that Irish taxpayers' money was going to be used for promoting abortion in the world.
They are scurrilous lies that should be retracted.
We should have an apology here tonight from Mrs Scallon for promoting these falsehoods.
I am pro-choice.
I believe it is the responsibility of every man and woman to choose the number of children and the spacing of their children, as and when they choose.
It is not for me to decide or for Mrs Scallon to decide.
It is for each individual to decide.
If I came across a woman who was pregnant and drowning, I would not ask her if she was pregnant, an abortionist, or if she would likely have her pregnancy aborted, before I threw her a lifeline.
There are 600 000 women this year who will die, who probably have other children, certainly parents and certainly lovers or husbands who want them to live.
We are being asked to deny them the right to life.
Unfortunately, we are not giving enough money in this programme to save them all, but at the very least, we have the right and a duty to provide what we propose to provide and not pretend that we are in some way saving lives by opposing this programme.
The attitude of Mrs Scallon and President Bush is based on heartless, theological hair-splitting which has nothing to do with life.
We should stand up and be counted on this issue in this House and make it clear that we are 'for life' and 'for the lives' of the 600 000 women who die every single year.
(Applause from the Left)
Mr President, I would like to thank all those who have worked so hard to try to reach a good compromise.
The opinions within this House may differ, but no one should doubt the sincerity of all present in wishing to offer the best help to women in the poorest countries.
As has been made very clear by the contributions tonight, there is just one main problem: some definitions within this regulation are not clear enough.
It is in everyone's interest to clarify the meaning of the wording of this very important and much needed regulation for the care of women, for mothers and their children.
In order to do this to the best of our ability, we should support, in particular, Amendment 53.
There is no conflict presented by the wording of this amendment.
It is in keeping with the compromise reached and the expressed opinion of the Commission and Council.
The European Parliament has very often decided in favour of this very same wording.
Without any doubt, it protects the Irish Constitutional position and supports the Irish Government, as well as reassuring the political representatives of accession countries and members of least-developed nations who have contacted various members of the European institutions to express their deep concern at the possible interpretation of some terms of the regulation.
As we are all aware, the European Union has no legal competence to decide on or to fund abortion in Member States.
Nor does it have the legal right to do so in the poorest of countries in the world, but this does not deny women the highest level of medical care to prevent maternal mortality and morbidity. This I absolutely support.
There is no conflict presented by the wording of this amendment.
It will clarify beyond doubt the intentions of this Parliament, the Commission and Council.
For these reasons, I would respectfully ask for support for Amendment 53.
Mr President, I am convinced that by supporting this regulation, as agreed by the Committee on Development and Cooperation, Parliament will allow us to fund operations and agencies working to reach the international development targets, to empower women and to reduce infant, child and maternal mortality.
The amendments voted by the Committee on Development and Cooperation have received wide support and strengthen and clarify the text of the regulation, without altering its main objectives.
The Commission welcomes them.
On Amendments Nos 46 and 47 on the financial proposal, I am not able to commit the Commission formally tonight because the broader discussions on allocations have not yet been concluded.
However, I do not see this as something that should lead to a second reading.
I am confident that we will find a solution.
The new amendments tabled in plenary - Amendments Nos 48, 49, 50, 51, 52 and 53 - skew the focus and the substance of the regulation and are not acceptable to the Commission.
Mr Ribeiro e Castro and a few others have remarked that laws are different in Member States and also said something about the competence of the European Union on these matters.
We are on very firm ground in what is happening here.
We are not discussing abortion policy in European Member States.
We are discussing development policy and we are proposing to do what is clearly in line with what has been internationally agreed.
This is the purpose of all this.
I warn against changing this discussion into something totally different.
Mr Ribeiro e Castro said that Amendment 49 is about clarification.
I disagree.
It is a change of the substance.
We may not have this meeting taking place in full daylight, but I find it light enough in here to make the following remark.
In the existing text, no support is to be given under this regulation to incentives to encourage sterilisation or abortion.
Amendment 49 says: 'no support is to be given under this regulation to sterilisation or abortion, nor to ?'.
This is not a clarification.
This is a change of the substance.
A spade should be called a spade and a text should be called a text.
In reply to some of the other remarks made by Mr Ribeiro e Castro, I warn against throwing around quotes which are very difficult to verify.
This debate has already had an overdose of that sort of input.
One strong reason to remain with what the Committee on Development has concluded, as expressed by Mr Corrie and others, with whom I agree, is that it reflects the Cairo consensus - no more and no less.
To Mr Ã Neachtain I say that I can subscribe to his observations.
They are a precise account of the reality and the formalities of the issue, as stated.
Anything other than what is now emerging here as the consensus from the Committee on Development and Cooperation represents an unacceptable deviation from Cairo.
I advise that we stay on track.
When following the international discussion on these issues over the last few years, we have repeatedly seen that proposals or attempts to backtrack from Cairo or to go beyond Cairo in all cases have been futile.
That is another good reason for the European Parliament and the European Union to stay on track.
I hope that we will be able to stay on track on this issue.
(Applause)
Mr President, I would like to defend my honour.
I do not believe that the Commissioner insulted me, nor that he intended to insult me.
However, as the record is read by many people, and as he mentioned quotations I made, I would like to point out that owing to the limited speaking time we have, I could not read out all that I wished to.
I should like to say on record that I will be happy to send the Commissioner the papers from which I quoted during my speech.
The Commission would then have an opportunity to read them in their entirety, something which, of course, I was unable to do in plenary.
I find that absolutely acceptable, but the point is not whether Mr Ribeiro e Castro was quoting correctly.
The problem is whether what is being quoted is correct.
I just gave the warning that we have seen quite a lot of input to this debate which calls for great scepticism.
That was my well-intentioned warning.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
WRITTEN DECLARATION (RULE 120)
. (IT) We feel Mrs Sandbaek, Mrs Martens and Mrs Ferrer's work is satisfactory, considering the different starting points.
We should always be mindful of our ability to produce texts which require respect for human rights, inviolability, self-determination and responsibilisation of the individual as a priority.
The violent practice of abortion should therefore be excluded as a general means of family planning.
A regulation whose objective is to protect health cannot contradict itself and attack life, the supreme good of the individual from the moment of conception.
Another general consideration is countries' approach to these instruments, which reflect the responsibility that every State, every community and every individual should feel to protect life.
With the help of the donor countries, the governments of the developing countries must provide information, education and appropriate instruments and encourage responsibilisation of the individual, to free people from ignorance, taboos, superstition and the archaic practices which go hand in hand with underdevelopment.
My last point concerns the issue of the subordination of women to men.
The culture of the hierarchy of force must be eliminated once and for all during the Third Millennium.
The Third Millennium is characterised by the culture of information and knowledge and, therefore, must provide the conditions for free exchange between minds.
Women must be able to dialogue with men without being affected by any form of sexism.
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0026/2003) by Mr Harbour, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions: 2002 Review of the Internal Market Strategy - Delivering the promise [COM(2002) 171 - C5-0283/2002 - 2002/2143(COS)].
Mr President, it gives me great pleasure to be able to present my report, even if for the second night running I find myself speaking in the last debate of the day.
On behalf of all my colleagues on the committee, I hope that we can request the services to give the internal market a rather more prominent place in future.
As you said in your introduction, my report is about the Commission's strategy paper, Delivering the Promise.
That will be very much the theme of my speech.
But I want to say, for the record, that I have also been involved in considering a veritable cascade of other documents that the Commissioner sent us over the last few months.
I have also considered the second Biennial Report on Mutual Recognition, the State of the Internal Market for Services and the Internal Market Scoreboard No 11, a very colourful document I am sure you have all read.
Before I move to the substance of the report, I should like to say that it is a privilege for me to have succeeded, as the committee's rapporteur on internal market strategy, my very good friend, Mrs Palacio, who was such a tremendous chairman of our committee and did so much to champion the cause of the internal market.
She has now gone on to higher things as the Foreign Minister of Spain.
I have had the pleasure of working on this report by a happy coincidence during the time when the 10th anniversary of the internal market was marked.
We were very pleased to welcome Commissioner Bolkestein and Mr Benson, the chairman of the Competitiveness Council, to Parliament back in November 2002.
I would like to thank them both for enthusiastically promoting the cause of the internal market during that time.
In his speech then Mr Bolkestein asked us to produce an ambitious and hard-hitting report.
I think I have managed that, but I could not have done it without a lot of support from my colleagues.
You will see tomorrow that I am confident this report will get the overwhelming support of the House.
I particularly want to thank the shadow rapporteur, Mrs McCarthy, who made many valuable contributions, that we have included; my colleague and former President, Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado, who has done the same; and thanks to the rapporteur for opinion Mr David Martin from the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee.
We have incorporated a number of his points.
I hope he feels that we have done justice to his work as well.
I am slightly disappointed that the Liberal benches tonight are empty.
I hope that their absence means that they are content with the work we have done.
However, since they are of your political family, Commissioner, I hope you will draw that to their attention tomorrow.
I will highlight some of the points in this report.
It is no coincidence that we have timed it now, in the run-up to the economic summit and following on the debate we had this morning.
Our central recommendation - and Commissioner, we want you to take this forward from this House when you go to the summit so that the Council takes note of it - is that we want the completion of the internal market to be the top priority of the 2003 economic summit.
We want the 'delivery gap' - a phrase that you appropriately used, Commissioner - to be closed.
We want the new Competitiveness Council to address the issues seriously and make a difference.
Naturally, we want the deficit revealed on your scoreboards in Member States' transposition to be closed.
We also want to see quicker and more effective action taken where the Rules are being flouted.
As part of the Better Regulation Initiative, we want to deal with the problems of over-complex, gold plating of internal market regulations.
We also want internal market compatibility to be introduced as part of the assessment process.
We urge you to move forward quickly with the Internal Market for Services strategy.
It is clear that will be a difficult measure, but it is a vital one.
It will include important elements of mutual recognition, alongside harmonisation.
We want the Member States to take a much more mature attitude to using mutual recognition alongside other weapons as a measure to create the single market.
In our committee, we are absolutely dismayed that the sales promotion regulation, an ideal single market mutual recognition measure is still blocked in Council.
We hope you will take that message back as well.
I want to conclude with two important points.
First, we hope that you, Commissioner, will join us and the single market in organising another Single Market Forum before the end of 2003 where we can celebrate the entry of ten new countries to the internal market.
That is something in which we want to involve consumers, businesses, Member governments and Commissioners in the quest to make the internal market work better.
Finally, we hope that you can get, with the support of the Council, a firm declaration of support for the completion of the single market on its tenth anniversary.
We have been ambitious and hard hitting.
We invite the Council to take the same approach.
Mr President, this is a very important topic, one of the bases on which the European Union rests.
Last November, I challenged Parliament to come up with bold new ideas for improving the internal market.
The Harbour report more than meets that challenge.
Ten years of the internal market have given us 2.5 million extra jobs and EUR 900 billion, cumulatively, in extra wealth.
But that is not enough.
Too many barriers are still holding us back.
Enlargement makes it all the more urgent to clear the decks.
As any engineer will tell you, if you add a couple of storeys to a building, which is what enlargement in essence will do, you must make sure that the foundations are sufficiently strong.
Hence the emphasis in the forthcoming medium-term Internal Market Strategy for the years 2003-2006.
The emphasis in that medium-term Internal Market Strategy - a document that the Commission will present in April - is on going 'back to basics'.
Foremost among this move 'back to basics' is the matter of implementation and enforcement.
I welcome Parliament's support for strengthening the Commission's enforcement powers in the future IGC.
The Harbour report also calls on the Commission to calculate the economic costs of transposition delays.
I can see the attraction of that idea, but the transposition deficit is a moving target which reflects different directives with different economic impacts over time.
However, I have asked my staff to look into the feasibility of making such a calculation and I will report back to you as soon as possible.
It is not yet as easy to trade within the internal market as it is to trade within a Member State.
Borders still exist, not perhaps in the real world, but certainly in the minds of national officials who often do not yet think or act in a European way.
We may need to put some disciplines in place to get a change in behaviour.
As you may know, the Commission is giving very high priority to making a proposal for a horizontal instrument to remove barriers in the services market by the end of the year.
We are also considering ways of making trade in goods easier.
EU citizens and businesses deserve more and better information about their internal market rights.
Mr Harbour's report calls for a second Internal Market Forum as a means of connecting with citizens.
I welcome the idea of a second forum and I shall be honoured to take part - if you invite me, of course!
Removing tax obstacles is another key priority.
I welcome Parliament's support for the Commission's communications on the taxation of persons and passenger cars, a subject dear to the heart of Mr Vatanen, who spoke to me at length about that.
I respect his energy in pursuing that subject.
The Commission will bring forward proposals this year to modernise and simplify VAT rules so as to reduce the burden on businesses, particularly on SMEs.
This list is not exhaustive.
We all know that the internal market covers a multitude of subjects.
We are still open to ideas.
I should like to work closely with Parliament in the coming months as our strategy takes shape.
I will end by endorsing the opening paragraph of the Harbour report which states that the internal market should be the top priority for this year's Spring Summit.
I wholeheartedly agree with Mr Harbour on that and call on Parliament to do everything it can to ensure that this comes about.
Mr President, firstly I would like to congratulate Mr Harbour on his report and thank him for incorporating into it so many of the viewpoints of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
The Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee broadly shares the view of the state of the internal market set out by the Commission in its third annual report.
Like the Commission, we regret that in the period covered by the report only about 50% of the target actions have been met.
However, we reject the Commission's claim that the Council and Parliament are equally to blame for this failure.
The list set out by the Commission itself in the report contains eight examples of where we have failed to meet targets.
Six of these clearly lie at the door of the Council, and only two can loosely be blamed on the European Parliament.
We therefore call on the Commission, at the Spring Summit, to push the Council to come forward with a clear set of priorities and a timetable for meeting its commitments under the single market programme.
The Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee welcomes the four headings for target actions set out in the review: modernising markets, improving business conditions, meeting citizens' needs and anticipating enlargement.
As far as the modernisation of markets is concerned, we particularly welcome the call to improve the pace of the delivery of the financial services action plan.
Financial services are the oil in Europe's economic engine, and we share the Commission's view that a truly integrated financial sector could add between 0.5 and 0.7% annually to EU GDP: a staggering EUR 43 billion per year.
Regarding the improvement of business conditions, we particularly welcome the objective aimed at ensuring that, in all Member States, a private limited company can be set up within 18 working days and at a cost of no more than EUR 213.
Where meeting citizens' needs is concerned, we welcome the emphasis given to encouraging free movement of labour, particularly through the introduction of a European health card, and the improved mutual recognition of academic and professional qualifications.
Finally, as far as anticipating enlargement is concerned, we now believe it urgent that the Commission addresses the administrative capacity of the candidate countries to ensure compliance with single market legislation.
As the Commissioner himself has said, the creation of the single market and the progress we have made since 1992 is remarkable, but there are no grounds for complacency.
We believe that the Commission has set out a practical roadmap for the next 18 months.
The Commission will have the support of my committee, and I am sure the whole of the Parliament, in meeting the objectives it has set out.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is the third time in the space of the last few days that we find ourselves discussing the significance of the internal market.
On Monday, we discussed the fallout from the World Economic Summit in Davos, and today we have already had a debate on the Spring Summit.
Circling around the future of the internal market and the Lisbon targets, both debates made clear how important the internal market is to us.
Both the Commissioner and the ten-year balance sheet documented and demonstrated the benefits brought by the internal market, in terms of growth, employment and competitiveness, to all our continent's citizens.
Yet, despite these manifest advantages, the internal market is not yet complete and still has a large number of weaknesses.
Allusion was made to the facts that 50% of the objectives have not yet been achieved, that the progress made is less than what had been aimed for, and that 2.1% of all the directives on the internal market have still not yet been transposed.
We therefore call on the Commission and the Council to avail themselves of all the options available, including sanctions, coordination and the initiation of legislation, in order to bring to fruition those things to which we have jointly committed ourselves.
The Lisbon targets are ambitious, and we will not achieve them without a successful internal market and without adherence to the Stability and Growth Pact.
The internal market and the Stability and Growth Pact are the essential instruments for achieving the Lisbon targets by 2010.
Their importance lies in the credibility they give to long-term objectives.
They have an essential contribution to make in building confidence in Europe's goals on the part of the public, of enterprises and employees.
There is a blatant discrepancy between what is piously promised at summits and what is transposed at home, and so we demand that all the directives on the internal market be transposed into law.
We demand that coordination of this process be taken charge of by the Commission, and that its right to initiate legislation be extended.
This is no longer a matter of apportioning guilt, but of specifying short-term targets - and responsibilities - on the way to the overall objective.
This has to do with fiscal policy, with the various competences involved, which still lead to distortions of competition and to new obstacles. It has to do with studying the effects on small and medium-sized enterprises as we progress towards this great internal market.
Of course, it also affects the internal market in financial services, which would alone account for 1.1% - or EUR 130 billion worth - of growth, and it has to do with the creation of the internal services market.
There is much for us to do, and, although we see from the balance sheet that we are on the right road, we must not slow down or come to a halt; instead, we have to discover a new dynamism.
So I thank the rapporteur for having made us aware of these things in such an impressive way and also for defining new objectives.
Mr President, I should like to add my congratulations to the rapporteur for the work he has done on this report.
I always find it somewhat amazing that on this graveyard shift on a Wednesday night, which Mr Harbour and I have shared on many occasions, we have ended up discussing perhaps one of the most important pieces of legislation that the European Union has passed, but the way this Parliament operates, that tends to be the way of things.
It is just over ten years now since the internal market came into operation.
In that time, vast strides have been made towards the completion of the market.
That said, however, there is still a long way to go.
There are still a number of barriers - barriers to trade.
We look at the different tax regimes in the Member States, whether it be indirect taxation or direct taxation - all are used as barriers to trade.
We look at different employment legislation in Member States - this too is used as a barrier to trade.
We look at our own failure to decide upon a Community patent - again that is a barrier to trade, but the solution there is in our own hands.
However, it is not only the free movement of goods that we should be concerned about.
It is also about the free movement of workers, the free movement of labour.
At the moment within the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market we are discussing the mutual recognition of professional qualifications.
The sooner that is sorted out, the sooner another barrier will be removed.
In today's climate, however, there is another barrier.
It is a barrier of fear and suspicion which has developed since 11 September, but was probably there beforehand.
That is a barrier restricting the free movement of workers.
We cannot allow ourselves to become a fortress Europe by setting up internal walls.
I was interested to hear what the Commissioner had to say.
The onus is on him, however, to take a long hard look at every Member State to see where these countries, while proclaiming the benefits of the internal market, are at the same time blocking its completion by using internal rules to flout it.
Most of the time this is for short-term political gain.
We have an opportunity to bring about the completion of the internal market.
Commissioner, you challenged this Parliament to come up with a hard-hitting report which you have now got.
We challenge you to finish the job - and you have our support.
Mr President, the report wants Parliament to give its support to the Commission's Internal Market Strategy, which seeks to homogenise the various national markets.
What concerns the rapporteur is the gap between the intention of completing the unification of the market at European level and the reluctance of the national States.
However, what concerns the working classes of the European Union is certainly not that, but rather the avalanche of collective dismissals.
The big companies who are responsible for those dismissals did not need any vote in the European Parliament to homogenise their attitude in this area.
These collective dismissals have been carried out by big companies such as Airlib in France or big multinationals such as Daewoo, ACT, Arcelor, Pechiney or Fiat, which operate in several countries in Europe, and whose shareholders, both past and present, are well able to afford to preserve the jobs of all those people whom they are rendering unemployed.
If big companies wish to restructure, that is their affair, but what is inadmissible and revolting is that they should do it by condemning their workers to unemployment and poverty.
It is the shareholders who should pay, and not the workers.
The profits of the companies and the capital of their shareholders should be used, as a matter of priority, to guarantee the jobs and wages of the workers.
Mr President, I too welcome the Harbour report, even if we are attempting tonight to deliver the promise at a time when most people are tucked up in bed.
I am very grateful to Mr Harbour, not only for being so magnanimous in his comments about the work I carried out on this report, but also for taking on so many of the numerous amendments I tabled.
I am particularly grateful to him for taking up my initiative calling upon the Member States, at the Spring Summit, to reaffirm their commitment to delivering the promise of a single market by signing up to a solemn declaration in this, the single market's tenth anniversary year.
I hope the Greek Presidency and the Commission can take up this initiative.
Such an initiative is needed because if Member States were to be given the equivalent of an end of term school report, there would be no gold stars for model pupils.
Rather, they would receive the comment 'could do better'.
In fact, they could do much better.
The November scoreboard illustrates our failure to deliver.
We are failing businesses by not reducing barriers; we are failing consumers, who in many sectors are not seeing the benefits of more choice and cheaper goods; and finally we are sliding backwards in terms of our attempt to achieve the goal of becoming the world's most competitive economy by 2010.
Future scoreboards must not only quantify the benefits of single market laws, they should, as Mr Harbour suggested, include an index of damage illustrating the costs of non-implementation.
The Commission should undertake a rigorous evaluation of why Member States are failing to implement, and it must identify the root cause.
Is it simply a case of national protectionism?
Is it due to concern for consumer protection, or to a lack of administrative capacity in Member States?
I agree that there should be strong sanctions for non-implementation, swift action, tight deadlines and effective deterrents to non-implementation.
Otherwise I fear, Commissioner, that we will be here in ten years' time talking about the need to complete the internal market.
Achieving a single market in financial services in one fell swoop could boost EU growth by 1.1%.
It would add EUR 130 billion to Europe's wealth and reduce the cost of raising capital for business by 0.5%.
The takeover directive, as I know you agree, Commissioner, is a key component of financial services in single markets.
I agree that we in this Parliament should get it onto the statute book as soon as possible.
Mr President, I would like to join others in congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Harbour, on his report, which is very complete and which has been negotiated with a creditable willingness to seek consensus.
I have tried to cooperate with the fundamental objectives of the report - with which I may say I am in total agreement - with certain amendments because I thought it would be useful to incorporate certain points.
The first, in line with what Mr Martin has just said on behalf of the Committee on Industry, is to reject - and this has been done very intelligently by the rapporteur - the equal treatment, undoubtedly hasty on the part of the Commission, of Parliament and the Council with regard to the causes of the delay of certain rules of the internal market.
As we say in our country, 'every candlestick should support its candle' and we should not all be judged equally in relation to responsibilities that are different.
The second aspect was the need - and Mr Harbour agreed immediately - to incorporate workers' organisations into the cooperation which were and are laid down in the report between the consumers' organisations and the employers' organisations.
For those whose political doctrine consists of a social market economy, this involvement by all social elements seems to us to be significant.
I would like to take up a statement by the Commissioner: as long as all active sections of European society fail to take on board the idea of the internal market, all imaginable rules and actions will be insufficient to make it a reality.
If on the other hand society is mobilised, this objective will be achieved much more easily.
The rapporteur has also accepted my request that greater attention be paid to the existing obstacles to the creation of small businesses and the necessary initiatives to overcome them.
Because, Mr President, we can go on and on about employment in large companies, but the people who really provide work in the European Union, in really huge quantities, are the small and medium-sized businesses.
And we must ensure that they can be incorporated into the internal market without obstacles, as Mr Karas has said.
Finally, I would like to acknowledge the progress made thanks to the efforts of Commissioner de Palacio - it is fair to say - on liberalisation, not 'liberation' as the Spanish text mistakenly says, in the field of gas, electricity and air transport.
I would like to thank Mr Harbour for incorporating these points, as well as the fortunate way he has incorporated the principle elements of my Amendment No 40 into paragraph 33; by the way, Mr President, and for the benefit of the services of this House, I would like to make the observation that this paragraph 33 of the English text does not exist in the Spanish text, and it should also be included in our language.
I will therefore vote in favour of this excellent report, on which I congratulate Mr Harbour once again, and I would also like to thank him for his kind words for Mrs Palacio, not the Commissioner, but her sister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who has cooperated so fully in the work to implement the internal market.
Mr President, thank you for allowing me to take the floor yet again.
I will confine my reply to a few main points.
First, I welcome the fact that those who have spoken - all but one perhaps - have supported the report written by Mr Harbour and also support most clearly and energetically the whole concept of the internal market.
Without the support of Parliament the Commission would be at a loss as to what to do with regard to furthering the internal market.
I can assure Mr Harbour that I will speak to my Liberal friends and tell them what they missed tonight.
Mr Harbour will recall that the Liberal complement of this Parliament is somewhat smaller than the group to which he himself belongs.
Personally speaking, I regret that but it is what it is.
Both Mr Harbour and Mr Martin have made references to the European Council.
Sometimes the European Council rather airily asks ministers concerned to deal with that issue and then move on to more rarefied subjects.
I recall that, perhaps a year ago, the European Council said that the Community Patent should be dealt with as soon as possible by the Commission and the Council of Ministers.
Nothing has happened.
It is not much use for the European Council to issue generalities.
I wish it would deal more with the subjects at hand.
Mr Harbour also mentioned the subject of sales promotion.
The Commission will certainly do its best to help the Greek Presidency reach a conclusion on that important file.
I shall discuss the matter with those Member States that have outstanding concerns.
It is my opinion that the proposal is compatible with the follow-up to the Green Paper on Consumer Protection, as my colleague Commissioner Byrne and I have made clear on many occasions.
Mr Martin spoke about a European health card.
He may be interested to know that the Commission is engaged in activities in the area of health.
The issue concerns citizens who cannot get quick treatment in their own country and so want to go abroad to get treatment.
The European Court of Justice, not long ago, delivered a judgment stating that not only should that be allowed, but also that compensation should be paid to the patient according to the rules of his home country.
The issue is now whether or not that patient should get authorisation from the authorities in his own country before going abroad for treatment.
There was a meeting on that important subject in the so-called 'High Level Reflection Group' last week.
I and my colleagues Commissioner Diamantopoulou and Commissioner Byrne were there to defend the principle that this also relates to the internal market because, if a patient goes abroad to get treatment, that is a matter of the freedom of services.
Therefore it is an aspect of the internal market and one that is very close to the citizen.
After all, what is more important to a person than his health?
Mr Martin may be interested to hear about this.
He can rest assured that my colleagues and I are determined to pursue that subject, although some Member States do not agree with this approach.
That is an obstacle.
Turning to Mr Karas' point about different tax barriers which exist, again, the Commission is not sitting on its hands.
We use the instruments of infringement proceedings and, in particular where citizens of one Member State get tax relief if they contribute to pension fund in their own Member State but do not get tax relief if they contribute to a pension fund in another Member State.
That is a clear case of discrimination against the second Member State.
Recently the Commission has started infringement proceedings.
Already, in one particular case, the European Court of Justice ruled that this is not admissible.
The Commission is determined to pursue obstacles of a fiscal nature where such an obstacle impinges on the internal market, but only where the Treaty allows us to do so.
As Members will realise, the area of taxation requires unanimity.
To get unanimity among 15 Member States is extremely difficult.
To get unanimity in 25 Member States would be well nigh impossible.
Regarding Mrs McCarthy's point on the scoreboard, it is perhaps an unpleasant, but very necessary matter to keep Member States focused on what they have to do.
The scoreboard is a form of 'soft law', peer pressure or best practice.
It is not a legal instrument but it goes together with the matter of infringement proceedings.
Therefore we are determined to continue issuing those scoreboards.
We must, as Mrs McCarthy said, do our best to do what we decided at Lisbon.
Lisbon said that we should have a microeconomic structural adjustment programme.
There is a delivery gap and we are not doing as well as we ought to.
Indeed it is in the Council, most often, where there are obstacles.
I tell them with great regularity that they should be quicker.
That also applies to the Takeover Directive mentioned by Mrs McCarthy and others.
Lastly, I entirely agree with Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado that we should see to it that there are no obstacles to the setting-up of small- and medium-sized enterprises.
The time needed to set up such a company is much longer than it is in the United States.
If we really want to overtake the United States as far as the creation of small- and medium-sized enterprises is concerned, we must see to it that we act in accordance with the words of Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
(The sitting was closed at 11.55 p.m.)
Decision on urgent procedure
We begin by voting on a request to apply urgent procedure to the proposal for a Council Regulation amending, as regards the exemptions to the freezing of funds and economic resources and for the tenth time, Regulation (EC) No 881/2002 imposing certain specific restrictive measures directed against certain persons and entities associated with Osama bin Laden, the Al Qaeda network and the Taliban [COM(2003) 41 - C5-0048/2003 - 2003/0015(CNS)]
I would first give the floor to Mr HernÃ¡ndez Mollar, Chairman of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs.
of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs. (ES) Madam President, yesterday, the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, of which I am chairman, did indeed hold an extraordinary meeting to deal with this matter and it was agreed to refuse urgent procedure, and for two basic reasons: firstly, because the urgent procedure is not authorised to be applied on one day for the next; in the meeting, neither the Commission nor the Council presented good enough arguments; and, secondly, because I believe we must demand of the Council that it justify urgent procedure and, also, not to treat Parliament as a mere formality, even though it has to be said that, in this case, the content of the proposal also reflects the opinion of Parliament.
In any case, this matter will be dealt with next Monday in our committee's ordinary session.
If no one else wishes to take the floor, we shall vote on this request for urgent procedure.
We shall now proceed to the vote on the request for urgent procedure.
(The decision was made not to apply urgent procedure.)
The next item is a report (A5-0021/2003) by Mrs Malliori, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a Council recommendation on the prevention and reduction of risks associated with drug dependence [COM(2002) 201 - C5-0270/2002 - 2002/0098(CNS)].
Madam President, this proposal for a Council recommendation is based on Article 152 of the Treaty, which stipulates that Community action complementing national measures is to cover the fight against the major health scourges.
The Treaty cites drugs and drugs-related harm in the following way: 'The Community shall complement the Member States' action in reducing drugs-related health damage, including information and prevention.'
May I also remind you that one of its main initiatives in the fight against drugs - the EU Drug Strategy 2000-2004 - includes amongst its three main public health targets one to reduce substantially drugs-related health damage and the number of drugs-related deaths.
The reported number of deaths related to drug overdose in the European Union is approximately 7 000 per year.
Deaths indirectly related to drug use, such as AIDS, traffic accidents, violence or suicide, bring this figure to approximately 20 000 a year.
Preventing the use of illegal drugs is a top priority.
This can be achieved by reducing both the supply and the demand for drugs.
This proposed recommendation particularly covers the demand side and takes over where law enforcement fails to stop the supply of drugs.
Clearly, we should try to persuade people not to use illegal drugs in the first place.
However, when an individual cannot be stopped from taking drugs, it is of vital importance that every effort is made to decrease the damage to the person involved, as well the indirect damage the user can cause to others.
The addicted individual needs to be actively involved in these efforts.
This is called risk reduction - or sometimes harm reduction or harm minimisation.
This is what the main part of the recommendation is about.
The risk reduction methods that feature in the recommendation are well established.
They have been used in most or all of the Member States, but to varying degrees.
Opiates, such as heroin, are the root cause of most drugs-related deaths.
One of the oldest of the risk reduction methods is controlled use of methadone tablets as a substitute for injected heroin.
Methadone first appeared in the EU in the late 1960s in response to emerging opiate use.
The emergence of HIV in the 1980s led to the introduction of needle- and syringe-exchange programmes.
In recent years, the number of acute drugs-related deaths at EU level as a whole has stabilised, in spite of increasing drug use.
Many factors may have contributed to this development.
Injecting drugs has decreased in some countries and medical treatment of overdoses has improved.
However, the risk reduction methods covered by this recommendation are likely to have made a large contribution to this favourable development.
Drug services need to be easily accessible, reaching out to the place where the drug user happens to be, not where we want him or her to be.
These are termed 'outreach services'.
Such services should also be offered without unrealistic demands - sometimes called 'low threshold services'.
The aim is to prevent further deterioration in the health and social circumstances of users and motivate them to seek treatment.
The more controversial risk reduction methods are not mentioned in the present recommendation, although they are being used in some of the Member States.
Methods such as heroin injections under supervision, injection rooms, open-drug scenes and on-the-spot anonymous testing of substances require more research and evaluation before they can be generally recommended.
The recommendation emphasises evaluation as a key tool for improving drugs-related measures.
The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction in Lisbon plays a crucial role in the development of key indicators for monitoring and comparing drug use in the Member States.
It also assists in providing guidelines for the evaluation of drugs-related projects and evaluates different programmes and policies.
The Commission has received invaluable help from the Lisbon agency in preparing this recommendation, which I see as a positive step for drug users as well as public health in general.
Madam President, Commissioner, unfortunately, drug abuse is one of today's major social problems, meaning that the measures and policies applied so far have been inadequate.
Drug use is increasing along with the other problems facing modern society.
The 2002 annual report of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction shows that the level of drug use is fairly stable, with 2 to 9 users per 1 000 population in the 15 to 64 age group, 500 000 to 1 000 000 of whom are drug injectors, that is, heroin addicts.
That is why, even though the primary objective when dealing with this problem is still and always will be prevention, I think this is a very important initiative and I congratulate you, Commissioner, on your proposal on the prevention and reduction of risks associated with drug dependence.
I make no bones about the fact that I would have preferred this particular proposal to have been a legislative proposal because it is common European policy or at least a legislative approach that makes our policies effective.
Nonetheless, I think that the proposed recommendation is an important step towards protecting both public health and the personal health of users and that we are sending out the right political message; that addicts are patients in need of medical and social care, not just offenders, as most societies today believe.
Our proposed amendments mainly specify the action needed at local level if we are to achieve maximum possible results in this difficult and sensitive sector.
Raising public awareness in order to gain acceptance of various forms of treatment and other user protection programmes is vital if we are to be able to implement the proposed recommendation.
In other words, when we talk of measures to reduce the harm done by drug use, the main objective is still to cure the user.
However, as we know, a large number of drug addicts do not sign up for treatment programmes, and it is basically this group that has the most problems.
We can only stop dangerous diseases such as hepatitis, AIDS and tuberculosis from spreading if we educate this group on the health risks.
This should also encourage users to be more careful when taking drugs and adopt a healthier lifestyle.
It is also vital to include measures targeting high-risk environments, such as prisons.
The proportion of inmates in the EU reporting having used drugs varies according to prisons and countries from between 29 and 86%.
Prisoners are highly exposed to illnesses through the use of common syringes and needles and sexual contact.
Inevitably, the prison staff also face an immediate danger and a number of amendments have been proposed in order to reflect this.
As you know, Commissioner, the drug debate has been a topical debate for quite some time now and always gives rise to a great many, usually conflicting views.
Nonetheless, and my thanks here to all my colleagues, especially the shadow rapporteurs for their cooperation, we have managed to table a relatively well-endorsed proposal in plenary today, despite the 103 original amendments.
I think that, if the Member States implement just some of the proposed measures, both users and their families and European citizens will feel that we are determined to do something about this complex and difficult problem.
Madam President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her report and the Commissioner for bringing forward this proposal.
I think the Commissioner is right at this stage that it should be a recommendation.
There are different cultures in different Member States and we need to respect that, and so recommendations on good practice are probably the way forward at this stage.
I should also like to point out to him and to you, Madam President, that he needs to go through the text of his communication to make absolutely certain there is nothing in it which will frighten people into thinking that this recommendation is in any way promoting drug use.
There is no safe drug abuse, it is a question of how we reduce and prevent the harm that arises from such abuse.
In my country we have 3 million people on illegal drugs, 28% of them are 16-29 year olds, 14% of them are 14-15 year olds.
We have 12 000 new notified addicts, 70 000 drug offences and 1 200 drug related deaths per year.
If you look at the European figures from the MCDDA, offences in the EU have doubled since 1991 and quadrupled in some countries such as France, Greece and Spain.
Acute drug related deaths have doubled since 1985.
There are those who use the same arguments as we sometimes hear on AIDS, saying that we can forget about those people who are infected, but should protect and save the rest.
However, we must not abandon people who are hooked.
Many of them, as those figures show, are children.
We are losing the battle but we must not give up the fight.
Our aims must be to target the growers and manufacturers, the traders and pushers, and to educate, deter and prevent, but also to reduce the harm to those addicted and to those with whom they come into contact.
This recommendation does exactly that.
No Member State is forced to do anything.
This sits alongside measures on prevention.
To my colleague Mr Santini I would say that if his amendments 60, 61, 63 and 64 were in addition to the proposals in this report then I would be happy to accept them.
It is only if they replace the proposals that I am less happy.
This is not the occasion for a debate on legalisation and I know there are some amendments on that.
That is why I would reject the legalisation and decriminalisation arguments on this occasion.
The report does not replace harm reduction with other measures, least of all 'JUST SAY NO', which does not work.
I know that from having been Minister responsible for drug addiction in my own country.
You have to tell young people in particular the truth.
They have to know the upside as well as the downside.
We had the case of Leah Betts, a young girl who died taking ecstasy, an amphetamine.
Afterwards, her parents very bravely allowed a video of her body to be shown, so that young people would understand the effect of taking ecstasy.
They also joined us in making sure that we issued guidance to night clubs on how to avoid this catastrophe affecting other people.
It is a question of water provision and 'chill-out rooms' and so on, and not a question of 'shooting rooms', which is a completely different matter.
There are so many young people who need and deserve our support.
There are needle exchanges, which protect not just the addicts, but also the people with whom they are in contact.
Prison health needs to be looked at and we need to stop the abuse of drugs in prison, but we also need to ensure there is harm reduction and that we do not incorporate perverse incentives to further drug taking.
I welcome this report.
The whole subject needs to be treated with care, and I know the Commissioner will ensure that this is the case as we move forward to take on good practice throughout the European Union.
I give the floor to Mrs Sandberg-Fries, whom I would take the opportunity to welcome back to the European Parliament.
Madam President, this report concerns the prevention and reduction of risks associated with drug dependence.
From the beginning, we Swedish Social Democrats have held the view that the recommendation focuses to an unduly high degree upon harm reduction.
Our point of departure is that the most important measure for reducing harm is that of preventing dependence itself.
That does not mean that we deny the need for efforts to reduce harm.
Such efforts must, however, form part of a coherent strategy aimed at bringing about lasting change and lives not dependent upon illegal and other drugs.
On this point, the committee has complied with quite a few of the proposals we have tabled.
It is therefore very odd that the same committee in the same report should also have accepted a number of amendments in quite the opposite vein.
I mean the proposals concerning so-called chill-out rooms, drug classification, special injecting rooms and positive information about drugs.
These are proposals that we cannot under any circumstances support.
Such measures would imply social acceptance of drug abuse.
Nor, obviously, do we accept proposals that are basically contrary to the UN Convention on Drugs.
The fact that a drugs policy based upon the three components consisting of prevention, treatment and control really can be successful is, I think, confirmed by the latest major survey carried out in Swedish schools.
This survey shows that 92 out of every 100 pupils in Swedish schools have not even tried drugs.
This is a result that, in an international context, is extremely encouraging.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am keen to do again what I did in committee, that is, to express my support for our rapporteur Mrs Malliori on this subject, which is, to say the least, a controversial subject that evokes passion.
The approach deliberately chosen by the committee and by our rapporteur, that of focussing on providing, on a local scale, step-by-step programmes targeting persons addicted to hard drugs, seems to us to be the right one, the one most likely to yield tangible results at grass-roots level and to reverse the current, rather disturbing, tendency.
Drug-related deaths are on the up, and that seems to be the case in most of the Member States.
For all these reasons, the Liberal Group welcomes the amendments that add value to this recommendation in terms of public health.
Our governments must indeed give priority to high-risk environments.
Streets, the penal system, nightclubs, raves, are all places where hard drugs circulate freely and without regard to the minimum standards of health and safety.
We must of course prioritise action programmes on the street, in prisons and also in places of nocturnal entertainment where the simultaneous consumption of more than one drug is prevalent.
As regards this latter practice of using drugs and alcohol at the same time, which is cutting swathes through young people in particular - and they are getting ever younger - it is imperative that, in parallel with one another, schemes for prevention, information, analysis of chemical substances and providing a rapid response in the event of illness or withdrawal, should be operated and made widely available.
The 8000 citizens who are dying every year in the European Union, from overdoses, from adulterated products, or as a result of shared needles, deserve a full-frontal approach to risk reduction on the part of the European Union.
Let me say now that I regret the fact that we have not, in this report, completely succeeded in focussing our attention on this specifically health-related aspect, at the risk of watering down our message and reverting to an ethical and generalised debate, which would again be futile and would attempt to set up prevention and suppression in opposition to each other.
I wish to say that I go along with Mr Bowis' arguments and that I am unable to accept those put forward by Mrs Sandberg-Fries.
My conclusion, Madam President, is that we need to set ourselves realistic targets if we are to be able to say, tomorrow at least, that the EU's new action plan on drugs has been a success.
Madam President, I should like firstly to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Malliori, who, as do other rapporteurs in the case of all the reports we prepare, relies on the opinions of the other groups with a view to obtaining a final outcome that we can all accept.
It seems that, in this case, there are some differences of opinion, but I believe that it will be possible for the report to be approved by a majority of this Parliament.
The report and the Commission communication refer to the prevention and reduction of risks.
Every Member will express his or her opinion in this Chamber on how risks are to be prevented and reduced.
Mrs Malliori's report clearly refers to reducing supply and demand, to integrated policies, to the exchange of good practice and to a concern for social re-integration. These are the bases of the report.
To achieve these aims, a variety of methods, including prevention programmes, are required, as are assessments of various methods of treatment and rehabilitation, taking into account the work of former drug addicts, their families and the communities that work with them.
In my own region of Asturias, the organisation 'Proyecto Hombre' operates in this way and obtains results that I can see every day, encouraging local communities to set up, on the one hand, mobile units able to provide information, advice, assistance and first aid in the event of overdoses and, on the other hand - and, in this connection, I do not understand some of the amendments tabled - mobile units to dispense condoms, needles and syringes, something that has been proven to reduce AIDS infection and other illnesses.
Furthermore, it is necessary to support the innovative proposals reflecting experiments carried out with, as one approved amendment states, some success by a number of Member States with a view to preventing deaths and reducing risks. I know that, on this subject, there are differences, including in my own group, where my Swedish fellow MEPs do not share this position of mine.
In this case, I agreed with an amendment by Mr Davies - defeated in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy - that proposed authorising and evaluating the professional prescription of heroin to addicts so that they might escape the clutches of dealers.
In my own country - and I heard the Commissioner say that he is now ready to approve this option - a pilot programme is to be carried out in one autonomous region, specifically Andalusia, involving chronically ill people who have completed re-integration programmes and entailing controlled doses of heroine being administered professionally only to those drug addicts who have shown that they are unable to give up the drug.
An assessment will be carried out in due course.
One hundred and thirty people chronically addicted to the drug have been selected to see if the programme produces results.
I, for my part, Commissioner, think that this programme is very worthwhile because it may help us all in the future.
I shall conclude by pointing out that the report also deals with the situation in prisons.
Depending upon the particular country, the situation in prisons is very serious, and there are a very great many prisoners infected with a variety of illnesses, precisely because they have taken drugs and used infected needles and syringes.
Madam President, a report like this, on how to deal with drug abuse, will always be controversial in this House.
This is because it touches on our inability to control reality, and that is difficult for us as politicians.
I therefore think that it is courageous and commendable that the rapporteur has managed to keep both feet on the ground.
She says in her explanation, and I quote: 'In an ideal world there would be no drug abuse.
In the real world, drugs have always been a fact of life.' and that is the way things are.
Zero tolerance or simpler still, closing your eyes, is not a solution.
The question to our politicians is therefore how can we bring about an improvement to a reality that we do not like.
One such possibility is described in Amendment No 24, which encourages Member States to facilitate the testing of synthetic drugs.
These are drugs that are mainly used by young people at discos, concerts and parties.
A lot of young people use them, perhaps even our sons and daughters, but many of these drugs are not innocent - certainly not if they have been tampered with to increase the profit margin even further.
I am in fact talking about ecstasy, the consequences of which have also just been set out by Mr Bowis.
It often results in fatal accidents.
Testing can reduce the health risks.
It puts social workers in touch with users, and it also helps assess the dangerous substances that are available on the market.
Testing can take place in testing centres throughout the country or in situ at parties or concerts.
You will of course have to be careful and make sure that the approval of a pill cannot be interpreted as a statement that it is a good idea to use it, because of course it is not.
Advice, the provision of information and prevention naturally remain key, but I nevertheless think that it is also extremely important for the government to try to make nightlife a little safer.
The use of these pills by young people is a fact, and I think that it is important for us to prevent fatal accidents from happening in our children's nightlife.
Madam President, given the seriousness of the drugs problem I find it incomprehensible that Mr Byrne and the Malliori report are recommending a 'beating your head against a brick wall' policy in this way.
Parliament's resolution on the Action Plan to Combat Drugs (2000-2004) clearly indicated at the time that drug abuse results in biological, psychological and social problems, disease, problems with families and at work, committing offences, traffic accidents, and so on. Drug abuse is also a threat to young people.
For these reasons, in 1999 the same resolution called for everything to be done to give priority to protecting children under the age of 18 and to reduce the number of drug-related deaths.
It is well known that there are differences between different kinds of drugs.
The most serious drug problems affect intravenous drugs users, of whom there are, according to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, between 500 000 and one million in the European Union.
Intravenous drug use inevitably results in social exclusion, as it soon excludes the essential elements of normal life - work, family, personal relationships and a permanent home.
That is not to say, however, that there is nothing wrong with other drugs.
It was wrongly stated in the discussions that so-called soft drugs are harmless.
It is partly on account of this belief that the use of cannabis has increased enormously.
It has furthermore been scientifically proven that there is a relationship between the use of these drugs and mental health.
For example, the chance of developing schizophrenia is 30% to 50% higher for cannabis users. I am quoting the British Medical Journal of 23 November 2002.
What is more, the policy of tolerance of soft drugs - as in the Netherlands - has resulted in an increase in use, particularly among young people.
In practice the switch to hard drugs has also been shown to be much easier; after all, the use of drugs is already accepted.
The recommendation before us is about the health risks associated with drug addiction.
The European Commission mainly places the emphasis on limiting the risks instead of prevention.
The rapporteur is arguing for additional measures, particularly for the care of drug users at local level, for example by helping drug users achieve a healthier life.
The rapporteur cites the provision of a number of elementary health services such as clean hypodermic syringes and blood tests.
This may perhaps go a little way towards achieving better hygiene, but does not contribute to solving the problems.
I am firmly convinced that kicking the habit is the best way of achieving a healthier life.
The policy of harm reduction does not work, as it has been shown that the overload caused by users increases again after a while and the provision of free methadone seems only to result in additional addiction.
The negative effect of a liberal drugs policy has the effect of drawing people into certain other areas.
Crime, decay and the lack of safety in certain parts of towns and cities have taken on serious proportions.
To dismiss these arguments with the argument that this recommendation is only about the effects on health is misplaced.
The effects on health can best be reduced by means of a restrictive policy.
In addition, I am also in favour of proper help for addicts.
It does depend on how this is done, however.
We do not help drug addicts by only treating symptoms.
If we want to get drug addicts out of the downward spiral, kicking the habit - either voluntarily or otherwise - is the best option.
In the Netherlands there are fortunately examples of so-called hopeless cases who, with the right motivation, have been helped to achieve a drug-free existence.
This approach does most to benefit health.
I cannot accept Mr Bowis' suggestion for Amendments Nos 60, 61 and 64 to be regarded as additional ones.
Madam President, Commissioner, it is a matter of concern that the use of drugs is everywhere being treated as unimportant and commonplace.
This phenomenon goes hand in hand with the social acceptance of the marketing of them for recreational purposes, sometimes on a daily basis.
Drugs are not, though, an accident of fate to which one must resign oneself.
They involve serious risk of infection and lead to people being socially excluded in a very real sense.
You have to call a spade a spade.
This report speaks of risks, for the danger is indeed there.
Let me say that I am astonished that the report does not retain the amendment I had tabled in committee with the aim of avoiding the pitfall of trivialising drug use.
How do you combat evil if you start from the premise that it is inevitable or even necessary?
To do so demonstrates a sad detachment from reality.
The risk will be no less if we sink into politically correct indifference.
Drug addiction is not tolerable.
It is a scourge that must be fought against.
There are no soft drugs.
There certainly needs to be information, but the trivialisation of drug use is a snare and must be combated.
As for a policy of risk-reduction, it could not do other than appear like fatalistic acceptance of the dangers.
This not about marginalising drug users still further, nor about scuppering risk reduction schemes, but about demonstrating at last the will to undertake preventive measures, which must have a simultaneous effect on both supply and demand and on our sense of social responsibility.
The refusal to trivialise drug use means taking up our responsibilities, both as regards our young people, who are most affected by this, and also with respect to social cohesion, which must always unite us all.
Madam President, Commissioner, I am one of those who take the view that, where the global repercussions of drug addiction for public health, crime and insecurity are concerned, it would be preferable, wherever possible, to develop European approaches.
I therefore welcome this proposal for a recommendation and the excellent report by Mrs Malliori.
Our policy for combating drug addiction has proved to be a failure: the prohibitionist approach has given trafficking oxygen, allowing it to thrive and to make ever-greater profits, boosting both organised and petty crime, corrupting regimes and humiliating us for being powerless to do anything about it.
Furthermore, the deterioration of drug addicts' health is of concern, but also the health risks arising from infection such as HIV, tuberculosis, hepatitis B and hepatitis C, as well as the increasing number of deaths from overdoses and poisoning.
Faced with such problems, it is impossible to be absolutely sure of what approach to take. We must, however, move in a new direction.
Although I believe that the debate must continue calmly in the United Nations on the impact on public health and crime of the possible decriminalisation of some drugs, I do not think that this should be our priority.
Our priority should be, firstly, to draw up rational prevention policies based on scientific knowledge of each drug and not on an emotional response and on the radical approach which, by treating all drugs equally, ultimately removes the credibility of preventive action.
Our second priority is to develop a risk-reduction policy.
For those infected for whom free drug treatments have not achieved positive results, methadone substitution programmes must be pursued.
It is also important that experiments involving administering heroin under medical supervision to patients with a long history of failure to respond to treatment and chronic illnesses are pursued and implemented in other States.
We must also be able to undertake an evaluation of these results.
Many of these experiments have shown positive results in reducing crime, the number of overdoses by poisoning and the number of those infected with HIV, tuberculosis, hepatitis B and hepatitis C.
Madam President, drug addiction is a complicated problem with significant social consequences for the user and for his or her environment, with risks to health and ongoing crime.
There are, however, not only social consequences, but also social causes.
Our rapporteur, Minerva Malliori, deserves our firm support for her approach.
A tailor-made approach; as drug users are not all the same, the prevention of drug use and drug addiction must be based on respect for the drug user.
There has been a great deal of disagreement over the years about the approach to the drugs problem, all of which involve firm stances.
The Commission has opted for a policy of risk reduction or damage limitation.
Rightly so, as risk reduction can limit the impact on health.
A policy of monitoring substances and clean hypodermic syringes can save lives.
Naturally risk reduction must not lead to complacency, however.
We cannot relax about the addiction problem.
Conversely, the policy of damage limitation is precisely what makes a convincing approach to drugs crime possible.
There thus does not need to be a huge contrast between the policy of damage limitation and the policy of drug prevention.
We should be receptive to the benefits of each approach.
Mrs Malliori's local approach can achieve a great deal, and the establishment of mobile low threshold help services is a good idea.
We do not, however, have to strive towards a uniform approach, although we must be willing to learn from one another.
We must compare the approaches to see which is effective in countering addiction.
This report is a good opportunity for us to familiarise ourselves with the approach in various countries.
I warmly invite my fellow Members to come and see how it is done in the Netherlands. My thanks and appreciation to Mrs Malliori again.
Madam President, hundreds of thousands of people die each year from the use of perfectly legal drugs.
Yet we subsidise the growing of tobacco plants while we cut down cannabis plants.
It is all complete nonsense.
The truth is that prohibition lies at the very heart of many of our problems.
Prohibition creates huge profits for criminals, who seek to extend their market.
Prohibition fosters corruption and theft. Prohibition denies drug users the information about content that is available to everyone who enjoys an alcohol drink in the evening.
If health messages are to work and society is to be protected we must replace prohibition with government regulation.
The criminals must be denied their profits if we are to bring these problems under control.
This paper is an excellent step forward.
It ignores the moral outrage which has been expressed so often in the past.
It concentrates on pragmatic and sensible steps to inform people and reduce harm.
It is in complete contrast to the Swedish approach, which I find utterly appalling.
As Mr Bowis said, just saying 'no' does not work - it certainly does not work in most of the societies in which we live.
The idea that we should try and prevent needle exchanges, for example, will simply mean more deaths, more blood poisoning, more AIDS.
It is a vicious and cruel approach.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Italian Radicals do not support this report either.
At a time such as this when we have an opportunity to discuss drugs, the Malliori report does not provide Parliament, particularly in the light of the disastrous effects of 40 years of prohibitionist policies and insubstantial endeavours - 'lightweight' measures - which have failed miserably to control the spread of illegal drugs and, on the contrary, even exacerbated the social effects and effects on people's lives and health - does not provide the European Parliament - with the opportunity to state some very simple truths: that prohibitionism has failed and that we therefore need to take steps, even one step at a time, to separate the markets, for example, to prevent the black market attracting consumers of hashish or marijuana, which are not drugs, and inducing them to approach the markets of other drugs. We need to look carefully at the experiments with public injection rooms, at the experiments carried out in Switzerland and other European countries, to find a different path from that of the current policy which has led the European countries, and all the countries striving in vain to combat drugs, to continue with their prohibitionist policies.
This is why, together with other Members and the International Antiprohibitionist League, we have launched a large-scale campaign condemning the UN Conventions.
This is our position and we will therefore vote against the Malliori report, for it contains nothing new and just stresses the severity of the problems without proposing any solution, in some cases even changing the approach for the worse.
Madam President, when we talk about drugs, we clearly mean out-and-out war. We cannot just be content with a few short battles.
The battles we are talking about today are preventing and reducing the damage but, clearly, all these measures are, in any case, dependent upon the success of other measures such as combating drug trafficking and consumption.
It must be pointed out that we need to start by addressing a human condition, the condition of drug addicts.
We need to change our approach: drug addicts must be treated as people who are ill rather than criminals, and so we need to take lines which are consistent with this view and, therefore, employ treatments which bring about the recovery of drug addicts rather than social exclusion.
That is why, out of the two kinds of treatment still being debated, many of us still prefer the more human approach of rehabilitation communities, therapeutic communities, to the administration of chemical substances which are alternatives to or substitutes for drugs.
We do not endorse the use of substances such as methadone, except in extreme clinical cases.
In addition to medical and pharmaceutical care, we need to provide drug addicts with psychological help too.
First and foremost, we need to step up the fight against the network of traffickers who continue, I regret to say, to be on the scene.
Turning briefly to methadone, I would say that it is a substitution substance which does not resolve the problem of drug dependence and, worst of all, does not bring about the recovery of the drug addict: it is a bit like drugging up someone who is ill and administering pain killers without ever giving them an operation.
Mr Blokland and other Members have also mentioned the unsuccessful results of attempts at liberalisation and legalisation in this field: these kinds of approach must be abandoned.
That is why, therefore, I too have taken the liberty of tabling some amendments, which Mr Bowis is kindly going to illustrate during the vote, presenting them to our rapporteur not as replacing but as supplementing the contents of the report. They are amendments which relate, above all, to prevention.
Amendment No 60 proposes some ideas for freeing addicts from their dependence, striking at the root of the evil. Amendment No 61 relates to treatments which are not based on drugs but which include a great deal of psychological help for the ill drug addict.
Amendment No 62 recommends great caution in providing access to needles, condoms and syringes.
Amendments Nos 63 and 64 are on the subject of preventive and preparatory measures, first and foremost, for the people responsible for implementing these measures. Lastly, the other amendments propose measures to combat drugs in prisons, to encourage data collection on prevention and, once again, to discourage substitution treatment, which not only fails to reduce damage and consumption but increases, boosts, the black market.
Madam President, I am deeply concerned, Commissioner.
Listening to our fellow MEP, Mr Davies is extremely depressing.
More and more young people in Europe are ending up in the type of squalor brought about by drugs.
The trend is in the wrong direction.
Mr Davies thinks so too, but more and more EU countries appear to have given up.
In this Chamber too, voices in favour of legalising and liberalising drugs and classifying them as dangerous and less dangerous are being heard more and more often.
Here in Parliament, there is a desire to tear up the UN conventions on drugs.
These are what we have to hold onto, Commissioner.
I am afraid that European drugs policy is on the decline.
The overall tenor of Mrs Malliori's report is, unfortunately, along those lines, even though certain parts of it are constructive, for example the demand for drugs-free prisons.
That being said, it is quite unreasonable to begin talking about the 'upside' of drugs and about chill-out rooms and injecting rooms.
Drug policy must free addicts from dependence, not sanitise dependence.
The only way to achieve that goal is through a combination of bans, care, preventive work and international cooperation.
The objective, which has to remain in place, must be a drugs-free society.
We Swedish Liberals will vote against the report because it lacks this overall combination.
Madam President, I would like to use the mere seconds I have been given to speak in to firstly point out to my fellow Members that the government in my own country, Flanders, in Belgium, has, over the past few years and in the most outrageous way, been neglecting the drugs problem and trivialising drug use.
In my country the use of so-called soft drugs has been de facto legalised, and this has also been advertised to young people in television programmes with ministers in office acting as if they were smoking dope.
At this moment nobody in my country knows what is actually legally permitted and what is not legally or socially permitted, with all the extremely serious consequences this entails.
Young people and children in my country currently do not know where they stand.
What we ought to be sending out today is a signal from a Europe that is engaging in the fight against drugs in a serious and consistent way - by means of prevention, certainly, by supporting addicts and their families, certainly, but also if necessary by means of compulsory detoxification programmes for addicts and by means of the toughest possible penalties for drug dealers.
I regret the fact that the present recommendations do not contain these two necessary components, and so I am unfortunately not able approve the report.
Madam President, Mrs Malliori's report is mainly acceptable in itself.
The main basis of the report is health grounds, but its general tone could be interpreted as permissive with respect to drugs.
For that reason I would stress that we must tackle the drugs problem strictly and that in the EU we must achieve minimum norms in legislation as well as in the penalties we impose.
The credibility of our fight against drugs is weakened by the fact that in the Member States the use of those other intoxicants, alcoholic drinks, is viewed permissively or even idealised.
It does Mrs Malliori's report credit that it should mention that problems with alcohol are on a par with drug problems.
This is the way we should be going.
The EU must agree to raise taxes on alcohol, hence reducing consumption and the harm it does.
Social welfare and healthcare costs will then come down, so allowing us to cut other forms of taxation.
The Member States must also be able to maintain a protection from imports system that would make possible a national, health-promoting policy on alcohol.
Madam President, initially we denied that the problem existed.
Then gradually we moved from denying that the problem existed to playing down its importance; it varied depending on the country and the society concerned.
I think that this report now presents us with a more holistic approach.
I find the report positive overall, although it could certainly be improved.
The analysis is very comprehensive and good.
If we consider the five different levels - production, transport, marketing, consumption and consequences - we realise that as a society and as a legislator we are going to have to intervene in various different areas and sectors.
Where production is concerned, I think that we need to intervene much more decisively through development aid, which is a different field, but one that is entirely relevant here.
Because if we are not in a position to share of our own free will now, then we will certainly have to do so in the future.
As regards transport, marketing and the criminality associated with them are concerned, I think that this is where more effort needs to be made, and it is essential that this go hand in hand with tightening up the relevant measures on prevention and care.
Although this is not directly our responsibility, I do believe - indeed I am convinced - that this issue needs to be raised.
Consumption is generally presented as an individual problem.
But it is not just an individual problem; it is an issue not only for the individual, the family and their immediate circle, but also for the local community and society at large.
The consequences, as it states in detail in the analysis contained in the report, are also a public health problem.
It is then an issue for the whole of society and I believe that this phenomenon - which after being played down is now once again entering a new phase in which a holistic approach is being adopted - can only be tackled through dialogue and with the help and willingness of the entire community - the local community in particular - to provide care.
I hope that society's attitude gradually changes in this regard and that people become more willing to show greater commitment here, because that is what is required if we are to be successful in combating this scourge.
. Madam President, I very much appreciate Mrs Malliori's report and in particular the many wise remarks in her explanatory statement, which demonstrate a profound knowledge in this field and a positive attitude.
Let me first make it clear that prevention will always be our priority.
The scope of the recommendation is, however, focused on risk reduction.
This is not an alternative, but an important other element in the fight against drugs.
Most of the suggested amendments strengthen the recommendation.
I am pleased to say that the Commission agrees with 41 out of the 66 proposed amendments.
A number of those amendments overlap and redrafting may be necessary for other reasons.
Those involving financial commitments should be dealt with according to normal procedures.
I particularly welcome Amendments 12 and 24 suggesting the addition of risk reduction methods related to the use of new synthetic drugs such as ecstasy.
Strictly speaking, this might be regarded as on the periphery of the scope of this recommendation, as most users of these drugs are not actually addicted.
But the use of these drugs is on the increase.
Some users show a compulsive use pattern and they are frequently part of a network where drug use is very common.
As I have said, many of the suggested amendments can be supported, but time does not allow me to mention all of them.
There are 25 amendments that I cannot support, not necessarily because I disagree with the thrust of their content, but because they clearly fall outside the scope of this recommendation.
I have arranged for a list to be handed over to Parliament's secretariat for inclusion in the Minutes of this debate for greater clarity and precision.
Thank you, Commissioner Byrne.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at midday.
The next item is a report by Mrs Stihler (A5-0008/2003), on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the communication from the Commission on community and national measures in relation to breast implants [COM(2001) 666 - C5-0327/2002 - 2002/2171(COS)].
, rapporteur. Madam President, I wish to thank everyone who has contributed to this debate.
Throughout this process there has been a lot of consensus and, for a change, most colleagues agree that action needs to be taken.
That is why I accept all three amendments which have been tabled to this report.
How did we get to this stage?
Over eight years ago a woman called Margot Cameron attended a surgery held by my colleague, Mr Miller.
She said that nobody would listen to her.
Her story so inspired my colleague that a petition was lodged with the European Parliament which showed that Margot was not alone.
There are many Margots in the UK and across the EU with similar stories concerning problems with silicone.
The petition has led to the Commission reclassifying breast implants as a Class III product under the Medical Devices Directive 93/42/EEC.
Member States are to adopt and publish laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this directive no later than 1 August 2003.
If I am not mistaken, this is the first time that such a petition has led to direct action by the Commission.
I hope that more and more EU citizens will find solutions to their problems through this route.
However, much as Parliament welcomes the Commission's actions, we would like to take this matter still further.
As more women choose to have implants - whether for purely cosmetic reasons, reconstruction after breast cancer or breast deformities - we must ensure that people make informed choices and we must put patient safety first.
My report aims to answer both the legitimate concerns of thousands of women and the need to put patient safety first.
Therefore, the report recommends Member States to take measures to increase and improve information for patients through tracking and surveillance, quality control and assurance.
In this perspective, I particularly want to emphasise three main points. Firstly, the need for responsible advertising.
This includes all forms of direct advertising, such as in magazines and the use of 'before and after' pictures.
We must clamp down on this misleading advertising that is fuelling demand and which many women pin so much hope on.
Perhaps 'before and after' photographs of women who have suffered from ruptured implants would tell a very different side of the story to the readers of glossy magazines.
I would like to see the 18-year age limit applied - apart from where there is medical need - in order to protect young women from making ill-informed beauty choices.
Secondly, the need for information requires proper labelling and marketing, including health warnings explaining the health risks involved.
For instance, women should be aware that breast implants will have to be replaced after a time period.
It is a grave state of affairs that for too long cosmetic cowboys have got away with not explaining these simple facts.
It is for this reason that we require the creation of an international register of accredited plastic surgeons.
Finally, there must be responsible research.
Before breast implants are placed on the market, manufacturers must collect clinical data on the characteristics and performance of their product.
It also means that breast-implant producers need to trace their products.
Therefore, the creation of a national breast implant registration to keep women informed in the event of a product fault is vital.
This issue will not go away.
I hope that in the future more women will be able to make informed choices and they will not have to suffer in the way that so many women like Margot have in the past.
I hope that the Commission will be able to report back to Parliament on how far the Member States have gone in implementing this reclassification, and will continue to monitor the issue of silicone-gel breast implants, always putting patient safety first.
Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating Mrs Stihler and the members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy for their excellent work.
The same applies to the members of the Committees on Petitions and Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities who also played a part in the process.
The report reflects the policy consensus between the European Parliament and the Commission.
I am pleased to inform Parliament that, last week, the Commission adopted a directive reclassifying breast implants in the context of the legislation on medical devices.
Breast implants are now subject to the most stringent assessment procedures.
More precisely, breast implants have been reclassified from class IIB to class III.
It requires, in addition, clinical data and design attributes, namely on biocompatibility, physical and mechanical properties.
This will increase the level of safety of breast implants.
Furthermore, at the request of the Commission and the Member States, CEN, the European Standardisation Body, is proceeding to an in-depth review of the European standards on breast implants.
The Commission received encouraging information from Member States regarding national measures taken, or further developed, under the recommendations set out in our communication of November 2001.
This information will be made available to Parliament in a Commission staff working document on national measures adopted or planned to be adopted by Member States in relation to breast implants.
This paper will be finalised in the coming weeks.
The Commission believes that its communication and the production of the forthcoming working document have produced a significant effect.
All Member States have acted by verifying existing national policies and by starting to introduce measures as recommended by the communication.
Both documents will continue to be a useful element that interest groups and national authorities may use, at national level, to promote best practice and inspire further actions.
The excellent cooperation between Parliament and the Commission on this subject should be highlighted, since the overall result has been extremely positive.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thousands of women have petitioned Parliament to take a stand on the dangers inherent in the use of silicone breast implants.
Breast implants are subject to the standard quality and safety requirements for medical devices, being covered - as you also mentioned, Commissioner - by Directive 93/42/EEC.
It was lobbying from self-help groups of women suffering adverse effects from silicon-gel breast implants that prompted the Commission Communication.
Silicon implants were used for years before there was regulation or surveillance of their use.
The draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, my colleague, Mrs Ria Oomen-Ruijten, who unfortunately is unable to be here today, refers in particular to the need for open and transparent information about silicon implants.
Public health and healthcare issues are for the most part the competence of the Member States.
Together with Mrs Stihler, we now call on all of the Member States to introduce a national register including information about how medical aftercare is provided and how it is taken up.
Personal privacy must be protected.
Access to the registers will therefore have to be restricted and their contents treated as confidential.
Best practice will have to be publicised and then applied Europe-wide.
We need research and further development work to be carried out on safety and implant toleration.
Here the introduction of a passport for implant recipients and compulsory aftercare examinations might also be helpful for gathering data.
Accurate information must not be given in the form of advertising.
Advertising will increase demand for implants.
What is needed, however, is balanced information.
Doctors and nurses - both male and female - have a particular responsibility here to provide patients with objective, complete and scientifically up-to-date information in writing about all the details of their implants, such as the identification number, volume and type.
I should like to thank Mrs Stihler for her balanced report.
Ladies and gentlemen, in my view, breast implants are also an integral part of health.
They are needed to reconstruct breasts.
Aesthetic reasons do often play a role, but if someone thinks that they are inferior then it is their general health that suffers. With the help of implants their sense of well-being can be restored.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it was in 1998 that the Committee on Petitions received two petitions with a total of over 1 000 signatures, which, as Mrs Stihler has said, were those of women concerned about this issue or who had themselves suffered, and who asked Europe to consider the problems presented by breast implants, especially those made of silicon.
The Committee on Petitions, with its ear open to the public, reacted at that time by asking STOA to carry out an independent and intensive study of implants.
Following this, it organised a hearing that attracted wide media coverage, and, as rapporteur, I was entrusted with the task of drafting a resolution, which Parliament adopted unanimously on 13 June 2001.

It will therefore be evident that our vote today on a communication dealing with Community and national provisions on breast implants is a matter of twofold satisfaction to me; firstly, because it gives recognition to the action taken by the Committee on Petitions, which was the true initiator of this communication, and then because Mrs Stihler's excellent work takes up and gives added weight to almost all the proposals made in the June 2001 resolution, especially as regards advertising, the information required to be given to patients, the guarantee of the implants' high quality, research, the responsibilities placed not only on manufacturers, but also on surgeons and clinics, as well as the invitation extended to the Member States to maintain national registers and to make provision for a consent form.
My only regret is that the idea of issuing a passport to the patients was not retained in the initial report, and it is for that reason that I will be supporting Amendment No 3 to paragraph 10 (ii), resubmitted on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, which aims to reintroduce such a passport.
Although some may object that this is just one more piece of paper, I consider it an effective way to replenish the future European database.
Moreover, such a system would, above all, allow the patient to have real knowledge of the implant's specific characteristics.
Let me conclude by saying that I rejoice to be able to vote on this resolution, which itself demonstrates how well the Commission and our Parliamentary committees can work together to meet the expectations of Europe's citizens.
It demonstrates that the Committee on Petitions, which the public tends to use as a means of bringing to light the Community system's failings, can also play its part in developing creative and positive Community initiatives.
It is also a way in which we can show the petitioners that we do indeed honour our commitments.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Stihler, very much for her excellent report and for the remarkably good cooperation, also on behalf of my colleague, Mrs Ria Oomen-Ruijten, who cannot be here today for an important reason, namely an investiture ceremony in the Netherlands.
She sends her apologies.
Breast implants are covered by the directive on medical devices.
I am very pleased that the Commission - as Commissioner Byrne also explained earlier - has recently announced that it is reclassifying breast implants and is pressing for higher levels of safety for patients.
Broadly speaking, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats can support the Commission Communication and the report tabled by Mrs Stihler.
We have to face up to the following fact in Europe: every year 160 000 women in the European Union suffer from breast cancer.
It affects one in eight women.
In Germany alone, that means over 50 000 women every year.
Parliament is acutely aware of how topical and sensitive this issue is.
In the post-operative care of breast cancer patients, breast implants are often a decisive factor in increasing their quality of life.
Where breast abnormalities and surgical beauty treatments are concerned, the options available must also be explained and safety guaranteed.
We are therefore calling for a number of decisive measures to be taken, above and beyond the Commission's proposals. It is essential for a minimum age to be set for cosmetic breast operations.
These should not be carried out on young women under the age of 18. Operations for medical reasons would be exempt.
In addition, advertising for such implants that is directed at the general public should be banned along the lines of the French model.
It would then only be permitted to publish objective information in a non-commercial context.
It must be guaranteed that advice and information will be provided prior to the operation by a doctor specialising in plastic surgery.
We think it is vital for this meeting to take place at least four to six weeks before an appointment is agreed for the operation, so as to give the women concerned a cooling-off period to reflect on the objective and reliable information that they have received.
As in other areas, more emphasis needs to be given to providing patients with information.
Before the operation date is agreed, the women concerned should therefore also be given an information sheet.
It is important for this to be based on the content already developed by EQUAM.
It should contain both a warning about the potential health risks and also a clear appeal only to agree an operation date once all remaining questions are fully resolved.
This is also the point made in the amendment that I have tabled to paragraph 9 of the report.
Where silicon implants are concerned, we need high standards of safety and quality at international level.
For this reason, we need cross-border registration of breast implants to be made compulsory at international level.
In this context, the EU Member States should be advised to become members of the international breast implant register.
The scientific research carried out over the last few years has yielded some decisive findings in this field.
We therefore also think it is important to support this research and guarantee that the scientific work continues across Europe.
Overall the Commission Communication, together with the amendments proposed by Parliament, constitutes an important step in the right direction.
It is not a question of making it more difficult to use breast implants, for either medical or cosmetic reasons.
The aim of this initiative is to guarantee the highest levels of product safety, ensure that comprehensive information is provided and ultimately to increase the quality of life of the women concerned.
Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to thank Mrs Stihler very much for her excellent and, above all, important report.
Time and again, women complain about the damage suffered to their health following the use of breast implants or about operations that have had undesirable cosmetic results.
Incidentally, 80% of breast implant operations are carried out for purely cosmetic reasons.
The constant physical and emotional suffering caused by the implant operations is often immense.
As a rule this ought to be avoidable, as the cause is not the implants per se.
This has been confirmed in studies, and particularly impressively by the STOA study from the year 2000.
The causes are more usually the implants not being fitted by specialists, the device not being replaced automatically after a few years and the continuing lack of regular medical aftercare, not to mention the fact that women are still not fully informed about the potential risks, which vary from case to case, before the operation.
That is why there is an urgent need to impress on the Member States that they must finally ensure that women are fully informed before an operation of this kind and, above all, that they must stop a plethora of insufficiently qualified beauty surgeons from working by introducing additional qualification requirements and subjecting their clinics to more stringent inspections.
If we want to optimise quality assurance then this is the second step, now that we have already taken the first step, together with the Commission, of putting in place stricter product safety standards. I am thinking of the recent decision to reclassify breast implants as class 3 medical devices.
My group is also calling for an implant passport to be introduced, which would give information both about the characteristics of the implant and about the necessary post-operative care and would identify the surgeon.
The passport should be signed by the doctor and the patient before the operation as a clear declaration of consent.
In the light of the many complications that can arise after breast implant operations - which were brought to our attention not least by the petitions sent in by thousands of women in 1998 - I think it is quite frankly scandalous and completely incomprehensible that so far only one Member State has introduced a national implant register.
It will come as no surprise either then to learn that at the moment we do not have either precise figures on the implant operations carried out or complete scientific findings based on the adverse effects suffered by the women.
That is why it is of the utmost urgency to start setting up a national register for breast implants in all of the Member States immediately, and to join the international breast implant register.
In my view, this whole sorry tale also illustrates yet again why we urgently need multidisciplinary breast centres, in which benign and malignant diseases can be treated and beauty operations carried out under one roof, and where quality is guaranteed.
Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, every year, tens of thousands of women undergo surgery for the insertion of at least one breast implant.
In Belgium alone over the past ten years, over 4 000 prosthetic implants were inserted, with, in 1999, 313 women needing hospital in-patient treatment because of complications.
So there are at least three reasons to justify this action being taken at Community level: improving information for patients in certain cases; shedding the maximum possible light on the potential secondary effects of having a breast implant, in particular by means of research; and, of course, taking into account the petitions presented by citizens' groups, giving consideration to whether or not their request that silicon implants of this sort be subject to an immediate ban is well founded.
These three aspirations are set out clearly by Mrs Stihler, whom also I wish to congratulate, in her report, the broad outlines of which the Liberal Group endorses. I am thinking especially of the prohibition of advertising aimed directly at the public, and of the authorisation of prosthetic implants for young women under the age of 18, strictly and solely for medical reasons.
The Liberal Group does not, however, support all the measures advocated by this report, specifically mandatory entry in national registers, or Amendment No 3, which proposes the introduction of a passport for wearers of implants, which strike us as being like so many ideas which appear to be good but turn out to be misguided.
Over and above that, primarily, where the cost and feasibility of such interventions is concerned, should we be contemplating the imposition of requirements that go well beyond those in place for other equally invasive and extensive surgery?
I am thinking, for example, of heart surgery, the requirements imposed on which by the Commission are sufficiently restrictive.
In conclusion, Mr President, what women expect is clear answers to issues that frequently cause them anguish or even traumatise them, when raised in the event of an illness.
It is self-evident that what we owe them is the truth, and the truth is not about imposing a ban that risks simply sending these women across our European borders.
The Liberals therefore give their active support to Amendment No 2 tabled by the Group of the Party of European Socialists.
The truth is that women tempted to undergo this sort of operation which - as has been said - is becoming increasingly common, need to be informed and protected, and that is what we have tried to do.
Mr President, as Mrs Fourtou said very clearly, this resolution stems from the Committee on Petitions and is motivated by the petitions of thousands of women who attended a hearing in the course of one morning at which they expressed their concern and anxiety about the consequences that certain implants had had in terms of their health.
This gave rise to the STOA report, according to which there was apparently no evidence of a relationship between silicone implants and, for example, cancer.
There was, however, a clear indication of the various kinds of inconvenience caused to women who wanted, or felt obliged, to undergo implant operations.
I believe that Mrs Stihler's proposal acknowledges the suggestions, with which we too agree, that were put forward both in the study made of the STOA report, as well as elsewhere, and that, in general, ask for special measures to be adopted as a matter of urgency, one of the most important being an improvement in the independent information provided to women who wish to undergo implants.
It is also proposed that the information not come from the private clinics that are to carry out the implants; that the information be exhaustive; that there be a period of reflection so that the women concerned might consider the pros and cons of having the implants carried out; that prior consent be given; that there be follow-up and monitoring where the implants are concerned, as well as a basic investigation into the latter; and, above all, that the Member States subject all the clinics, especially the private ones, to rigorous controls.
In my own country, there was a case, which gave rise to a national debate, of a hairdresser's in the Canary Islands that had given implants to a large number of women without providing any medical guarantee.
The problem became public knowledge because one of the women who had been given implants had to have both her breasts removed.
I believe that this is an extreme case, and something which obviously does not usually happen, but it is vital that the Member States exercise rigorous control over all clinics and over all products that serve as implants, so improving the situation of those women who, for one reason or another, feel obliged to undergo implant operations.
Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mrs Stihler on an excellent report.
One of the key issues is the ban on the direct advertising of breast implants to the public.
The provision of non-commercial information through national public health services is the way forward.
France has already introduced a ban.
All Member States should do the same in relation to breast implants because they always involve certain risks.
The promotion of cosmetic surgery in general is a major problem.
Action should be taken to prevent situations whereby women and indeed men are coerced into unnecessary surgery which may involve particular risks.
It is true that there are, in many cases, health and psychological reasons for breast implants, but we need to be careful in that regard.
I agree with the rapporteur concerning the age limit.
Implants in women under the age of 18 should be authorised only on medical grounds.
Anyone under 18 years of age is extremely vulnerable and could be coerced into something they may regret in later years.
Advertising for cosmetic surgery should carry clear health warnings.
We need to focus more on promoting and securing acceptance of women as they are, rather than allowing the advertising industry to impose some sort of idea of beauty as the norm.
This applies not only to women but also to men.
If you look in the back of women's magazines you can see a huge number of adverts encouraging women to put extra things into some parts of their bodies, and to remove parts elsewhere.
The advertising industry has a huge amount to answer for.
There are cases where it is necessary on health grounds, but it also needs to be - as the rapporteur has said - very well tracked, and information must be made available to patients.
In terms of implants for purely cosmetic reasons, we need to look at what the advertising industry is doing in relation to coercing people into something that they may regret in later years.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate Mrs Stihler on her report.
As an oncological surgeon and university research scientist, I read the report very carefully and support many of the proposals it contains.
I feel, however, that the tone is excessively alarmist and I will tell you why.
For 50 years or so, silicones have been widely used in products for large-scale consumption such as drinks, puddings, cakes, drugs, paediatric materials, pacemakers, cardiac valves, lipsticks, creams and fabrics - and it has been proved that none of these cause cancer in humans.
For 40 years, silicone breast implants have been used throughout the world for both aesthetic reasons, as in the case of serious psychological problems, and for reconstruction, as in the case of mastectomies carried out to remove breast cancer where there are no age restrictions.
In 1986, the University of Los Angeles examined 3000 women who had had implants for at least six years and found no risk of increasing neoplasia or to mobility.
In 1992, the University of Calgary, examining 11 000 women, reached the same conclusions.
The American Association of Rheumatologists also promoted two studies on the risk of autoimmune pathology in women with silicone implants, which recorded good tolerance in all cases.
It was discovered that the average life of implants is between 15 and 25 years and spontaneous rupture is often asymptomatic.
There are therefore no sufficiently serious grounds for preventing the use of implants, except in young women less than 18 years old.
I must point out that the report makes no reference to breast implants inserted as preventive treatment in cases where the results of predictive genetic tests have shown a high risk of carcinogenesis in patients, tests carried out particularly on the children of mothers who have suffered from cancer, which is a practice which will become increasingly widespread.
As regards paragraph 10a, I would like to point out that patient consent forms are already in use in all the States of the Union.
It is compulsory for the patient to sign a form after receiving all the necessary information, before any treatment is applied, including implants.
I therefore feel it superfluous to mention a passport.
I also feel it would be useful to set up European and national registers containing data collected on both aesthetic and therapeutic breast implants.
Furthermore, it is important for an annual check to be carried out by a breast specialist and a free echography performed, without the need for invasive examinations such as mammographies or CAT scans , which still subject patients to radiation and are practices which are on the expensive side for national health services.
The collection of data on implants and regulated follow-up would contribute to the production of a valid survey allowing a more precise assessment to be carried out, which would certainly be reassuring for all women.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with a few exceptions, including the last speaker - perhaps the fact that he is a man has something to do with it - there is significant consensus among the political groups on this subject.
It is for good reason that it is mainly women who are speaking here.
I do not think that this has anything to do with personal experience but rather with the fact that we do, after all, feel a close bond with the thousands of women who submitted the petition to Parliament.
It was not that we woke up one morning and said: we must regulate this.
The question came from grass roots level and on this basis we have already spent a long time working on creating a good Community framework.
I would also like to thank Mrs Stihler very much for her excellent report, and also the Commissioner who I hope will soon present the report from the Member States, as he promised a moment ago.
I hope that he will also work hard on following up what we recommend today.
Without wanting to repeat what has already been said, I would just briefly like to ask what is particularly important, and what our starting points are.
Our main aim is to see patients protected.
We do not want to patronise them; we want to protect them.
That is crucial.
We do not want a ban; a woman must be able to decide for herself in good faith whether she wants breast implants or not.
What we do want is to ensure that she is properly informed and that she knows what the disadvantages and potential dangers of a breast implant are.
We want to guarantee that.
That is why we have such a problem with advertising.
This is not the same as selling a coffee machine; this is about a medical intervention.
We do not want women to be persuaded to change their breasts on the basis of misleading advertising.
Why is compulsory registration so important?
In Europe we know too little about breast implants, we know too little about the dangers, we know too little about where these women are and what the consequences are.
That is why proper registration is essential.
Finally, protecting the patient.
Yes, protecting young people, yes, making sure that they are given time to think things over.
Mr President, people who have to do without a part of their body as a result of an accident or an operation are generally happy that these days there are ways of restoring their lost functions.
In cases in which they cannot be restored, they at least want to make sure that the external damage caused is made as invisible as possible.
This naturally also applies to women who have had an operation as a result of breast cancer.
They thought it was a good solution to replace the lost part of their bodies with an artificial substitute that has the same suppleness as the original living material.
These days there are disappointed women who find that they have been poisoned after such treatment.
These are the people who are warning against this happening again and are pleading for a ban.
The new material generally lasts only a few years; after that the silicone may leak or escape into the body.
Those affected by this may have been beautiful for a short time but are ill for a long time afterwards.
A positive point in the rapporteur's proposal is to prohibit advertising for this solution and to improve advice on the negative consequences and on alternatives.
It may be possible to live with silicone breasts if they are periodically replaced with new material.
This approach takes better account of women who are in danger of psychological problems following an operation than does an outright ban, and prevents these treatments from being performed illegally without proper information.
A possible advantage is still the fact that gullible women who are not able to check out the dangers and who retain old replacement material in their bodies because they cannot afford or are afraid of repeated operations will continue to get into difficulties in the future.
I agree with Mrs McKenna that if it is not possible to severely restrict these practices, a ban may soon be unavoidable.
Mr President, I also wish to thank the Commission for this proposal and to congratulate Mrs Stihler on an excellent report on a very important subject.
It is an area that touches upon many aspects of health and consumer policy.
Thousands of women who have had problems have contacted the European Parliament and want us to express an opinion on the dangers associated with silicone breast implants.
This shows that those who carry out these operations are not always reliable and that there is an extreme lack of information.
The image, often presented in advertisements, of how young women should look - all slim waists and large breasts - means that there is a considerable increase in the number of breast implants carried out on very young women.
The weekly magazines fuel this trend by showing 'before and after' pictures.
It is therefore high time that, as responsible politicians, we protected patients by beginning to bring some order to this very confused area.
I completely agree with Mrs Stihler that this is only a step in that direction.
I believe that many more binding commitments are required on the part of those who carry out these implants.
What I think is the most important part of the proposal is the '18 years' old' limit whereby non-medical implants are to be prohibited in the case of girls under 18 years of age.
The proposal that surgeons and clinics must issue guarantees is also important.
Unlike my colleagues, I think that registration at both national and EU levels is justified.
When there is insufficient research, a register is needed.
I am very satisfied with the report.
We, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, fully support the report and the amendments tabled.
Mr President, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur and all colleagues who have worked on this report for keeping this issue in the spotlight.
The rapporteur told you a story about a woman called Margot Cameron who came to see me eight years ago.
She wandered in, nobody would listen to her, and we sat down and looked at the problem she had and started campaigning.
It is a success story, because here we are today looking at legislation that we are putting through this Parliament, which is great.
I would like to tell you another story, which does not have such a happy ending.
As I have said, this all happened eight years ago when Margot Cameron came to see me.
We started campaigning and raised the issue at national level and finally took it to European level.
