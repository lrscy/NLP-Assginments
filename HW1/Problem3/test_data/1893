Mr President, the solemn calls for budgetary rigour and discipline entail devastating constraints when it comes to development aid.
The promises remain, but there is a difficulty in getting actions to follow. That, in the end, is the thought inspired in me by this 2004 budget on development cooperation.
I agree, on this matter, with our rapporteur, Mrs Sanders-Ten Holte, that any subordination to the external actions heading cannot but accentuate this phenomenon.
Indeed, how is one to believe that the objective of eradicating poverty between now and 2015 will be achieved when - and this is only one example - the financial commitments to the Middle Eastern, Latin American, Asian and ACP countries that are the concern of the OECD's Development Assistance Committee have not been honoured by the Commission, particularly when it comes to the health and education sectors?
One is permitted to have doubts.
The sums allocated still offer very little basis for fulfilling the declared wish of achieving the millennium objectives.
How can approval not be given to any demand made of the Commission to give attention also to the rights of the most vulnerable people and to provide for a specific budgetary line when necessary? I am thinking, for example, of the rights of children.
Any reduction in, or financial pressure upon, the fundamental elements of Community policy, such as human rights or the duty to give assistance to those who are weakest, would have the effect of sending out a very negative signal indeed to peoples already largely excluded from the march of world progress - victims, no more nor less, of a globalisation that has more in common with the law of the jungle than with growth and the equitable distribution of wealth.
Developing countries are waiting for the European Union's ambitions to change, a fact witnessed to, I think, by the reactions at the last WTO conference in CancÃºn.
As a final word on the subject of development aid, I remain convinced that, without a serious review of the financial perspectives, the pressure upon this heading will become unbearable.
As for the proposals concerning reconstruction in Iraq, they also call, at any rate in the long term, for an increase in overall resources to avoid the need to draw on the reduced sums for development aid.
That being said, I agree with Mr Poos: the announcement of such a financial commitment cannot in any case precede Europe's indispensable adoption of an independent policy in favour of the sovereignty of the Iraqi people and of the role of the UN.
Regarding the amendments, I approve of those that could favour an annual evaluation of the results and anticipate a joint dialogue between the Commission, Parliament and the Council on the methods to be put in place in order to achieve the objectives.
In the same spirit and in the interests of genuinely democratic and effective development cooperation, I am in favour of encouraging the widest participation, at all levels, of all those active in civil society.
Finally, I am going to support my group's proposal aimed at creating a specific line of aid for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of the territories under the administration of the Palestinian Authority.
The Israeli army's destruction, to the tune of almost EUR 40 million, of the infrastructure funded by the EU or the Member States was the product of criminal fury.
The Palestinian population's conditions of life have deteriorated considerably during the most recent period.
We know that the Commission's delegation on the ground is doing a remarkable job in difficult conditions. If, however, the EU is to be an active member of the quartet in the manner suggested by the speeches, the EU would do well to accord its budgetary lines as it intends.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Schreyer, Mr Fischler, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by welcoming the fact that we are holding this new budgetary debate, which has already shown itself to be a useful and profitable experience for the Commission and Parliament.
It is a good opportunity which we Members of the European Parliament are grateful for and take a very positive view of.
From a general point of view, this is the year in which we should avoid the conflict between national and Community interests.
The principles of budgetary austerity in national budgets, which are at the root of the Stability Pact, must be reconciled more than ever with the complete implementation of the Community policies contained in the objectives of the Community budget.
It is perhaps we, as Members of the European Parliament, who have the greatest interest in the Stability Pact being complied with and respected.
Compliance with it must not be an excuse to interfere in the development of the great areas of expenditure of the Union's budget, but it must be another incentive to improve its implementation.
Providing our budget with sufficient payment appropriations does not mean failing to comply with the austerity objectives, but to help the European Union's growth by means of its policies.
Otherwise we would be preventing the correct absorption of the leftovers or hindering the efficient implementation of the structural policies.
The Union's best budgetary policy is not one that allows for a high budgetary expenditure, but one which implements the commitments in the Budget well.
We would therefore like to ask the Commissioner whether she agrees with this approach and whether the Commission believes that the level of payment appropriations in the Council's draft budget is sufficient.
On the other hand, our group has no particular reasons to disagree with the Council on this Budget.
We would like, and this will be agreed in the sectoral debate, to go further into certain questions of agricultural or internal policy.
In external policy we are still seeking a more active role for the Union in the world, because that is also part of the programmed objectives of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.
This must be seen not only in relation to the strengthening of the common foreign and security policy - both its objectives and its budgetary appropriations - but to particular reconstruction actions in Iraq and Afghanistan, as part of the European Union's moral commitment to promote peace, security and human rights.
We would therefore like to know, Commissioner, whether there is really sufficient room in the budget to be able to take account of the approach taken by the PPE by means of its amendment.
Mr President, firstly, from a conceptual point of view, we legitimately wish the new nomenclature for the Budget to be a technical instrument which rationalises it, and not a cunning way to modify the political orientations of Community action.
The Committee on Development and Cooperation is therefore, under the heading 'Development', restoring the cooperation lines with Asia and Latin America, which had been diverted to the external relations heading.
Development policy is not only directed towards the ACP countries, but towards all developing countries with a view to eradicating poverty.
Furthermore, Commissioner, we thank you and we congratulate and support you, as well as Mr Nielson, in relation to the budgeting of the EDF.
Secondly, our policy for assisting certain groups such as the Saharan people, who for years have been objectively in a situation of humanitarian need, should not be called into question for administrative reasons.
And finally, the integration of the gender perspective into the Budget is one of our objectives.
With regard to the figures, our priorities are the funding of actions to promote children's rights, funds for combating AIDS and malaria, increasing funds for Latin America and the Mediterranean: between the 2000 Budget and the draft 2004 Budget the funds intended for cooperation with these regions have plummeted; they have been reduced by 10.8% for Latin America (EUR 37.2 million) and 16% for MEDA in real terms (EUR 193.9 million), despite the new priorities for these two regions and the summit which is going to take place.
Their reflection in the Budget should not conflict with the ceiling corresponding to us, provided that there is no intention to fund any other new action or initiative through development funds.
And it is for this reason that we are also concerned about the reconstruction of Iraq or any other issue which may arise.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to say something about some of this Budget's foreign policy aspects and will start by responding to Mr Poos, who said that the amendment tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is unacceptable in terms of the amount that it proposes for Iraq, as a UN mandate is required.
Mr Poos has evidently not read this amendment, which takes as its reference value the resolution that this House will be adopting tomorrow, it being a minimum precondition for the European Union's involvement in Iraq that there should be a UN resolution, that the money should be put in a trust fund controlled by the World Bank and the United Nations, that the Iraqi people should be involved in the processes of democratisation, in the adoption of a constitution and of the establishment of institutions, all of which are now needed, and, above all, that the oil industry should be placed in the hands of the United Nations, in order that it may be a source of funding for the country's reconstruction.
The budget allocation we have proposed is dependent on that condition, and, even if we are talking in terms of one single euro rather than five hundred million of them, it matters that we should get this general concept and these framework conditions right.
From that point of view, the Budget today and Parliament's resolution tomorrow must be seen as very closely interconnected.
Secondly, if this leads us to say that we want to get the United Nations more involved, then we must give more attention to it and to our relations with it overall - and that is what Parliament and the Commission are currently working on.
I believe it is tomorrow that the Italian Presidency of the Council is signing, in New York, an agreement on crisis management and crisis prevention, but this needs to be mentioned in the Budget.
At present, our programmes for the United Nations are all shared out between a whole load of items in the Budget, without there having been a policy debate to set priorities.
As an issue in this House, the subject of the United Nations has been dormant in recent years, and the Commission's new document gives hope that we will now be defining our relationship with the UN in more political terms, even though the Commission has achieved the masterly feat of producing a document of nearly fifty pages that refers not even once to Parliament and the budgetary authority.
I think that any redefinition will also necessitate dialogue between the Commission and Parliament.
Now for a third comment, addressed to the Council.
As we do in every Budget procedure, we have put a number of Budget lines in reserve, as the Council still refuses to provide the information agreed on in the November 2002 agreement between Parliament, the Council and the Commission.
This sometimes seems as if we are battering our heads against the Kremlin wall in the way we used to do.
We are sure that we will overcome this obstacle and come to an agreement with the Council that will guarantee the public and Parliament greater transparency in future concerning what is going on in the common foreign and security policy.
Mr President, firstly, and as a Member of the Committee on Budgets, I would like to thank the two rapporteurs, Mrs Gill and Mr Mulder, who are present at the moment, and the President of the committee, Mr Wynn, for the work being done at the moment in that committee, which we hope will have a favourable and happy outcome in December.
I would like to refer to the agriculture chapter, and I would also like to thank Mr Fischler for being here and say to him that, despite the lack of success in CancÃºn, I am particularly grateful for his defence during these meetings of the interests of European farmers and breeders, of all Europeans and of the whole commercial world.
The amendments proposed to the agriculture chapter are aimed above all, in my view, to the promotion and quality of European products.
It is important to bear in mind the amendments I have presented, because one of our fundamental tasks is to protect and defend European products, because their production involves stricter methods with regard to quality and respect for the environment.
We must also promote information in relation to the common agricultural policy.
At this moment, when the whole of the common agricultural policy is being changed, it is important that the citizens know what this policy is and, above all, the opportunities it represents for European agriculture and livestock.
I have placed particular emphasis on the introduction of agricultural insurance systems and I would like this to take place and for it to be reflected in the 2004 Budget.
Finally, I would like to refer to the restoration of funds for the 'Forest Focus', for the prevention and combating of fires, because, as we have seen this summer, the absence of prevention and combating of forest fires may lead us into very dramatic environmental situations.
. (DE) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, honourable Members, I do not propose to discuss agricultural policy, as much more has been said - by Mr Poos, Mr Laschet, and Mr Salafranca - on the subject of Iraq.
I am glad to see consensus on the need for the conditions to be met.
Aid, including that given by the European Union, must be provided under the aegis of the United Nations.
The Trust Fund must not be confused with the fund administering the yields from oil deposits, but must be separate from it.
I also believe that we can also achieve consensus on other points relating to the conditions.
The EUR 200 million proposed by the Commission would also express well our sense of obligation, our awareness of the need for us to take on responsibility, and our willingness to do so together on the basis of the EU Budget.
It is also very important that this aid for Iraq should be seen in relation to the shared commitments that we have made in other areas.
Let me reiterate that EUR 214 million have been allocated to Afghanistan for next year, thus discharging in full the obligations into which we entered at the donors' conference in Tokyo.
I would also like to again lay stress upon the fact that we are allocating, next year, EUR 250 million as additional aid for Turkey, Iraq's neighbour, with 65 million inhabitants, and that must also, of course, be seen in its context.
Next week - on 1 October - we will have the opportunity to debate this in a joint meeting of the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, when the Commission will be putting forward a proposal that the margin and also part of the flexibility reserve be used for Iraq, and will be submitting an amending budget.
Mrs Figueiredo asked about the Forest Focus programme.
For this we have allocated the same amount as this year.
Both the Regional Development Fund and the Structural Funds can be used for reforestation measures and also for measures to prevent natural disasters.
The question has been raised as to whether cohesion policy can be pursued at all successfully using a European Budget amounting to some 0.99 per cent of the Community's economic product.
The answer to that is in the affirmative.
The European Budget and its effects demonstrate that our support for cohesion policy is yielding fruit.
Last week, I presented what we are calling the 'allocation report', which shows who is paying what and where the money goes.
The four cohesion countries are the four net recipients from the EU's Budget, which is only right and proper.
The two poorest countries receive the most funds expressed as a percentage of their gross national product, and the cohesion reports do indeed show how successful that is, and that the European Union is successful in its efforts to reduce the economic gaps between one country and another.
Mrs Buitenweg addressed the issue of the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organisation.
This year, these funds - which, by the way, your House had blocked - will be reallocated to other purposes, whilst this breach of the agreement means that we have allocated no funds in the preliminary draft Budget for next year.
North Korea is not, unfortunately, offering to abandon its atomic programme and to invest instead in renewable forms of energy.
This is also relevant to Mr Dell'Alba's question on the human rights clause.
Countries such as North Korea, in which humanitarian emergencies exist at the same time as human rights are being abused, always put us in a very difficult position.
Indeed, the Commission had also decided to step up humanitarian aid for North Korea, concentrating this aid on mothers, who are worst affected by the terrible conditions in that country.
The Commission did of course bear in mind administrations' capacity for implementing them when making its proposals relating to Latin America, but we will of course look at Parliament's various proposals as well.
Next, Mr Garriga Polledo asked whether the means of payment cut by the Council are still adequate.
As it usually does in October, the Commission will shortly be proposing a revision of the agricultural policy, with new assessments of market developments and taking due account of the exchange rate.
We will also be submitting an estimate relating to the old Structural Funds programmes, but I can tell you even now that the Commission cannot accept that the means of payment for pre-accession aid should be cut back.
Next year, although the candidate countries will be Member States, they will still be getting help with their pre-accession programmes, as these will still be in progress.
It is fortunate that the pre-accession programmes are now at last being better implemented, and this of course means that we need the means to pay for them.
We would be very glad if Parliament and the Council together were to restore the former amounts.
Mr President, before discussing the budget, I would like to convey our good wishes to our Commissioner, Mr Fischler, on his birthday today.
We are particularly pleased that he is here for the budget, but also that he is celebrating his birthday with us.
We appreciate that very much.
This is not the only support I am giving this Commissioner, as my words will also be critical of the Council and will contain support for the Commission's policy.
For the sake of clarity, much has changed in the budgetary system.
Amongst other things, pre-accession aid for the new members has been added to the agricultural budget.
What is particularly striking, though, is that the Council has cut the Commission's original preliminary draft of the budget right down to the bone.
For a start, a distinction has again been drawn between the old or existing Member States and the new Member States.
The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development regrets that.
A linear reduction has also been made, however, which amounts to a considerable sum in many cases.
A linear reduction has been implemented ruthlessly in budget amounts of more than a billion in particular.
I would like to say this to the Council: you must realise that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development stands four square behind the Commission.
It wants the approbations included in the preliminary draft of the budget reinstated.
I can understand that the general rapporteur, Mr Mulder, wanted to submit a block amendment that includes this.
This is also urged in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development's report.
It would be a good thing if the Council were to realise this, particularly given the fact that next year will be a difficult year; a complete review of our agricultural policy and the accession of new Member States.
The Council must therefore realise that it is essential that the Commission be given sufficient financial leeway to implement this policy.
I would like to mention some of the various items.
It is true that we are aiming for a more market-compliant policy, but at the same time the Council wants to make too many cutbacks, which the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development considers unacceptable.
To begin with the school market programme; we propose earmarking an additional 10.3 million for this.
We also refer to the support for young farmers and for future-oriented and innovative projects.
I am referring to the LEADER programme and the SAPARD programme.
If it were up to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, there would be an extra 144 million.
The same applies to promotion, control and prevention.
With regard to the latter point, I would like to say that we must not allow more cutbacks on the veterinary funds and the emergency funds for animal diseases to be made.
We want 30 million extra for these two items.
Mr President, a number of amendments to the budget were adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
A main objective was to restore or increase the budgets of the agencies on which we rely to carry out statutory and other tasks set by Parliament, namely those of the European Medicines Evaluation Agency, the European Environment Agency and the fledgling European Food Safety Authority.
New tasks are continually being delegated to these agencies and it is vital that they are adequately resourced.
Secondly, once again we expose the hypocrisy of a European Union that pays lip-service to health promotion by combating smoking-related diseases but continues to pour EUR 1 billion per annum into subsidising the production of low-quality tobacco, much of which is exported to developing countries.
How can this be justified?
Lastly I turn to CAP reform.
European Union and US farmers are subsidy junkies and although the agreement does not spell an end to this transatlantic addiction, it may be a step in the right direction.
We applaud moves from direct aid to aid linked to environmental objectives, but we know very well that many environmental directives are not being complied with.
For example, the Nitrates Directive, despite being 13 years old, is only being complied with in two Member States.
Does Commissioner Fischler foresee individual farmers, regions or Member States having their cheques cut back because of this non-compliance?
Are we only paying lip-service to a link between the CAP and a cleaner, better environment?
. (DE) Mr President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, as Mr Maat has already mentioned - amendments adopted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development are restoring the estimates for various Budget lines under heading 1a to the levels envisaged by the preliminary draft Budget.
Although the Commission welcomes these amendments, I would like to remind you that, at the end of October, the Commission will be approving a letter of amendment to the preliminary draft Budget in respect of the European Agriculture Guidance and Guarantee Fund, in order to update the resources required.
It would certainly be premature to give precise figures for the amendments that we will be proposing, but I am already able to tell you something about the important factors that make these changes necessary.
These include, first, the depreciation of the US dollar against the euro, which has had consequent effects on certain export refunds or on aid; then, the decision to grant, as early as 2003 - that is to say, in the Budget year 2003 - certain advances against animal premiums for those regions that suffered particularly from the summer drought; and, finally, an agreement on the reform of the common agricultural policy, which, however, is expected to have little effect on the Budget for 2004.
Let me now return to the amendments that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development adopted.
The amendment relating to subheading 1b on rural development increases the estimates to such an extent that they would exceed the upper limit in the Financial Perspective by some EUR 100 million.
Whilst the Commission shares your view that there is an absolute need to strengthen the second pillar - after all, this is also the general tendency of the modulation agreed on as part of the reform of the common agricultural policy, and, moreover, funds will be reallocated from subheading 1a to subheading 1b with effect from 2006 - you will understand that, where the 2004 Budget is concerned, the Commission is unable to go beyond the upper limit in the Financial Perspective.
Turning to SAPARD and to the introduction of a new Budget line for the funding of a sort of 'Leader East', I would like to say that, in the short time available, I see it as neither feasible nor desirable to provide, in the 2004 Budget, for 'Leader'-type measures in a new preparatory instrument.
We are, however, currently examining how SAPARD's basic rules can be altered in such a way as to do justice to your concerns.
Finally, I would like to discuss some of the priorities set by the general rapporteur.
Firstly, the resolution on the Budget for 2004 states that funds are to be made available for the further development of opportunities for the use of environmental indicators.
In this context, the rapporteur demands that a study be drawn up on how these indicators are worked out.
I take a favourable view of this.
The second point has to do with the implementation of a preparatory measure to promote the introduction of insurance schemes to cover economic losses resulting from epizootics.
As the Commission is very much in favour of a public debate on this issue, to involve all the stakeholders, we are planning for next year a series of consultations and seminars, which will involve all the services and parties affected.
As regards the development of marker vaccines and discriminatory tests for pathogens such as those causing foot and mouth disease or classical swine fever, let me say on behalf of my fellow-Commissioner Mr Byrne, that the Commission is working on a directive in this area, which is to create the legal basis for funding to be made available for the development of standard serums.
Once the Commission has approved this directive, there will be an invitation to tender for the manufacture of these standard serums.
After evaluation, a decision will then be taken on the manufacture of other serums and the funding that this will require.
Turning to the proposal for the examination of systems for the quality assurance and certification of what is termed integrated supply chain management, I am able to assure Mr Mulder that the Commission is in favour of budgeting half a million euros for the purpose of funding new studies and a conference.
I would also like to respond to the accusation that we are continuing to fund the tobacco sector.
Let me draw your attention to the fact that the Commission has today decided that we will carry out a reform of the tobacco sector, which will result in these financial resources being completely decoupled.
As regards non-compliance, in certain situations, with the nitrates directive, let me point out to you that the Commission has for some time already been taking legal action on this, but this is primarily to do with the way in which the Member States have only partly complied with the requirements of the nitrates directive and have therefore not implemented it.
It follows that this cannot be laid at the door of individual farmers.
I would, finally, like to point out to you that the Council has reduced the number of posts for expenditure connected with enlargement.
As you will all be aware, the common agricultural policy will be applicable in the new Member States from the day of their accession, with nothing left out.
This makes it absolutely necessary that the Commission should have enough in the way of personnel resources to be able to effectively implement the common agricultural policy.
Let me turn now - very briefly - to fisheries and to the report by Mrs Langenhagen, Mr Mulder and Mr FÃ€rm, the motion for a resolution in which I can very largely endorse, so that I would now like simply to pick up on only a few of its aspects.
As long ago as March, when we had the resolution on the white fish sector, Parliament called on the budgetary authority to draw up a plan for allocating EUR 150 million to compensate for the losses sustained by coastal communities as a consequence of the crisis in white fish stocks.
On several occasions, I asked the Member States to tell us how much additional funding they required.
With the exception of the United Kingdom and Denmark, though, not one Member State reported itself to be in any need.
The Commission is therefore unable to put before Parliament any proposal for additional funds.
The same is true of the attempt to have scrapping funds funded to the tune of an additional EUR 32 million.
That, too, proved unsuccessful, as the Member States did not provide the necessary data.
Mr FÃ€rm asked why funds could not be reallocated to provide the EUR 32 million, and so I would like to remind him that there is no longer any margin in heading 2, quite apart from which, all funding commitments were finalised right at the beginning of the programme planning period in the national and regional programme planning documents for all four of the Structural Funds.
There can therefore be no reallocation before next year's mid-term review.
I can confirm that we will, in the coming weeks, be submitting a proposal on the Regional Advisory Councils.
I agree with the statement in Mrs Langenhagen's report that fisheries agreements should be endowed with appropriate funding and that their budgets should be as transparent as possible.
On fisheries inspections, I am able to inform you that we will, in the weeks to come, propose that the current Regulation on the Member States' expenditure on inspection work be extended to run until 2005, and provision is made for this in the draft of the 2004 Budget.
Mr President, Commissioner, we Socialists welcome Mr Maat's report, on which I would like to make the following comments.
As young people's health is always of very great importance to us, we should be building up the school milk programme, rather than virtually freezing its current funding in the way that the Council has decided.
Existing funds will not be enough for ten new Member States, and adequate funding for rural areas and their development, along with assuring the quality of food production, are equally indispensable.
This is another area in which money must flow, and it is also important that it should be possible to move from measures to regulate the market to support for rural areas, which, at present a fragile sapling, may thus be enabled to put down strong roots and to flourish.
As rapporteur of the temporary committee on foot and mouth disease, I can see that the enlargement of the European Union means that there must be significantly more investment in the prevention of epizootics.
I am glad to hear Commissioner Fischler tell Mr Byrne that more money should find its way into research, as a calamity such as the one we have witnessed in Great Britain must not be allowed to happen again.
What I would say in general terms to the Council is that trimming budgets as if you were mowing the lawn serves no useful purpose whatever, for the agricultural budget is not a quarry to be worked for the benefit of this or that other project.
The right road ahead does not go by way of across-the-board cuts, and this House wants what was provided for in the Convention's draft constitution - full powers of codecision and the abolition of the clear-cut dividing line between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure.
You can be certain that expert decision-making in both the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the Committee on Budgets would then be guaranteed beyond doubt.
Thank you for your attention.
Mr President, Commissioner Schreyer, Commissioner Fischler, I want to focus on rural development.
By topping up the funds for this area, the committee has made it clear that it is to this that we attach a higher value and that the cutting back of the market organisations demands that there should be compensation for farms that take themselves to market.
We note with concern the evidence that the groups - and, so one gathers, the Commission - are discussing how to use long-term financial planning as a means of trimming this area rather than extending it, or the possibility of putting it under the Structural Funds.
Commissioner Fischler, I see the fact that there is now a structural line devoted to 'rural areas' as a great triumph on your part.
It would be fatal if the forces that want to put things back the way they were were to prevail, as the Structural Funds criteria for rural areas are not very favourable.
When expressing your view of the 'Leader East' issue, you pointed out that you wanted to adjust the SAPARD programme accordingly.
We have had this discussion before.
I hear what you say, but I lack the faith to believe that the administration will actually put it into practice and that a sensible practice will be the result.
A 'Leader East' programme should therefore be set up for Bulgaria and Romania, in order to involve the ordinary population in the development of rural areas.
Let me conclude by saying that it was also with great disquiet that we heard - as we shall shortly do in the committee, when you will give us your comments - that the offer was made to make the Green Box a subject for negotiation.
Such a development we really would regard as crazy.
If something that is necessary from the point of view of rural development is now to be seen as a subsidy currently laid off and liable to be cut back, then we should discuss that in this House and make our position clear in the next round at the WTO.
Mr President, the common agricultural policy remains the single biggest item of expenditure in the Community budget.
Along with most colleagues, I welcome the fact that a series of reforms under the current and past Commissioners have brought agricultural expenditure under control.
It is also welcome that the Council agreement in Brussels in October 2002 brought stability and predictability to farmer spending up to 2013.
Furthermore, the most recent Luxembourg agreement on CAP reform ensures that payments will shift away from trade-distorting subsidies to payments based on services to society provided by our farmers in areas such as the environment, food safety and animal welfare.
I strongly support this trend.
I also strongly support the need to maintain export refunds as a crucial stabilising tool within the budget.
The amount of money given has been a decreasing portion of farmer spending over the past number of years.
Nevertheless, this will remain an essential mechanism for assisting heavily export-dependent sectors to maintain a position in export markets in periods when prices are plunging and markets are uncertain.
In conclusion, I welcome the statement from Commissioner Fischler on the proposal to decouple aid for tobacco producers, which will hopefully lead to a reduction in the production of this health-damaging crop.
Mr President, Commissioners, comrades, ladies and gentlemen, in the areas of environmental protection, consumer protection and health, we keep on, at European level, we keep on attempting to tackle very ambitious projects that are intended to improve the public's quality of life in every area: environmental action programmes, action programmes in the field of public health, consumer protection strategies, strategies for the environment and health, and so on and so forth. But what about the resources that are needed if we are to be able to successfully bring these projects to fruition?
This is where the Commission's preliminary draft Budget is rather timid, characterised by willing submission to the Council's mania for indiscriminate austerity measures.
How else is one to imagine the genesis of this PDB, which the Council or - to put it a better way, the functionaries in COREPER - have tightened up?
That, let me add, for a year in which the Budget is to be drawn up not for fifteen Member States, but for twenty-five, for which it must be adequate.
That, though, is the Council with which we are familiar, ceremoniously signing treaties, but refusing to put its name to the budget appropriations for them.
Just do not let the Commission get into the same way of doing things.
We know that the ten new Member States' institutions are in need of a great deal of reconstruction where the protection of the environment, consumer policy and health care are concerned; these are areas in which, despite the funds made available under the pre-accession strategy, they have as yet achieved nothing of any substance.
Not only have we learned that from the Consumers International report, but the Court of Auditors has also enjoined us to take good note of it.
Of course we want 'greening of the budget', consumer protection as a mainstreaming principle in all European policies, and awareness at every level of Europe, but, to do that, we need operational resources and resources in terms of personnel, and these have to be made available.
That will not be done only by pithy strategies or action programmes written down on paper - which, of course, does not blush!
Mr President, Mrs Langenhagen, the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Fisheries, has clearly communicated the concerns of this committee with regard to the draft Budget for 2004.
In the view of the Socialists, and in my view as their spokesman, three of the issues of the many which the rapporteur indicates in her report are the most prominent and my group fully agrees with them.
The first relates to the socio-economic crisis in the white fish sector, which results from the recovery plans for a series of species including hake and cod and to which we must now also add halibut in the fishing grounds of the NAFO.
We agree with the sum of EUR 150 million proposed by the rapporteur.
The second, ladies and gentlemen, relates to the scrapping fund, for which the Committee on Fisheries proposes a sum of EUR 32 million.
I would like to say to the Commissioner that he, as Commissioner, and the Commission itself, has promoted a reform of the CFP of a highly destructive nature, scrapping fleets, and that the Commissioner for budgets should perhaps tell us now how much additional funding is going to be allocated by the Commission to pay for this policy of scrapping.
The third issue I would like to focus on is the fisheries agreements.
The new ones: Tanzania, Kenya, Libya, etc. for which additional funds will be needed, and the old ones, for which the Committee on Fisheries maintains its former demand that the part corresponding to compensation for fishing opportunities be separated in this budget line from the part corresponding to development cooperation with third countries.
. (DE) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, honourable Members, I do not want now to repeat all the things I said in my speech earlier, but just to deal with a number of the issues that have been raised.
For a start, I believe that we are, in principle, in entire agreement where the issue of rural development is concerned, but we must, on the other hand, all abide by the boundaries set by the Financial Perspective.
As regards what Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf rightly described as a long drawn-out debate on additional measures in connection with a sort of 'Leader East', I do not know if I can now, so to speak, convert him, as he has said he lacks the faith, but I am quite serious in saying ?
... that we will rearrange the basic regulation in such a way as to do justice to your concern.
Taking up your suggestion that we should discuss the things that were said in CancÃºn about the Green Box, I really would greatly welcome a discussion of this sort, which we could perhaps extend by inviting various representatives of NGOs to join in.
I did in fact get the impression from CancÃºn that this is where what one might term the sustainability department and the development department in some of the NGOs sometimes put forward quite contrary points of view, and I believe that this is something we should really hammer out together.
I have already indicated that the Commission can make a proposal on fisheries policy only if the Member States are willing to give us the necessary figures.
Their needs are obviously not that great, or else they would have provided the figures.
I am not, therefore able to say at present how much of the Budget is to be allocated additionally to the scrapping policy; my only guide is what we have actually been told is needed.
We are meant to - and we will - draw a distinction between the development component and that element in which we pay for the acquisition of fisheries rights under an agreement, but no new subheadings are needed for this in the Budget; it can be quite sensibly organised within one Budget line, and that is what we are going to do.
You will very soon find your requests being complied with in the proposals that we are going to submit.
(Applause)
Mr President, I am delighted to speak to the House - and in public - as a member of the gagged and muzzled committee of this Parliament which has been unable to conduct its business properly because of a decision by the Conference of Presidents about interviewing Mr Prodi on one of the subjects I will be raising shortly.
Following the normal practice within my committee, this year I have used the matters that we found during our discharge procedure to draw some budgetary amendments to get what the Committee on Budgetary Control would like to see from the Commission and other institutions.
It breaks down into three different areas, two are related and will be touched on later, and the other is the Committee of the Regions.
We have yet to grant discharge to this committee for the 2001 set of accounts and, as more revelations appear about the state of its accounts and what has been going on within that committee, it is highly unlikely that we will do so.
Therefore we have tabled an amendment asking for 25% of members' allowances within the Committee of the Regions to go into the reserve until the rapporteur provides us with much of the information we have requested.
The main point concerns Eurostat and OLAF.
We have tabled an amendment asking for a significant sum of money to be placed in the reserve for OLAF.
This achieved near-unanimity in the committee, because we have been unhappy with the way OLAF has been reporting to the budgetary authority, in many cases contravening its own rules.
Finally, I turn to Eurostat.
We are very concerned about some of its activities and the way in which the Commission is dealing with it.
We have tabled a number of amendments and, when it comes to the main budget debate, more amendments - that we shall be pushing on behalf of our committee - may be tabled by the political groups, because it is about time that someone took responsibility for the problems within Eurostat.
Mr President, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, when dealing with the issue of European jurisdiction, limited itself to seconding the proposal for the Commission's preliminary draft, which provides for increases for two reasons; the first being in consequence of enlargement, and the second in response to new tasks for European justice, in which context more funds are allocated for the purposes of documentation and translation.
What that means - no more and no less - is that the Commission's preliminary draft does not include any structural improvements in the conditions under which the European justice system functions.
Nevertheless, we went no further than doing this, and I would like to urge the Committee on Budgets not to reduce this still further, for, if we allocate only the funding relating to enlargement, and not the funds for the additional tasks, the situation cannot fail to deteriorate still further.
The Committee on Budgets will have to decide whether to take sides with the Council or with the Commission and the Court of Justice.
The second point that I would like to address has to do with the Academy of European Law, the work of which, over the past ten years, has met with immense success.
Its founding members, Germany and Luxembourg, have since been joined by Ireland, Poland, Greece, Spain, Portugal, Italy, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Hungary and Sweden.
Finland has announced its intention of joining.
Over the past ten years, a total of 38 000 people from the European Union and the new countries have taken part in seminars and training courses.
The Academy of European Law has, in that time, become the secretariat of the European Judicial Training Network, and it will, in future, be particularly involved in promoting cooperation between judges in Eastern Europe.
All this justifies a commensurate increase in the grants to the Academy of European Law under the financial programme, not only for 2004, but thereafter.
.
Mr President, I am extremely grateful to you and indeed to Mr Rothley for speaking long enough to enable me to get through the door.
Mr Rothley did this without any pre-arrangement or knowledge, and, I guess, by extra-sensory perception.
As the House will know and as my colleague Commissioner Schreyer has said, the Commission's Annual Policy Strategy for 2004 has identified three policy areas as priorities, namely enlargement, stability and sustainable growth.
We also made it clear that on the second and third of those priorities the work is to be staffed by internal redeployment of Commission personnel.
The Commission also decided that in the further implementation of reform, the redeployment of resources should be accomplished with the assistance of the time-and-numbers-limited voluntary early retirement scheme.
In the case of enlargement, we recognised the reality that new human resources - new posts - were needed in order to meet the fresh and very substantial demands arising from the historic change.
The rationale for the proposed increase is very straightforward: the accession of ten countries on 1 May 2004 will bring a 66% increase in the number of Member States, a 20% increase in the population of the Union and an 82% increase in working languages.
The Commission will handle the very diverse and substantive new demands with just 13% more staff: 3900 extra qualified people recruited over a transition period of five years from the beginning of 2004 through to the end of 2008.
For 2004 - enlargement year - after 500 deployments of existing personnel within and between existing services, the net addition needed is 780 new posts.
To establish this figure, all current tasks performed by Commission services were classified on the basis of 'activity-based management'.
Calculations were strictly based on the additional workload that we know will have to be borne by the Commission as a direct result of enlargement.
This systematic approach was applied across all services and the information provided was then carefully screened for extra certainty.
In short, we based our request for additional human resources on a rigorous and comprehensive analysis of real and proven operational needs.
I am very glad that representatives of the Council are here.
I thank them for their courtesy in attending this debate, but I have to say candidly that, against this background, the cut of 272 posts proposed by Council in its judgment on the provisional draft budget is unwelcome and, in the light of enlargement, unrealistic.
I believe that it is vital for this Parliament to be made aware of the sombre reality that providing less than the 780 enlargement-related posts which we have proposed as essential for 2004 would have a major and very negative effect on the Commission's ability to manage the fresh task arising directly from the accession of ten new Member States which, universally and unanimously in Commission, Parliament and Council, we strongly advocate and stoutly support.
In making our proposal we were not seeking to grab posts.
We were simply being realistic about what has to be done in and for a bigger Union.
I am therefore pleased to see the horizontal amendment - Amendment No 3053 - tabled by Mr Mulder, which would facilitate the re-establishment of the number of posts requested.
However, the fact that those posts would be in the reserve would produce significant practical problems.
By definition, it would mean that the new posts would be made available to the services later, thereby further delaying the recruitment process.
In the meantime, the resulting uncertainty and delay would seriously inhibit proper fulfilment of the tasks of the Commission.
I want to make it clear to the House that the list of criteria given by Mr Mulder in his Amendment No 3053 is realistic, but those criteria could usefully be clarified further.
For instance, concerning the second criterion, I want it to be plainly evident that the proposed recruitment figures will enable the Commission to ensure geographical balance across the institution after enlargement.
That is fundamental.
In any case we want to avoid the addition of any further criteria which the Commission could not, frankly, feasibly meet in time for the second reading in this House.
The Commission has manifestly shown great care and deliberation in calculating needs.
The minimum necessary number has been proposed.
No-one in this House appears to be motivated by any intention to destabilise the already demanding processes of fulfilling the tasks arising from enlargement.
When all of those facts are self-evident, I hope that there will be further reflection on the proposal to put posts in the reserve with all that implies in practical terms.
The House is also considering amendments which seek to make changes to the establishment plan.
Amendment No 3502 proposes to reduce administrative and staffing costs by 10% in a number of policy areas and to place that 10% in the reserve with the aim of fostering the operational part of the programmes.
I am bound to say that this would lead to a substantial delay in future recruitments.
While I understand the political intention behind this amendment and realise that it is consistent with similar amendments in previous years, the Commission will have great difficulty in trying to fulfil the relevant programmes effectively without the appropriate level of administrative resources.
I do not need to tell Members who have been involved in efforts to introduce activity-based budgeting and greater transparency that we are not debating a technical matter.
The Commission's responsibility for allocating resources to activities and for accounting for those allocations is a profoundly political issue.
As the internal allocation of human resources is decided, the Commission will give proper consideration to the concerns expressed by this Parliament in its budgetary resolution.
But, for the sake of effective operation and responsibility, the administrative autonomy of our institutions must be maintained.
That means that the conclusive decisions on establishment plans must, in the final analysis, continue to be for the Commission to make on the basis of properly calculated and manifest needs.
I know that many Members will recognise the principle and its practicality.
I have huge respect for the many qualities of Mr Mulder, but he is pre-eminently a practical man.
I hope that those considerations will recommend themselves to him.
I only give praise where it is due ...
... lavishly to Mr Mulder, but nevertheless, when it is due.
Apart from the cuts relating to the appropriations for posts, the Council has made a number of other cuts in the administrative budget of the Commission relating to delegations, auxiliaries, missions, meetings and representation offices.
Faced with that I want to be absolutely clear: cutting the budget of our delegation offices would damage the last phase of the deconcentration, which is a process strongly favoured by this House and by the Commission.
The proposed reduction on missions, meetings and representation offices will also inevitably have a negative impact on the enlargement process.
The Commission needs the preliminary draft budget to be re-established in order to meet the administrative challenges of 2004 arising inevitably and foreseeably from enlargement.
Expenditure in that area is neither excessive nor decorative.
It is absolutely essential to good performance.
Also essential to good performance is the continuation of the normal transformation of posts needed for career development.
If, as the Council had proposed, the transition to the new career structure - strongly and rightly supported by this House and indeed by the Council - was to be accompanied by the withholding of conventional patterns of promotion, the effect would understandably be confusing and demoralising for the staff of the European public service.
However, I understand that the rapporteur proposes tabling an amendment to re-establish this routine practice.
That would be a most welcome proposal and one that would give a reassuring and strongly cooperative signal to our staff, whose active and confident engagement in modernising change continues to be absolutely vital, as it always will be.
Mr President, Commissioner, allow me to begin by telling you in public what I have already taken the opportunity to tell you in private, namely that I profoundly admire the courageous and direct manner in which you are facing up to your responsibilities in the Eurostat case.
Allow me also, however, to say to you just as directly that I would describe the way in which the Commission is hiding the internal audit report from Parliament, and especially from the Committee on Budgetary Control, as a deeply irresponsible act.
I must alert you to the consequences of that act as of now.
We required that report as part of the discharge procedure, as the essential condition on which discharge was to be granted.
The Commission itself, as a body, must consider where the responsibility lies here.
I would also like to let you know, Commissioner, that I fully agree with what Mr Heaton-Harris has already said about the cuts in the amounts for both OLAF and Eurostat.
I also believe that it is essential that the principle of political responsibility should be implemented, in practical terms.
I believe that Commissioners should assume their responsibilities and be given the means to do so.
I believe, in particular, that each Commissioner should have at his or her disposal an inspection, an audit, or whatever else they need in order to address the questions asked of them.
Mr President, firstly I wish to thank Commissioners Schreyer and Kinnock for their successful reform of the Commission and the reshaping of the Financial Regulation connected with it.
They create a basis for the clarification of personal accountability, taking responsibility and the creation of activity-based budgeting and management.
This budget is in fact the first activity-based budget.
How to improve activity-based management is a continual challenge.
The objective must be that the different policy areas be given room for manoeuvre in creating the most efficient administrative structure possible.
This means that in the future we can very likely abandon the practice where Parliament decides separately on the establishment of a post or changes to it.
Parliament will only decide how much money is available in a particular administrative area.
This may then itself decide on the creation of the most appropriate administrative structure.
In the future, defining and bearing personal responsibility will be of key importance, because activity-based budgeting and management lead to the downward delegation of power of decision.
As regards financial management, we have to be able to establish exactly what we require of the careful management of finances.
Different organisations and NGOs make up their own areas of specialisation, which the European Parliament has given its support to.
These 'earmarked' A-30 budget lines have been the budget's bugbear.
To be honest, access to them on the part of organisations has been on an arbitrary basis.
Often the European dimension to these organisations has not been any better off than that of hundreds of other organisations that have been operating without support.
Now a legal basis is being established for the system and the question of assistance is to be for the Commission to decide.
This measure must be implemented as soon as possible.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Kinnock, I am glad that you have been able to get back to your roots as transport commissioner by delivering your speech to us just in time.
When you took up your new responsibility in 1999, you promised to create the most modern and most efficient administration in the world.
Now you are trying to get us to buy the idea that, as your term of office in this Commission draws to a close, you have actually achieved this exalted objective, but, Commissioner, things in the garden are not quite as rosy as the glowing colours in which you have depicted them would suggest.
There are many dark clouds overshadowing it, and a number of points that I would like to take up.
The first is that it is, in my view, unacceptable that the Commission's administration does not reflect what the budgetary authority wants.
I am glad to see that Commissioner Vitorino has now arrived; we discussed this under the heading of information policy this morning.
We have topped up the funds for this, leaving nothing in the reserves, but, at ground level, there is no administration and the decentralisation to which you referred does not work either.
Agreements with the Member States are not concluded and there are no funds for things - like the outcome of the Convention - in which the Commission has no political interest.
You have EUR 10 million at your disposal, and only EUR 1.5 million have been spent.
It is not your job to decide for yourself how the Budget is to be administered, but to ensure that the administration actually carries out what the Council and Parliament have decided.
You are failing to do so, and, as Commissioner for personnel, you share the responsibility for that.
I could give you many other examples of this.
Secondly, this is also about those areas in which the Commission itself bears financial responsibility.
The excuse is always given that it is the dastardly Member States who administer 80% of the budget, but, where you yourself are responsible, you have to maintain order and, the members of the Committee on Budgetary Control have given you the clear message as regards the way you do that: that is your responsibility and you have to answer for it!
. Mr President, I am grateful to Mr Ferber for his kind remarks on my timely arrival.
It reminded me of the time when I used to have to get to a 10 a.m. division in the House of Commons and narrowly make it in, practising my side-step around the policemen.
It was not quite as complicated on this occasion.
I am grateful for constructive contributions and I can reply very briefly but I hope reassuringly to the honourable Members who have contributed.
Firstly, I am grateful for the kind remarks by Mr Casaca because they are based on very thorough analysis of everything we are seeking to do.
I wish that was a universal characteristic, but I find that some people writing in the press, for instance, have a confidence and an assertiveness in what they write, which is in inverse proportion to the amount of knowledge that they have.
I regret his understandable view that the Commission, to use his term, is hiding the internal audit report from Parliament.
I understand the force of what he says when he reminds us again that the internal audit activity, the examination of contracts, was a direct product of the discharge resolution drafted, in fact, by Mr Casaca himself and some of his close colleagues.
I fully recognise the force with which he puts the point.
I only say this: we are having to use the Annex III procedure for a very basic reason which I am sure will be understood.
We have to observe strict confidentiality whilst trying to maximise information to the people who are most entitled to know, including Members of this House, simply because those reports which are now being completed contain a potential for disciplinary and even more grave procedures.
That is not an excuse, it is not an evasion.
It arises from the proper observance of the rights of natural justice and the presumption of innocence, and also from our strong desire not in a precipitate fashion to release details into the public domain which could then compromise the integrity of a case or cases we may wish to bring against individuals.
I hope that on examination it will be understood that I say this in a mood of explanation and transparency, not apology or evasiveness, and it is necessary simply because of the material we are dealing with.
I realise that if there had been a historic background of trying to keep confidentiality to a minimum, and transparency to a maximum, then it would be easier for this House to understand that, when it is critically essential that we use confidential procedures, it is done for absolutely the best reasons.
I hope that, amongst other products of activity-based management and budgeting and the transparency that Mr Virrankoski spoke about, we will see a further evolution of the readiness of the Commission to make maximum disclosure whilst trying to safeguard the integrity of necessary procedures.
The report will be available under Annex III of the framework agreement procedure when it is ready.
It is being finalised literally now, so that it can be available in the proper form at the time promised.
As regards the consolidation of political responsibility I do not yet envisage the full implementation of the architecture that Mr Casaca desires, though I have a lot of sympathy for it.
That architecture consists in the establishment of a full financial control unit, as it were, in the office of every Commissioner.
But I consider that we have made substantial progress towards achieving that, on the one hand in the general ambit of the Financial Regulation, but more specifically in the reforms adopted by the Commission, in some cases as recently as July 2003.
Those guarantee an absolute requirement for reporting on management conduct and financial operation in a DG at least twice a year, specifically to the responsible Commissioner, so that Commissioners will in future continue to be au fait with the practical operational management of the directorate-general, as well as bearing their straightforward and obvious political responsibilities.
It will not diminish political responsibility, portfolio responsibility or policy engagement: it is likely to add to those.
Commissioner Schreyer and I sent a letter to all DGs in July 2003.
The response we got from the DGs - with very thorough analysis seeking to detect any practices remotely related to what we have observed in Eurostat - was rigorous and encouragingly thorough.
I know that Mr Casaca, with his interest in these matters, and probably Mr Mulder, will want to examine that.
That will be very welcome.
Mr Virrankoski obviously shows great understanding and I know his background really gives him an authority in this area.
I would simply say to him that I agree with his forecast for future structures and the practices that he anticipates, and express confidence that they will come to pass.
Culture in an organisation of human beings is substantially a product not of ethnic or national origin or regional origin or language. Culture is a product of the systems and structures in which people work.
By making massive reforms that radically change systems and structures, we foster the kind of culture of transparency and accountability which is fundamental to the successful operation of activity-based management and of the activity-based budgeting which reinforces that process.
To Mr Ferber I would say: it is a matter of record that my promise at the outset of the Commission - and I am not trying to denounce or go back on any catchphrases about the best in the world, etc. was that we would strive to achieve, through radical modernising reform, a well managed, high-performance, service-orientated, independent European Commission in the service of the peoples of the European Union.
I do not think that was modest, and yet we are accomplishing it.
To use his phrase, I do not imagine that the sky is as blue as he says I have painted it.
We acknowledge in our frequent progress reports the shortcomings, the target dates that we have missed, as well as the ones that we have bettered.
We acknowledge where further development needs to take place.
It was, after all, this Commission which - as soon as we had prima facie evidence that gave us legal security in undertaking certain actions - suspended contracts, opened disciplinary proceedings, established the strongest, biggest ever inquiry task force in the history of the Commission, increased the staffing of the internal audit examination of contracts from 9 to 24 persons and has had those reports coming in absolutely on schedule.
This is not evidence of a slothful or lax Commission, but neither does it mean that we imagine that the sky is permanently blue, nor do these glasses have any rose tint.
I am impatient for further change.
I want to see total implementation.
That ambition is shared universally by my colleagues and we could not have made the progress we have unless we had had massive cooperation from staff assuming these obligations in addition to their normal workload and if we had not had the full-hearted commitment of every single Member of the College of Commissioners.
Therefore, I do not try to pretend that we have done more than we have.
I simply ask for a factual examination of what has been achieved.
For instance, automatic mandatory mobility for senior management and for people in money-handling, contract-handling posts will in itself provide a safeguard against a repetition of the double accounting that we have detected in Eurostat.
More than any other measure, but in addition, reforms of structures and systems of audit control and management control that give us - insofar as any human organisation handling money can get it - real, strong safeguards against any form of repetition of what we have detected and are acting upon now.
As far as the response to Parliament and the Council is concerned, I respect it.
I come from a parliamentary tradition where an elected House of Commons obtained its strength by having the vote on the budget.
Therefore I fundamentally respect and want to endorse that democratic procedure.
I do not plead for us to depart from that.
I do not make an argument for being insulated against the representations and judgment of Parliament or of the Council which represents the taxpayers.
I do not ask for that for one second.
I simply say that it is a practical reality that, without autonomy, it is difficult to exercise responsibility, and when we have autonomy our responsibility must be fully accountable.
However, if we do not have the resources or the people whose presence, qualities and qualifications we can totally justify, then it is very difficult to see how the Commission can undertake the tasks it has now, let alone the ones that are to come as a consequence of this glorious enlargement, but which nevertheless we recognise to be additional obligations which we must discharge with efficiency and honesty.
I would like to make a comment on the way this debate is structured.
Our Rules of Procedure state that Commissioners may speak for as long as they wish.
Personally, though, I feel that something is out of balance if a Commissioner speaks for twice as long as the three Members before him.
Without wishing to restrict their rights under the Rules of Procedure, I would urge the Commission to give some thought to what I have said.
. I rise to do two things.
First, I apologise if you feel that I have abused the Rules of the House.
I would certainly not repeat that.
I believe that people in this House know that my occupation of time is, generally speaking, very disciplined.
There were fundamental points raised on a budget about which I feel passionately.
We need people!
Do not take it personally Commissioner.
It was just a general remark.
Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, along with continuity and accountability, planning a budget requires that any necessary adjustments and reforms be made; more than anything else, it also calls for political vision.
In a constructive dialogue, this House's specialists in social policy have made a package of these objectives and adopted them by an overwhelming majority in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
Our priorities include industrial safety, by which I mean that our agencies should be adequately equipped and enabled, above all, to press on with the programmes for small and medium-sized enterprises and also micro-businesses, something that is especially necessary in the candidate countries.
We also seek a moderate increase in funding for the Community initiative EQUAL and for non-governmental organisations.
The Community initiative EQUAL is a specific instrument, within the framework of the European Social Fund, for realising our ideas and achieving our objectives, which are also those of the Lisbon process.
We have to make progress towards these goals, and to do so, we have to guarantee that the initiative is endowed with the necessary funding.
We need more jobs - sustainable jobs - and we also want to promote training - training with qualifications - and strengthen its role in the Member States, while at the same time offering businesses incentives to discharge their obligations.
Until such time as there is any change, we will keep on criticising the flow of funds from the European Social Fund, which, this time round, is still a scandal - not one attributable to Parliament or the Commission, but, we believe, one for which the Member States bear responsibility.
This is something that we want to change in the forthcoming reform of the Structural Funds, rather than taking action in the course of this Budget.
Our political vision is of course not just about making enlargement a reality, but primarily about the creation of a social Europe, which is where we still have a lot of catching-up to do in amidst the other tasks that Europe has to accomplish.
Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, which has presented a certain number of amendments that I can combine in several chapters.
The first concerns the perspectives and priorities of the European Parliament, notably in the framework of the Prince programme.
We talked about the subject this morning in the course of the meeting on the issue of interinstitutional information, and we are very concerned about the non-implementation of a fair portion of the appropriations made to the priorities that Parliament recommends, has already recommended and will again recommend for next year.
I would appeal to the Commission to place this non-implementation at the heart of its concerns.
Commissioner Barnier is well aware of the matter.
I think that we are in a decisive year for the integration of Europe and for the image of Europe. The Constitution will, we hope, be adopted, and the elections are approaching.
The credits in question must, therefore, be implemented and put to good use.
So much for the first chapter of the amendments by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs.
There then follows another chapter of amendments that I would call 'image of the institutions'.
We would put forward the idea, which we would ask the general rapporteur also to support, that the Internet should become the tool by which Europeans can really take an interest in, and get up to date with, what is happening in Europe.
I am thinking not only of the written Internet, which obviously makes a lot of things possible already, but also of the broadcasting of debates such as the budgetary debate, the committee debates, the public meetings of the Council, when these take place, and the daily conferences of the European Commission.
We think that this tool, which is actually very cheap to use, really can enable people to keep up to date with what is happening in the European institutions.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are about to vote on a 2004 budget which is, in a manner of speaking, historic because it will be the first budget of a reunited Europe.
Before mentioning three points, I would like to say to Mrs Weiler that I have noted the perspectives that she outlined, which have in fact more to do with future regional policy, its appraisal and how that regional policy and cohesion policy can be made to serve the Lisbon or GÃ¶teborg objectives.
That is precisely what the college is discussing at the moment in preparation for future financial perspectives and for the content and proposals of the third cohesion report.
Thank you very much for the impetus you have given.
Mr President, I would, therefore, like to mention three points:
the 2000-2006 programmes,
the closure for the period 1994-1999, and
the structural policy consequences of enlargement.
My first point is that the 2000-2006 programmes are honestly making up lost time.
This is the fruit of the simplifications we have proposed and undertaken with the Member States.
The payments for 2000-2006 were made more quickly than before.
At the end of August, we had already paid 25% more than at the same time in 2002.
For the first time, the 2000-2006 payments could even be higher than forecast and I anticipate asking for at least EUR 1 billion more in objective 1 appropriations when the overall end-of-year transfer is made.
We can also see here the effect of the n+2 rule about which we alerted ministers on 22 April last, as I informed your committees.
Between 1 January and 1 September, the governments reduced the backlog of payment appropriations that had to be dealt with in order to avoid decommitments.
To avoid any decommitment, I am also going to write to every government again and they will have to present us with another 5 billion in payments by the end of the year.
If their forecasts are to be believed, it will be done, but, ladies and gentlemen, to be perfectly honest I no longer give much credence to Member States' forecasts when I get them.
Having said that, Italy, which has got us used to miracles, accounts for 40% of the effort that still has to be made.
Three states alone account for 80% of the remaining effort.
Conversely, in Austria, Spain and Greece the risk is very low and there is therefore nothing inevitable about it.
My second point is the 1994-1999 closure.
This is a difficult point, as I have often said in this House.
This closure will in fact be longer than expected.
It was only on 31 March last that the Commission received virtually all of the some 2 000 files to be closed for these 1994-1999 programmes.
I want the necessary checks to be made and any corrections that may be necessary as a result of those checks to be completed.
I do not therefore want to rush the closure of those programmes.
In view of the time required to guarantee the quality of the checks and the consultations that the procedures require, ladies and gentlemen, despite the best efforts of my services and those of the Commission we shall be unable to pay all the appropriations earmarked for 1994-1999 in 2003.
That is the main reason for the delays just highlighted by Mr van Dam.
There is therefore a risk of under-implementation in 2003 of at least EUR 5 billion for the Structural Funds as a whole.
As soon as I had identified this risk in July, I alerted my colleague Commissioner Michaele Schreyer.
Together, we will shortly be proposing that the Commission submit a draft amending budget to the budgetary authority in order to cancel without delay the appropriations that would be unused.
The actual amount that will have to be cancelled still needs to be clarified by Commissioner Schreyer's services, they being the only ones with an overall picture of the budget, in order to identify any needs that will have to be covered under other budget headings between now and the end of the year.
Nevertheless, ladies and gentlemen, I confirm my commitment to reducing the amount remaining to be settled in two ways: firstly by cancelling commitments not covered by a request for payment, for example when the project has been abandoned or cost less than expected (in this connection, decommitments are already being prepared; they will represent at least EUR 1.5 billion for the European Regional Development fund (ERDF) alone) and, secondly, by making as many payments as possible where the dossiers are now in order.
Between payments and decommitments, I confirm that I have set myself the target of cutting by at least half what remains to be settled for 1994-1999 for the ERDF in 2003.
I think these few explanations on this point will satisfy Mr SeppÃ€nen's request.
The flaw in the 1994-1999 management was precisely the lack, Mr SeppÃ€nen, of what you called a sunset clause.
We now have one with the new n+2 rule and it is starting to bear fruit.
My third and final point is the structural-policy consequences of enlargement.
The success of this enlargement, taking in 10 new Member States, is the Commission's top priority.
Cohesion policy is also a top priority.
The big challenge facing us is to complete negotiations with all the new Member States before the end of 2003 on the programmes that will have to be operational in a few months' time for the very short period 2004-2006.
Enlargement is therefore already part of the everyday lives of our directorates-general responsible for the Structural Funds and your constant support - which I will still need for the crucial period ahead - has enabled me to anticipate the Commission's commitments.
What are the budgetary effects of this enlargement?
For commitment appropriations, for the structural funds and the Cohesion Fund, in addition to the 34 billion provided for the present Member States, an additional EUR 6.7 billion is earmarked for the new Member States.
That is an increase of around 20%.
In terms of human resources, the number of posts requested to guarantee the success of this enlargement is, it seems to me, modest.
If you accede to the Commission's requests, the directorates-general concerned will increase their staff by only 7% to manage a 20% increase in appropriations.
This increase in our administrative capacity is a minimum because these countries are not yet used to Community programmes.
They will therefore need more support, more advice, and more controls, too, than the present members.
That is my objective answer to Mrs Gill's comment that she would like us to make economies of scale.
Quite honestly, a mission to Poland cannot be combined with a mission to Spain.
However that may be, I thank you for your support in obtaining the human resources essential for guaranteeing the success of our cohesion policy in 2004 and beyond.
In conclusion, Mr President, what are the consequences of all this for the payment appropriations needed for 2004?
So far as enlargement is concerned, it is not really an issue.
As was decided in Copenhagen, payment appropriations for the new Member States in 2004 have been confined to advances.
For the 2000-2006 programmes, your rapporteur, Mr Mulder, suggests increasing payment appropriations by 3 billion.
If Member States' forecasts are to be believed, that will be necessary.
It is true that if the Member States manage to avoid any decommitment under the n+2 rule, we would then need an extra 1 billion for the ERDF alone.
As you see, the Commission has adopted a prudent and realistic approach in the light of the implementation of earlier years.
I think some decommitments under the n+2 rule will be unavoidable in 2004.
We will also have to get used to including them in our forecasts.
If the payment appropriations turned out to be insufficient for the 2000-2006 Structural Funds and for closing the 1994-1999 period, the Commission would then ask for an additional amending budget during the 2004 financial year.
Finally, for the 1994-1999 programmes it is clear that we will need appropriations in 2004 to complete the closure beyond the Commission's preliminary draft budget.
I cannot yet say how much those appropriations will amount to.
The checks currently being made will certainly result in reductions in the amounts to pay, either by excluding amounts which are not legitimate or by applying financial corrections.
Over all, on the basis of the information I have available, an increase in heading 2 payment appropriations would not be illegitimate while not perhaps going as far as Mr Mulder suggests.
At this stage, however, I would prefer to confront the Member States with their responsibilities and get them in the end to make realistic forecasts, even if that means increasing the appropriations under management in an amending budget when we have all the data.
Finally, Mr Dell'Alba, we have had a very important dialogue and, like my colleague Mr Vitorino this morning, I have paid great attention to it.
I can confirm that of the 12 million available this year for information on the great debate on the future of Europe, 8.3 million are in the process of being or have already been committed.
There are 3.7 million remaining, which can be redeployed.
Like Mr Vitorino, I will endeavour to propose a use for this money by the end of the year, perhaps in partnership with Parliament, for an information campaign or to compile documents that will help to explain the outcome of the Convention and, I hope, the outcome of the Intergovernmental Conference, but also to show how this new institutional architecture we are going to have can be useful for specific policies to benefit the citizens.
We are thinking of a new document - we discussed it with some parliamentary officials this morning - that could be made available to Members of Parliament and European election candidates to show specifically what this new Constitution consists of and how it can be useful for specific policies to benefit the citizens.
That is the information I wanted to give you on this specific point that Mr Dell'Alba raised.
Mr President, speaking about issues which concern the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, I should like to start with the issues touched on by Commissioner Barnier, the issues of regional policy, and to say here that, as far as the previous period from 1994 to 1999 is concerned, as he himself admitted, developments are not the most propitious.
There is a delay in closing dossiers, the basic responsibility for which lies with the Member States, which are late submitting all the information required or, in all events, when they do submit it, do not submit it in the proper form.
That is why there are funds which have not yet been paid to the Member States and that is creating a problem both with the Community budget and, of course, with the national budgets.
By contrast, there are more positive developments in the new programming period from 2000 to 2006, although here too, of course, we must be very, very careful.
I noted with satisfaction that this year we are doing better than last year from the point of view of the take-up of appropriations and trust that the n+2 rule, despite the criticism it sometimes receives, even here in Parliament, is a rule which will result in proper management on the part of the Member States as regards programming and managing the sums of money.
Besides, we should not forget that it was the Member States themselves which, in unanimously adopting the current Structural Fund regulations, came to accept this n+2 rule.
These, broadly speaking, are also the reasons why, in our committee at least, we propose to return essentially to the preliminary draft budget initially submitted by the Commission as far as category II of the budget is concerned.
As far as the other matters are concerned, I should like to comment in particular on the trans-European networks and to say that, even after the van Miert report of 30 June this year, and pending the proposal to reform the trans-European networks, our committee wishes to note their importance and to stress that words and deeds must coincide at some point.
If we want to promote the trans-European networks, we need to find ways of funding them and one of these ways is obviously the Community budget.
I should also like to comment on the issue of the European Maritime Safety Agency, the headquarters of which have not been decided.
The fact that the headquarters of this agency have not been decided should not lead us to conclude that we should also not fund it.
We need to put sums of money in reserve so that, when the headquarters are decided, we are ready to fund this agency, which will play a particularly important role in these issues of safety at sea which we debated this morning.
I should also like to underline the importance of two issues to which we are not, I think, paying proper attention.
One is tourism, where we consider that a number of pilot programmes which will strengthen small and medium-sized enterprises in the sector in particular should be funded and, the second, which is sometimes undervalued, is safe transport where, here too, we believe that we could proceed to increase the funds somewhat.
Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, still on the subject of regional policy, transport and tourism, I have to say to you that we are quite worried, not to say disillusioned, by our reading of the draft budget.
The problem has been clearly explained: to see the budget lines for essential policies cut so drastically by the Council worries us extremely.
I have to say to you that it worries us because it happens all the time.
Whatever the decision-making procedures, whatever the reports highlighting the European Union's development needs, the same thing has happened for years: whenever budget time comes the Council makes the most astounding cuts to its programmes, which are nevertheless among the most important ones for encouraging development in the European Union.
Time passes and nothing changes in this.
Hence our concern and hence the Commission's unanimity in seeking to use amendments to get the level of expenditure provided for in the preliminary draft budget reinstated.
I will return for a few moments to the issue of the Structural Funds and I would like to thank Commissioner Barnier for all the explanations he has given us.
We can indeed see that the simplifications made are bearing fruit.
We also note a qualitative and quantitative improvement in the management of those funds.
In short, we want the European Union's budget to take account of the reality of expenditure, which will avoid the Commission having to present supplementary draft budgets, which would be damaging to the peaceful implementation of these essential funds.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Barnier, I wish to begin by congratulating you, Commissioner Barnier, for the results achieved with the n+2 rule, by the efforts at simplification and by the fact that matters are now apparently such that, within structural policy, there is more success in implementing expenditure and getting money used.
We do in fact see, however, how the budgets and the payment appropriations have been significantly cut back, both in the Commission's and the Council's proposals, and, in the light of what you are saying today, it has of course to be wondered whether it is right to take matters so calmly, confident that there are enough payment appropriations, and whether a proposal for the supplementary budget is enough to solve the problem, if it emerges that the money is being used up more quickly than we anticipated.
In recent years, we have of course seen that there has been a huge amount of money left over from the agricultural budgets in the autumn, but will that continue, with a falling dollar and other growing expenditure?
That is a matter for reflection.
I also think it right to look at the problem constituted by the fact that it is not possible to have confidence in the reports we obtain from the Member States.
Neither the Commission nor the Member States' finance ministers have confidence in the reports obtained as to what needs exist.
This is therefore worth investigating more carefully.
I nonetheless think Mr Mulder has the right idea in saying we should increase the payment appropriations so that we might be sure that the projects can be implemented within the agreed time frames, even if those of us in my group have never supported large increases in the payment appropriations.
I want to mention something else, namely the issue of the cutbacks we see in a range of budget lines where small and medium-sized enterprises are concerned.
In particular, we see how, within the action programme for the working environment, the budget is being drastically cut back, and that, I think, is a completely wrong signal to send out prior to enlargement.
I want to attach a lot of importance to our being able to obtain an exchange of knowledge and development of experience in the area relating to the working environment, so that free competition in the EU is not at the expense of a good working environment.
Mr President, I should like to make one or two observations with regard to social policy.
I totally agree with what Mrs Jensen said on this subject a moment ago.
It is regrettable that some areas leave something to be desired.
I should particularly like to ask for attention to be paid to the European Year of the disabled which we are celebrating at the moment and which is also reasonably successful.
It is, in my view, very important that we should provide an opportunity for follow-up next year.
I also hope that provision can be made for this in the budget during the course of this budget procedure.
I should also like to make a brief comment further to what Commissioner Barnier has stated.
Needless to say, we have all looked into the figures.
It is indeed satisfying to see that the situation has improved particularly over the past few months and that a little more money is being spent than during the period immediately preceding it.
Despite this, I do think that we have not solved the problem by a long way.
Neither am I completely convinced that we need an additional budget.
I myself do not expect this at all.
What can we see happening?
Countries are working out how much money they would need to spend in order to use up all the money that has been allocated to them.
Those countries are saying: well, it should be this or that amount, which they subsequently find impossible to spend.
They are far too optimistic and there is no monitoring procedure of any kind.
I think that we ought to be extremely grateful to the Commissioner for having introduced all kinds of gentle mechanisms that will hopefully rectify the situation to some degree.
For years, I have been indignant about the fact that everyone knows that there are too many payment credits and that the money is not being spent.
The only thing we notice at the end of the year is that a great deal of money is retuned to the Member States.
I think we should put a stop to this.
This is probably more important than approving the occasional additional budget.
Mr President, we can be glad that the Lisbon Process is working in spite of everything.
Two multiannual programmes that become effective from the start of next year are an indication of that.
Erasmus Mundus is a master's course programme to improve the attractiveness of Europe for nationals of third countries.
E-Learning, which Parliament has been active in setting up through a pilot project, will provide inter alia schools and universities with new opportunities for cooperation.
Now we have to ensure that the programmes get the necessary level of funding.
Likewise, we must guarantee the financing of the European Year of Education through Sports and improve opportunities for youth organisation activities in the new Member States.
It is a positive sign that enlargement is being taken into consideration in the Socrates-Youth programme and Culture 2000 programme.
Switching to an activity-based budget will mean the opportunity to establish a legal basis for the financing of European cultural organisations.
If we are firm and prudent we will create legislation that serves the cause of cultural cooperation and at the same time goes further to meet the requirements of transparency and good management.
Rule 19 in our Rules of Procedure states that the President shall possess all the powers necessary to preside over the proceedings of Parliament.
Rule 120 (6) states that the President shall attempt to agree speaking times with the Commission and the Council.
Commissioner Barnier, I will now agree to give you eleven minutes, the same that Parliament has had.
As I took ten minutes, does that mean that I only have one minute left?
I do hope that that is not the case, but do not worry, I will not take advantage, I will answer as quickly as possible.
I would like to thank everyone who has expressed an opinion on Structural Funds policy, for which I am responsible together with Mrs Diamantopoulou and Mr Fischler, in particular regional policy.
I am not going to go back over the figures I confirmed today and which I sought to give as the most sincere and honest answer possible to the questions put by the Committee on Budgets, the Committee on Budgetary Control and Mr Hatzidakis' Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.
The first assessment I outlined before you confirms what I said on 22 May about the period 1994-1999, which for me is the black spot, or at least the grey spot: the procedure used for this programming was so unwieldy that control and certification became concentrated at the end of the period.
Mr Hatzidakis, what applies to this period is not n+2 but, you might as well say, n+11.
That is the objective reason for the amount of work we have to do to process and check the 2 000 files received.
I repeat that my colleagues and I will not skimp this certification period; I shall have no hesitation in taking any measures that may be necessary.
I do not want to lower the quality of the controls or the level of information and certification required by rules with which we are all familiar.
Mr Hatzidakis is right when he says that the n+2 procedure adopted for new programmes in 1999 is more efficient and is already producing better results, creates an impression of continuity and results in a smaller number of regular cancellations.
Mr Pronk, I am not satisfied either, even if progress has been made.
I am not going to act self-satisfied in front of you, believe me.
I am simply noting, like you, a better use for the period 2000-2006.
This improvement is due mainly to the n+2 rule and our ongoing cooperation with the governments.
Mr Hatzidakis, I will pass on your comments on the matter of transport and road safety to Mrs de Palacio.
I would like to thank Mrs Guy-Quint and Mrs Jensen for their appraisal of our management under your supervision.
Mrs Guy-Quint, we are at this moment making progress on programme appraisal.
I am thinking in particular of the efforts being made by Mr Likanen, Mr Monti and myself to make it easier to use the Structural Funds to cover areas not yet served by mobile telephones or the Internet.
Let us have less padding and more quality.
We are doing so already, but with the future regional policy we are working on and for which I need your support we can go a lot further.
The future objective 2 policy in particular will enable us, in partnership with the regions and governments, to implement directly the major objectives of GÃ¶teborg and Lisbon relating to competitiveness and sustainable growth.
Mrs Jensen, I shall be continuing the efforts we have begun.
The commitment appropriations that you regretted were cut do not fall under heading 2 for which we are responsible.
They are transport appropriations, like those for small and medium-sized undertakings.
I therefore think that Commissioner Schreyer understood those comments correctly, but I cannot answer this point because there is no reduction in the commitment appropriations, which, incidentally, were safeguarded for the whole period in Berlin.
Mr Pronk, I have answered your question.
I am not sure that we will need the supplementary budget I mentioned just now, but as I am being transparent with you I am mentioning it to you at this stage.
So far as 2003 is concerned, we do need an amending budget.
We may need a supplementary budget next year, but that is not certain.
It is simply that we have to be able to pay when the time comes.
I do not want States that are capable of consuming and implementing to be penalised on the pretext that there are some bad pupils in the class.
Mrs Iivari, your comment was addressed more to Mrs Reding, but I have heard it.
Regarding the cultural cooperation of which you spoke - even though it is not my subject, I am sensitive to what you have said in this regard - in the forthcoming debate on regional policy after 2007 I intend proposing an increase in our appropriations for Interreg and a simplification of that programme's rules, in order to target cross-border cooperation in transport infrastructures in particular.
In that field, too, we need cultural and university cooperation.
There you are, Mr President, I have taken more than a minute but less than 11 minutes and I thank you for your understanding.
Mr President, I make this statement on behalf of the Committee on Home Affairs and as its rapporteur.
I am very glad that this House's rapporteur, Mr Mulder, has noted that everything related to home affairs and justice policy in the European Union has a close connection with enlargement, and that he himself has already made some necessary proposals.
It makes things much easier for those of us who deal with home affairs and justice policy if the rapporteur who understands us best is right alongside us.
I must, secondly, extend warm thanks to Commissioner Vitorino for the excellent cooperation with his staff, which has gone outstandingly well.
Although our proposals relating to the 2004 Budget were adopted unanimously, I must simply point out, now that we are debating them in plenary, that this year, we have a priority issue in the shape of our three agencies.
What particularly makes our agencies in Vienna, Lisbon and the Hague very important to us is the fact that we will soon have ten new Member States, which will make more work for the agencies in the areas of combating racism, drug crime, criminal activities and terrorism.
Our monitoring centres in Vienna and Lisbon, along with Eurojust in The Hague are three agencies in need of active support, and that will cost money.
I take it as read that my fellow-MEPs who sit on the Committee on Budgets will join with us in seeing the need for this and in giving us their support in this House.
Thank you.
. Madam President, I would like to place on record my appreciation to the general rapporteur, Mr Mulder, for his attention to our concerns.
This committee takes less than 1% of the EU budget, but I would not want anyone to think that we should see education, culture, media and information as optional extras.
The creative industries in Europe contribute some 12% to Europe's GDP.
There are two points I would particularly like the Commission to heed.
Firstly, in its culture budget each year, Parliament helps a number of cultural organisations and networks such as the European Youth Orchestra and the Yehudi Menuhin Foundation.
If these organisations are to survive, let alone flourish, then they not only need our financial and moral support, they need legal certainty.
I am appalled that at the end of September, there is still no guarantee they will get their money for 2004 and sadly, as usual, some have not yet been paid for 2003.
I urge the Commission to resolve this legal base problem.
Secondly, if EU citizens are to know about the EU they require information.
25% of Britons do not know their country is in the EU.
31% of Germans have never heard of the European Commission and 90% of Spaniards do not know what the European Convention is!
The public learn about Europe through television.
We have Euronews, an excellent independent channel, but like all public sector broadcasters, it needs funding.
This year Parliament voted EUR 3 million for Euronews.
As far as I am aware, that money has not yet been paid.
We have proposed in our budget suggestion for next year that it should receive EUR 5 million.
I am afraid that we could enter the year of enlargement - the year of European elections - with no European Youth Orchestra and no European television.
I hope the Commission will take these points seriously.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this is the second time that the justice and internal affairs sector has been invited to this budget debate, but when it comes to figures those for which I am responsible seem so small that I almost feel ashamed to be standing here alongside my colleagues from agriculture or cohesion.
Nevertheless, from a statistical point of view the budget for justice and internal affairs has increased by 252% this year.
In reality, however, much of that increase is the result of the decision taken in Copenhagen to create the Schengen facility, at a cost of EUR 317 million, to help the seven future Member States to adopt and incorporate the Schengen acquis.
Another EUR 13 million are for transitional measures for Lithuania in connection with transit to and from Kaliningrad.
So far as justice and internal affairs are concerned, the most important changes from the budgetary point of view are therefore the enlargement-related increase in appropriations for programmes (EUR 16 million) and the increase in appropriations for control of the external frontiers, which has been a major European Union priority since the Seville and Thessaloniki summits.
I would like to stress the importance of the ARGO programme in support of frontier control operations carried out jointly by the Member States; this is given an extra EUR 15 million.
I would also like to highlight the creation of a new budget line for development of the VIS project, a visa information system, to which EUR 10 million will be allocated initially.
This year 2004 will be marked by a number of important factors affecting budget management.
It will be the last year of operation for the European Refugee Fund.
We therefore need to learn from experience in making a new allocation after 2004.
Then there is the doubling of the amount allocated to the Daphne programme, which will be 10 million for 2004.
In this connection, I want to stress the importance of reaching a conclusion concerning the legal basis as quickly as possible in the codecision procedure between Parliament and Council.
Finally, as rapporteur Ceyhun points out, the budgets for Eurojust and the Drugs Monitoring Centre in Lisbon are increased in particular in order to enable those bodies to adapt to enlargement.
Regarding the proposed amendments voted unanimously by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs - for which I want to thank Mr Ceyhun - I am particularly pleased about the increase in the budget for the European Refugee Fund.
However, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that doing so today will allow voluntary return actions to be paid for and that there is absolutely no question of using this money for forced returns.
There is therefore a contradiction between the fact that capacity is being increased and the comment.
I would like to draw your attention to that.
I am also pleased with the two amendments which the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs has proposed concerning the VIS system and the new generation Schengen information system, SIS II.
Following the feasibility studies, it is in fact necessary to reprogramme expenditure for these two systems so as to spread the cost over the following three financial years 2004 to 2006, 2006 being the deadline for the SIS II system to become operational and therefore ready to fully integrate the countries that will join on 1 May 2004.
Finally, I would like to thank Parliament for its idea of creating an Erasmus programme for judges; the Commission will try to conduct a pilot project.
I turn now to the field of information and communication.
Following the adoption of the Bayona de Perogordo report, 2003 was the first year in which we developed a new information and communication strategy for the general public.
You will remember that the cornerstone of this strategy is cooperation with the Member States, the establishment of partnerships with the Member States.
I am pleased to say that the interinstitutional group on information and communication has managed to reach broad agreement on what should be the priority subjects for such public information and communication campaigns.
I am speaking not only of the euro, but also of enlargement, the future of Europe, the area of freedom, security and justice and, for next year 2004, the role of Europe in the world, including a specific line to support information campaigns in the field of defence.
Let us be clear, however, and in saying this I am trying to answer the comments made by Mr Ferber just now.
This is in fact the second time I have tried to answer him today, but he is never there to hear me.
I nevertheless hope that the message will get to him.
When we are talking about partnership, we have to rely on the Member States being available to take part in such a partnership.
For example, EUR 4 million were reserved for such partnerships with the Member States for the information campaign on the Future of Europe.
Up until now, however, only three Member States have said they are willing to reach an agreement with us in order to develop the campaign on the future of Europe.
Since partnership is built on a voluntary basis, what the Commission has done is to allocate those EUR 4 million that were not used by the partnership with the Member States to other funds.
Until the end of this year, therefore, we are covering the expenditure for the entire budget for the Future of Europe programme, including an invitation to tender for an audiovisual campaign on the future of Europe, amounting to EUR 4 million, and the reallocation of EUR 3.7 million for the production of printed objective information material for distribution at the end of this year and early next year on the conclusions of the Convention.
I would also like to stress, as Mr Perry has said, that we attach great importance to the use of audiovisual systems.
For this year 2003 we therefore have EUR 4 million for an audiovisual information strategy on enlargement, EUR 4 million for the Future of Europe and EUR 8.5 million for audiovisuals providing general information about the European Union, including the Euronews channel.
I agree with you entirely, Mr Perry, that we should meet Euronews' request as Parliament agreed.
What have we done?
We have granted Euronews EUR 1.5 million in accordance with the framework agreement signed with Euronews in 2001 and we have taken into account the further sum of EUR 3 million voted by Parliament.
Having said that, Parliament has clearly said that those three million euros were not to finance Euronews's administrative costs but to pay for its activities.
We have therefore suggested to Euronews that it submit to us programmes for information activities and we are perfectly willing to assess them and finance them by releasing the EUR 3 million by the end of the year.
You raised the question of the legal bases.
This aspect is not my direct responsibility but I do know that the Commission has already put forward proposals for the creation of legal bases for a number of entities, including Euronews.
I think that will be the best way of proceeding and the best approach for giving stability to such funding.
I will eagerly await Parliament's position on this matter.
Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioners, the way speaking time is organised is so mischievous and bizarre that I now have to speak again about transport problems and agencies.
Having said that, I very much support what my colleague Mr Hatzidakis has said, namely that we must keep the lines as they were in the preliminary draft budget because there are no savings to be made on these policies for the present.
I would like to take the opportunity, Commissioner, to respond to the problem of the policy of providing information to European Union citizens.
This subject will really be one of the most important in the years ahead.
You may know that several of us have tabled amendments to restore the lines to what they were last year.
The most important thing, however, is that all institutional communication should get as close to ordinary citizens as possible.
What worries me the most about the present communications policy is that we do not have the necessary tools to reach those who are going to vote.
The citizen's ignorance of the present machinery and the institutions as they will be is quite appalling.
You have the resources, Commissioner, but for goodness sake let us ensure that they go to the heart of our present-day society.
That would be a great step forward for the democratic future of our Union.
Madam President, I should like to talk about two matters: first, in my capacity as shadow rapporteur for the PPE-DE Group on various transport matters; secondly, as shadow rapporteur on the other institutions.
So firstly, I should like to address Mrs de Palacio and secondly, Commissioner Schreyer.
The TENs programme is a wonderful one, which allows transport, energy and telematics projects throughout Europe to be decided upon by the nation states themselves in order to connect the 15 countries now in the Union with the 10 countries coming in, embracing the whole of the European Union and making sure that each nation can build its part within the trans-European network.
I have nothing but full confidence in that programme.
I would just point out that there is an item of some EUR 225 million for studies relating to it in the budget, whereas the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, of which I am a substitute Member, says that they do not want more studies but more action and implementation on the ground.
With regard to the Marco Polo programme on transfer to other modes of transport, away from road traffic and the congestion which it causes, I give that my full support.
We need to have more telematics and computer information technology used to advance the efficient movement of goods and passengers throughout the European Union.
Touching upon the Galileo project, we need to maximise the use of the private sector.
I welcome this project.
I hope that we will not use it for automatic levying of tolls on lorries, but rather allow individual drivers of private commercial vehicles to avoid congestion by knowing their best route from where they are to where they want to go: in other words, to help the motorists rather than tax and hinder them.
On the other institutions, we have had useful discussions in the last day or two.
I was delighted to attend the conciliation meeting in July and pay tribute to Mr Magri and his superb chairmanship of that committee.
There was one matter that was left.
That was where our rapporteur, Mrs Gill, thought that the Commission and the Council were being generous - I would say extremely generous - in their attitude to the budgets proposed by three of the other institutions: the Court of Justice, the Committee of the Regions, and the Economic and Social Committee.
Whereas Parliament's budget is only going up by 13%, the Council's by 21% and the Commission's by 8% or 9%, the Court of Justice, for example, is asking for 57%.
I am delighted the Council has knocked that figure down to 46%.
But in an amendment that we tabled from the United Kingdom delegation, we are asking for a further, similar reduction.
The same applies to the Economic and Social Committee.
It asked for 33%, knocked down by the Council to 27%.
We want it down by the same percentage again.
The Committee of the Regions asked for 63% and was knocked down to 54%.
We want a further reduction to 46%.
We can afford these increases, but that is not the point.
We must get the best possible value for money from these other institutions and ask them to re-examine their budget spending.
Madam President, in the preliminary draft budget, a sum of EUR 39 million has been earmarked for the European Refugee Fund to cover the present fifteen Member States.
This is EUR 3 million less than in the budget for 2003.
This, despite the fact that the objectives of the fund are rather bold: promoting the integration of newcomers and organising solidarity between the EU Member States when receiving refugees.
In actual fact, a much larger fund is needed to share the responsibility effectively and put an end to the negative policy rivalry between the Member States to adopt the strictest asylum policy.
As long as three years ago, I, backed by this House, asked the Commissioner to make an assessment of how much money he would actually need in order to realise the Fund's objectives.
As I have never seen this assessment, I should like to remind him of this request.
It is particularly important to give this a lot of consideration, because the Commission will be presenting its plans for the financial perspectives in mid-November.
Mr Vitorino, I therefore rely on your courage.
Not only is there insufficient money in the Fund structurally speaking, the Fund's objectives are also at risk of being contaminated.
Less funds for the distribution of the cost of reception, but more emphasis on sharing the burden of repatriation policy.
In fact, the Member States now want forced repatriation to be paid for from the Refugee Fund.
However, the question as to who can stay and who has to go is still the subject of a debate between Member States, and is simply a national decision.
It therefore seems very wrong to me to pay European tax money for national decisions.
As long as we have not reached agreement on who can stay on European territory and who has to go, it seems wrong to cover the cost of forced repatriation from the European budget.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I believe that today finds us again at an important and decisive point in the history of Europe.
It is quite clear to us that small and medium-sized businesses are of particular significance in terms of Europe's economic development.
Whilst we have heard that in many contributions to today's debate, we know that we are directly affected by many developments on the international stage, one example being Basel II.
That is why we have decided to seize the initiative and introduce a pilot scheme facilitating guarantees through the European banks for especially small businesses.
I believe that such guarantees will play an essential part in the future of small- and medium-sized enterprises.
Support of this kind is especially important when businesses are being set up.
My second point is that we have just got through the failed assembly in CancÃºn, the failure of which is attributable to the presence in the ministerial conference of certain persons who make a very healthy profit from their own system and are therefore unwilling to do for their national economies something that we would see in a favourable light.
This leads us to believe that there is an urgent need for a parliamentary assembly in this area.
We want to lend our active support to this in future and to discuss the possibilities with parliamentarians from the countries in question, with the opposition in certain countries also being given the opportunity to state its position on international issues.
With this in mind, we should concentrate on representing Europe on the international stage, taking a share in decisions rather than just sharing in paying the bills.
Thank you, Madam President.
Madam President, first of all I would like to say to Mrs Guy-Quint that I agree with her entirely.
I think a successful information policy is a policy that gets as close as possible to the citizens.
That is why we developed this strategy of partnership with the Member States, including regional and local authorities.
It is an approach which also enjoys the support of the Committee of the Regions.
But if this approach is to succeed, there must be the political will for a partnership.
There must be at least two partners.
That is why I hope, so far as the campaign on the future of Europe is concerned, that the European elections, the national debate on ratification of the Constitution and the referendums that will be held in some Member States will next year all be further incentives, further reasons for the Member States to join in partnership with us to conduct information and communication campaigns on the future of Europe, on the content of the Constitution, and to conduct those campaigns as closely to the citizens as possible.
I am expressing here my complete agreement with the strategy that Commissioner Michel Barnier has just explained in answer to Mr Dell'Alba's question.
Madam President, I am going to be very brief because Parliament has supported all the proposals I have presented.
I would like to take this opportunity to expressly thank Mrs McNally and Mr Collins for their contributions to this work.
We have been working in great harmony over all these years and this has been the case once again in the discussion of these budgets.
I thank Parliament for its support for the proposals I have presented.
Madam President, Commissioners, Union support is needed in energy policy for the Trans-European Energy Network, the Intelligent Energy - Europe programme, sustainable energy systems and also nuclear safety projects.
The Union has set ambitious targets to promote renewable energy sources and combined heat and power production.
With regard to reaching these targets it is unfortunate that cuts in the area of research into energy have been proposed in the budget.
If we support the diverse use of local renewable energy resources we will improve security of energy supply and reduce dependence on imports.
The basis of transport policy must be the development of a versatile transport network, decongestion, improved safety and the promotion of sustainable transport.
The development of trans-European transport networks has not progressed in the way that was hoped for, owing to inadequate funding.
Only three of the 14 Essen projects have been finalised, and in the summer Mr Van Miert's group listed a number of new TEN-T projects.
The Union, for its part, must set aside the necessary funds for both the old and the new projects and take account of the needs of an enlarging Union.
For the internal market to function there have to be flexible transport connections between the different regions of the Union.
Transport connections in the peripheral regions are a vital necessity.
In the summer the Commission issued a communication on the development of transport in the Mediterranean region.
I think a similar communication should also be drafted with regard to transport in the north.
Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Pohjamo for his support, despite the fact that he is calling for more resources.
I would also call for more resources, of course, but we must be aware that we are dealing - my colleague Commissioner Schreyer has just discussed this - with specific financial perspectives and we have specific limits.
With regard to the support for renewable energy sources, as the honourable Member is well aware, we are dealing with this jointly with support for energy efficiency by means of the intelligent energy programme.
The honourable Member will think that this is not much money.
The truth is that we have approved it on a multi-annual basis and, in the end, we reached agreement with the Council.
Once we have agreements, I believe that we must conserve them and maintain them and I would therefore refer back to what we approved and adopted at the time.
With regard to the trans-European networks, I have said very clearly, with a view to the next financial perspectives, that the amount dedicated to trans-European networks must not be increased by 5, 10 or even 15%, but, in my opinion, by 600 or 700%.
In other words, it should be multiplied by 7. As simple as that.
We need some EUR 4000 million if we are really going to be able to act as the driving force behind the construction of networks of a trans-European nature, and not of a solely national nature.
These trans-European networks of a trans-European nature are necessary in view of the reality of the internal market and for the competitiveness of the European economy as a whole, and I can therefore only agree with the honourable Member but, I would insist, this cannot be done by modifying budgets, but by reviewing the new financial perspectives, given the great importance of the issue.
With regard to the transport networks, in relation to the energy sector, I have already presented specific projects for Euro-Mediterranean energy networks, which must allow, firstly, for the rationalisation of investments made in a series of countries and greater coordination and efficiency in investments, thereby achieving not just purely national benefits from certain investments, but providing a broader continental-type perspective.
When I talk about these Euro-Mediterranean energy networks, I am talking about Europe as a continent, not the European Union.
These networks also take account of neighbouring countries such as Russia, Belarus or the Ukraine.
In other words, the whole ring of friends included by President Prodi in his strategy.
Secondly, in the transport sector we are working on it, and I hope that in the near future we will be able to make it a reality.
Specifically, I was in St Petersburg a week ago discussing these very networks, and in this case they were even Euro-Asian, because we should be seeking systems to better integrate, in a continental sense, the European Union with our neighbours.
I would like to thank Parliament once again for supporting the proposals we have presented.
Madam President, as the day draws to a close, I would like to thank the Commissioners and Members of Parliament who have taken part in the debate and reflect briefly on what has been said.
This is clearly a constituent phase and, not least in the new Constitution, for instance, the European Parliament will be given wider, more extensive powers.
This is a welcome, inevitable, historical fact, and we have, without a doubt, given fresh impetus to the process which will certainly give the European Parliament greater autonomy, more clout and greater representativeness in the near future.
That said, we must focus for a moment on the points made during the debate.
Without mentioning any one issue in particular, I would like to stress that the Council is quite prepared to look at all the recommendations made.
Moreover, it must be said that, even in the introductory report and in the meetings which have taken place thus far on all the issues - including that of the availability of new posts for Commission staff and other matters such as the cut in preaccession funds and so forth - the Council has been completely open to reassessing the proposals on the basis of new approaches, new information and new decisions.
I would therefore like to say a word in defence of the Council - which has been somewhat ill-treated, so to speak, by some of the Members in their speeches - and explain that, in cases such as this, the Council has the task of seeking to realise and harmonise many different expectations.
Since the European budget is, of necessity, the result of prioritising and compromise, it is not always possible to say 'yes' to everybody immediately.
For precisely this reason, I would ask the Members not to make the mistake of attempting to criticise the intentions of others, for we all have the right to criticise our own intentions but, above all, we have a duty to display full confidence in others.
I believe that this is one of the principles of democracy, of our political culture, and I believe it is a principle that we all share.
It is precisely because we do have shared cultural models, because we believe in a united Europe, that we realise that there is a great difference between the management of power and politics.
Politics is the management of power harmonised according to a cultural model.
I believe that our shared cultural models will help us to achieve an excellent result at the next reading.
. (DE) Madam President, Mr President-in-Office, honourable Members, I too wish to be brief.
The importance of enlargement goes without saying, and it has also become clear how important the other priorities are for the 2004 Budget.
The debate has also, I believe, made it clear that the Commission must have the necessary human resources at its disposal.
This is an area in which I am grateful to the President-in-Office of the Council for being so frank in what he said.
I am quite happy to provide any information required by the members of the Committee on Budgets, by the Council, or by Parliament, and the Budget Directorate-General is also at your service.
If I might take up again the issue of the quality of public service at the European level, the Budget Directorate-General has a department with seventy staff to handle everything to do with drawing up the Budget - the drafting, the hearings, all the information, the transfers, the supplementary budgets, the lot. When I compare that figure with the numbers required in the Member States and compare the quality involved, I can say loud and clear and with a clear conscience that the service is first-rate.
Those who have any dealings with it will, I think, be able to back me up on that.
I would like to say how very grateful I am for this debate, and that I am confident that we will be able, once more, to produce a good European Budget for 2004, one that will do a good job of promoting enlargement.
. Mr President, I just want to thank those Members who have taken part in this debate.
I thank in particular Mr Magri and his officials for being here all this time.
As I said at the beginning, it is rare to have ministers here.
The Danes set this trend, and I congratulate Mr Magri for keeping it up.
I also congratulate the Commissioners who have participated in this debate.
On the whole, it has gone quite well.
However, occasionally we have strayed from the subject.
The idea of having the Commissioners here is to question them directly on specific issues, and not all Members have done that.
Perhaps we need to refine our act for next time.
All in all, although it has been long, it has been well worthwhile.
Thank you, Mr Wynn.
The debate is closed.
The next item is the Commission statement on the situation of the Alstom Group.
Before that, I am giving the floor to Mr Harbour for a procedural motion.
Madam President, am I right in thinking that there will be an opportunity for questioning the Commissioner under the catch-the-eye procedure at the end of his statement?
You did not actually say so at the beginning, but I very much hope that I and other colleagues here will have the opportunity to do so.
Thank you for your question, Mr Harbour.
The decision has, however, already been taken: you will not be able to ask the Commissioner questions at the end of his statement.
However, people have their names down to speak and will no doubt ask the Commissioner questions in the course of what they have to say.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the European Parliament for inviting me this evening.
I am always pleased to be offered the opportunity to examine competition policy issues with Parliament in greater depth, issues relating to which, incidentally, I have the honour to appear periodically before the Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
The subject of your invitation this evening, Madam President, is a specific file which is currently under examination and about which I must therefore observe a measure of discretion.
Within those limits, I am at your disposal to provide the explanations that will be asked of us.
What has the European Commission done about the Alstom file so far?
It has taken a decision and it has decided not to take another.
The decision to initiate the review procedure regards the support measures adopted by the French State on 2 August under an agreement with Alstom and a number of banks then the Commission was notified.
This decision to initiate this procedure was taken by the college on 17 September.
That was a perfectly normal decision.
I come now to the decision that was not taken.
It concerns one specific part of the support plan that was decided and announced on 2 August but has not yet been put into effect: state participation in Alstom's capital.
The Commission was unable to agree to an immediate participation by the French Republic in Alstom's capital because a measure of that kind, unlike other contributions of liquid assets, was likely to have irreversible consequences for the markets on which the Alstom Group is active.
On 17 September, the Commission therefore found that the conditions were such that the French authorities should be asked not to go ahead with a State holding in Alstom's capital.
The Commission, however, wanted to give France one last opportunity before proceeding with that injunction.
It therefore authorised me to adopt and execute, by 22 September at the latest and by agreement with President Prodi, an injunction for the suspension of certain aids unless the French authorities publicly agreed not to take measures automatically and irreversibly entailing a State holding in the capital of the Alstom Group without the Commission's prior approval as required by the Community rules concerning State aids.
Following speedy and fruitful contacts with the French authorities, I was able to note yesterday that they had agreed to amend the support plan in a way that satisfies the Commission's condition.
The French state will not therefore become an Alstom shareholder in the immediate future and will not adopt any measures likely to constitute equity capital, that is structural measures to which the Commission cannot agree without prejudicing the findings of the competition inquiry it will be conducting.
The state participation in the capital increase will be replaced by a fixed-term floating-rate note redeemable in shares.
It is a liquidity measure that may be converted into equity only if the Commission decides that the state participation in the capital increase presents no problems for competition on the markets in question.
Since France had agreed not to automatically acquire a stake in Alstom's capital and had promised that it would no longer present the Commission with a fait accompli, there was no longer any need for me to exercise the power given me by the college of Commissioners to order a suspension.
So that is the decision the Commission did not take.
The Commission is pleased with the constructive attitude taken by French authorities and in particular, I would like to stress, by Mr Francis Mer, the Minister for the Economy, Finance and Industry.
It was our duty to prevent the conditions of competition on the market from being immediately and irreversibly changed in Alstom's favour before the Commission had even been able to begin looking at the effect of the aids on the markets in question.
The changes made would probably have entailed an increase in the overall amount of aid granted.
This shows the knock-on effect of a capital increase and its irreversible effects.
In other words, it would never have been possible to restore the status quo.
I would like to point out that the amount of aids will also be one of the key factors that the Commission will take into account when examining the matter in depth.
The fact that it is not necessary to implement the suspending injunction does not, of course, at this stage mean that the Commission has approved the aids.
The measures as a whole are now going to be examined.
We will be able to undertake the in-depth scrutiny in a constructive spirit and will do so as quickly as the complexity of the matter allows.
The aim is to enable the undertaking to be restructured while at the same time preserving the proper working of the internal market, which is the only guarantee of sustainable employment.
In the course of its assessment, the Commission will check the undertaking's long-term viability and the proportionality between the amount of aid granted and what France will be willing to accept in return in order to preserve the conditions of competition on the markets in question.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to emphasise that there is absolutely no position of principle involved on the part of the Commission concerning the system of ownership of undertakings in the Member States.
You know as well as I do that the Treaty provides for and therefore imposes on us the strictest neutrality in the matter of public or private ownership of undertakings.
I am therefore very much aware that the suspension was not designed to prevent the French state's entry into Alstom's capital as such.
The Commission's desire was to prevent aid-constituting measures from producing irreversible consequences on the markets in question without the Commission's prior approval, that is in violation of the rules of the Treaty concerning state aid.
Please do not let it be said that the Commission is against the public ownership of undertakings.
As I have always stressed, it is not the Commission that asks a Member State to open the capital of public undertakings like the French Government is doing with ÃlectricitÃ© de France, for example.
Those choices are entirely up to the Member State concerned.
What the Commission does have a duty to do under the Treaties is to ensure that undertakings, whether public or private, comply with the competition rules.
As I said, I would like to stress the quality of our cooperation, based on a constructive spirit and one of confidence, with the French Government and Minister Mer in particular.
Some of the reactions and remarks heard from French political and economic circles recently would benefit from a more detached analysis.
I understand the feelings of the trade unions perfectly.
I am well aware of the Alstom Group's importance in the European industrial and social fabric.
On the other hand, I find it harder to understand the reference made here and there recently in the French debate to the European Commission acting like a lawyer and allegedly having no political awareness.
Can people not see the political value of preserving a single market with no distortions of competition, a necessary, not sufficient, true, but necessary part of a social market economy?
Can they not see the political merit of preventing a State from bypassing the rules of the single market the chief beneficiaries of which are European undertakings themselves and the possibilities for growth, including growth in employment?
Can they not see the political necessity of inspiring confidence in Europe as a whole by demonstrating to the citizens of the small and future Member States that the Commission, in its role of guardian of the Treaty, is not strict with the small ones and weak with the big ones?
Commissioner, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, speaking as I do on behalf of my group, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I would like to make three things very clear, especially to those who, following Commissioner Monti's statements, have forced today's debate upon us.
Any criticism of the Commission is unfounded, and there is no reason to change competition policy; on the contrary, indeed, we owe a debt of gratitude to the Commission and, above all, to Commissioner Monti, whose actions over recent days have been marked by calmness, consistency and frankness, and who has been willing to engage in dialogue.
On 17 September, we read in Agence Europe that Commissioner Monti had said, 'We are open to dialogue, and I am still confident that we will find a solution capable of safeguarding the integrity of the Common Market without distorting competition.
This is a necessary condition for healthy European industry and for lasting employment.'
On 22 September, again in Agence Europe, Mr Monti had this to say: 'The Commission has never had negative prejudices against France and Alstom, but it was our duty to check that no direct and irrevocable change was made to conditions of competition in the market.'
He went on to say: 'I am happy to let it be known that the French authorities have fully complied with the Commission's conditions'.
End of quotation.
This is, of course, a sensitive case, but it is an issue of state aid. Yes, of course this company is of enormous importance on our continent.
The Commission cannot, however, make adherence to EU law conditional on the size of a company and the number of people it employs.
When questions are raised or something goes wrong, it has to intervene. All over the media, we read today's headlines: 'All banks agree rescue plan.'
'French industrial giant Alstom saved!' 'Alstom shares fall after initial rescue.'
'Paris urges Alstom industrial conglomerate to restructure.' 'Battle for the future of 110 000 jobs.'
This is a sensitive issue, but can we really claim that we would have wanted or expected the Commission to act in a different way?
I can speak for my group when I say that no, we would not, even though our hearts are in the right place where the associated problems are concerned and there is adequate awareness of the problems associated with it.
Let me remind you of three articles in the new constitution.
Article 3(2) will read: 'The Union shall offer its citizens an area of freedom, security and justice without internal frontiers, and an internal market where competition is free and undistorted'.
In Article 4(2), we adopt and put on the record our prohibition on discrimination within the internal market as a domestic market.
In Article 5(2) we lay it down that 'Member States shall facilitate the achievement of the Union's tasks and refrain from any measure which could jeopardise the attainment of the objectives set out in the Constitution.'
In Lisbon, we resolved to become, by 2010, the most competitive continent in the world.
Let me emphasise that state subsidies need to be approved.
Anything that distorts competition cries out to be investigated by the Commission, after conditions have been fulfilled and time limits have elapsed.
Anything that goes against EU law must be prohibited.
All discrimination is banned.
Whatever weakens the internal market is irresponsible, as it damages growth and employment.
My group has committed itself to the social market economy, and hence also to social responsibility.
We are committed to the internal market and to competition, on which the creation of new jobs and growth depend.
Commissioner Monti is its independent regulator.
He has our entire support, and he has done the right thing.
Madam President, Commissioner, at our initiative, the Alstom trades union representatives have visited the European Parliament on several occasions.
As long ago as 1999, they condemned serious management errors committed by the group's directors.
On 17 February 2000, here in Parliament, we adopted a resolution expressing a warning about the future risks facing the business.
At the time, certain people stood up to speak and, in the name of the sacrosanct principles of liberalism, condemned this as an incongruous and, inevitably, incompetent intrusion of politics into economics - an experience that should give us all pause for serious thought.
The coordinator of the Alstom Europe unions, Mrs Francine Blanche, was telling me yesterday evening that the employees were naturally pleased about the Commission's approval, in principle, of the rescue plan.
However, they remember the many warnings given by their elected representatives, warnings that have never been taken seriously at any level.
They are not about to agree to be the victims of this rescue now.
Mrs Blanche gave me to understand that, since his appointment in January of this year, the new chairman of the group, Mr Kron, had devoted no more than two hours to discussions with the European representatives of the employees.
Such arrogance is no longer tolerable.
The need is enormous, and the demands are loud for those employees to exercise their rights as employees.
Already, Commissioner, Alstom's European trades union coordinators are asking to be received, heard and listened to by the Commission.
In the meantime, they will have studied the plan in detail and will be in a position to propose measures to achieve savings which will not take the form of job losses.
That is what will happen in the immediate future.
After that, this enormously important affair places certain major questions squarely on the agenda of the debate on the future of the European Union.
I shall mention three of these.
The first of these issues is the social dialogue, or rather the essential new rights of employees.
Those timid and dust-covered directives on informing and consulting workers and on the European Works Council must be revised.
Real rights must be established, even the right to suspend a restructuring plan so as to enable a second expert opinion to be obtained and all the available options considered.
The second issue is that European industrial policy does not exist.
All that exists is a race for state aids in the name of the competition rules.
Yet in the present case, conversely, if there had not been any state aids, world economic competition would have been seriously distorted, given, on the one hand, what would be left of European industries in the strategic sectors of energy and the railways and, on the other, American giants such as General Electric, or those of Japan such as Mitsubishi.
Thirdly, the democratic functioning of the Union makes it necessary to review the discretionary powers granted to the Commission in competition matters.
It is essential that the social partners, the national parliaments and, of course, Parliament should have their say as regards the criteria to be met, the objectives to be assigned, and the controls to be exercised.
Where would have been the legitimacy, in the minds of our fellow citizens, in implementing the Commission's initial threat to refuse the rescue plan for a strategic business which employs 118 000 people?
Finally, the Alstom case is a powerful reminder of the essential political choices to which the public debate on the European constitution will be leading us.
For all these reasons, it was well worth adding this item to our agenda.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let us be clear about this, the Alstom affair, in its European dimension, is first of all a matter of form.
The Commission was perfectly right to sanction the French Government for the arrogance and contempt for the common rules which it has demonstrated in this affair.
This incident is only part of a long series of incidents.
The way in which Mr Raffarin's government openly flouted the provisions of the Stability Pact, even though President Chirac had been one of its initiators and unconditional supporters, will make it difficult to renegotiate that pact, something that even Mr Prodi himself describes as stupid.
There are other examples, such as the Raffarin government's contempt for the Directive on the conservation of wild birds and the Natura 2000 Directive, which resulted in the massacre in the wetlands of Poitou.
The icing on the cake is Mr Raffarin's statement in which he talks about the legal requirements for the executive authority of the European Union as if it were some office in a foreign country.
For this shameful statement I should like, on behalf of the great majority of French people who are aware of the fact that Europe is not a foreign country but rather our joint home, to offer our apologies to the Commission.
Agreement has been reached today, and in this I rejoice.
It will make it possible to save Alstom from imminent bankruptcy, something for which the directors, and those of ABB, are entirely responsible, despite warnings from their union members.
It will give the French Government and the Commission time to negotiate formally a final solution.
Having said that, Competition Commissioner, I should like to say a few words about the substance of this affair.
You are aware that our group, the Greens, has loyally supported your efforts to defend consumers against the abusive practices of monopolies. My report on competition in 2001 bears witness to that fact.
Nevertheless, I made certain observations which we have discussed in detail face to face, not only between Commissioner and MEP, but also between one economist and another.
The Alstom affair once again gives me the opportunity to tell you this.
Consumer protection consists, first of all, in guaranteeing consumers the existence of the supply of goods or services, before even thinking about the price of those goods or services. In other words it consists in implementing an industrial policy.
The disappearance of Alstom, which would have caused the collapse of Asean Brown Boveri, would have greatly reduced the European supply of electricity turbines and high-speed trains, just at the time when the climate crisis and the Kyoto Agreement are calling for enormous investment in these two areas.
Then again, what applies in the case of network infrastructures, where economic theory shows that monopolies and public subsidies are sometimes preferable to pure competition, often applies, ipso facto, to the oligopoly which is responsible for constructing and maintaining those networks.
Finally, the brutal way in which the Raffarin Government was put in its place was perceived by the employees and the people who live in the regions concerned as a piece of brutality and inhumanity directed against them personally by a Europe which is once again being experienced as a foreign and hostile institution.
In the final analysis the position of the Raffarin Government means privatising profits and nationalising losses. I do not approve of that and neither do you.
You need to be able to demonstrate that European competition policy is aimed at keeping excessive profits in check and promoting the supply of public goods.
Madam President, Commissioner, the people of France have had the feeling that, quite apart from the debate about any aid which the French Government may or may not decide to provide, there is an ego problem between Mr Mer and yourself.
I should like to say right away that that is a matter which is of no interest to us.
We are not here to give you our support, any more than we are here to give Mr Mer our support.
The question we have to consider is simple: does Europe, the European Union - and more specifically the Commission of which you are a member - have a clear industrial policy?
Ought we to have blind faith in you?
The answer is 'no'.
I do not see any clear industrial policy.
As for having blind faith in you, the decisions which have been taken by the Court of Justice, which have overturned three of the decisions which you had taken, demonstrate only too well that this is not possible.
I do not doubt your good intentions, but I do doubt the efficacy and the justice of the decisions that you take.
At all events this affair has revealed that even the European Commission, whatever its claims, when confronted with an exceptionally serious problem involving one country, cannot do anything either.
I would be the first to admit that the French Government has presented its case badly.
However, I would also like to say that the way in which you yourself have reacted is not calculated to help Alstom either.
Finally, it would seem that both sides have now seen reason to some extent.
I would add, in conclusion, the Mr Lipietz is in the wrong place.
If he wants to criticise the French Government, he should not do it here, because it is not the job of this House to judge the French Government. Come and do it in a different forum, Mr Lipietz, in our own country, where people will be able to give you an answer.
Madam President, Commissioner, our experiences of recent days involving the Alstom affair remind me a little of the story of the man who, when he was asked why he kept hitting himself on the head with a hammer, replied that it was because it felt so good when it stopped.
Admittedly, Mr Monti, your strong-arm tactics enabled you to impose your will on the French Government.
Let us admit it: you even made it look ridiculous. That government, which had rejected all the figures on the Friday, then spent the weekend producing a whole lot more, with the support of every bank in the country.
You have won then, but at what price?
All Europeans now know that Brussels can sacrifice 120 000 jobs without losing sleep over it, that it can ruin such prestigious industrial sites as Belfort or St-Nazaire, simply in order to get its own back. Mr Pasqua mentioned this a moment ago - the wounded pride of a European Commissioner.
You are playing with communities, Mr Monti, simply in order to satisfy unimportant dogmas and your own vanity. You are not a lawyer, Mr Monti.
Indeed, to call you a lawyer would be a compliment, since there are many lawyers who are actually working in the interests of families and their inheritance. You are only a bailiff, the man who carries out the process of seizing this social market economy, which can best be summed up as follows: the market is economising on society.
Mr Monti, we, the people of France, already have you to thank for the fact that PÃ©chinet was abandoned.
You did not allow us to buy back Alcan, even though you could have done so.
We might have had you to thank for the ruin of Schneider and of Legrand.
Do you not sometimes think that you are to European industry what Torquemada was to the Catholic religion? In other words, you are playing the grand inquisitor in hunting down state aids just as the good Torquemada, if I may put it this way, hunted down heresy, sodomy and to some extent, let us admit it, Jews.
Madam President, following on as it does from the debate in France about the budget austerity pact, the arrogant and dogmatic handling of the Alstom affair by the European Commission is symbolic, and full of lessons to be learned for the future.
It is an extremely bitter foretaste of the future that lies in store for a Europe of nation states in thrall.
The people of France, surprised and shocked, have suddenly discovered the reality of Europe, a technocratic and imperialist octopus, which puts balance sheets before people, and Community legalism before enterprise.
It is not a Europe of industry, growth and employment that the Commission is preparing, but rather a vast industrial wasteland, a Europe of delocalisation, unemployment, economic decline and social vulnerability.
France has gone from independence to dependence, from liberty to submission, to the extent that it is now reduced to sending its government to beg our lords and masters in Brussels for new conditions and for new time limits - a pitiable and humiliating spectacle!
Finally, an agreement obtained only after a hard fight will not hide for long the vital need for the French people to recover their freedoms, their economic and social independence, their political sovereignty and, quite simply, their dignity.
Madam President, Commissioner Monti, ladies and gentlemen, the threat of the Alstom Group's imminent bankruptcy has been averted through a compromise solution between more than thirty lending banks, the French Government and the Commission.
The support package amounts to EUR 2.8 billion.
EUR 2.8 billion, that is a generous package, and it could also be said that it is, for the most part, a generous present from the state that is of doubtful benefit.
In my view, it is impossible to eradicate from Europe the erroneous belief that money can be used to prop up uncompetitive structures.
I would argue for temporary support to avoid structures breaking down and to allow them to change, but I am concerned that even in this way uncompetitive structures will continue to be supported.
The convertible loan, which is on the cards as a compromise, is nothing more than an invitation to the French state to exchange this for shares after this enquiry, which would once again result in the re-nationalisation of Alstom.
It is precisely this mindset in Europe of not wanting to allow structural change, the belief that state money should, as a matter of principle, be used to avoid structural change, that is damaging for Europe as a business location.
The International Monetary Fund has once again pointed out that it is the large states, Germany, France and Italy, that act as bottlenecks on the continent and are thus responsible for the fact that the next boom will probably pass Europe by.
The elimination of businesses that cannot sustain competition is part of the market economy, and, let me add, also part of the social market economy.
Something else of importance for me is that today, Mr Monti, we can read the headlines saying that the test of strength has been passed.
I see that as positive and I should like to congratulate you on this in this House.
It was important that the French state should not put before the Commission a fait accompli without being asked.
No, this European Union is a Community based on the rule of law and this includes competition law.
I can only invite all national states to heed this law.
From 2001 to date there has been an increase in state aid - EUR 88 billion to date within the European Union - that is revealing and something to fear.
I think that the nation states are well advised to adhere to competition law, in particular on the eve of the enlargement of the European Union.
Madam President, firstly I wish to tell Mr Monti that I will not be engaging in any personal attacks on him - he has an extremely difficult job.
However, let me just say, in reaction to the previous speaker, that businesses just stop - they go out of business.
That is the reality.
We have to remind ourselves of what we are trying to address tonight, which is the reality of 110 000 jobs.
The reality is that if you do not have a job, you cannot pay your bills or support yourself.
This House needs to recognise that we must come together to create better social dialogue and a better awareness and social responsibility for those in employment.
In the United Kingdom alone, 10 000 jobs rest with Alstom.
We need to support Alstom.
The uncertainty over the aid is not helpful.
