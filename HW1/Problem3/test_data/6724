Whatever side of the political divide we come from, we all agree that more needs to be done to achieve a more effective Europe-wide employment strategy.
Many of the proposals in Mr Mann's report and some of the amendments will help towards this final goal.
However, we must also learn from the mistakes of the past.
In particular, the guidelines need to be simplified and reduced.
Appropriate targets have to be put in place to guarantee the delivery of proper results rather than a mere tinkering with figures.
We need to create proper conditions for full and stable employment to improve quality and productivity at work and labour market cohesion.
We need to ensure that all employment policies are people-centred, not merely a response to an urgent need in one or other Member State.
Our strategy requires not only that people be given training and skills but also that there be no discrimination between men and women.
This year, in particular - the International Year of the Disabled - we should also be working more actively towards integrating people with disabilities into the workforce.
We must maintain and improve the incentive to work.
The most effective way is by guaranteeing proper wages and ensuring that people can maintain as much of their own earning potential as possible to reduce labour taxes.
However, this is where we differ from some of the speakers and from the proposal in Mr Mann's report, in particular Paragraphs 11 and 13, which deal with taxation.
These issues are exclusively for Member States.
If a Member State, or a group of Member States, wishes to follow the best practices of another Member State, then so be it.
However, you can look at all the models that you wish and analyse all the processes that have been put in place but the only way of increasing employment that has been successful is the reduction of labour costs.
My last point concerns my own amendment to Paragraph 24.
The purpose is to boost consumer confidence through proper corporate social responsibility, which can create and contribute to higher innovation performance.
The idea is to distinguish between how an enterprise relates to internal stakeholders, shareholders and employees.
Corporate social responsibility can also have beneficial effects in terms of building good relationships with consumers, suppliers and others. If we can deal with the question of taxation, we can all support this report.
However, the question of taxation has to remain outside the responsibility.
Mr President, first of all, I wish to congratulate Mr Mann on this report, which makes an excellent contribution to defining a future strategy for employment and social policy in the European Union.
Now that five years have passed since this strategy was launched, this is the right time to assess the experience, to evaluate its weak points and to try to provide responses that are both realistic and bold, to the emerging challenges that are common to the current and future Member States and bring them into line with the aims of the Lisbon strategy.
The strategy for employment has undeniably contributed to reducing unemployment, but we are today facing a different scenario, with Europe's economy in a period of stagnation, a situation to which the Member States must pay particular attention.
We must also focus on clear issues, on adopting global priorities in the medium term and on achieving results.
One of these issues is that of active ageing as a response to the demographic challenge, whilst not forgetting young people and the least-favoured social groups.
Recent history has shown that the greater the involvement of regional and local policies in policies adopted at national and at European level, the more the strategy for employment has to gain.
The importance of the role of the social partners, civil society and non-governmental organisations in achieving the objective of full employment and of better jobs for all cannot be over-emphasised.
The report rightly highlights the role of the small and medium-sized enterprises in particular.
These have indeed been the driving force behind job creation in Europe.
Consequently, measures promoting the creation and existence of SMEs will surely have a positive effect both on the quantity and quality of jobs created.
I also wish to highlight and express my total agreement with the idea of cooperation between the various universities, in addition to there being a genuine interface between universities and businesses.
Lastly, I shall refer to the principle of equal opportunities: a lasting increase in the general employment rate is only possible if the female employment rate is strongly improved, and this will require effective measures to square the demands of family and professional life.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, following the conclusions of the Lisbon Council, the various reports voted upon here in Parliament dealing with employment have consistently highlighted the need to strike a balance between quantitative and qualitative development of employment, or between economic development and social development.
The strategy implemented has made genuine progress possible, and, as has been stated, Commissioner, we fully support the proposals regarding the way in which you plan to follow up this work.
Today, however, in a difficult context, a context of waves of company restructuring and mass redundancies that are increasing instability on the job market, the European Parliament must once again send out a strong, clear signal.
Mr Mann's own-initiative report, however, takes the opposite view to the message we should be sending, presenting to us an exclusively liberal creed, and the work carried out by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs in order to balance the text is in danger of being completely nullified by the amendments reintroduced in plenary.
Mr Mann, what we need today is not just increased flexibility: we also need a policy that is both durable and flexible.
We do not want second-class jobs or deskilled casual work, as you are proposing.
We must focus on training and qualifications, and support the most vulnerable categories, which are women, young people and the elderly.
Nor do we want a policy that insists on seeing fiscal pressure as the cause of all evils in this matter.
Nor do we want deregulation, uncontrolled opening up of the service trade markets, sacrificing all the social acquis on the altar of free competition.
If the report were to be amended in the way you are proposing in plenary, we would have to oppose it.
I shall end, Mr President, by saying that, in promoting employment strategy and social policy in the European Union, which is the title of the report, we cannot overlook the principles of solidarity and social cohesion, which are guarantees of the prosperity of our economies.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not know whether I shall find anything much to add to Mrs Gillig's superb speech.
I believe this report will not allow me to move towards workers at Metaleurop, Alstom, France TÃ©lÃ©com or many other companies, who are currently clearly threatened by mass restructuring and harsh, unacceptable mass redundancies, often due, furthermore, to shareholders' completely uncontrolled actions.
In this context, the endless calls for social dialogue are a rather surreal figure of speech.
The commitment we must make today is very clearly to a policy of democratisation within companies that breaks with this unacceptable way in which employees are currently hired and fired, given intermittent work or made redundant.
I believe that the social situation, which is further exacerbated by the economic recession, is currently creating a despicable climate to which this report is certainly not capable of responding in a credible way.
Must we, in this kind of situation, forbid ourselves from investigating, from taking a closer look - I am well aware that it is rather unusual to talk about this in this House - at certain experiments in reducing working hours, negotiated experiments which create jobs, which have considerably improved the economic performance of certain large companies, which have considerably improved the quality of social relations in the workplace and the quality of work?
Must we prevent ourselves from taking a look at these experiments and drawing the conclusions that, in my opinion, are generally extremely interesting?
Must we stop ourselves examining the capacity to develop many activities that are useful socially or for environmental management and whose potential we suspect, but which, I regret to say, receive very little support or recognition.
I believe it would be far more interesting to show imagination, rather than to keep trotting out old-fashioned ideas that we have heard all too often.
We must start to show an interest in this kind of debate and initiative.
Mr President, since the Lisbon European Council set itself the target of making the EU the world's most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy by 2010 - an economy that can create sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion - we can ask ourselves how matters have developed since then.
In short, nothing has happened.
The increases in the United States's and our own competitiveness have been so markedly different that the discrepancies between the United States and the EU have increased, rather than decreased, since that target was set.
We therefore have a very great problem, and all we can say is that, up until now, the Lisbon strategy has not worked at all and that the target is now even further away than it was when it was adopted.
As will have become apparent from the debate in Parliament, there is too much bureaucracy and there are too many regulations. What we lack is training, better access to capital and a long list of structural changes to enable us to cope successfully in the new knowledge-based economy.
The key to progress will be more basic research so that the new knowledge can quickly be converted into exciting, well-paid and interesting jobs.
I want to say that Mr Mann's report is a step in the right direction in promoting economic growth and increasing the number of jobs in the Member States.
He emphasises the importance of small and medium-sized businesses and sets out a long list of initiatives that I believe will enhance the process.
Mr President, unlike the rapporteur, who spoke earlier, I believe that the European employment strategy has played a major part in combating unemployment thus far and that it has had a positive effect on national labour market policies - not in all the Member States, of course, but certainly in some.
Then, because of the ambitious goals we set ourselves, the Lisbon Summit was a decisive step, with the goals being updated each year by specific indicators, just as the Commission's assessment of the national plans and the respective recommendations are a point of reference and an incentive to follow the example of those countries which are more successful than others in obtaining positive results by means of a proactive policy involving the social partners at all levels.
Each year, the European Parliament has consistently succeeded in its resolutions in finding the right balance between flexibility and security and putting economic policy, employment policy and social policy on an equal footing.
Now, in the face of the new generation of guidelines proposed by the Commission, which seek, as has been said, to achieve three objectives - to bring the employment rate further into line with the Lisbon objectives, to improve the quality of jobs and to promote a labour market which is open to socially vulnerable groups - it is a little surprising that the rapporteur proposed in committee and is proposing once again in the form of amendments in the House a series of instruments - reducing taxation across the board, recourse to what is known as 'minor work', the introduction of excessive flexibility - which are incompatible with improving job quality, investment in human resources or effective reconciliation of family and professional life which is not detrimental in terms of security.
I feel that these instruments serve the purposes of the ideological debates taking place in some of the Member States - Italy, for example - rather than stimulating and coordinating the Union.
This line was partially adjusted in committee and the result is more balanced, and that is why, as has been said, we do not support the amendments.
I would like to end with a comment.
Mrs Bastos rightly upheld the paragraph of the resolution which calls for greater cooperation between universities and research centres. It is a shame that her group has tabled an amendment seeking to replace cooperation with competition.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I do not think I am in danger of being complacent, as figures are not really open to interpretation.
I might only be looking at one side of the coin, however.
Nonetheless, it is pleasing to note that the number of people unemployed in the European Union has fallen dramatically. The total stood at 17 million in 1997 but by 2002 it was down to 13.5 million.
The scenario and pace are now quite different.
Of course, I have to admit there is another side to this coin. A hard core of 7.4% of the unemployed have never actually worked, have lost their job, or face major obstacles in getting back into work.
In general, these are older people.
At least, they are likely to be too old to benefit from schemes for the young, and too young to be considered for early retirement.
Alternatively, they might be young and lack the necessary experience and training.
I have already referred to two groups in particular need of protection or initiatives, namely the young and older people who have lost their job.
Turning to a third such group, on 8 March we celebrated International Working Women's Day, and its memory should still be fresh in our minds.
Women also need support.
It is important to honour the commitment given at the Lisbon Council, namely to ensure that over 60% of women are in employment by 2010 at the latest.
The proposal we are debating today encompasses three main objectives. These are to increase the rate of employment, to improve job quality and to open up the labour market to the most disadvantaged groups in society.
2003 is the year of the disabled, and this should be in the forefront of our minds.
In addition, the horizontal policies so frequently referred to in the House must permeate all our activities.
It is difficult to rank these horizontal policies, but health and safety in the workplace, equality and sustainable development are certainly amongst the most important.
It is also vital to ensure the involvement of society as a whole and of all levels of administration, regardless of how close they might be to the citizens.
The enlargement countries will be watching our activities with interest too.
Mr Mann's report takes account of all these considerations. The report is to be commended in its original version, and also as it now stands following the improvements made in committee.
I congratulate Mr Mann and call for a vote in favour of this report.
Mr President, there can be no doubt that Europe was in need of an employment strategy in 1997 even though the economic cycle was at a high and it was possible to argue that the market itself would provide for our needs. In the light of the present situation, however, it is even more necessary to make every effort to improve this strategy, particularly as we face up to a war situation and its aftermath.
The Commission's communication and reform must therefore be more than welcome. Let us hope that the second half of the decade that began in 1997 will actually surpass the first.
I must begin by echoing what other Members have said.
I do not know whether to start by commenting on Mr Mann's report or on the amendments to it. Further to the statements made by the rapporteur and by Mr Pronk, I find I am bound to state strong opposition to all the amendments.
Mr Mann's report does indeed contain a number of positive ideas.
These enjoyed broad support in committee. Unfortunately, the amendments amount to a strong reaction against the most sensible and balanced ideas of the European strategy for ideological reasons.
I should like to focus on the objectives and point out that there can be no valid strategy if the objectives are scaled down.
As the Commissioner stated, the Lisbon objectives are crystal clear. There is no doubt that the objectives for the coming five years are more jobs, better job quality and better social inclusion.
Mr Mann, more jobs is not synonymous with full employment.
It is not acceptable to maintain that it was over-ambitious to hope to attain the rates of employment set at Lisbon.
That is backtracking.
Similarly, better quality is not synonymous with lower taxation, nor is more social inclusion synonymous with fewer fiscal demands.
Public resources will be needed to launch proactive policies and to ensure those in danger of being excluded from the labour market are drawn into it.
If these amendments are adopted, I shall therefore be obliged to vote against your report, Mr Mann, along with many other Members in my delegation.
Mr President, I hope that my good friend Thomas Mann has forgiven me for not voting for the report in committee, and indeed that he will forgive me again, as he knows I will not be supporting it in the plenary.
There are many points that I welcome in his report; the recognition of the need to deliver the Lisbon conclusions, the encouragement and support for SMEs and the need to improve employment of disadvantaged groups in society.
But I do not accept the basic thrust of the report that one of the solutions is to strengthen the roles of the social partners.
I am all for social dialogue, but this should be between employees and employers within their companies.
The rapporteur confirmed the importance of SMEs as the motor of employment, but SMEs have only a tiny voice within UNICE and most of their employees do not have membership of trade unions.
So within the social partners their voice goes virtually unheard, and yet the social partners presume to speak for them.
There was an interesting report in the UK press at the weekend about Germany: Chancellor SchrÃ¶der was apparently finding it increasingly difficult to get acceptance of much-needed labour market reforms because the social partners were blocking them.
A German minister was quoted as saying 'when it becomes necessary to drain the swamp, you don't stand around asking the frogs'.
With unemployment approaching 5 million in that country, the swamp is getting bigger and the need for change is very clear.
So I am all for social justice and social inclusion, but the biggest enemy of both is unemployment.
Governments need to do what is necessary to address this.
Clinging on to outdated concepts does not help; strengthening the role of the social partners simply leads to more paralysis.
If some countries wish to persist in this, it is of course up to them.
But please, rapporteur, please, Commissioner, do not inflict such concepts on the rest of us.
Mr President, Commissioner, today we are debating the future of the European Employment Strategy, at a time when the economy is seriously overshadowed by the threat of war in Iraq, rising oil prices and economic problems in the countries in the eurozone.
Unfortunately, the current labour market is not dynamic enough to create new jobs.
As far as women are concerned, to whom you alluded extensively, despite the increase in the number of working women, who now account for about 41%-42% of the total workforce, and the gradual increase in the number of women in purely male-dominated sectors, unemployment is far higher among women than it is among men.
The Lisbon objectives to improve the position of women in the labour market would appear to be some way off, given that unemployment is still about double among women: 14.6% compared to 8.7% among men.
We also note that exploitation is rife among women, with over 250 000 women working at home with absolutely no social protection.
At the same time, the black market is flourishing, relying heavily on hundreds of thousands of mainly female foreigners who are left out of labour and unemployment statistics.
The European Employment Strategy recognises the role that women can play in increasing employment rates, and we are delighted that it is moving towards eroding the differentials between men and women as far as wages and the representation of women in all sectors of the economy are concerned.
We are also delighted, Commissioner, with the importance you have attached to gender mainstreaming in all sectors.
However, it is clear from the statistics on the number of women in work that the policies already being applied require greater momentum and evaluation.
Most importantly, quantifiable, qualitative and quantitative targets need to be introduced at both European and national level.
For example, we could set ourselves the objective of halving the current differential between men and women on pay, training, pensions and promotions and the length of time women stay in work by 2010.
I hope the forthcoming spring Council will accept your proposals and that we shall have new national employment plans by the autumn, as you said in your speech.
Mr President, as we have discussed the individual subjects broached by the honourable Members on several occasions, I have just three brief comments to make.
The first concerns the objectives of the spring Council.
It is important that the Greek Presidency has made employment a priority at the spring Council.
This will be the second time since Lisbon that employment has been one of the Council's priorities.
Interestingly, it would appear from a series of initiatives between prime ministers over the last month that they are all promoting employment as a priority and at the spring Council, war permitting, it will be top of the agenda.
However, we must bear in mind that the quantitative target of full employment by 2010 set in Lisbon depended on two basic preconditions: 3% annual growth and the implementation of a reform package.
As far as the first target is concerned, we are clearly behind schedule.
In several countries growth is below 3%; in fact, a number of countries have almost zero growth, which by definition will make it very difficult to achieve our targets.
On the second issue, the positive evaluation of the employment strategy notwithstanding, numerous reforms need speeding up.
The message, as far as reforming the Employment Strategy is concerned, is that we cannot insist on reforms relating to the labour market and to the modernisation of social systems and to another set of policies relating to the employment strategy.
I think this is where the main difference lies; in other words, labour market reforms are part and parcel of the Employment Strategy, which is much wider and which, as many members said, ranges from taxation to education.
So we believe that it is very important that the spring Council and Parliament will be sticking to the Lisbon objectives; it shows that we all hope to be able to make up the last two years' lack of growth over coming years.
My second point has to do with discrimination.
Briefly, one of the three basic objectives is a non-discriminatory job market, and what we are proposing to the Council is that there should be individual quantitative targets for groups vulnerable to discrimination.
My third point has to do with women.
For the first time, more women than men have entered the labour market.
Of the ten million jobs created between 1997 and 2001, 75% were filled by women, a clear signal that our targets are being achieved and our polices are effective.
I shall of course be insisting on gender mainstreaming in all measures and priorities.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0063/2003) by Mr Friedrich, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the ECB recommendation for a Council decision on an amendment to Article 10.2 of the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank (6163/2003 - C5-0038/2003 - 2003/0803(CNS)).
Mr President, this is indeed an important issue.
What is at stake, after all, is the stability and development of our single currency, the euro.
At present, the voting modalities in the European Central Bank are as follows: we have twelve central bank presidents - or governors, if you will - plus six central bank directors, making a total of 18 votes.
That is a relatively small and manageable body.
Every member has full and unrestricted speaking and voting rights.
We can assume that sooner or later, other countries will join as well.
I hope that Great Britain will be one of them, but some countries from the Central and Eastern European accession candidates will undoubtedly join too, which means that it is essential to consider how these voting modalities can be amended and adjusted to the new dimension, given that in future, some 15, 20 or 25 countries may be part of the euro-zone.
The Council has now asked the ECB to draw up its own proposal on this issue.
Under pressure of time, a proposal has been drafted which really is not acceptable.
Let me cite just a few examples: it proposes forming three groups of countries, although it is very difficult to explain why any country is in a specific group.
I could do so, but it would take about ten minutes.
Of course, this system is not remotely transparent, especially since a rotation system would then be introduced.
This means that the first group comprising the 'biggest' countries would not take part in 20% of the votes, but would take part in 80% of votes.
In the other groups, it is entirely possible that a country, that is to say, a central bank governor, would not participate in as many as 40% of votes.
In practice, this could mean that a large country belonging to the first group would look precisely at when it is not entitled to vote, in a bid to influence the agenda and ensure that important items are excluded from the agenda when it has no right to vote.
This will mean that there will be massive debates about the agenda.
What is more, the details of this rotation system still have to be hammered out by the Central Bank's Governing Council.
As we can imagine, it is quite likely that a country which is not entitled to vote will make even greater efforts to influence the voting behaviour by delivering lengthy speeches during the debate.
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs - quite rightly, in my view - has now said that this model is not functional, transparent or efficient for such an important body as the Governing Council.
We have also taken the trouble to speak with academics from France, Germany and Great Britain because we believe that the academic sector should have an input here as well.
Last Monday, at 7.15 p.m., the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs accepted my proposal which - without any prior discussion on our part - is also endorsed by many other bodies and parties in this House.
We say this: we are not under any real pressure of time!
We say this: Let the Convention and the Intergovernmental Conference, put forward a new and better proposal.
It will be 2006 at the earliest, and most probably 2008 - in other words, four years - before any of the new Member States joins the euro.
So take time to work out a new, transparent and viable proposal!
We have presented two options in this context.
We have said that even if weighting is needed, there should be no rotation system.
Give us a 'one country, one vote' system every time, but with a weighting system based on population size, GDP and the relative size of the financial services sector - we were thinking to some extent of Luxembourg here.
We have also said that in the long term, you really do need to get down to brass tacks.
If confidence in the euro has increased to an adequate extent in a few years' time, the academics' proposal could be adopted. This entails differentiating between short-term operational decisions and long-term institutional/strategic decisions.
The short-term decisions could then be taken by the board of central bank directors - currently six, but in future perhaps nine people - while the strategic decisions, such as the overall monetary strategy and monetary policy instruments, could remain the responsibility of the Governing Council as a whole.
For this reason - and let me cite the relevant passage in English to conclude my brief speech - we are asking for 'calls for proposals to be made by the Convention in view of its adoption'.
I just want to say that the ideas I have put forward here have been drawn together in writing as a compromise amendment, for we anticipate that a new proposal - if these principles are accepted - will produce a better voting procedure than the untenable solution which has been put forward at short notice by the Governing Council, and which is not acceptable to anyone.
Mr President, in this my first intervention I should like to say a few words about the Commission's ruling. I shall outline our differences with Mr Friedrich's report and refer also to our final position.
Any reform of the Central Bank must comply with four conditions. Firstly, decisions have to be taken quickly and efficiently.
Secondly, decision-making bodies have to act taking account of the interests of the Eurozone as a whole. Thirdly, the system has to be impartial and fair to present and future Members.
Fourthly, the markets and the public as a whole have to be aware of transparency.
This is crucial to understanding the operation of the system.
The model advocated by the Central Bank does help to ensure efficiency.
Nonetheless, the key feature of the Central Bank's proposal is based on the enabling clause in the Treaty of Nice. It is therefore based on the premise that the system legally in force may not be modified.
I should like to return to this when I have heard what Mr Friedrich has to say.
The Commission is of the opinion that taking the European Central Bank's proposal as a point of departure, the rotation model may be improved by reducing the maximum number of voting rights on the Governing Council. Such improvement should be substantial.
It should involve adjusting the method of classifying countries into groups. There is no need to develop new types of weighting.
The Bank's own classification should be used instead. This takes account on the one hand of population and, on the other, of GDP.
Improvements are called for, however, to clarify the frequency and order of rotation in this type of voting.
This is the thinking behind our proposals.
Having considered the proposals in the report, we believe them to be ambitious, but find they pose a fundamental problem. They envisage interpretations going beyond the enabling clause.
We differ on this in two respects.
Turning to the most significant first, the report rejects the Central Bank's model and presents a counter-proposal. The latter is no doubt technically valid, but it is not in line with the enabling clause.
The notion of a double key, involving double weighting of the vote, is not in line with the clause either. This is because according to legislation currently in force, every Member of the Council must have a voting right.
Such adjustments are therefore better suited to a different context, to a more ambitious position, like the one you yourself referred to, Mr Friedrich.
The decision we have to take in the near future is whether or not to go ahead, following the accelerated procedure, and adopt the Central Bank's proposal.
A decision must be made within the next few weeks if it is to comply with the enabling clause. Were this to be the case, a unanimous vote in the Council of Ministers would be required.
As you are aware, this is still outstanding. Nonetheless, the Commission agrees with the House that a more thorough reform is called for.
Such reform should go further than what is envisaged under the enabling clause. We should be prepared to tackle it at the next Intergovernmental Conference on the basis of a different model.
As has been rightly pointed out, this can be done at the Intergovernmental Conference, but not under the current enabling clause.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we will all - institutions and politicians alike - have to review and reshape our communication strategies, priorities and working methods, but also our decision-making and opinion-forming processes in the light of the European Union's enlargement to what will probably be more than 30 states - if we include the Balkan countries - but also in the light of the political challenges which are being set for us and which we are setting ourselves.
Against this background, we welcome the fact that the ECB has put forward a proposal unanimously.
We also welcome the fact that a clear political message has been sent that the ECB should in future regulate its decision-making mechanisms itself, and that we do not want to make any special provisions here.
There is absolutely no reason why this decision should be adopted hastily, as the rapporteur has already pointed out.
We can continue in familiar fashion and prepare a fundamental reform with the next Intergovernmental Conference.
The fundamental reform which is necessary, and which we intend, differs in one key respect.
We say: everyone should remain on board; there should be no rotation principle; in a common Europe, everyone should have a say in the ECB.
The solution is not rotation but weighting.
This weighting could be based on the weighting in the Council, but must build primarily on economic and financial market policy parameters.
Rather than more complexity, we want greater transparency.
We do not want new forms of discrimination, but more integration and therefore greater clarity for the public.
Take us up on our offer, which is to prepare a comprehensive reform instead of an over-hasty short-term solution!
Mr President, I agree with the rapporteur: the proposal submitted for reform of the voting in the ECB Governing Council is not a step in the right direction.
It is because it was developed from the perspective of national representation, not a European perspective, that it must be rejected.
What we actually need is an ambitious European solution.
Here, no Member of this House can be neutral, for the way in which such a key macroeconomic partner arrives at its decisions is important.
We must therefore know how the decisions are shaped, but there is still time for that at the next Intergovernmental Conference.
Specifying that representation should be on a national basis conflicts with the aim of an integrated monetary policy.
However, I should point out here that when drafting its proposal, the European Central Bank's hands were tied, for the paltry spirit of the Treaty of Nice is also reflected in the enabling clause contained in Article 10.2, and we therefore do indeed need a proposal from the Convention for the Intergovernmental Conference so that a number of issues become clear: should the Executive Board have a special role?
Should we differentiate between monetary policy and operational decisions?
Where should the strategic decisions be taken?
This is possible with a unanimous amendment to the Treaty.
I really do think it is important for us to make this distinction, simply because it is necessary.
As the European Parliament, we also have a particular interest in doing so because we attach importance to transparency.
Like our colleagues in the USA, we want to be able to follow how decisions are taken and also how weightings occur in the discussions.
In this respect, the difficult proposal by the ECB, which we in the Socialist Group cannot endorse, sends out quite a hopeful signal - for up to now, we have always been told that the outcomes of the votes in the ECB's Governing Council could not be published because no votes take place.
I think that in a democratic system, majority voting should apply, and then the voting behaviour of the individual members of the central banks or the Executive Board can also be published.
I am all in favour of anonymity, so that no names are mentioned, as in the USA.
Our key concern is to gain an overview of the various perspectives on monetary policy.
This will remove confusion and insecurity, create the clarity that is required, especially at present, and underline the Central Bank's democratic duty of accountability.
Mr President, the European Liberal Democrats also reject the European Central Bank's proposal for a change in the way it takes decisions once the 10 candidate countries join the eurozone.
The ECB proposal would create a third class of Member State with fewer chances of voting and, outrageously, only candidate countries would be in this inferior grouping.
Tiny Luxembourg gets a special lift into the second group thanks to its financial markets, even though it has had a central bank for substantially fewer years than many of the candidate countries, including Poland and Hungary.
This is a proposal designed to protect the vested interests of the eurozone's existing central bankers.
They are just trying to pull the ladder up behind them.
We support instead an Executive Board of nine members, as Mr Friedrich has mentioned, taking operational decisions, plus a wider Governing Council that would involve all Member States' central bank governors in strategic decisions, such as the definition of price stability, and the emphasis on other objectives, such as monetary reference values.
As regards the proposal of the PPE-DE and PSE Groups that the Governing Council should decide by a double majority system, giving more weight to the members from the big Member States, we beg to differ.
We support the principle of one member one vote when it comes to decision-taking, and a double majority system implies that a Governing Council member from a big Member State is representing that Member State, rather than voting for the eurozone as a whole.
This would be retrogressive and would undermine the collegiate outlook of the Governing Council.
However, there should be some checks and balances on the Executive Board, which is why we propose that the Governing Council should be able to overturn decisions of the Executive Board by a two-thirds majority.
The Convention should look at this issue so that it can be discussed as openly as possible and with full consultation of all the interested parties.
Mr President, Commissioner, before us is a compromise which has achieved only one clear objective, that of unanimous consensus in the Governing Council, which is not exactly what the European Central Bank needs to prepare for enlargement.
The distribution of powers and responsibilities between parliaments, governments and independent authorities - the independence of the European Central Bank is a valuable asset which has worked well and must be safeguarded - does not give independent authorities the power to decide on their working procedures or, as in this case, on changes to the working mechanisms, particularly where it is a question of enlarging a club.
It is clear that the current members of the club have presented a proposal which, first and foremost, affords themselves and their prerogatives some protection against the prerogatives of the members who will join the club in the future.
It is absolutely obvious.
I believe there is a serious procedural defect that has led to this situation and to a proposal containing a number of shortcomings, which have already been pointed out by Mr Huhne, who said that the hierarchy of countries is dubious.
I hope Mr Goebbels will forgive me if I say, just by way of example, that I too believe that Luxembourg must not have a greater role than Poland.
Of course, the presentation of the European Central Bank's proposal is in line with the Treaty of Nice, which, moreover, stipulated that the Council could decide on either an ECB proposal or a Commission proposal.
I believe that we must somehow go back to square one and that the Commission must produce its own proposal, taking Parliament's recommendations into consideration.
The ECB will be consulted, but it cannot be allowed to be the promoter of this decision which concerns it so closely.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have adopted a clear position on the ECB Governing Council's proposal, Commissioner, but the Commission, unfortunately, has not done so.
You have shied away from it!
We want the Council of Heads of State or Government to devise and adopt a different model, with other weighting criteria being used in this context.
The draft on changes to the voting modalities proposed by the ECB Governing Council and endorsed by the European Commission, is unnecessary and unjust.
It is unnecessary because we are certainly not under the time pressure that you, Commissioner, have described.
Summer 2006, in a best-case scenario, is theoretically the earliest that we will achieve a figure of 15 eurozone members.
We therefore do have enough time.
With this model, you will create a two-class system among the members of the ECB Governing Council, with the governors of the smaller countries' central banks suffering a severe curtailment of their rights.
In a single currency zone, it is essential for every member of the ECB Governing Council to have a permanent and equal vote.
To ensure that this is guaranteed in future too, and thus to retain the existing rules, we have proposed that other weighting criteria should be used.
Our colleague Dr Friedrich has already spoken about this.
My proposal to use population as one of these criteria has not found support among a majority in the committee so far this time.
Since the rules have to be agreed unanimously, there will be no movement without a compromise.
The rotation system, Commissioner, is a bad compromise.
I have proposed that in addition to a simple majority of votes, at least half the population of the Member States of the eurozone must be represented.
This will avoid majority decisions being taken in the ECB Governing Council without taking sufficient account of the economic realities in the European Union.
Population as a criterion is more appropriate and more representative, for a variety of reasons, than other criteria such as the relative size of the financial services sector or GDP.
Current and precise population figures are available for all Member States; they are calculated on a per capita and therefore absolutely comparable basis, and take account of the fact that the primary focus of a rational monetary policy based on the EU treaties must not be on the capital markets, but on the people affected by it.
Mr President, Commissioner, the European Union, or at least some representatives of countries that are allegedly more important than the others, is suffering from a mystery illness, Gulliver's syndrome.
Whether within the Convention or in bodies such as the European Central Bank, representatives of the large countries believe they are under threat of being tied up by a gang of small countries, which are by definition irresponsible and which, following enlargement, will form the majority within the Council in terms of numbers.
Although it is true that the European Union theoretically brings together States that are equal in rights and duties, some, like George Orwell's pigs, believe themselves to be more equal than others.
The history of the European Union does not provide a single example of an alliance of Lilliputians against the Gullivers of Europe.
In fact, every case of obstruction in Europe, from de Gaulle's empty chair policy to Maggie Thatcher's famous 'I want my money back', has been the work of the large countries.
The Stability and Growth Pact was invented to establish budgetary discipline in the so-called 'Club Med' countries in order to guarantee the external value of the euro.
The Pact is respected by the small countries, but far less by the large countries.
Gulliver's syndrome, however, leads some capital cities to believe that governors from small countries might be led to impose a lax monetary policy.
The result of all these fears is the ECB proposal to restrict the number of governors deciding on monetary policy.
President Duisenberg claims that governors do not vote according to their national interests, that there are, in fact, no votes and that monetary policy is decided by consensus.
Why, therefore, this proposal to change the voting system?
We are told that it will no longer be possible to vote when there are 25 Members.
Although a discussion between 25 Members would certainly be longer, a vote for or against a change to key interest rates can take place just as easily with 25 as with 18 or 9 governors.
This is not, therefore, the real reason behind the proposed reform.
In fact, the five large States, which represent approximately three quarters of the Community GDP, want to be able to define monetary policy themselves.
In this regard, the ECB's proposal is ingenious, since it would set up a system of rotation between three groups of countries which would ensure that the large countries are able to vote in 80% of cases.
The Friedrich report proposes to restrict monetary policy decisions to an Executive Board of nine Members, which would be selected on the basis of the two-fold criteria of the population of each country and the total size of its economy and the relative size within it of the financial services sector.
As regards this latter point, the Friedrich report is in line with the unanimous proposal of the Governing Council.
However, there are still some doubts in relation to all these proposals.
As this is not a matter of urgency, why not grant us an additional reflection period?
Mr President, I would also like to respond to Mr Della Vedova that, according to the ECB proposals, Poland would still be ahead of Luxembourg.
Mr President, Commissioner, we all know that, in a larger EU, the ECB must be reformed, but the proposal presented by the ECB has not been sufficiently worked out.
It has also been severely criticised.
Mr Friedrich's report is along the right lines but, in common with others in Parliament, I wonder why there is all this hurry.
We should stop and reflect and produce a securely founded proposal for the next intergovernmental conference.
It is a requirement of democracy that voting rules be fairly simple and comprehensible.
Ordinary people too must in fact be able to understand them and how they work.
The principle should be one of 'one member, one vote'.
As Mr Huhne pointed out, the important requirement of efficiency can be met in an enlarged EU.
Commissioner, we must prevent an unduly divided Europe.
A division into A, B and even C teams is not acceptable.
The ECB must demonstrate greater openness, with public reporting of discussions and votes.
That is a requirement that cannot be abandoned.
Finally, we must in fact also strengthen Parliament's role.
Mr President, I want to thank the rapporteur, Mr Friedrich, for his sterling work on this matter.
The issue of the voting rules for the ECB's Governing Council is very important, especially in view of the forthcoming enlargement and, so too, of the probable expansion of EMU cooperation.
The present rules must be reformed.
Everyone seems to agree that reform is necessary.
It is not, however, entirely clear what that reform is to look like.
Mr Friedrich's report rejects the proposal put forward by the ECB on 3 February: a model with 21 votes on the part of 15 Central Bank governors and six auditors, and a rotating system once 16 or more countries have entered the currency union.
That means that, in the extremely near future, not all Member States' voices will be heard.
There will be a system in which not everyone participates, but which is nonetheless unwieldy and complicated.
If decision-making is unduly complicated, this will lead either to the Bank's not being able to respond quickly enough to economic changes or to decisions' not being seen as legitimate.
The rotation system will make it difficult to demand accountability, because it will become almost impossible to decide which individual or individuals is or are responsible for a decision.
Mr Friedrich's report, considerably compromised by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, proposes fundamental principles: the principle of one member one vote and principles concerning representativeness, transparency and accountability and about taking the lead in devising a new decision-making model that will be more efficient but also designed in such a way that all members still participate.
I think that this will be important for the small countries.
It will also be significant for the new Member States.
For myself, coming as I do from a country that is facing a crucial referendum on exchanging the krona for the euro, it feels only right and sensible to recommend a decision-making model that can be efficient and responsive in the long term and, at the same time, give everyone the opportunity to participate in a process in which it is also possible to demand accountability.
Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we knew that this matter would arise.
For a long time, it was too early to discuss it.
This was true, in particular, when, by means of a report presented in autumn 2000, we tried to discuss it within the context of our work on enlargement.
The report was by Mr Brok.
Today, it would be hasty to take a decision solely on the basis of the work of the European Central Bank.
The truth is that, in fact, the institutional solutions we adopt with regard to the Central Bank are sometimes frightening, because we sometimes have the impression that they could be imposed on other institutional mechanisms, or even the Union itself.
That is the reality of the debate we are holding here.
Essentially, I believe that the Convention can undo what the Treaty of Nice has done.
The Convention must be able to reverse proposals from the Central Bank because what is basically proposed is a change to the system, whether this involves the establishment of a rotation mechanism or differentiation between the decisions taken within the Central Bank.
Essentially, once again, I believe that we cannot reject the entire proposal made by the Central Bank, for example the idea of restricting the number of members of the Governing Council if we want this body to be able to continue to take decisions.
Essentially, I also believe that we should examine these proposals and try to extract what we consider to be the main points.
I believe we can extract some information, some criteria, from the experience gained by the Central Bank in its short life.
The first criterion is that the distribution of power between the Executive Board and the Governing Council must be examined carefully to ensure that the Bank is in a position to take decisions.
The second criterion, which the Chairman of our committee, Mrs Christa Randzio-Plath, has mentioned, concerns the transparency of decisions within decision-making bodies.
The third criterion concerns the Bank's ability to define monetary policy in the interests of the whole euro zone.
I believe we should examine the Central Bank's proposal in light of these three criteria, and, in particular, it is in light of these three criteria that the Convention - because I think this decision is principally the responsibility of the Convention - will have to propose a solution for the future of decision-making within the Central Bank.
Mr President, I am disappointed by the proposals for reform of the management structure of the European Central Bank, under which different classes of member will be created and a small group of large countries will in practice make the decisions.
Nor do I see how it is possible to reconcile the fact that a few large Member States that now happen to be obstructing the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact should have a prominent place in this lead group, while smaller Member States, which from the beginning have conducted a responsible and correct monetary policy, are relegated to second class.
These proposals affect the equality of the Member States.
Must those in the second and the third groups simply keep quiet in the discussion or stand aside while the great of the earth cast their votes?
No, Mr President, I think that the situation as we know it at present is perfectly all right.
The rapporteur rightly says that we still have plenty of time to look calmly at a better system.
Let us first acquire some experience of enlargement before we turn things upside down and subsequently opt for a simple and transparent management system with a European and not a national perspective.
My own country would find the whole situation even more disagreeable.
The Netherlands is one of the countries that have conducted a strong monetary policy for years.
Initially we will be allowed to go along with this lead group, but as soon as the United Kingdom joins the euro zone we will be thanked for services rendered by being returned to the bench.
Whilst I fervently hope that the United Kingdom will join at some stage, it is a rather sorry state of affairs when it entails consequences of this kind.
Countries that have for some years been sawing more or less vigorously at the legs of European monetary stability are seeing themselves rewarded.
It is nonetheless inconceivable, Mr President, that we throw away the euro in this way.
Mr President, I am pleased that the European Parliament's Committee on Budgets yesterday opted to support what is also the Finnish Government's policy, according to which any reform proposed by the Council cannot serve as a basis for decision-making.
The work of the European Central Bank's main decision-making body must be reformed in order for effective decision-making to be possible after enlargement.
The model proposed by the ECB Governing Council, however, is overly complicated and vague, and will not make it any easier for the general public to follow how monetary policy is formulated.
We all want to make decision-making on monetary policy more effective, but the system must be more transparent and comprehensible.
The problem at present with decision-making in the ECB is not how votes are cast, but the fact that the Governing Council is trying too hard to avoid voting in general.
The existing version of Article 10(2) of the Statute of the European Central Bank states that the ECB Governing Council takes its decisions by a simple majority.
Proposals for decisions are not, however, put to the vote before there is consensus in the discussions. According at least to the statements made in Parliament by the President of the ECB, Wim Duisenberg, consensus means more than a majority but less than unanimity.
For the ECB to be able to react more swiftly to market changes it should practise majority voting.
From this point of view, it is not sensible for the voting procedures to be made complicated and off-putting with even less voting happening than before.
Moreover, the rotation model being proposed by the ECB violates several principles which both Parliament and the central bank governors themselves used to consider of vital importance.
The preparatory work to reform the ECB's voting procedures is to be postponed until the Intergovernmental Conference takes place.
Two proposals by Parliament are worthy of support. The first is the call for double key voting and the second the proposal that operational decisions concerning practical monetary policy should be distinguished in decision-making from longer-term institutional and strategic decisions.
We hope that Ecofin takes Parliament's opinion into consideration when it makes its decision.
Mr President, let me make it clear from the outset that I did not vote for the report that was adopted yesterday evening in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
Certainly, our German rapporteur relinquished his initial proposal to give each eurozone country a vote in the ECB Governing Council but to counterbalance this exclusively with the represented population.
I would remind you that the ECB Governing Council examined a similar proposal by the Bundesbank during its lengthy deliberations and finally rejected it.
Why?
Because in a eurozone enlarged to 25 or 27 members, it means that four large Member States would have a de facto veto in the ECB Governing Council at the other countries' expense.
This is unacceptable.
Even if - as was agreed yesterday as a compromise in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs - the two objective criteria of GDP and TAPs were additionally considered, this would result in a far less balanced system than the ECB model, which only uses these two criteria for ranking the Member States that are granted voting rights in a rotation system.
Of course the ECB model is new and takes time to adjust to, but it is not so complex and lacking in transparency as to make it incomprehensible to those who have to deal with it.
That would be an indictment of the Member States' politicians and their central bankers!
Ultimately, a currency is influenced by economic and financial strength rather than by a country's population.
The ECB's proposal reflects this truism.
Another reason why I did not endorse the so-called 'compromise' amendment is that it would lead to what amounts to renationalisation.
It envisages even more enhanced competencies for the enlarged Executive Board of nine members at the expense of the ECB Governing Council, which currently meets twice a month, but which - with as many as 27 members in line with the Committee's proposal - could henceforth naturally only play a subordinate role.
I hope that the Council will endorse the ECB Governing Council's far more balanced recommendation and that this can be ratified before enlargement - for the scenario which is now being proposed would deal a fatal blow to confidence in the euro.
Mr President, I shall be brief.
Two different issues have emerged during this debate.
The first concerns the system proposed by the Central Bank, based on the implementation of the enabling clause. The question arises as to whether it is logical or not and whether a better system could be devised.
The second issue concerns what a better system might involve.
It might be the system detailed in Mr Friedrich's report or it might be different again.
What we are concerned with at present, however, is the enabling clause established at Nice.
The governments are referring to it authorising the Central Bank to present a proposal which must be unanimously approved. They are also referring to it in connection with a Commission proposal, which must also be unanimously approved.
The enabling clause only provides either for all the members of the central banks to be present and for all of them to vote, or, alternatively, for a system of restricted voting. Such a system would have to involve rotation.
Clearly, a system of rotation means that not everyone would be involved in everything. The issue of the nature of the system of rotation then arises.
There is no doubt that the model presented by the Central Bank does provide for a weighting of the countries based on their respective financial and economic significance. As a result, the smaller countries are given a significant role.
The Commission is of the opinion, however, that there is not sufficient justification for the proposed system of rotation.
The Commission therefore proposes adjusting the system of rotation only.
All the Commission has done is to propose using the current Central Bank criteria to define its voting system. As I said, all this means is using the system the Bank has in place at present.
This system will of course involve a change.
Not everyone will be present.
The enabling clause does however provide for this.
It would not make sense to table a further proposal for a different system of rotation, instead of suggesting an amendment to the Central Bank's proposal.
It has been argued in the House that the enabling clause will not resolve all the problems, and that a more ambitious stance is called for.
I sympathise with these views. The Commission has adopted a similar position in some cases.
Nonetheless, if a vote or decision is taken on the basis of the enabling clause, there is no doubt that the Central Bank's proposal, suitably amended, could prove useful. It would resolve the potential problem of the transition.
It is worth remembering that any alternative model would also require unanimity and ratification, and would not be easy to implement.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place next Thursday.
(The sitting was suspended at 5.05 p.m and resumed at 5.20 p.m.)
The next item is the statement by the Commission on the neighbours of the enlarged Europe: a new framework for relations with the neighbours to the east and south.
Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to inform you of a slight change in the order of business.
The next item will be the statement by the Commission, and the debate will continue until 5.45 p.m. Question Time will follow at 5.45 p.m.
Mr President, I will be extremely brief, just making a few points regarding the document presented today on proximity policy.
This is an extremely important document which clarifies our proposals for European and Mediterranean relations after enlargement.
The enlargement process has, in fact, given the countries near to the Union great hopes, but it has also generated frustration and tension which can be summarised in a number of quite clear, quite comprehensible comments made by the countries of the East excluded from enlargement.
They have reproached us for merely shifting the iron curtain eastwards, while the Mediterranean countries have reproached us for concentrating primarily on the East rather than on the Mediterranean countries.
Our neighbours have many hopes and I have always believed that they must not be disappointed, that we should create a proper policy for the Union's relations with them too, both in their interest and in the interest of the Union.
The communication approved by the Commission today on proximity policy meets this need, the need to create a reference framework within which we can develop ever closer relationships with our neighbours to the East and South, to create what I have described on several occasions, initially intuitively and then after increasing analysis and reflection, as the ring of friendly countries, the ring of friends which stretches from Russia to Morocco, a ring with which we can share everything except the institutions, in other words with which we can share programmes, market, rules and political dialogue but not Parliament, not the Council and not the Commission.
In short, our aim is to develop a policy for these countries which are calling for a special relationship with the Union but for which the Union cannot foresee an enlargement strategy, at least in the short term.
Clearly, then, the western Balkan countries are not included in this ring: the prospect of their membership has already been agreed, although the date has not yet been set.
The reference framework we have outlined in the communication complements rather than replaces the relationship the Union has with individual countries or groups of countries.
Clearly, the intensity and, above all, the speed with which relations between the Union and the individual countries develop within this reference framework will depend on the abilities of each individual country.
In other words, the principle of differentiation will apply in this case too. The objective is twofold.
Firstly, to create, together with our partners, an area of prosperity and stability based on the principle of economic integration, strengthening of political bonds and cultural cooperation, and on this last - cultural cooperation - I insist. Secondly, to make the development of these preferential relations dependent upon the gradual adaptation of the countries to our rules and our set of values in both the economic and political domains.
Thus, we want to develop with each individual country, on the basis of experience and our current contractual obligations, an agreed action plan which sets out the path we intend to pursue together.
These action plans will include objectives, timeframes, procedures and monitoring mechanisms applying equally to both parties.
With a view to this, therefore, we will assess whether there is a need for us to create a specific contractual instrument - a proximity agreement - and an ad hoc financial instrument - a proximity instrument.
In practical terms, we will work with our neighbours to create a single market, to promote the free movement of persons, goods and services, to strengthen cooperation in the fight against common threats, to strengthen our cooperation in conflict prevention and crisis management, to promote human rights, to step up dialogue between cultures and religions, to integrate transport, energy and telecommunications networks and to create a wider research area, in short to bring about ever greater integration based on the shared values and principles of tolerance, peace, freedom and solidarity - the very principles on which our Union is founded.
Mr President, the Commissioner obviously wanted to say something just now, and perhaps I can ask him a question at the same time.
I fully endorse the proposals that Mr Prodi has outlined here.
What would interest me is this: what will be the institutional framework for all this?
You mentioned the financial instruments and the treaties with neighbouring countries.
However, my question to the President or the Commissioner is this: are any specific institutional arrangements required?
Theoretically, after all, there is still the European Conference.
There are various possibilities.
In connection with the Mediterranean region, we have discussed the option of establishing closer parliamentary cooperation as well.
We must not leave this in abeyance, and we must also ensure that the responsibility is clarified within the Commission, for what we are dealing with here, really, is an interim phase between normal traditional foreign policy and integration in the European Union.
In my view, this interim phase must be defined very precisely, and the Commission should submit specific proposals to deal with it, setting out detailed arrangements and describing which institutions are involved.
Will the European Conference be revived?
Will there be specific responsibility within the Commission for this area of cooperation?
Will it remain with Commissioner Patten?
These are the questions that interest me.
Perhaps you could explain the situation in more detail.
Mr President, we have just had an extremely interesting discussion in the Commission in which the leitmotif of most of the contributions - the strongly-held argument of most of those who spoke - was that it was absolutely imperative that we give the question of the relationship with our new neighbours the priority which in the past we have given the whole process of enlargement; that, in other words, it becomes part of everybody's responsibility to promote the concept of an institutionalised ring of friends to whom we can offer ways of sharing in our security, stability and prosperity.
The honourable Member will see from the communication we are publishing today the practical ways in which we try to give expression to this notion.
It is not easy.
We have tried it in the past.
To some extent it has been like the philosopher's stone; we have never quite found a way of expressing our views about our neighbours that does not involve offering them all membership of the European Union.
That is not the subject of this communication.
However, the honourable Member will see from our proposals that we have put forward sensible and concrete ways in which we can encourage our neighbours, both on our land and our sea borders, to share in our market, to share in our policies, not to share in our institutions but to share in the prosperity and political stability which have been the hallmark of the European Union.
The simple answer to his question is that there is no disagreement.
The Commission believes that this is a responsibility for the whole Commission and that responsibilities will have to be shared between us.
In view of the short time remaining and of the number of Members who wish to speak, I shall give the floor to sets of three Members at a time, preferably one from each group.
I have a long list of Members before me.
The Commissioner will reply once the three Members have posed their questions.
Mr President, I have listened with great interest to the Commissioner's statement on the enlargement countries.
I am sure if they join the Union, they will wish to ensure transparency and accountability in all the institutions.
To this end, the President of the Commission this morning promised Parliament that he would publish the note to Commissioner Kinnock from Mr Jules Muis of the Internal Audit Service.
This afternoon the Commission spokesman said that the Commission now had no plans to publish that note.
Could the Commissioner please tell us why the Commission's line has changed from this morning and why it is refusing to publish this document so that the discharge of the Commission's budget can proceed as urgently and speedily as possible?
This is not relevant to this afternoon's debate.
Mr Prodi is welcome to respond if he so wishes, but I would urge Members to keep to the order of business.
I want to confirm what I said this morning: the document will be made public as per the interinstitutional agreement.
Mr President, I have followed the Commission President's introduction very closely and have also read the speech he made on the same subject in Brussels in December.
In both his introduction today and in that speech he vacillates dreadfully between the position that we must not entirely rule out the prospect of membership and the view that we must not initiate it either.
That I understand perfectly well and that is no criticism of Mr Prodi either.
There is a ring of friends in which Morocco and Russia will be treated on the same terms, in the same way.
My question - it is an open question to the Commission - is whether it is not better or would be better to say in even clearer terms: 'in this ring of friends there are friends who are ever so slightly closer to us'.
Ukraine and Belarus might become members in the future for example, while we cannot imagine the same of Russia.
We must be perfectly clear about this.
The same applies to North Africa for example.
Does that not create the clarity that these countries demand of us and is it not better to make a distinction between potential members and countries or neighbours who will never be eligible for membership?
I should like to endorse Mr Lagendijk's question.
I understand perfectly well what the Commission is doing and also what priority it wants to give its policy with regard to the countries around us.
In this Parliament we shall be returning in detail to the announcement that the Commission is making today.
I really only have one question.
The objective of course is to prevent the creation of a new divide, a new Iron Curtain, in Europe.
If this is what we want to prevent, then we are going to have to help countries such as Ukraine or Belarus to undergo the same development as countries such as Hungary or Poland.
Does the Commission think it will be able to develop sufficient influence on and cooperation with these countries with its proposal, so that the same reform processes take place there as in the present candidate countries and in time a kind of equality will develop that opens the way to answering the question as to whether these countries can also become members of the Union?
For me, what it comes down to in the end is whether, by means of what you are proposing, we can achieve the same positive effect on those countries as we have achieved with the enlargement process in a number of other countries in Central and Eastern Europe.
Given what is currently happening in those countries, I think that this is the only way to prevent a new divide in Europe.
Mr President, the accession of the new Member States will expand Europe's borders further, in that the Union will exert even greater influence over the continent, with the development of proximity policies which will create new potential partners which might become new Member countries in the future, as has happened in the case of the current accession countries.
We find it hard, however, to imagine enlarging Europe even further without launching a debate which is now urgent: ultimately, how wide can Europe's borders stretch?
If we look southwards, towards the African shores of the Mediterranean, we see situations which have always been such as to make it clear that those countries cannot share development criteria, ideologies or political or religious beliefs with Europe, except, perhaps, Libya and Israel.
If we look eastwards, we might consider granting membership to the Republics of Ukraine and Georgia. The same may be said of Norway, to the North, while, to the West, the Atlantic is in itself already a border.
What are the widest borders that we can consider if we are not to drown the Union in an area of free trade, given the need to have a Union which does not go under whenever it has to address major international issues, as, I am sad to say, has been the case in recent days?
The debate on which countries will be destined to become part of the Union and with which countries we should just form preferential cooperation relations will have to be addressed very carefully, given that cooperation cannot concern trade measures alone but must cover relations on sensitive issues such as respect for human rights and the control of migration flows too.
I will respond very briefly to the three related questions.
I want it to be clear that this objective of building a ring of friends does not imply any commitment or any exclusion as regards enlargement: none of these countries has the right to membership and none of them is excluded.
However, clearly, this does not resolve the issue raised in the last question.
Here, I want to reiterate a request - which I have already made to Parliament many times and which I am told has been heard - for a debate to be held in the near future precisely on the Union's borders.
However, the ring of friends is a different project, a project which is not concerned with the enlargement of the Union but which still offers a relationship of close cooperation, which offers gradual integration, which genuinely offers the Union and the countries around it a future of economic and political security.
Membership is something different.
To turn to the second question, Mr Wiersma , this was done precisely in order to avoid the accusation that we have merely moved the iron curtain eastwards, as I said in my previous speech. There is no longer an iron curtain.
There is no exclusion any more. There are Member countries, but countries which have a relationship of increasing active cooperation with the countries around them, with the ring of friends.
It is an organic strategy that will increase the number of Members of the Union through enlargement and create an ever stronger and closer proximity policy through the ring of friends.
Mr President, I am pleased that the Commission has now put forward a proposal for us to discuss, on whether there are alternative options to full membership of the European Union.
This will undoubtedly be a key issue for the future after enlargement and the accession of ten new countries.
I would like to ask two questions.
Firstly, I am not altogether clear whether what is being proposed is a flexible system of bilateral relations between the EU and the various countries, or a multilateral approach - a kind of a 'European Economic Area plus'.
I think this is an important point.
My second question relates to the Balkans.
I know that a highly differentiated approach is essential when considering the Balkan countries and that some of them will be able to join the European Union earlier than others.
However, the other countries will still need a long period of internal development.
It would therefore be wrong not to include them in a strategy of this kind, for during the interim period - which could last a long time - they could be included in this network as well.
Perhaps the Commission could review this position once again.
Mr President, the general framework set out by the President of the Commission for relations with other countries following enlargement generally has my backing.
However, general principle policies do tend to fail in practice.
This being so, I have two questions: first, what other good can come out of relations with the Mediterranean countries of North Africa in practice, when general policies have not, in my opinion, been particularly successful.
And secondly, on the subject of the candidate countries of the former east bloc, because the quality of relations is sometimes determined by neighbouring countries rather than general principles and because, as we recently realised, many of the candidate countries have proceeded as they see fit on strategic policy matters - we are talking about the problem of Iraq, irrespective of what position you agree or disagree with - the question is: how can we influence these countries so that they do not set their own criteria for relations with their neighbours, which we see as countries of collaboration and peace and which others perhaps see as enemies.
Mr President, our discussions have focussed exclusively on the broad outlines, and, whilst these are, of course, very important, the problems lie in the detail.
One of the central issues in the neighbouring countries is what will happen at the borders.
Will there be new, decentralised instruments to facilitate practical cross-border cooperation?
Will the border arrangements be eased, or will the borders lead to a real and tangible division by separating ethnic groups and severing existing relations?
What interests me is what the Commission's strategy says about this issue.
What form will the financial instrument take?
Will it be a centralised instrument, as is currently the case, with the problems that we have, or will it be a decentralised instrument?
Mr President, I can answer the three questions on the principle of work-sharing.
Firstly, the Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy will recall that I have agreed to come to the committee on 25 March to have a full discussion on the Commission communication, which will enable us to follow up in more detail a number of the points being debated this afternoon.
He raised a couple of points.
Firstly, what we want to provide is a coherent global framework.
However, we recognise that one cannot argue that there should be a one-size-fits-all policy.
We must have a policy that is able to accommodate the different levels of economic development and of commitment to our value system.
Therefore I hope that there is coherence which is sufficiently flexible to ensure that the policy works.
He also referred to the Balkans.
We have specifically excluded from this communication the countries that are involved in the stabilisation and association process, i.e. Croatia and the countries of the west Balkans, Turkey, Romania and Bulgaria.
They have already been given the perspective of membership of the European Union and we are focusing in this document - as we were asked to do by the Copenhagen European Council - on those countries that do not have the perspective of membership.
As the President has said, I am sure there will be a debate in due course on the geographical limits of the European Union.
The President was making speeches about this around three and a half years ago.
However, this is not the time or the document for that debate.
I would just add that it is our intention that the accession candidates themselves should be involved in this debate in which many of them have a larger stake than us.
On the question of how the Mediterranean countries and the Eastern European countries can be involved in our policies, we very much hope that we can involve them in everything from the internal market, trade, migration and the movement of persons to justice and home affairs, financial assistance and issues like governance, human rights and the rule of law.
We have been trying to do that through the Barcelona process by, for example, giving more encouragement to those countries that are already involved in the Agadir process, encouraging them to move on from that and to start trying to harmonise their regulations with ours, and involving themselves more in our own internal market.
That will be the policy that we continue.
There are a number of countries in Eastern Europe - the western NIS one could call them - who have been unable to join the European Union, even though, like Moldova and Ukraine, they express their European vocation.
I hope that what we are proposing to them in terms of trade, economics and political dialogue will increase the size of the common economic and political space around our borders.
However, we do not seek to resolve the question of membership for those countries of the European Union in this document.
Finally, I am pleased to have the opportunity to answer the honourable Member's question on this because it is one we have discussed in the past.
She quite sensibly asks about coherence in our financial instruments for dealing with cross-border issues.
I can assure her that she will find in our document the proposal for a neighbourhood instrument, which will deal with the sort of problems she has referred to.
My colleagues who work on enlargement and regional matters will be working with my own directorate-general and others to try to bring this new instrument into operation in the most effective and least disruptive way possible.
Mr President, I was unaware that British Members of this House had a reputation for being verbose!
The President of the Commission introduced the communication in broad outline, so perhaps I could ask Commissioner Patten about two points of detail since he has touched on them.
Could we have an assurance that, as the President has said, we are not attempting to create a new iron curtain and that, for example, the present visa arrangements between Poland and Ukraine will not be made more difficult once Poland becomes a member of the European Union?
I see the President of the Commission is nodding, so that will cut down the time for his answer.
The second question to Commissioner Patten is that, since the acceding Member States have tremendous experience of relations with countries such as Ukraine, Belarus and Russia, would it not be timely now to set up some sort of working party?
Those acceding Member States could then begin to feed in their experience in foreign policy relations with our new neighbours, perhaps reporting to Commissioner Verheugen or indeed to Commissioner Patten himself.
Mr President, I strongly believe that at least offering Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova prospects of potential long-term membership will encourage the necessary reforms needed in their economies, their systems of governance and human rights and also support those politicians and parties who share our values and aspirations.
Will Commissioner Prodi retract his statement - if it is true - that Ukraine is no more European than New Zealand?
It was clearly seen by the Ukrainians as a geographical nonsense and a signal to their government that they were much better off making their bed with the Russian bear.
Fortunately Russia does not want to join the European Union, but Ukraine does.
We should not exclude this possibility, particularly if at the end of next year the Commission sanctions the much weaker case - to my mind - for Turkey's membership.
Can the Commission provide more funds to combat illegal immigration and border flows through these countries, irrespective of our disapproval of their governments in office at the moment?
Mr President, President of the Commission, I support and welcome the Commission's statement which expresses the political desire to build closer relations with neighbouring countries. I feel, however, that the issue of borders constitutes an element of discord in this climate of rapprochement.
We have established a series of measures relating to relations with third countries, particularly our neighbours, in order to integrate the management of the flow of migrants. These concern border controls, the control of illegal immigration and agreements on readmission.
I wonder whether we are really in the process of subcontracting the management of migration to our neighbours, so creating a buffer zone between the European Union and the rest of the world, which would probably be less laudable. In my opinion, these measures serve to promote the establishment of detention zones in these neighbouring countries both within and on the borders of Europe.
I am referring to zones run in a heavy-handed and arbitrary manner, where the kind of rights enshrined in the founding values we wish to share, are, more often than not, flouted. I would therefore urge you to consider the risks currently involved.
Mr President, we are in some danger of begging the question.
The current enlargement round depends on the outcome of eight referendums which have yet to be held across central and eastern Europe.
Does the Commission believe that it is right for these countries to be left to take that decision on their own, or does the Commission believe that it is acceptable to intervene politically and financially in that decision?
So far there has been one referendum, in which the European Commission admits to having spent EUR 700 000, a sum which in per capita terms is equivalent to spending EUR 100 million in Commissioner Prodi's native Italy or in Commissioner Patten's native United Kingdom.
If the terms that we are offering these countries are so favourable, why do we need to deploy colossal resources on this scale in order to help them make up their minds?
Mr President, I think the House is going to have the benefit of the President after the External Affairs Commissioner has made one or two points.
Firstly, I should like to assure Mr Beazley that there is no question of us seeking to create another iron curtain in Europe.
Indeed, part of the intention of this communication is to prevent any notion of a fortress Europe being created with the 25 Member States.
When one talks about easing visa regimes, it is important to consider the conditions under which interior ministers are likely to regard that as a tolerable option.
One of the things that they look at is not simply the border between the country making the application and Europe, but the other borders for which that country is responsible.
When, for example - I hope after we have concluded a re-admission agreement with the Russian Federation - we begin discussing the question of visas, one question which will be raised again and again is the security of the thousands of kilometres of borders which Russia has with other countries.
There are a number of conditions precedent to any serious discussion of visas.
The honourable Member also asked whether we were going to try to involve the applicant countries which have not yet joined, and whether we were involving those countries in the debate.
We have the democratic process to go through, as the honourable Member said a moment ago, but the simple answer is 'yes, we are'.
A number of applicant countries, for example Poland with its recent discussion document on the eastern dimension, have made very sensible and thoughtful proposals.
From April the candidates for accession will be sitting in the meetings of the General Affairs and External Relations Councils and listening to the debates, so I hope that will inform their contributions in due course.
I am aware of Mr Tannock's concern about the Ukraine which he has expressed on a number of occasions.
As Mr Prodi said, this document itself is not a definition of the geographical boundaries of the European Union, but I hope that our friends in the Ukraine will recognise the real efforts that we have made to help create a common political and economic space which will be to their advantage.
I would wish that we were able to have a closer and more benign relationship with Belarus.
It is not our fault that does not exist.
The honourable Member knows the style, objectives and policies of the regime in Belarus which led to the unfortunate visa ban not long ago.
At the moment we can still provide Belarus with support for civil society developments, and I look forward to the day - perhaps after the next elections if they are conducted freely and fairly - when we can develop our relationship with that country.
We do not want any country on our borders to be isolated by its own will, or by the will of its regime.
I have attempted to answer the honourable Member's point about a buffer zone.
One has to take account of all the borders of other countries.
Finally, I say to the honourable Member - whose interest in these matters I readily acknowledge - that he should recognise that many of us believe passionately that when we discuss enlargement we are not just talking about a matter of money.
We are not just talking about commercial, economic or even geostrategic interests.
For many of us the case for enlargement is a moral one.
The honourable Member should not worry too much if we think it is worth expressing that case as vigorously and as comprehensively as possible.
Though I have intervened in their debate myself, I do not believe that the people of Malta, who have a certain reputation for courage and independent-mindedness, are likely to be swayed by the occasional advertisement in one of their newspapers, or even, I must confess, by the occasional interview with the Commissioner for External Relations.
They might be much more swayed by interviews with the Commissioner for Enlargement who has a much more silver tongue than I do, but I hope, as this democratic process rolls across Europe, that the honourable Member will see one country after another voting to come home.
Just two further comments, for the Commissioner has answered almost all the questions in full.
I reiterate: this offer, this proposal, this political strategy does not mean accession for these countries, it does not mean that they will become members of the Union. It certainly does not imply that but nor does it exclude it.
I would also, however, like to make it quite clear that I do not accept - or rather, I accept up to a certain point - the argument that the possibility of becoming a Member of the Union furthers the democratic process and the internal development of these countries.
This gives me great pleasure, it is beneficial, but it is certainly not a sufficient basis on which to judge whether or not a country should become a Member of the Union.
Membership of the Union means sharing specific political objectives too, sharing roots and identities, sharing much more than just democratic sentiments. This was the point I made with regard to New Zealand.
I have never said that New Zealand is more European than Ukraine. I merely said - and I will say it again - that, if we consider democratic criteria alone, there is no reason why New Zealand should not become part of the Union.
However, there are geographical and historical considerations and political goals that a country must share in order to become a Member of the Union.
It is therefore clear that this possibility must be conferred where these goals are identified and consolidated and are shared by ourselves as well as the countries involved.
That is why I am anxious for the debate on the Union's borders to be opened.
Lastly, I would like to reassure Mrs Flautre that the objective is precisely the opposite of creating detention centres for immigrants from these countries, which has rightly been identified as a dangerous course of action.
There are different ethical considerations where immigration is concerned: cooperation with these countries would make it possible to deal with the issue of immigration more compassionately, more thoroughly, less traumatically and with greater involvement of the countries concerned.
Clearly, this can only be achieved with the ring of friends, while we know that immigrants are now coming to Europe even from very distant countries.
Having a group of countries with which we can cooperate on these sensitive issues too is extremely important, and it is, of course, our responsibility to ensure that this is achieved with due regard for the rights of the migrants.
It is much easier to achieve this objective where there is cooperation than where such cooperation is lacking.
The debate is closed.
The next item is Question Time (B5-0085/2003)
The following questions are addressed to the Commission.
Part I
Question No 50 by Bill Newton Dunn (H-0095/03):
Subject: Reports of national quotas for soccer players inside EU
Newspapers in the UK, some of which are notorious for reporting EU matters inaccurately and sensationally, are reporting that 'a deal is close between UEFA and the European Union' to limit the number of 'foreign' players in each team to 50 per cent - so that soccer clubs inside the Union could be forced to field teams which include at least half from their own Member State.
Will the Commission kindly confirm that these reports are incorrect, because such a deal would conflict with the Union's basic principle of free movement for its citizens?
. The Commission is not aware of the United Kingdom press reports to which the honourable Member refers.
As far as any enforced limit on the number of foreign players is concerned, I should like to recall the following.
The application of the Community rules on the free movement of workers in sport was decided by the European Court of Justice in the 1974 Walrave case, in which the Court held that sport was subject to Community law when it constitutes an economic activity, whether by professional or amateur athletes.
This was confirmed by the Court in its now famous 1995 judgment in the Bosman case.
In this case-law the Court also held that nationality clauses could only be justified in relation to specific official matches between teams representing countries - such as the Olympic Games - or certain world or European championships.
Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for what seems to be a very satisfactory answer and to congratulate her on the newspapers she chooses to read, or rather chooses not to read.
Question No 54 by Alexandros Alavanos (H-0066/03):
Subject: The Annan plan for Cyprus and the 'acquis communautaire'
Referring in its resolution concerning 'the progress made by each of the candidate countries towards accession' to the Annan plan for a political settlement of the Cyprus problem (EP Minutes of 20 November 2002), the European Parliament 'calls on the Commission to certify whether the plan can provide the basis for a viable and operational settlement in the framework of the European Union in accordance with the acquis communautaire'.
Now that the Commission has studied this plan, can it certify that it is consistent with the 'acquis communautaire'? Does it intend to communicate its considered opinion to Parliament and, if so, when?
Mr President, the honourable Member will of course be aware that his very important and interesting oral question has sadly been overtaken by events over the last 24 hours.
I would therefore, with his permission, like to take this opportunity to inform you about the latest developments.
The Commission regrets that the efforts made by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr Kofi Annan, to seek a comprehensive solution to the problem of Cyprus have proved unsuccessful.
The Commission gave this process its full support, and it recalls the European Union's readiness to facilitate a solution in accordance with the principles on which the European Union is based.
Notwithstanding the European Union's preference for a political solution, the Commission confirms that the accession process will continue as planned in line with the existing timetable.
All the preparatory legal steps to enable this to take place have already been taken.
In other words, we will now submit to Parliament a protocol supplementing the accession treaty with Cyprus and setting forth how Cyprus's accession will be organised under the present circumstances.
The Commission notes and endorses the UN Secretary-General's statement that the peace plan will stay on the table.
The Commission is also ready to support all further endeavours in this context. The Commission encourages all the sides concerned, including Turkey in particular, to work actively to achieve a solution.
The Commission underlines its solidarity with all Cypriots and appreciates the courage with which the Turkish Cypriots have expressed their European convictions.
The Commission will continue to promote projects in Cyprus to the benefit of both communities, so that economic inequalities on the island are reduced and confidence is built between the two communities.
May I start by thanking the Commission and expressing my appreciation of all its hard work on the accession of the whole of Cyprus to the European Union, acknowledge the importance of the announcement it has taken this opportunity to make and ask the following question: given that negotiations with Turkey are scheduled to start at the end of 2004, is resolving the Cyprus question one of the preconditions, the implementation of which will require a positive and constructive contribution from Turkey if it wishes to integrate?
Also, now that this stage of the Annan plan has come to a close, does the Commission think that the European Union and the Commission will perhaps take on a more substantive role in negotiations between the two communities?
Mr President, Mr Alavanos, when I visited Ankara at the end of January I left the Turkish authorities in no doubt about the possible consequences of a failure of the Cyprus talks.
In my discussions with the Prime Minister and the leader of the AK party and also with other leading figures in Turkish politics, I made it clear that the Commission is expected to issue an opinion and a recommendation at the end of 2004 stating whether or not Turkey meets the political criteria for accession and, if so, recommending when accession negotiations with Turkey should start.
I have to say very clearly that the Cyprus problem is part and parcel of these political criteria for accession.
We have also expressed this unequivocally in the accession partnership with Turkey.
Today, what I can say, with all due caution, is that if, at the end of 2004 - when the Commission has to table its report and recommendation - the situation in Cyprus were to remain unchanged, that is be exactly the same as it is today, then we would have a situation where a country, namely Turkey, wished to negotiate accession with us but did not recognise one of our Member States, namely Cyprus.
I find it very difficult to imagine how, in such a situation, the Commission could issue a positive opinion on starting accession negotiations with Turkey.
I apologise for my inability to be any clearer, and, indeed, for my not wishing to be any clearer, but I think that what I have said is clear enough.
If you consider what I have just said in connection with what I have said about the protocol, then this means that there is obviously still an opportunity for a solution to be reached between now and the end of 2004.
That is why both the United Nations and the European Union are saying that yesterday's failure does not mean that the Cyprus problem is a closed book, but that as soon as the political situation allows, obviously, talks about the plan can be resumed.
It is very important for the United Nations plan to remain on the table.
Allow me to make one further point: the most recent version of the United Nations plan was an extremely favourable offer, especially for the Turkish Cypriots.
I am firmly convinced that there will never be a better offer or a better solution for the Turkish Cypriots than this one.
That is why it is extremely important from the point of view of the Turkish Cypriots for the United Nations to say that the plan will stay on the table. We can only warmly welcome this.
Commissioner, allow me a brief comment, if you will, before the supplementary question.
Not only has the process to integrate Cyprus into the European Union failed to resolve the Cyprus question; by integrating the free part of Cyprus, it has resulted in de jure partition and recognition of the Turkish occupation.
Not that things would have been much better had the two sides accepted the Annan plan which, unlike the UN resolutions, attempted to impose a particular form of federation which was not so very different from the recognition of two states in Cyprus, in other words partition.
Under these circumstances I wonder, Commissioner, how the Commission is going to deal with a situation in which a candidate country, in this case Turkey, has forces occupying and has colonised part of a country which is already a Member State of the European Union, in violation of numerous UN resolutions.
I am not just talking about resolving the Cyprus problem, I am talking about dealing with the occupation.
Will the European Union accept responsibility for liberating the occupied part of Cyprus?
Mr Alyssandrakis, I do not agree with you that Cyprus' accession, in the form currently proposed, will mean a de jure division of the island.
The protocol that I have already mentioned several times makes it absolutely clear that Community law will not be applied in those parts of Cyprus over which the Government of the Republic of Cyprus cannot exert effective control.
But this is not tantamount to recognising two Cypriot states.
Like the rest of the international community, we still regard the Government of the Republic of Cyprus as the representative of the whole of Cyprus, as its only legitimate representative under international law.
From a purely legal point of view, the whole of Cyprus will become a Member of the European Union.
In practice, Community law will not be able to be applied in part of the territory of Cyprus for as long as there is no political solution.
Once there is a political solution - whenever this may be - all that will be required will be a unanimous decision by the Council and the whole of Cyprus will be a Member, both de jure and de facto.
We would not need to hold further negotiations. Neither would another Treaty be required, or renewed ratification.
All of these matters are settled in the protocol, which is part of the Act of Accession.
What can the Commission do to improve the situation?
I think the most important thing that we can do is to continue to cooperate intensively with Turkey, to continue to use all of the means at our disposal to encourage Turkey to drive forward political, economic and social reforms and to meet the political accession criteria.
That is the only thing that we can do. At the end of the day it is also the only thing that will help.
Mr President, I would ask you to call my question again, and for the following reason: I was here at 5.30 p.m. and the debate was still in full swing.
I then went to another meeting.
As soon as I saw that Question Time was starting and Mr Prodi had finished speaking I rushed here from that meeting, but the first part - which according to our documents was supposed to last 30 minutes - was already over.
I really would therefore crave your indulgence.
In such cases it is extremely difficult, even for someone like myself who endeavours to attend Question Time on every occasion, to be here on the dot ready for this procedure.
I would therefore ask you to call my question again.
Mr Posselt, believe me that I am sorry because you are one of the most committed Members during this Question Time, but there are several Members in the chamber who have thought the same thing and the Rules of Procedure state that the Member must be present when their question is replied to.
The question has lapsed and the Rules of Procedure do not leave any other option since that would amount to setting a precedent.
I understand your argument, but I cannot do anything, either for you or for Mr Salafranca who is now going to speak.
I will give the floor to Mr Salafranca for a point of order; but, for example, Mr Lamy has already left.
I know that we have started late, because Mr Prodi arrived late.
I know all of this.
But the Rules of Procedure lay down that the questions lapse.
Mr President, I am very glad that you know what I am going to say, because I did not intend to say what you have suggested.
I simply wish to say that your interpretation of the Rules of Procedure is correct and that, when the Member asking the question is not present, the question lapses.
I wanted to stress that I was paying great attention in an opposite room watching the screen, which indicated the order of speakers and that Question No 51, the one previous to mine, did not show up on the screen.
I saw the first one, but I did not see the second.
The speaker was not present and Mr Lamy did not wait very long, because I ran into him leaving.
Therefore, Mr President, without wanting to accuse you of having any responsibility for the way the debate proceeded - although it would be desirable not to change the agenda - I would request that you ask the services of the House to ensure that the screen and the monitor work correctly so that this kind of situation does not happen again.
Thank you for very much improving on what I thought you were going to say.
It is always important that the President can be mistaken in his judgments.
You have many reasons and you have explained them to me.
I will ask the Commission to answer these questions in writing given the extraordinary circumstances, but there will be no oral reply.
Mr President, I just wanted to clarify three points: firstly, Commissioner Verheugen is still here.
Secondly - and this is also an important point - you made an exception at the last part-session.
I will check in the Minutes to see which Member was concerned. I have a very clear recollection of this precedent being set.
Thirdly, I should like to say that I would request that Question Time begin, as in previous years, at 5.30 p.m. precisely, regardless of what is happening in plenary.
That was the practice in this House for almost 20 years and it was something that we could rely on.
But being sloppy about the start time, only then to be strict when applying this rule, and extreme when interpreting it, is not something that I can accept.
Either you are liberal in both cases or strict in both cases!
I would ask that this be the last point of order, since we are going to spend more time on this than we would have done answering the questions.
Mr President, I would like to thank you for kindly suggesting that the Commission should reply to my question in writing, but I would prefer my question to lapse in accordance with the Rules of Procedure.
I will present it again for the next part-session since I would prefer there to be a debate in the Chamber.
I can only say to Mr Posselt that in that case, which was very different from today's case, I made it very clear that I was not setting a precedent and I hope that that is recorded in the Minutes.
But you will remember that I said that I was not setting a precedent.
Mr President, Mr Crowley, the point you raise in your oral question corresponds exactly to the subject of a formal complaint that has been submitted to us.
The formal complaint came from the Media Observatory Czech Republic, and has been endorsed by the company Media Print & Kappa Pressegrosso.
It stated that alleged violations of EC competition law had been observed in the Czech Republic.
Both I myself, and the EU delegation in Prague, have also had this matter drawn to our attention in conversations with the chairman of the Media Observatory Czech Republic. And I can tell you that immediately afterwards I had the opportunity to raise this issue with the Czech Government at the very highest level.
For the time being, the Commission is of the opinion that it is first and foremost the Czech competition authorities and courts that are responsible for the matter, because it mainly concerns distortions of competition on the Czech market in print media.
Nevertheless, the Commission services have contacted the Czech competition supervision authorities.
The Czech supervision authorities are currently examining the case and recently issued a temporary order against the company Prvni Novinova Spolecnost and its parent company for possible violations of the Czech competition rules. I hope I pronounced that correctly.
I am not quite sure.
Czech is a difficult language!
Implementation of legislative provisions by the Czech competition authorities is being closely monitored in the run-up to accession, and with this in mind the Commission will continue to observe progress on this case.
Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his brief response.
However, Commissioner, you did not answer the basic aspects of the question.
The reason I gave so much information - like you I had access to this information - was that it could be an attempt by a private company or by groups of private companies to distort the market before the full impact of European Union law becomes legal and to interfere so that no action can be taken afterwards.
Commissioner, I should like to know, firstly, your own directorate's response to this type of action and, secondly, whether there are any other mechanisms, besides going through the Czech authorities, that can be utilised in future to prevent this particular instance and also similar instances which are currently threatened in Poland, Hungary and Slovenia.
Mr Crowley, the different roles that we play here explain our different accounts of the situation.
As a Member of Parliament, you are of course free to express a political judgment.
As a Member of the Commission, I obviously cannot make a political assessment of a case when the legal proceedings are not yet concluded.
You will understand this and you would certainly object - and rightly so - if the Commission were to express an opinion in other cases that are sub judice and where the proceedings have not yet been concluded.
I must therefore say that I simply do not know today whether we do in fact have a breach of competition law on our hands.
The question of whether competition law has been violated is being investigated at this very moment by the Czech authorities, and the Commission services are in contact with the Czech authorities because it is our job to ensure that in the pre-accession phase the relevant instruments are correctly applied and the relevant procedures adhered to.
That is the connection.
Incidentally, if this had happened after accession it would not have made any difference.
There is no doubt that this is a case for the national competition authorities and not for the European competition authorities because it is only the domestic Czech market that is affected by this dispute.
The Commission is therefore already doing what you asked me to do at the end of your statement.
We are acting on this matter.
I can even go a step further and say that given that this is about media pluralism and given that media pluralism plays a significant role in promoting democracy in a country, the Commission is also taking this case particularly seriously.
Question No 56 by Anne E.M. Van Lancker (H-0125/03):
Subject: Accession negotiations with Slovakia and the Roma minorities
In its resolution of 20 November 2002 (Paragraph 114) the European Parliament urged the Slovak Government to undertake decisive action to overcome the problems of discrimination against the Roma minorities, in particular with regard to the elimination of possible discriminatory practices by state institutions and public authorities.
In late January 2003, the Centre for Reproductive Rights published an investigative report confirming that forced sterilisation was being practised on Roma women in the Slovak health-care system.
Does the Commission share the questioner's view that these practices amount to a violation of the Copenhagen criteria and of Articles 1, 3, 4 and 7 of the European Union Convention on Fundamental Rights?
Will the Commission ask the Slovak Government to launch a searching investigation and adopt measures to put a stop to the practice of enforced sterilisation, which constitutes a serious infringement of human rights
Mrs Van Lancker, yes, I must say that this is a particularly depressing question.
I also found the reports to which you refer deeply disturbing.
I read the report on the alleged forced sterilisation of women from the Roma minority in the Slovak Republic with great concern and consternation.
A practice of this kind would in fact constitute a serious violation of human rights if it were either ordered or at least tolerated by the state or any other public institution, or if the state were to refuse to investigate the accusations and call those responsible to account.
Immediately after this report appeared I therefore expressed my concerns to the Slovak Prime Minister, both verbally and in writing, and asking him to ensure that light was shed quickly on the accusations, which have been made by various human rights organisations.
I am very pleased to be able to tell you that the Slovak Government responded immediately and without hesitation.
The Deputy Prime Minister of the Slovak Republic responsible for human rights issues acted straight away to instigate the necessary steps under criminal law.
A special investigation team was set up. This investigation team is supported by the Home Affairs Minister's advisor on Roma issues.
This Home Office advisor for Roma issues himself belongs to the Roma minority.
In addition, the government has invited the Vice-Chairperson of the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly's Committee on Health to the Slovak Republic on a fact-finding mission.
In the meantime I have also received a written reply from the Slovak Prime Minister in which he assures me that there is no state-sponsored practice of this kind in the Slovak Republic, that the accusations are the subject of a meticulous investigation and that should they prove to be true the full force of the law will be brought to bear in taking action against the perpetrators.
I can assure you that the Commission will closely monitor the progress of the investigations.
Obviously we will do all we can to ensure that any abuses are remedied forthwith and that the necessary steps are taken under criminal law, should the accusations be true.
Mr President, I thank the Commissioner for the steps that he has already taken in this matter.
If he will allow me, I will shortly be handing him a copy of the investigation.
You will see, Commissioner, that absolutely nothing of what the people of the Centre for Reproductive Rights, which carried out this investigation, are saying is either nonsense or invented.
So I am really shocked by the Slovak Government's response to the effect that these practices do not go on.
I should like to urge you yourself to demand an independent inquiry of the Slovak Government and also to demand that they discontinue the proceedings against this organisation, which has produced serious work.
The fact is that, at the moment, it is the complainant who is in the dock.
Mr President, Mrs Van Lancker, you have clearly misunderstood me.
At any rate your supplementary question does not reflect what I said.
I did not say that the Slovak Government had dismissed the accusations as untrue.
I simply said that the Slovak Government stressed that there was no state-sponsored practice of this kind, that the state did not tolerate these practices and that the accusations that you and others are making were the subject of a meticulous investigation by the competent authorities.
If the Slovak Government were to say that there was no truth in these accusations then it would not need to order an investigation.
I would ask you not to be too quick to condemn another country.
So far, in my opinion, there is no proof that this is a systematic state practice. Instead the suspicion that is uppermost in my mind is that what we have here are individual cases of abuse, admittedly of the gravest kind.
I must draw your attention to the fact that the Commission does not have any executive power in the countries that will be joining us.
It is therefore completely out of the question for us to undertake a criminal or criminological investigation in a future Member State, just as we would be unable to do so in a current Member State.
We have done what we can to use our political influence to make the Government of the Slovak Republic aware of the urgency of this matter and to ask it to carry out a thorough investigation.
I really must insist on stating here that the Slovak Government responded immediately and has complied with all of our requests without hesitation.
Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his answer and I would like to congratulate Mrs Van Lancker for bringing this forward.
On a slightly wider point, I visited, albeit a year or so ago, Bratislava and Kosice with a parliament delegation and we looked at the conditions of the Roma people there.
What I saw was that, despite the commitments of the government, the discrimination continues, partly because it seems to be ingrained in the society and almost institutionalised.
There are poorer conditions for Roma people, fewer facilities, nowhere near the same number of opportunities and generally they are far more alienated from society, for example in schools where there was no evidence of mother-tongue teaching, no evidence of any Roma teachers at all.
As a criterion for membership of the Union, is respect for minority languages and cultures being seriously independently monitored and if so by whom and how?
How is the Commission responding to any criticisms that may be coming up?
Mr President, I am a little taken aback by Mr Evans' question, because there is hardly an issue that I have reported on more often to Parliament than the issue of the situation of the Roma in the Slovak Republic, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania.
There is barely no other issue either that I myself, and the Commission as a whole, are working on as intensively as this one.
First and foremost I must remind you that discrimination against Roma is not only a sad fact of life in the future Member States, but that unfortunately we also find this in a whole series of current Member States.
It is just that it is not as noticeable in the figures because there are not as many of them in the Member States.
The crucial point here is whether the constitution, the judicial system and the state administration system in the future Member States really do discriminate against the Roma or not.
Our investigations - in agreement incidentally with the Council of Europe and a considerable number of human rights organisations - show that there is no as it were institutionalised discrimination against the Roma in either the constitution, legislation or administrative structure of these countries.
What we do find is deeply rooted, traditional discrimination in society, which in some parts of these countries has taken on really tragic proportions.
However, I must repeat that this is nothing new.
Our efforts have focused on ensuring that these countries develop a strategy to reduce the discrimination against the Roma.
We have made it a political precondition for the conclusion of the enlargement negotiations for such strategies to exist and be in force.
I have, however, always said - including here in this House - that we cannot expect social discrimination against the Roma to have been completely eliminated at the time of accession of the new Members.
Neither can we say that there is absolutely no discrimination in the present Member States.
I could name a series of cases of discrimination in our current Member States where we are also not saying that the fact that people are being discriminated against constitutes a violation of the Treaty. Instead we say that European Community law requires measures to be taken to put an end to this discrimination.
That is the situation that we find in these countries.
In its pre-accession instruments the Commission addressed the needs of the Roma minorities in a big way.
It has deployed a great deal of money, made significant human resources available and provided considerable advice to help the future Member States to develop and also apply a strategy to combat discrimination against the Roma.
I do not think that you will find anyone for miles around who is better acquainted with the reality of the situation faced by the Roma in these countries than I am.
I never let a visit to these countries go by without addressing this problem directly and on the spot.
I do not do this because I believe that I can solve the problem by visiting a Roma settlement, a Roma school or whatever it may be; I do it to make a powerful and symbolic contribution to shaping political ideas.
I want the people in these countries to see on their television screens that when the Commission comes to their country it does not regard the Roma as untouchables, but as a section of the population that needs particular attention and particular care.
Mr President, I should like to thank the Commissioner very much for his answers.
He really is very convincing on this issue.
I should also, however, like to thank the questioner for even raising this matter.
I have a small and perhaps naive supplementary question: would it not be possible then for either the Commission or perhaps even Parliament's Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities to invite one or other of these women to visit us and describe to us what is actually happening there?
I would be interested to talk to this woman in person.
Perhaps it would not be without interest for the Commission either to hear a personal account of the situation on a one-to-one basis.
Mrs Flemming, Parliament is of course free to make its own decisions and I would consider it a worthwhile initiative if it were to go along with the suggestion that you have just made.
If it did then the Commission would be very grateful to have this opportunity to receive information of this kind first hand.
We shall now proceed to the second part of this Question Time, during which Commissioner Fischler will respond.
Part two
Questions to Mr Fischler
Question No 57 by Bart Staes (H-0067/03):
Subject: Guarantee of food distribution to disadvantaged groups
In his answer to Question E-1695/02
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the question posed by Mr Staes concerns the distribution of food to those in need in Belgium.
This is clearly a matter for the Member States, so, in this case, it is a matter for the Belgian authorities.
The funds that were provided for the 2002 programme in Belgium were no lower than in 2001.
On the contrary, funding was increased from around EUR 2.3 million to EUR 3.5 million, precisely so that beef, which was available again in 2002, could be distributed without this entailing a reduction in the quantities of the other food that had been made available.
The decline in the quantities made available to the Belgian Federation of Food Banks is due to the fact that the Belgian authorities divided up the food available differently from in previous years.
Mr President, Commissioner, I am rather surprised by your answer, because it is of course all a matter of juggling with figures.
All I know is that these food distribution organisations are manned by people who are highly committed, very socially aware, and also well disposed towards Europe.
In any event they have told us, in response to an earlier question, that problems had already been reported and I asked a question about this together with Mrs van Lancker, Mrs Maes and I believe Mrs van Brempt as well.
In response you said that just as much food is being distributed as before and then we have the disconcerting assessment that in fact 750 tonnes less are being distributed.
I repeat my question: can you confirm here that in terms of quantities - I am not talking about figures or about values - just as much food was made available in 2002 as in the years before?
Have I understood that properly?
If I have indeed understood that properly, then I shall be putting further questions to the Belgian Government through the federal advisory committee for European affairs in the Chamber and Senate and with fellow Members of the European Parliament.
Mr Staes, in my statement I was talking about amounts of money and not about tonnes.
I also said, however, that you need to bear three different things in mind here.
First of all, as I said, it is the Belgian authorities that are responsible for dividing the food between various charitable organisations, which then pass this on to disadvantaged groups.
How much each organisation gets is therefore decided by the Belgian authorities, and it may well be the case that the organisation that you mentioned received less, but this would mean that another organisation would have received more.
The only way of finding this out is, however, by contacting the Belgian authorities.
The second point is that there is also a link between the Community and Belgium because, as you know, we have provided a financial grant, but we do not give this grant to the individual organisation, we give it to the Member State.
We then leave it up to the Belgian State to divide these resources amongst the individual charitable organisations in accordance with its particular priorities.
Question No 58 by Dirk Sterckx, which has been taken over by Mr. Vermeer (H-0080/03):
Subject: Calculation of a 'fishing day' to limit the fishing effort in accordance with Regulation (EC) 2341/2002
Annex XVII to Regulation (EC) 2341/2002
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the problem raised by Mr Sterckx in his question is one of which the Commission is very well aware. I agree: it is true that the definition of fishing days in the temporary recovery plan for cod is very inflexible.
We accept this and are working on amending Annex XVII because in this way we can resolve the problem.
I can also tell you that we invited all those with responsibilities in this sector to Brussels on Monday morning.
We discussed this issue with representatives of the Member States on Monday and also today.
We are sure that we will find a solution to this problem that takes account of the practical situation.
Thank you very much for that answer, Mr Fischler.
Yet I would ask you to be more specific.
You say that you are expecting a result to be achieved.
The grassroots, the people who go to sea, are asking: when are we going to do something concrete?
Could you give a date on which we can specifically introduce a very practical policy, for example a policy with hours instead of days, so that someone who sets sail in the evening and only actually starts working the next day is then dealt with according to the number of hours?
Can you be more specific?
What kind of result have you achieved with the agreements that you have made during the meetings today and yesterday?
Mr Vermeer, if you wish I can be even more specific. We are not putting off dealing with this problem; we want to change it straight away.
We were simply waiting until we had met with those involved, the representatives of the fishing sector.
It goes without saying that this is something that we intend to change within the next few weeks.
Commissioner, Scottish fishermen and others north of 55o north are being restricted to 15 days, which they find difficult to accept, all the more when they see the industrial fishermen scooping up a million tonnes of sand eels and Norway pout, which are both the feedstock for their whitefish, and in many cases, immature haddock and other whitefish.
How can you justify this to the fishermen of Scotland?
Mr President, the question that Mr Purvis has raised is actually completely unrelated to the issue that we have been discussing here.
The debate is a general one about the means by which we can on the one hand rescue our endangered cod stocks and on the other hand do so in such a way as to avoid the fishermen concerned suffering severe hardship.
Turning now specifically to industrial fishing, I can only say that we have been working on this issue for years.
We have also obtained relevant reports from scientists to ascertain whether fishing for sand eels does actually as it were take the food from the mouths of young fish and young cod in particular.
We were told that this is only true to a very limited extent. In addition, you will also see from the stock surveys that the sand eel stocks continue to be very large and are not in decline.
These stocks are in fact stable; we do not have a problem there.
There is one problem with industrial fishing and that is the risk of cod being caught as a by-catch.
It is certainly important to monitor what happens here.
The experts are telling us, however, that these by-catches have fallen significantly thanks to new fishing technologies and that in the future it will be possible to virtually eliminate them.
Question No 59 by MarÃ­a Izquierdo Rojo (H-0090/03):
Subject: Young farmers and recognition of historical farming rights in the new proposal for reform of the CAP
In connection with the new proposal to reform the CAP and with reference to the forms of aid totally decoupled from production to be paid to farmers on the basis of farming rights, how are young farmers to be incorporated in the proposal?
Will they too receive aid based on historical rights?
Has the Commission forgotten young farmers?
Mr President, as Mrs Izquierdo Rojo has rightly said, the Commission proposal on establishing Community rules for direct payments under the common agricultural policy provides that the single payment arrangement is open to all farmers that can show that they have a valid claim.
All eligible farmers, including of course young farmers, who have already received direct payments under the old system, have an equal claim.
Furthermore, under Article 49 of our proposal, these claims can be passed on, either through specific bequests or by anticipating the line of succession.
This provision takes account of customary practice in Europe when a holding is taken over by young farmers.
In addition the proposal also specifically accommodates new farmers.
Article 45 provides for a national reserve in the Member States.
Reference amounts can be allocated from this reserve for the single payment to farmers who started their farming activity only after 31 December 2000.
Finally, it goes without saying that reference amounts need to be allocated to new farmers in accordance with objective criteria and according to the principle of equal treatment, so as to avoid distortions of the market or competition.
Finally, if a farmer - and that obviously includes a young farmer - can prove that his production has been reduced in the reference period because of force majeure or other unusual circumstances, then he can claim that his case is one of hardship.
The possible cases when hardship pertains are described in more detail in Paragraph 4 of the relevant article.
As you can see, Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, there are a whole series of ways in which we want to use our proposal to give a special helping hand to our young farmers.
Thank you very much, Commissioner, for that very positive and illuminating reply, at a time when there is great uncertainty in the countryside.
However, given the importance of the issue, I believe more information should be provided.
So my supplementary question is: does the Commission plan to provide the farmers with direct information and guidance on the advantages and improvements represented by the reform you are proposing?
I say this with knowledge of the facts, because in my country there are many parodies in which farmers are constantly being told that decoupling means that the less they work, the more they earn and that they will earn more the more they 'scratch their bellies', to employ the terminology actually used.
Therefore, Commissioner, if we want the farmers to understand your proposals, bearing in mind that the Spanish Minister for Agriculture's strategy is head-on opposition, I believe you should consider this question and that the Commission must propose measures to provide direct information, because what we have in Spain at the moment are ridiculous parodies.
Mr President, Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, I can tell you that what you said about parodies certainly rings true with me.
It is actually sometimes the case - regrettably, I have to say - that when you listen to the comments of some national politicians you can barely recognise the Commission's proposals.
We do actually need to do much more here.
We have prepared a public relations strategy specifically so as to ensure that the proposals are discussed in the public domain.
We do however expect - and quite rightly in my opinion - the national governments to at least provide correct information.
Whether a government representative likes these proposals or not is of secondary importance.
We have an entirely legitimate expectation, however, that no false information is put into circulation.
Unfortunately, this requirement is not always respected.
I would therefore say that this is a task for all of us.
I can only ask you, in your capacity as a Member of the European Parliament, to make the facts known for example in Spain and to keep farmers informed.
In any case I will continue to do everything in my power to send this information out directly from Brussels, particularly through the media.
Question No 60 by Mrs MarÃ­a Esther Herranz GarcÃ­a, which has been taken over by Mrs. Redondo JimÃ©nez (H-0109/03):
Subject: Imports of agricultural products and reform of the CAP
Under the reform of the common agricultural policy proposed by the Commission a few weeks ago, Community aid is to be made strictly subject to the requirements of food safety, animal welfare, the environment, and safety at work.
If the proposal were to be accepted, farmers would be penalised if they failed to comply with any of the directives, of which there are about forty, that they would be called upon to observe.
The Commission's proposed reform will entail a substantial increase in production costs, which will be offset only in part by the new accompanying measure provided for under the heading of rural development in order to help farmers obey the rules.
The new rural development aid being proposed by the Commission is a partial and temporary solution because it will decrease over time.
Does the Commission intend to apply the same requirements to agricultural products imported from non-member countries so as to ensure that Community producers will not have to compete on the market in a position of weakness?
What steps is it proposing to take to alleviate the situation?
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Redondo JimÃ©nez is right to say that, according to Article 3 of the Commission proposal, a farmer in receipt of direct payments has to comply with the basic requirements of farm management in accordance with Annex 3 of the proposal and has to ensure that the land is kept in good agricultural condition.
This is intended to guarantee that farmers that receive direct support comply with binding EU standards on the environment, food safety, animal health, animal protection and also safety in the workplace and that they keep their land in good agricultural condition in accordance with good agricultural practice.
The EU standards included in these basic requirements have all been legally binding for a long time; they are nothing new.
This Commission proposal cannot therefore directly create any additional costs.
Furthermore, the measures that are available to Member States under rural development have been extended to include instruments to improve quality and also achieve better animal protection.
In the context of these newly proposed measures to achieve compliance with standards, farmers can receive aid for a new standard for five years, if applying it involves additional costs and obligations for the farmer.
The aid that is granted for applying a particular standard is limited in time, but the measure itself is not.
As far as funding the measures on rural development is concerned, by introducing modulation the Commission is also laying the foundations for increasing the relevant budgetary funds.
Despite our efforts to secure the future of European farmers and promote important European trade interests, one of the most important objectives of the European proposals made in January for the WTO negotiations is that in the current negotiating round non-trade-related matters - such as food safety or the protection of designations of origin, or animal and environmental protection - be treated on an equal footing.
The Commission has already responded several times in no uncertain terms to the first proposal of modalities for the agriculture negotiations that was tabled on 12 February by Mr Harbinson, and it will continue to defend the European negotiating position.
The Commissioner has just told us only what he was able to tell us.
Other things have been left out, however, which have already been debated in the special committees on agriculture.
For example, with regard to rice, he knows that the subsidy price has been reduced by 60%, that internal production has stabilised and that consumption has increased by 20%.
However, for five years the situation has been unsustainable for rice producers, who are facing an increasingly bleak future, as a result of the Everything but Arms decisions and imports of basmati rice, which do not correspond either in terms of their characteristics or their origins.
We could also consider garlic, mushrooms, honey, tomato, rice, wine, concentrated juices, etc., and we would see that the quality, the safety of products imported, as well as the production methods, both in terms of animal welfare and in terms of guaranteeing quality and the environment, are not subject to any control.
I would therefore ask you what supplementary measures are subject to the supervision of the Commission, but do not tell me that control falls to the Member States.
Mr President, Mrs Redondo JimÃ©nez states that I did not mention various points, but I could just as easily reply that she did not ask me about them either.
In your question, Mrs Redondo JimÃ©nez, you did not ask for example what is going to happen to the rice regime or what the situation is with food safety for imports.
What is more, this is not even a subject for which I am responsible.
I would however like to comment briefly on what you said.
Firstly then, why do we need a rice reform?
We do not need it because of imports of basmati rice, which are I might add very limited, something which incidentally greatly annoys the Indians, who are therefore constantly trying to have their export quota to the European Union increased.
We need it as a result of the decision - which by the way was also made here in Parliament - to give the world's poorest countries the right to export all of the goods that they produce, without any restrictions, to the European Union.
Of course the world's poorest countries include a whole series of rice producers.
That is why our current rice regime will no longer work in the future and why we need to change it.
The objective of the reform has to be on the one hand to address the consequences of this external trade policy and on the other to ensure that at the same time the typical landscapes are preserved in traditional rice-growing areas, such as in southern Spain, where there is of course even a national park where rice is the main crop.
I turn now to the question of import controls. This may not be what you want to hear, Mrs Redondo JimÃ©nez, but products that are imported through Spanish ports or via any other border post in Spain by train or lorry have to be checked at the border to ascertain whether they meet plant health and veterinary requirements.
All that the European authorities, for example the Veterinary Office in Dublin, can do is to introduce a control plan to check that the border inspections are actually working.
This is, however, as I said, the responsibility of my fellow-Commissioner Mr Byrne.
Let us continue with rice.
EBA: Everything but Arms.
If the 40 poorest countries are so poor and are dying of hunger, why do they have to send us rice?
Let them eat it and then they will not be hungry!
But my question is this: how can the Commissioner and the European Commission prevent Vietnam, for example, which falls within the Everything but Arms countries, from introducing its rice via its borders with Thailand and then Thailand from introducing it into the European Union?
How can we guarantee that?
How can it be controlled?
Will we put a label on every grain of rice?
How can we prevent the 40 poorest countries in the world, by means of multinationals we all know, which import rice, some of them here, from introducing these products via the poorest countries and wrecking our markets?
Mr President, Mr Bautista Ojeda, firstly, under the Everything but Arms initiative the world's poorest countries have the right to export their own production, that is their entire production, to the EU if they so wish.
And if they wish they can also import rice for their own use.
That is part of the decision that was made in this House.
Incidentally, I might add that I expressed my own misgivings about this from the outset.
But the decision was made and I stand by it.
Now there is only one thing that we can do, and that is to be vigilant and ensure that no foreign rice that has not even been produced in these countries is exported to the European Union.
How can we ensure that this is the case? We can do so by using those instruments that we also use in all other areas to check the origin of a product.
This requires proof of origin, certificates and checks by the appropriate teams of inspectors, and in some cases on-the-spot checks or analyses are also necessary.
In some cases it is certainly possible to tell by analysing the imported rice whether it really is from the country of origin indicated or not, and this does happen in practice.
The next item is the joint debate on economic and monetary union:
Report (A5-0051/2003) by JosÃ© Manuel GarcÃ­a-Margallo y Marfil, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the state of the European economy - preparatory report with a view to the Commission recommendation on broad economic policy guidelines ((2002/2287 (INI));
Report (A5-0047/2003) by Bruno Trentin, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the annual assessment of implementation of stability and convergence programmes (2002/2288(INI));
Report (A5-0037/2003) by Olle Schmidt, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission report: Convergence Report 2002 - Sweden (COM(2002) 243 - C5-0326/2002 - 2002/2170(COS));
Report (A5-0018/2003) by Manuel AntÃ³nio dos Santos, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission communication on Public finances in EMU - 2002 (COM(2002) 209 - C5-0324/2002 - 2002/2168(COS)).
Mr President, I would like to welcome the Commissioner to this sitting.
I would like to start by thanking all the parliamentary groups which have cooperated closely so that we can offer Parliament a clear text today, which focuses on action and not on words, on speeding up and not slowing down the strategy agreed in Lisbon, in Gothenburg and in Stockholm, to restore confidence to the European markets and thereby speed up our growth with a very clear objective, highlighted in the first paragraph: increasing job creation, which is a necessary condition if we are to compensate for ageing and maintain our social model.
Secondly, I would like to point out three strict limits to demand policies, which are included in the policy in the short term: to maintain macroeconomic stability, to maintain European competitiveness in an increasingly globalised world and to reduce public debt, in order to free up resources which must be destined towards investment and to create resources for future social needs.

The second of these key ideas is to increase coordination; we therefore welcome the strategies aimed at jointly examining the economic guidelines and the employment guidelines, but we would also like to integrate budgetary policies and supply policies, which remain in national hands, in order to create a framework which could provide a basis for the discussion of budgets, both European Union and national budgets.
In the field of monetary policy, which is the next section, the report stresses that the European Central Bank must closely follow the evolution of prices, in view of the underlying inflation in the services sector.
But it says something further. It says that everybody else, particularly the national governments, must do their duties: they must maintain the evolution of salaries linked to productivity, introduce measures in terms of the transparency of prices and reform their structures in order to increase productivity, in order to give the European Central Bank a margin, an additional margin, in the event that it is considered necessary to reduce interest rates, particularly if we want to bring interest rates into line with European export needs.
In the field of budgetary policy, the message seems to me to be equally clear.
This Parliament is stressing its commitment, which it has always maintained, to the Stability and Growth Pact.
Secondly, it welcomes the Commission's efforts to interpret this pact, to assess the budgetary situation of each Member State, taking account of volume of debt and quality of expenditure, particularly when it is investment expenditure, which is coherent with the Lisbon, Stockholm and Gothenburg strategies.
Thirdly, it regrets the lack of application, the lack of diligence of those prodigal governments which, while running the risk of excessive deficit, do not appear to want to make any effort to reduce structural deficits.
And finally, as an express appeal to the Commission, it urges it to play a more vigilant role at times of boom in order to ride out the storm at a later date.
With regard to structural reform policy, we stress that the lack of investment is key, and is the most definitive explanation of our lagging behind the United States, particularly investment in new technologies.
We therefore call for the establishment in the economic guidelines of quantified objectives in the field of public and private investment and for the promotion of investment by the private sector in these technologies, essentially by means of the tax deductions, linked to obtaining profits rather than subsidies, since we have no very clear idea of which activities those subsidies are used for.
We call for a new industrial policy, because people cannot live on services alone, as well as an effort in the field of renewable energies, on which I do not need to insist given the international climate.
In the field of small and medium-sized businesses, the Commission is urged to continue with the objectives of the Feira Charter, to facilitate their creation within 24 hours by means of new technologies, to advocate a postponement of taxes during the early years of operation, to simplify their operation, particularly in an administrative sense, and to exercise strict vigilance in the field of funding in the Basilea II negotiations, to stress the role of the European Investment Fund and to establish a network of guarantees which allows them access to the markets.
In the field of the liberalisation of the markets, transposition and therefore stressing the penalty mechanisms for States which do not comply, increasing competition in the privatised sectors, liberalising energy networks and particularly their connection.
On financial markets we are essentially in agreement.
We welcome the efforts in the field of taxation and we would ask for further effort in order to achieve VAT at source and a consolidated basis in taxes on companies and we ask for stricter representation of the euro in international fora and a denomination of energies in this currency.
Thank you very much, Commissioner, I hope that the message is clear and that it is well received.
Thanks once again to all the groups and the President for their patience.
Mr President, Council representatives, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr GarcÃ­a-Margallo's excellent report has highlighted the need to pin, from now on, the broad economic policy guidelines and the objectives relating to the coordination of Member States' economic and social policies to the goals set by the decisions of the Lisbon European Council, particularly where investment in research, lifelong learning and European infrastructure are concerned and as regards ensuring the efficiency of public services while safeguarding the general interest which they must serve, and, in addition, as regards an active ageing strategy which will help to bring about a substantial increase in the active population and employment.
This decision, which requires that binding stages in the implementation of the Lisbon strategy be provided for as an integral part of the broad economic policy guidelines, cannot fail to affect - and this is the subject of my report - the Stability and Growth Pact, which is still devoid of binding indicators relating precisely to growth and the quality of growth or to the coordination of budgetary policies, as Mr dos Santos rightly points out.
My explicit question on this point, Commissioner, concerns the compatibility of the Lisbon objectives with the objectives of the Stability and Growth Pact. Do the Lisbon objectives also concern the EMU States and to what extent, and, if they do, how can we make them as binding as the objectives set in the Stability and Growth Pact?
If the answer to this question is yes, as I believe it is, the problem then arises of how to coordinate and reconcile the different areas of Union intervention as regards economic policy, social and employment policy, sustainable development, financial stability and growth and achieve synergic interaction between them.
Clearly, this is not a question of procedure but a choice which must impact on the objectives of the Stability Pact and the way it is applied.
Indeed, in this new context, the application of the Stability Pact cannot just be concentrated in those periods in which there are clear risks of a shift away from the objectives and constraints of the Pact as regards budget deficit or public debt, constraints that we have no intention of questioning, especially during this difficult, uncertain period.
Indeed, the Stability and Growth Pact ought to curb the behaviour of the EMU States in periods of growth too, in order to prevent decisions leading away from the Lisbon objectives paving the way, in precisely those periods, for further departure from the objectives of the Stability Pact.
The Commission must acknowledge the difference between an economic policy which favours regular expenditures over public and private investment in periods of growth and a policy seeking to meet the Lisbon objectives in clear stages between now and 2010 in the areas of research and development, training and integrated European infrastructures.
It must also realise the difference, at times of crisis or in the event of war, between an economic policy which seeks to reduce fiscal pressure across the board and a policy of boosting public and private investment, which the Commission itself should be able to see is in the common interest, not least in that it is bound up with European projects in the spirit of Lisbon.
At this point, it is necessary to ascertain whether investment intended to contribute to the achievement of the Lisbon objectives makes things worse rather than better in the event of the danger of a shift away from the 3% constraint and whether it cannot be made compatible with greater financial rigour in order to comply with the criteria of the Stability Pact.
I hope that similar considerations and opportunities will all be taken into account together at the forthcoming Spring Council, and I would quietly point out, by way of conclusion, that there has to be institutional coordination of economic and social policies in the euro zone, coordination capable of taking majority decisions and showing, not least in the work of the Convention, that the enlargement of the Union which we are determined to make every effort to achieve will not hinder the progress or dampen the vitality of the European Union in the search for new, more advanced forms of integration.
Mr President, those politicians who launched EMU were bold and far-sighted.
There were many who believed that the project would fail. Some even hoped that it would.
Their fears have nonetheless proved groundless.
EMU has been very successful.
Now, further reforms are needed, however, as well as compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact by the Member States.
Overall, the introduction of the euro has been a painless process, especially in terms of the huge logistical work involved.
Certainly, there have been complaints about price rises, but the general price level has not increased.
Further investigations may, however, be needed, something that we are now also requesting in this report.
Three of the EU Member States are still outside the third phase of EMU: Great Britain, Denmark and Sweden, there being no special exemption rules in the case of Sweden.
Today's report concerns Sweden and the Commission's biannual convergence report.
I believe that, as I hope you already know, Sweden ought already to have been a fully fledged member of EMU.
When my work on the report began - and I want to take the opportunity of expressing my thanks for all the support I have received - there was still a lot of uncertainty about the Swedish Government's views.
Now, the situation is different, I am happy to say.
In a referendum on 14 September 2003, the Swedish people are to say yes or no to the euro.
Fortunately enough, events have taken on their own momentum, independently of both the report and myself.
Both the Commission and the ECB have recognised that Sweden has fulfilled three of the five convergence criteria: those relating to price stability, public sector finances and long-term interest rates.
In two areas, Sweden is considered, however, not yet to have fulfilled the criteria.
The most controversial of the convergence criteria is that relating to the rate of exchange because, unlike the other criteria, it has been so unclearly formulated.
ERM membership must be viewed as a requirement, but the period of membership may be relatively short.
The exchange rate criterion has, of course, also been applied flexibly to countries that have already introduced the euro.
I am thinking in particular of Finland and Italy which were not, of course, a part of ERM2 for two years.
The issue of membership of ERM2 is also significant and, of course, also very sensitive where the candidate countries are concerned.
Because quite a few of them are well on the way towards adjusting to EMU, I would certainly advocate a degree of flexibility.
I also noted that, in the course of a speech in Hungary the other week, the Commissioner was thinking along similar lines.
Another area in which the Commission and the ECB consider that Sweden does not meet the requirements of the Treaty is legal convergence.
This has to do with the independence of the Swedish Central Bank.
The issue has also been taken up in an exchange of letters between the President of the ECB and the Swedish Finance Minister.
The ECB expressed particular concern about the lack of clear rules concerning transfers of reserves from the Swedish Central Bank to the national treasury.
In his reply, however, the Finance Minister stressed that the necessary amendments would be submitted when the introduction of the euro was imminent, together with necessary changes to the constitution, even if time may be short, given Sweden's requirement for an interim election in the case of constitutional changes.
In my opinion, this does not mean however that Sweden is disqualified from the third stage of EMU right through to 2006 or 2007.
One of the most important principles of the Union's legal system is, of course, that EU law takes precedence over national law.
I would make bold enough to say that Sweden needs the euro.
At the same time, I would also venture to say that the euro in fact needs Sweden.
