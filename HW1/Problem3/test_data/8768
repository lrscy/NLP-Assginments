on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Madam President, I will read from the press: 'Just after the evening meal to break the Ramadan fast on 29 September, around 30 vehicles loaded with several hundred Sudanese rebels ripped through the perimeter of an African Union peacekeepers' base on the edge of Haskanita, a small town in southern Darfur, the embattled province in western Sudan where at least 200 000 people and perhaps as many as 300 000 have been killed since the rebellion began in 2003.'
The units of about 100 troops, most of them Nigerian, fought off the first attack before falling back to trenches, firing through the night until their ammunition ran out.
Then, ten were killed. At least 40 fled into the bush.
The attackers looted the compound before Sudanese troops rescued the survivors.
A week later, Haskanita itself was razed.
When the UN inspected the damage, only the school and the mosque were still standing.
About 7 000 people are thought to have fled.
Then, on 8 October, fighting erupted in the town of Muhajiriya, controlled by a Darfuri rebel faction.
Scores were killed.
No one is sure who the attackers were. Even the Government of Omar El Bashir came under suspicion.
But it could be the rebels.
What we know is that these things will continue to go on until there are international forces with an effective mandate and with effective means there.
Everybody knows that, and it is time to stop this game of hide-and-seek with the Government of Khartoum.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Madam President, the appalling attack by rebel forces in Haskanita against the African Union Mission in the Sudan (AMIS) was followed by a series of other revenge attacks by Government forces against all villages supposed to shelter rebels with tremendous civilian casualties.
We must realise that this suits the genocidal strategy of the Bashir clique in Khartoum to divide and destroy the Darfur communities and the rebel groups in order to make peace negotiations, such as the ones that are supposed to start this weekend in Libya, go nowhere.
That appalling attack and the violence which followed also demonstrate the fundamental limitations of an all-African force in Darfur such as AMIS.
It is, therefore, crucial that the African Union/United Nations Hybrid operation in Darfur (UNAMID), which is to be deployed by early January, will actually be duly equipped in full force and capacity to operate by then.
In this context, it is very disturbing that the Chairman of the African Union Commission, Mr KonarÃ©, has been insisting on an all-African force, even rejecting the integration of units offered by Uruguay, Thailand and Norway into UNAMID, in contradiction with the UN Security Council decision and, in this way, echoing the manoeuvres of the clique in Khartoum.
It is also disturbing that the European Union, the US and other rich countries have been failing to provide the speedy and full support that they should give to the deployment of that mission, namely by not providing it with a financial airlift and other logistical and military capacities that it needs to operate.
Even the Chad mission is very much delayed, and that was supposed to be 'urgent'.
Finally, Mr Bashir is going to be given a red carpet welcome in Lisbon: it is not only Mr Mugabe.
I hope that the European Union authorities, the Commission and the Presidency and the Member States will not fail to take that opportunity to actually confront him with this tremendous responsibility that, one day, will bring him to The Hague.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (SV) First of all, our thoughts go out to the sons, brothers and loved ones who are now missing following the brutal attack on the AMIS force.
These people died trying to help their fellow humans in a neighbouring country.
Many have been affected by violence, rape, murder and extreme poverty here.
How many times have we stood here and talked about it?
How many times have we demanded that the government or others take action?
Let me remind you that the central task of any government is to protect the human rights of its civilian population.
This government has never attempted or tried to do this in its entire career.
However, we must still be patient in our frustration, as it is only through long-term economic and political support for those who are endeavouring to resolve the conflict that we can do it.
We must not altogether ignore our own economic interests.
Sometimes it is our own oil companies that are actually supporting certain groups, indirectly or directly.
We must address this too.
A heavy responsibility rests with the government, and we must make further demands.
I agree completely with my colleague RaÃŒl Romeva that the International Criminal Court must be given full access rights and a full right to investigate, so that the people in this stricken country can see justice in due course.
Thank you.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, as Irish soldiers leave for Chad to protect refugees from neighbouring Sudan, I am again painfully reminded that this tragedy of genocide in Sudan continues day in and day out, without any end in sight.
I congratulate this motion for deploring violence, for its support of the UN and AU missions to Sudan.
'We must show a united front', the motion suggests; and, whilst I applaud the notion, I fail to see how this can come to pass.
You see, the UN itself is implicitly divided on the issue.
Efforts can only go so far while China, a deciding member, continues to sustain and prolong the conflict by supplying the region with arms.
Once again, we must point the finger at China as the main supporter of the Government in Khartoum.
China exchanges Chinese weapons for Sudanese oil, and it is not rocket science to see that this is one of the most important ways in which the ongoing conflict is being sustained.
We should not accept that the Chinese policy of exporting arms remain shrouded in secrecy.
Beijing does not publish any information about arms transfers abroad and has not submitted any data to the UN Register on Conventional Arms in the last eight years.
With Chinese arms exports - some of them in the attack that was described a minute ago - estimated to be in excess of USD 2 billion a year, the irresponsibility with which they act has to be called into question.
If this issue remains unaddressed, it is not just Sudan that will suffer.
Weapons from China can be found as far as Australia, Malaysia, Thailand, South Africa; regular shipments are sent to Burma and Nepal.
So, finally, I implore Parliament to act to condemn China for its role in underwriting the genocide of the Sudanese people.
For it is all very well to support peace and the role of the UN, but we must do this actively - if not, we risk contributing to the suffering of the Sudanese people.
on behalf of the ITS Group. - (NL) Mr President, of course the death of ten soldiers in the African Union peacekeeping force in Darfur is yet another tragic event.
For years this Parliament has been expressing concern about the region.
I do regret, though, that once more we have missed an opportunity to raise the matter of the responsibility and disastrous role of China in this conflict, because it has to be said again that, in seeking influence in Africa, China is playing a pernicious role in war-ravaged Sudan.
It is doing so on the backs of the victims killed in Darfur, and now indirectly too, with the blood of soldiers who are helping to stabilise the situation.
With their dubious investments, the Chinese have made an enormous contribution to the war efforts of the regime there.
Europe just has to realise that the stronger the Chinese become in Africa, the less powerful is our Western message of democracy, freedom and good governance.
However, China is too important a trading partner for Europe, and talk of human rights and democracy is all too often pushed into the background when Realpolitik comes into the picture.
Madam President, I strongly deplore the killing of 10 African Union peacekeepers on 30 September 2007 by unidentified forces in Haskanita in south Darfur.
At least eight other personnel from the African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS) were also seriously injured and another 40 remain missing.
I urge the Sudanese Government to cooperate fully with an independent investigation into the attack and to bring all those responsible to justice.
These deaths are a reminder of the gravity of the security situation in this region.
Unfortunately, there is no peace to keep at the moment but, nevertheless, the international community, including the UN and the European Union, have a responsibility to try to help secure this region as soon as possible so that peace can be realised in the future.
The European Union mission to the Chad, Central African Republic and Darfur border must also be mindful of the danger of incurring casualties.
No one said this was going to be an easy undertaking.
It is crucial that EU Member States mobilise political, financial, logistical and technical support for the Irish, French, Belgian, Polish and other troops forming part of this mission.
We cannot have our troops ill-equipped, like the beleaguered AMIS.
If we are putting our troops in a volatile environment, we must give them the means to protect themselves.
This EU mission will have a robust use-of-force mandate, with reference to Chapter VII of the UN Charter, and troops should be encouraged to invoke it.
Peacekeeping is one of the noblest professions and it is tragic when a peacekeeper loses his or her life whilst protecting the lives of others.
That is why we need to maintain pressure on the various parties involved ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
(PL) The conflict that has been ongoing in Darfur since 2003 is acknowledged as the greatest humanitarian catastrophe of our time.
Two hundred thousand people have lost their lives as a result of ethnic cleansing and pogroms, and a further two and a half million have been displaced.
Millions of refugees live in fear of what the next day will bring, and they have a force of just seven thousand poorly equipped soldiers from the African Union's peace force, which, increasingly, is becoming the focus of bloody attacks, such as the attack in Haskanita in September of last year.
The situation in this region is dramatically worsening, and representatives of humanitarian peace organisations are falling victim to kidnappings.
In this situation it is important to act as quickly as possible to put into motion the joint UN and African Union mission, which, now that it has the agreement of the Sudanese government, must also have a strong mandate allowing it to provide full protection to the civilian population.
The mission must have the appropriate number of soldiers and the appropriate quantity of equipment and funds.
The European Union, the UN and the African Union must make joint efforts to renew the peace process in Darfur and to help to find a just and lasting agreement that is signed by all interested parties.
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, we as the European Commission join with the European Parliament in strongly condemning the killing of the African Union peacekeepers in Haskanita, and in other incidents over the past year, and, of course, the fact that many others are still missing.
We should not pretend that even the larger peacekeeping force due to take over from the current African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS) will be able to protect itself easily to ensure the vast humanitarian operation supported by the European Commission and so many other donors and to keep the peace if there is no peace to keep. This is the question.
We acknowledge the acceptance by the Government of Sudan of the presence of the UN peacekeeping force on Sudanese soil.
Along with the rest of the international community, we intend to keep the Government to its word.
We welcome the intention of the Government to declare a cessation of hostilities when negotiations commence in Libya on 27 October, yet the Government needs to go further.
The European Commission also calls upon the Government of Sudan to engage meaningfully in negotiations intended to result in the equitable sharing of power and of wealth in Darfur.
We join with the rest of the European Union in calling upon the rebel movements themselves to declare an end to the killings and banditry that sully their cause.
We also call upon them to participate wholeheartedly in the talks in Sirte.
On top of that, as you know, UN Security Council Resolution 1778, adopted on 25 September, mandates an international multidimensional force to contribute to the stabilisation of eastern Chad and the north-eastern Central African Republic and thus also guarantee the security of the local civilian population, refugees and displaced people and stabilise the situation in Sudan.
On this basis, the General Affairs Council and Foreign Affairs Council on 15 October decided to send an interim and multidimensional European force of 3 000 troops, EUFOR Chad, as we call it, to support and complement in the short term the deployment of the UN contingent.
Taking into account the regional dimension of the Darfur crisis, the deployment of this new EUFOR Chad mission and of a UN police mission in parallel with UNAMID in Sudan is, I think, a crucial step towards facilitating a durable solution of the conflict in Darfur and, ultimately, also towards the voluntary return of the Sudanese refugees who have settled in Chad.
I can tell you that, at this very moment, an Irish General is there exploring the situation and exploring where exactly EUFOR should be deployed.
But coming back to the question of Sudan itself, let me say that we firmly believe that the future of Sudan lies in the sharing of wealth and power, in a federal government and a federal arrangement.
This is what the Government and the rebels agreed in Naivasha in January 2005, when the Comprehensive Peace Agreement was signed, ending decades of civil war between the north and the south.
The international community must stand firm behind this Comprehensive Peace Agreement.
For if this agreement can be made to hold - yes, it is at present in difficulty, but these difficulties need not be terminal - this will demonstrate powerfully that similar arrangements can surely be extended to Darfur.
So through the support extended also under the European Development Fund for the recovery and rehabilitation of southern Sudan and for the long-term equitable and sustainable development of the whole of the country, we are standing firmly behind the Comprehensive Peace Agreement.
We also back the efforts of the EU Special Representative to Sudan to facilitate peace in Darfur and, along with other donors, we stand ready to ensure that the peace dividend, in the shape of the rehabilitation and recovery of Darfur, follows closely on the heels of a renewed peace agreement.
We think it is in the interest of all the parties - the Government, the Darfur rebels, the countries of the Horn of Africa region and the international community - that Sudan stays together.
However long and arduous, and at times discouraging, the Sirte talks might turn out to be, I think we must be steadfast for peace in Sudan.
The unity of this country remains within our grasp.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place after the debates, during voting time - which is, in fact, the next item.

Statements by the President
Ladies and gentlemen, it was with deep sadness that we heard of the tragic event in Finland, in which eight people - pupils and teachers - were killed.
On behalf of the House, I should like to express our deepest sympathy to their families and the Finnish nation.
The groups have requested me to make a statement regarding the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on their Destruction (Ottawa Convention).
The 10th anniversary of the signing of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on their Destruction is coming up in just a few weeks.
On 3 and 4 December 1997, 122 states signed this historic treaty in Ottawa. Anti-personnel mines make no distinction between civilian and military victims.
They are directed against people, with the aim of killing or maiming them.
Effecting their prohibition by means of the Ottawa Convention is a victory for humanity.
The Convention is also a success for internationally linked civil society.
In a process that had never been seen before, a coalition of non-governmental organisations, together with committed governments and parliaments outside the usual diplomatic forums, managed to get an international treaty signed.
The International Campaign to Ban Landmines was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1997 to acknowledge this achievement.
The European Parliament supported the campaign to outlaw landmines from the very beginning.
After the signing of the Convention in Ottawa, the European Parliament campaigned using resolutions, hearings and opinions to ensure that it would be implemented effectively.
Today it is clear that the international campaign has been extremely successful.
More than three quarters of all states have ratified the Ottawa Convention.
The use of anti-personnel mines has decreased drastically, as has the number of countries that produce landmines.
Despite these successes, there are more than 69 countries that have not yet abolished landmines.
It has become apparent that this goal cannot be reached everywhere unless additional financial assistance is provided.
Europe has made an important contribution to implementation of the Ottawa Convention over recent years.
From 1997 to 2004, the European Union invested more than a billion euros in the battle against landmines.
The European Commission's anti-mines strategy is numbered among the most successful elements in the development of European external relations.
This is not only an expression of our humanitarian obligations, but also a worthwhile investment in sustainable development and human safety.
The Council of the European Union is about to adopt a new joint action on landmines within the framework of the Common Foreign and Security Policy.
We welcome the intention of working towards universal ratification of the Ottawa Convention and an effective Review Conference in 2009.
We look forward to close cooperation with the Council and the Commission in implementing this joint action.
I hope that we shall soon have an opportunity to discuss with the Council and the Commission their respective initiatives on the topic of landmines and how they are coordinating with each other.
The final goal that we all have in common is a world without landmines; to achieve this, the European Union must have a coherent common policy.
(Applause)

Order of business
The final draft of the agenda for this part-session, as laid down by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday 8 November pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure, has been distributed to you.
The following amendments have been requested to this draft agenda:
Tuesday:
The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe has requested that a statement by the Council and the Commission on the shipping accidents in the Black Sea be placed on the agenda for Tuesday afternoon, after Mr Leinen's report, with a corresponding extension of the afternoon sitting until 6.30 p.m.
This would mean that questions to the Commission would not commence until 6.30 p.m. and would thus be half an hour shorter.
Who would like to justify the motion?
If there is nobody to speak for or against this motion, that is the end of the matter.
(The motion lapsed)
Wednesday:
The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance requests that a statement by the Council and the Commission on the situation in Georgia be included and dealt with in a joint debate with the report by Mr Obiols i GermÃ  and Mr Tannock, and that the afternoon sitting therefore be extended to 6.30 p.m. and questions to the Council shortened by half an hour.
They also request that the debate on Georgia be concluded with the tabling of motions for resolutions and that voting on the matter be carried out during the November part-session in Brussels.
Who would like to justify the motion?
(DE) Mr President, there is not much for me to justify: it is obvious to all what is happening in Georgia, and it is clear that we should include Georgia when we are discussing neighbourhood policy.
This should be laid down, so that the Council knows what is what.
Then we should quietly proceed with preparing a resolution, for I believe it is important that the European Parliament formulate a clear resolution on the events in Georgia.
This should then be adopted in Brussels.
That is the correct formal procedure and I hope that all Members will agree to it, so that we can proceed in this way.
That was the justification.
Who is speaking in favour of the motion?
(DE) Mr President, we wish to support this for a very important reason.
The Rose Revolution in Georgia brought many positive elements with it, especially after the Shevardnadze regime.
Now there is a great danger that the undoubted successes will be destroyed if the opposition's criticisms are not addressed.
An initiative by the European Parliament could help President Saakashvili to get back on the right track; that is, to begin dialogue with the opposition.
I should also like to ask you, Mr President, to maintain contact with the Speaker of Parliament, who is also very active there, and to try to convince her, too, to follow the path of dialogue.
That is the point of this debate and also of the resolution, and I therefore support it wholeheartedly.
(Parliament adopted the motion)
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I must apologise.
I asked to speak earlier and, despite the fact that I stood up and signalled several times, I was not given the opportunity to speak.
I would just like to understand something.
I intended, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, to request a statement from the Council and Commission on the Black Sea disaster.
Without hearing who was in favour and who was against, I am not sure what was decided.
As I said, this was my intention, and I signalled this request.
It was my intention to direct this request to the President: that there should be a statement by the Council and the Commission on the Black Sea disaster.
I am simply asking for clarification on what Parliament has decided to do.
Mr Andria, please bear with me.
I called very clearly for Members who wanted to justify the motion.
There was no response. Nor were those responsible for managing the procedure in the room at that point.
I looked around very carefully, and there was no contribution to be heard at all, either to justify or to support the motion, and so the House agreed that it was not necessary for anyone to speak against it if it was not justified.
Those of us up here agreed, as did the plenary, that this motion thus lapsed and is no longer on the agenda.
Therefore I ask that we now proceed as has just been decided.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, please allow me to explain.
I stood up and signalled, even verbally, but the President indicated that I should stop.
I stood up several times.
I would ask you to include this initiative on the agenda and to ensure that the Council and Commission issue a statement.
In any case, at the start of the session, the President said that there was a request from the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe.
I do not see why we cannot have a debate simply because a request was accidentally missed.
I asked to speak, no one noticed, I even stood up.
Nobody here in plenary noticed, and that is why I told you that.
However, if you feel it is necessary, we shall be happy to vote on it.
The Chair of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe wishes to speak.
Mr President, I know that my colleague tried to interject when you raised it, but I think it would be helpful if I made one thing clear to the Chamber: we are not seeking to have a debate with the Commission and the Council about this; we know how little time we have with the Council this week.
But if there could be a statement from the Commission and we could have a debate on that basis, then that would be sufficient.
(Parliament rejected the motion)
(The order of business was thus adopted)
One-minute speeches on matters of political importance
(HU) Last week, for the third time, the Hungarian Academy of Sciences organised the World Science Forum in cooperation with the EU, UNESCO and the International Council for Science.
Scientists and decision-makers from more than 60 countries participated in the World Science Forum, including four Heads of State, the Director-General of UNESCO and the Commission's Environment [...] (interjection: I am sorry, Mr President, but I cannot carry on like this!).
As LÃ¡szlÃ³ SÃ³lyom, President of the Republic of Hungary, recommended the creation of a world environment organisation in his address, the leaders of the United Nations Environment Programme announced the formation of a new international organisation.
It was recommended at the World Forum that the parliaments of as many countries as possible should establish the institution of a commissioner responsible for future generations.
The main message of the World Forum is that science and politics must act together to halt climate change and the destruction of the environment.
According to the participants, a 'scientific Davos' has been created in Budapest, in other words, Budapest is now for science what Davos is for economic issues.
The next event in the series will be in 2009, when it is intended to host the world's science, education and finance ministers in Budapest, as the main event of the Year of Creativity.
I would like to ask the Commission and you to support the event and the concept behind it, that is to say, we must defend ourselves and future generations as well as the environment and sustainability.
Thank you for the floor, Mr President.
Mr President, one of the greatest problems in relation to EU policy is implementation.
This is particularly true in relation to directives relating to Lisbon and climate change.
On 4 January 2006 the energy performance of the Buildings Directive should have been implemented in all Member States.
This would have led to massive energy savings.
The problem is that only eight countries communicated full transposition on time.
That means that all of the following countries have failed to implement the laws that they themselves signed up to: France, Italy, Belgium, Luxembourg, the UK, Spain, Austria, Finland, Sweden, Estonia, Latvia, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Greece, Cyprus and Malta.
The EU will lose credibility and its attempts to reduce carbon emissions will not be taken seriously unless its laws are respected on time.
I urge you to write to the Member States I have just mentioned, to speed up implementation of this important directive.
(RO) The safety of Italian citizens on the territory of Italy comes within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Italian Government.
The Government of Romania cannot intervene in any way.
The thing that the Government of Romania can do, and it has done it, is to cooperate and provide all necessary information in order to prevent possible crimes committed by Romanian citizens.
Up to now, the Italian Government has had no strategy to improve the situation of Roma on its territory.
The best proof is the fact that the Italian Government has made no request to receive European funds for the integration of Roma, although it was obvious that the Roma had started to represent a problem that required an approach for several years.
The European Union Member States have the right to expel citizens who commit crimes, but no country of the European Union can have the right to expel European citizens who might be criminals, without having committed a blamable act.
Directive 38 of 2004 clearly explains these situations and the Italian Government Decree exceeds the spirit of the European Directive.
The European Parliament and the European officials should take a stand regarding Decree 181 of 1 November 2007 and ask the Italian Parliament for the final form of the law to comply with the letter and spirit of the European Directive.
- (PL) Mr President, recently ValÃ©ry Giscard d'Estaing, former President of France and the main architect of the Constitutional Treaty that was rejected in the French and Dutch referendums, stated that the EU Reform Treaty adopted in Lisbon was no more than a revised version of the Constitutional Treaty, from which references to the Constitution had deliberately been removed.
Let me quote his words: 'above all to head off any threat of referenda by avoiding any form of constitutional vocabulary' - end of quote.
That is how EU citizens learned that a referendum on the Reform Treaty is a threat to Europe, and the authors of this Treaty concede that manipulations are deliberately being practised to deceive the peoples of Europe.
This outrageous utterance shows that referendums on the Treaty are needed, but before they are held an honest debate is required, not least in the forum of the European Parliament.
Our electorate must be made aware of what this document really is.
(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, during a recent meeting with Czech citizens I was informed that there are still people there who are experiencing difficulties with the still pending harmonisation of EU legislation on concessions for disabled people travelling outside their home country.
I have already spoken this year in Parliament about the fact that harmonisation of EU legislation, which would enable people with different degrees of mental and physical disability to obtain a single document entitling them to concessions throughout the EU, would allow them to exercise their right to free movement, and as such it would enable them to participate more fully in our society.
Another issue voiced by the citizens that merits our attention concerns the deadline for calls for submissions of projects for financing under the European Social Fund.
I appreciate that the funds are directed to the citizens in need.
However, drawing up and submitting projects in the period between the launch of the call and the deadline for submission is, according to disability organisations, at times a superhuman achievement even for a completely healthy person.
I know that the Reform Treaty gives greater consideration to people with disabilities but it will not resolve everything.
We must therefore look at whether we need to pay more attention to people with disabilities.
Where are the boundaries between the able-bodied and the disabled?
As far as assistance goes, who is the giver and who is on the receiving end?
Any one of us might one day find ourselves on the other side of this equation.
- (PL) Mr President, the Polish press has reported that the names of two Polish women have been left off the memorial in Madrid commemorating the victims of the terrorist attack on 11 March 2004.
The missing names are those of Danuta Teresa Szpila and Alina Maria Bryk.
Their families are offended.
The memorial was unveiled eight months ago.
The names of immigrants from Morocco and Romania have also been omitted.
I am therefore asking my fellow Members from Spain: has this error been put right yet?
Why were these names not included on the memorial?
I would also ask, Mr President, that you show an interest and intervene in this matter.
(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, the final decision on the entry of nine EU Member States into the Schengen area was welcomed with enthusiasm by the citizens of the Czech Republic.
It will imply formal changes to the security system and protection of national borders and facilitate the free movement of goods and people, but it will also have some surprising complications.
At the recent meeting of local authorities from South Bohemia, Bavaria and Upper Austria, some experts mentioned that the new obstacle along the former national borders could be the so-called 'non-interference zone' of the Å umava National Park.
Some tourist routes from Bavaria border the non-interference zone and the strict environmental laws do not allow these routes to cross Czech territory.
Not so long ago there was an Iron Curtain along the Czech-Austrian and Czech-German borders, which cut off the former East Germany and Czechoslovakia, ruled by a totalitarian communist regime, from the democratic world.
We might live to experience a situation whereby the people in these regions are divided not by an iron but by a green curtain.
(DE) Mr President, I beg your pardon, but in the second-to-last intervention the German translation by our otherwise extremely capable interpreter stated that Mr SÃ¶der was Bulgaria's Minister for Europe.
I think it is important to point out, however, that he is in fact Bavaria's Minister for Europe, and this shows how important it is that we receive written minutes again, and not only audiovisual recordings.
We shall note that.
Mr DÃ®ncu now has the floor.
Is he absent?
Mr President, this is a 'catch-the-eye' debate.
How did that Member manage to catch your eye without being here?
I understand that you have an interest in promoting 'catch-the-eye', so you have succeeded!
Mr President, I would like to draw your attention to the increasing activity of far-right extremist forces, which sometimes we tend to forget and even to forgive.
In less than a month we have faced a number of worrying events.
In October a group of young Italians outraged the memory of the Holocaust, shouting in favour of Hitler in the Dachau concentration camp.
Spain has witnessed racist attacks against immigrants in Barcelona and Madrid.
The paramilitary Hungarian Guard has shown its violent face in Budapest.
In recent days we have seen far-right ideas which are contrary to the very basic values of our European project infecting political life in Belgium and Italy and influencing political decisions and actions.
Special attention should be given to last week's far-right rally in Prague, which attempted to celebrate the 1938 anti-Jewish purge known as the Kristallnacht on 9 November.
All these events are becoming part of our daily life.
It is time to wake up.
We, the European parliamentarians, should lead the battle for the principles which brought us into this House: peace, democracy, tolerance, justice and solidarity.
Let me underline that the existence of a far-right political group in this Parliament is encouraging extremists across Europe.
My only hope is that this abuse of democracy will soon be brought to an end.
Mr President, it is almost certain that the foot-and-mouth disease virus that caused enormous damage to the British economy last summer escaped from the Pirbright Laboratory in Surrey.
This establishment is an EU reference laboratory which is supposed to protect our animals from contagious diseases and not to cause epidemics through incompetence.
In the last two weeks the same laboratory has been the protagonist in what appears to be another fiasco.
It has been issuing scores of confusing and sometimes contradictory results, with respect to foot-and-mouth disease, on animal samples sent from Cyprus.
This apparent irresponsible behaviour has had severe effects on hundreds of farmers on the island.
The Cyprus authorities blame all the confusion on the European Commission, and the citizens are understandably rather upset.
Before Pirbright causes another dangerous blunder, could you please ask the Commission to take this laboratory off the list of animal testing reference laboratories and replace it with a more trustworthy facility, for agriculture's sake?
- (PL) Mr President, I would like to raise an issue that was bothering us all not so long ago; namely the change from summer to winter time (and back again in March).
It is said that this brings considerable savings in electricity consumption.
It seems to me that this is not so, as the amount of daylight does not change in any way.
Nor does electricity consumption for street lighting, as this is regulated automatically, depending on the amount of natural light available.
Electricity consumption at industrial plants does not change.
The only minor savings are in household electricity consumption, but new timetables are printed, trains are stopped, there is disruption for the elderly and also for children, and there is disruption to information systems.
I would be glad, Mr President, if Parliament were to hear authoritative information from the Commission concerning the gains and losses brought about by the time change.
Mr President, I would like to bring to the attention of the House a proposal by FIFA, the governing body of football, allowing players born in Northern Ireland to represent the Republic of Ireland.
The Northern Ireland football team has a very proud history going back many decades and has produced many great football teams over the years, defeating many of the large nations in Europe.
Over those years, Northern Ireland has had many difficulties, as it has over the past 30 years, but during all that time, soccer was able to bring the people together.
So I say clearly to FIFA: you are wrong to go down this road, and it would certainly not help Northern Ireland's chances of developing totally in the future, especially at a time when we believed we were returning to normality.
Mr President, I would like to raise the issue of Cadbury Schweppes, which has just announced in my own constituency that it is going to close its factory in Keynsham with the loss of 500 jobs and move production to Poland.
This has been opposed by the British and Polish trade unions as they believe that this is an attempt by Cadbury Schweppes to race to the bottom, with people prepared to take the lowest wages being taken on board.
Chocolate has been produced in Keynsham for 250 years, and for nearly 100 years by Cadbury Schweppes.
It is going to create 500 job losses there and the total, with the knock-on effects for subcontractors, will be something like 1 500.
It is hoping to get European money to help pay for moving this production.
I am fully in favour of European job-creation projects, and I hope that the Commission will continue them - whether in the United Kingdom, Poland or elsewhere - but money from the European Union is for job creation and not job relocation.
I hope the point will be made very clearly to the Commission that we do not expect it to pay for these job losses.
- (PL) Mr President, EU integration is passing through a series of phases.
As a result of implementation of the Schengen Agreement, another group of states will enter the area which border restrictions and controls have been lifted.
We welcome this, as a considerable proportion of Poland's eastern border is also an EU border.
The entry into force of the Schengen provisions has obliged on Poland to carry out extra controls on this border.
I am thinking particularly of the border with Ukraine, a state that is becoming an important EU partner since its democratic and economic transition.
Poland and Ukraine are linked by centuries of history as neighbours.
Today we need especially close contacts and cooperation between our citizens and our peoples.
We must therefore create good conditions and make it convenient for people crossing the Ukrainian-Polish, border - that is, the Ukrainian-EU border - while keeping unnecessary administrative requirements and costs to a minimum.
This should not be a border of division, but one of neighbourly cooperation - a border that in future will persist only formally, on paper, when Ukraine becomes integrated into the EU - and let us hope that it will.
(HU) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to speak about the situation that has developed in connection with that of the Romanian Roma in Italy.
I feel it is regrettable that such a tragedy had to occur in order for the Italian decision, which everyone has interpreted differently, to shed light on the real problem, which I have represented at every forum for as long as I can remember.
In this very Chamber I always mentioned the lack of a Roma integration policy during the accession discussions for Romania and Bulgaria.
If minority groups leave their homeland in the hope of a better life, that is also a problem.
But it is also an enormous problem that there are discriminatory situations within the borders of the European Union and certain minority groups are forced to leave the land of their birth.
The time has come to create the comprehensive strategy that we voted for in our decision of April 2005 - this Parliament voted for it - in which we asked the Commission to urge the Member States to create the strategy.
Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary and Slovakia have already created the strategy and are participating in the Decade of Roma Inclusion programme.
If the 2005 guidelines and Parliamentary decision were not satisfactory for the Commission or for the other Member States, the matter must be taken up again.
We not only need to create a comprehensive Roma strategy but, with regard to urging the creation of the strategy and to its seriousness, we also need to create a so-called EU fund as soon as possible in the interests of fully integrating the Roma, especially in order to stop educational segregation.
- (PL) Mr President, I was really supposed to be speaking today about the situation in Burma, but information I have received obliges me to draw your attention once again to Russia.
While preparations for the European Union summit were taking place in Mafra, in the Russian city of Kazan, 720 kilometres from Moscow, another round in the long-running battle between the authorities and the media was being played out.
This time the part of victim was played by Natalia Petrova, a maker of documentary films about, among other subjects, Chechnya.
The role of the torturers was played by plain-clothes officers from the local police.
They arrested Ms Petrova at her home in front of her parents and two small children.
During her arrest she lost consciousness, was struck several times and was burned with cigarettes.
She came round at police headquarters, from where she was released after a few hours.
One of the journalist's daughters also suffered injuries, as did her mother.
Are these the standards of police behaviour in a democratic state that is a member of the Council of Europe?
Are these events to be robustly exposed in this forum in order to make Europe aware of what is really happening in Russia?
(PT) I should like to use the opening of the plenary session of the European Parliament to express our solidarity with the Gestnave and Erecta workers who are doggedly and courageously continuing to fight for integration into Lisnave.
That integration, if they achieve it, is merely the implementation of what is stipulated in the agreement signed 10 years ago between the Portuguese State and the Mello Group within the framework of the restructuring of the SetÃºbal peninsula shipbuilding industry, but also of what is enshrined in the Portuguese Labour Code.
Finally, I should like to express our full support for the innumerable initiatives which the Gestnave, Erecta and Lisnave workers have taken over the years to enforce the law and bring justice for the workers and the future of the shipbuilding and repair industry in Portugal.
Mr President, a recent poll in Ireland showed support for the Reform Treaty to be at alarmingly low levels of just under 25% saying yes and over 62% undecided.
Yet this week the Commission's draft legislative work programme for 2008 states that 'work will also be continued in order to allow companies to choose an EU-wide tax base'.
Dr Sean Barrett, a senior lecturer in economics at Trinity College Dublin, has today described the reduction of the corporation tax rate in Ireland from 50% in the 1980s to 12Âœ% a decade later as 'the most important policy measure that achieved the transformation of Ireland'.
The concept of an EU-wide tax base with the dangerous option to collect corporation tax on sales based on the rate in each country undermines trust, contributes to rising Euro-scepticism in Ireland and is extremely misplaced in the context of the ratification of the Reform Treaty.
I therefore ask that this matter be raised urgently with the Commission.
Our focus should be on the important elements of the proposed Treaty and the real obstacles in the internal market, not jeopardising emerging markets, inward investment and the future ratification of the Treaty by working on an unwise, distrusted and thus unacceptable common tax-base proposal.
Commissioner FigeÄŸ is here, so I am sure that he has taken careful note of that.
(SK) This coming 17 November is for the Czech and Slovak people as symbolically important as the fall of the Berlin Wall was for the Germans.
Eighteen years ago a barbarian totalitarian regime came to an end in these countries.
Subsequently, the Czech and Slovak people once more became part of Europe.
Because of this event, 17 November is an anniversary that is alive, a symbol of something important to be remembered.
The united Europe is founded on the defeat not just of Nazism but also of Communism.
Just as not dealing with the Nazi crimes and criminals has been a threat to Europe, the same applies to the crimes of the Communist regime.
I would like to recall here the legacy of Pope John Paul II, whose famous words 'do not be afraid' were an important display of solidarity for Slovak dissent.
I would also like to mention President Reagan, whose words about the 'Evil Empire' turned him into our President, even though we did not vote for him.
Communism was defeated by the courage of men and women; injustice made way for justice.
Freedom is a great gift, and I am pleased to be able that today as a Member of the European Parliament.
(HU) A decisive majority of the European Parliament has rightly been disgusted with events in Italy, but there is extraordinarily great hypocrisy in this, ladies and gentlemen.
As if we didn't know that there are 3-4 million Roma living in difficult circumstances in Romania; as if we didn't know that there are 12 million Roma living in Europe.
This also demonstrates that the European Union does not have a minorities policy, not for indigenous minorities, not for the Roma, nor for migrant minorities.
I am pleased and proud that the European Socialists have condemned the principle of collective guilt in Italy, and I would also have been pleased if my own group had done the same with regard to the collective branding of the Hungarian minority living in Slovakia.
Mr President, I would very much like to ask that during this parliamentary session there should at last be a person responsible for minority matters in the European Parliament, the Subcommittee on Human Rights should finally be a proper committee, and there should finally be some monitoring, since our President is a truly 'minority-friendly' President.
Thank you.
(DE) Mr President, we saw only recently the fourth anniversary of the imprisonment of Mikhail Khodorkovsky and Platon Lebedev, who has heart problems and is suffering from hepatitis.
It is unacceptable that these two men remain in prison in the Siberian city of Chita, in violation of Russian law.
For spurious reasons, their applications for early release, which is possible under Russian law, were overruled, despite good behaviour.
This was clearly a step designed to keep opposition to a minimum before next year's election.
When our group visited Moscow two weeks ago, I met with Mr Khodorkovsky's lawyer, Mr Yuri Schmidt.
We also met with various other representatives of Memorial, with Garry Kasparov and Grigory Yavlinsky, all of whom confirmed that the Yukos problem is very much a political one.
I therefore call upon the EU to address human rights violations more intensively and clearly in its dialogue with Russia.
What matters here is not retribution, but humanity and justice.
- (EL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to talk about the tragic political situation in Lebanon and the role that the EU is urgently called upon to play.
Today is all too typical of this crisis, because once again the election of the President of the Republic has been postponed.
Regional power squabbles affecting Lebanon have deepened the rift between political groups.
As a result, the people are being held hostage, there is a risk of civil war and the whole area is unstable.
The EU, which is in partnership with Lebanon, is following an action plan determined by its Neighbourhood Policy.
The EU and its Member States contribute 40% of international development aid.
The Union has met its responsibilities in the strengthened peacekeeping force.
Yet all this is useless unless a national agreement is reached to avert the crisis.
The way ahead is difficult, if not impossible, owing to the failure of the presidential election.
The Union must play its part as an effective negotiator and initiate real dialogue.
We have no time to dither; we cannot just wait and see.
Mr President, the European Court of Human Rights recently made a ruling with far-reaching implications.
The case in question was that of the Amalgamated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen versus the UK.
It concerned Mr Jay Lee, who had been a member of ASLEF and the British National Party.
Mr Lee was expelled by ASLEF because of his BNP membership.
The Court upheld this action.
The BNP is a political party with its roots in neo-Nazism.
Nevertheless, under UK law, membership is perfectly legal.
The British Government has conceded that trade union law must now be amended so that unions can expel members whose political views they do not like.
The role of trade unions is to collectively represent the material interests of their members in the workplace, not to decide what political views are acceptable or unacceptable.
The Court's decision is yet another European nail in the coffin of British liberties.
Mr President, we were shocked at last week's violent clashes between protestors and police in Tbilisi, Georgia.
The fact that President Mikhail Saakashvili declared a state of emergency to overcome the riots and conducted a violent crackdown is highly alarming.
According to statements from the participants, the riots had nothing to do with external influences, but were the expression of severe displeasure with the Government.
President Saakashvili overreacted, since violence is not an appropriate solution when addressing the justified concerns of the opposition.
Furthermore, President Saakashvili declared that there would be presidential elections in Georgia in January 2008.
We should not overlook the disturbances.
The EU has provided Georgia, as a European Neighbourhood Policy country of destination, with advice on carrying out its regime transition.
We should ask ourselves whether we have done our best to avoid such a crisis from occurring and, moreover, whether we can be sure that this will not reoccur in some other destination country.
Mr President, at the recent Mafra summit, the Russian side proposed founding an institute to monitor the human rights situation in the EU countries.
The Russian representatives commend this initiative as a political measure to counterbalance continued EU criticism of the worsening human rights situation in Russia.
The institute in question will be financed by Russia.
In my opinion, the EU leaders should in principle avoid such attempts to politicise human rights issues.
It is true that there exist adequate human rights dialogue mechanisms between the EU and Russia.
These mechanisms unfortunately have not been adequately used, due mainly to the lack of Russian response to the problems raised by the EU.
Following this idea, one could imagine that, next, President Ahmadinejad will insist on establishing on EU territory an Iranian-financed institute on human rights and Holocaust studies.
I am convinced that initiatives like this can only discredit the noble cause of defending human rights.
The role of sport in education (debate)
The next item is the report by PÃ¡l Schmitt, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, on the role of sport in education.
rapporteur. - (HU) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, allow me first of all to express my thanks for the numerous remarks and recommended improvements that have been sent for my report.
My objective was to talk about strengthening the role of school PE and sport in education.
Nearly a quarter of the children living in the European Union are overweight, and 50% of them only participate in sports activities during school PE classes, whilst the number of PE classes is continuously falling.
As a result of this dangerous process, diabetes, high blood pressure, diseases of the heart and nervous system, spinal and vascular ailments are spreading throughout Europe and will significantly increase the health care expenditure of individual Member States in the future.
We cannot allow ourselves to compensate for the inactive lifestyle and sedentary everyday life typical of European adolescents by neglecting such a simple yet effective tool as the PE class.
As a one-time Olympian, a practising sports director and naturally as an MEP, it is my obligation and my responsibility to find a way for the Union to do its share in the fight against obesity in pupils, in supporting a healthy, active lifestyle, in establishing the health of European adolescents and in the process of education through sport.
Allow me to congratulate the heads of the Member States on their wise decision not to forget sport at the latest Lisbon summit and to give the Union the right of initiative in sport after approving the Reform Treaty.
The Commission has prepared numerous programmes for promoting a healthy lifestyle, and in the field of healthy nutrition, but there is not enough coordination among these programmes.
Sports experts, PE teachers and trainers must be given a greater role and respect in their implementation.
It must be said that the White Paper on Sport published by the Commission in July, and the Action Plan relating to it, are a step in the right direction.
We are also counting on the cooperation of the Commission in promoting research that is important for sports experts, and in gathering statistical data to measure the sporting activities of pupils and their physical condition.
I feel it is important that, using lifelong learning and the framework of the Bologna process, we can promote mobility and continued training for trainers and PE teachers, we can mutually recognise the degrees that attest to their qualifications, and we can assist with more effective cooperation among organisations of sports experts.
In addition to physical exercise, PE in schools develops such important qualities as persistence, team spirit, willpower and fair play, which the young people entrusted to us will be able to benefit from throughout their lives.
School sports facilities and gymnasia in the Member States are often extraordinarily neglected, and they are poorly maintained and shabby.
Another great problem is the lack of qualified PE teachers, that is, the disorganised state of further professional training and the fact that the content of the PE curriculum is out of date.
Unfortunately, PE in schools has lost its importance, although it is the basis for both physical and mental development.
Delicate and rough movements, which can be well developed through sport and popular games or any activity involving movement, are also essential in the study of reading and writing.
It is no accident that dyslexic and dysgraphic children are also treated using movement therapy.
PE is the only subject in the curriculum that focuses not only on mental development but also on physical development, the development of an active culture and hygiene.
It is a joint task for PE teachers and parents to teach and encourage children to have a healthy lifestyle and to take regular exercise, and to draw their attention to the harmful physical and mental effects of prohibited performance-enhancing drugs, alcohol and other drugs.
In order to improve the state of health and physical condition of children of school age, we recommend that PE in schools be made compulsory in primary and secondary schools, and that there be an opportunity for children to exercise at least three times a week as part of the curriculum.
Sport has a prominent role in promoting social integration and reinforcing social cohesion, in so far as sport is an important tool for socialisation and intercultural dialogue.
The issue of gender equality has been given a big role in the report.
I also feel it is important that those who live with a disability should also participate in regular PE at school that corresponds to their needs and is increasingly integrated.
In my report, I also mention that PE and organised sports at school play a prominent role, not only physically but also mentally, in the healthy development of children and, at the same time, a level of socialisation.
I recommend in my report that the regions that have been left behind in this field should be able to compete for funding for sports investment from the Structural Funds.
Finally, I would like to thank the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs for their valuable contributions to the report.
Ladies and gentlemen, I respectfully ask you to support my report.
Thank you for your attention.
(DE) Madam President, I asked for the floor before the report was announced.
The President in the chair before you called upon a large number of Members - as part of the catch-the-eye procedure - who were not even present in the House.
For that, he was reprimanded by the Rules of Procedure incarnate, Mr Corbett.
I tried to speak dozens of times, and also handed in my request, but was ignored.
I believe that what the President in the chair before you has just done is contrary to the rules of this House and unworthy of this Parliament.
Mr Martin, there were far too many one-minute speeches.
Normally it lasts half an hour.
It has overrun that by quite a lot, so I am sorry.
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, first of all my congratulations to Mr Schmitt and the committee on the own-initiative report.
This report is timely and very inspirational.
We used this report in drafting our White Paper as one of the contributions that I think important in a common strategy towards sport in Europe and I am happy that there is a lot of concrete convergence between the White Paper adopted in July and this report.
In general this report and our White Paper agree that the general orientation of physical education does not necessarily correspond to today's societal needs.
The subject is increasingly marginalised within school curricula programmes, so that is why we need to improve.
I would like to mention some of the issues or areas in the report and in the White Paper.
Both documents recommend enhanced cooperation between the health, education and sport sectors to define and implement strategies to reduce health risks such as being overweight.
Regarding the time devoted to physical education, we will build this into a set of physical activity guidelines.
We should develop this with Member States by the end of next year, 2008.
We are also considering introducing the award of a European label to schools which are actively involved in supporting and promoting physical activities in a school environment.
Concerning research, the White Paper proposes mobilising the seventh Research Framework Programme to support multidisciplinary research in this area, mainly on lifestyle aspects of health.
We also recommend considering the role of sport in the field of social inclusion, social integration and equal opportunities in the programming of Structural Funds.
Concerning investment, as far as top class sport is concerned, we have launched a study on the training of young top-level sportsmen and sportswomen in Europe.
This should enable us to identify the right instruments to develop sports training and education for young persons, and also ensure higher quality and quality more generally.
In the mean time, we are supporting sport and physical activity through the Lifelong Learning programme, the Youth in Action programme and the Europe for Citizens programme.
Let me underline at this moment that the general call for proposals for 2008, 2009 and 2010 in the framework of the Lifelong Learning Programme has included physical education and sport among its priorities, and this will open new funding opportunities for this education area.
To conclude, we are looking forward, as Mr Schmitt mentioned, to the ratification and entry into force of the Reform Treaty because this will open up new possibilities.
Our experience with the Pierre de Coubertin Action Plan and your own report will help us to shape those possibilities better to support Member States' efforts to promote the role of sport in education in the coming years.
I thank you again for your contribution.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, in sport - and we are talking about fairness here - no distinctions can be made between the sexes; women must be treated equally.
This begins during the school years, during PE classes, and extends right through to high-performance training in top-class sport, for here far too little consideration is given to female traits and female biological requirements.
More attention needs to be directed to this.
In top-class sport, the same applies to the public and to attention from the media, which has an effect on funding.
Women are greatly disadvantaged in top-class sport, and it is high time that we made sure that fair play applies to everyone in this regard, too.
We also need to ensure that the integration of girls from different cultural groups into school sporting activities works better, and must try to involve everybody, despite religious and cultural differences.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to congratulate our fellow Member Mr Schmitt, who has brought his experience to bear in his report.
I stress that sport and children's participation in sports activities are very necessary today in view of the changes that have taken place in our everyday lives.
Children these days spend much of their time in front of the television, video games and computers.
Their diet is anything but healthy.
Child obesity has become an increasingly serious problem inevitably entailing serious health hazards.
For children sport is not only a way of exercising and developing new group skills; it is also recreational and teaches teamwork.
The physical exercise involved in doing sport has a beneficial effect on young people's physical health.
Commissioner, children are not eating more, but they are less active and get less exercise.
A sedentary life and obesity often cause high blood pressure and diabetes, which affect a steadily increasing proportion of the EU's population.
Member States today must promote physical exercise as a school subject in order to prepare children for a healthy lifestyle.
Member States and the competent authorities must ensure that greater emphasis is placed on the promotion of health in the curriculum, and that physical education is given equal status with other subjects on the timetable.
Member States must also lay down a minimum requirement for the number of physical education lessons in schools.
Lastly, the Member States must actively support all forms of physical education and promote dialogue between parents, PE teachers and sports associations outside school.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DA) Madam President, I should like to thank Mr Schmitt for his good report and for his constructive collaboration during the preparation of this.
The role of sport generally and specifically within education is an incredibly important issue.
Commissioner Kyprianou said less than a month ago that he believed that the greatest threat to the health of EU citizens was obesity.
Unfortunately, I think that he is right, and therefore it is crucial that we focus on the problem and on what we can do to solve it.
We have an important obligation to our children, particularly those who do not form good eating and sports habits at home for social or family-related reasons.
Therefore, the focus on the role of sport in education is important.
School can and should play a major role in providing children with good habits, as children spend a large proportion of their day there.
As pointed out in the report, it is therefore not necessary to discuss whether sport is essential within education.
However, it is important that we discuss how we can ensure that there is more sport in school.
It is also important that children develop good exercise habits as early on as possible.
This is obvious for health reasons but, at the same time, as Mr Schmitt has also said, we know that exercise and sport can develop social relationships among children and young people and create social integration irrespective of ethnicity and social class.
This is why sport is such an important tool.
What can we do, therefore?
We must ensure that children have the opportunity to do more exercise than is the case today.
Sport should not just be something for affluent children.
Sport should be a natural part of every child's life.
At this juncture, it is also necessary to ensure that sport does not only mean competitive sport, but something that everyone can participate in, and that is why it is important that sport be integrated within education.
There is therefore a general need for individual Member States to prioritise sport as a part of education much more than is the case today, and as part of this to ensure that the correct facilities are available and also qualified teachers, for example.
It is therefore clearly a key responsibility for the Member States, but with this report we want to help focus on the problem and the possible solutions, and naturally also highlight what the EU can do in connection with this.
In addition, there are three things that are required.
We need teachers to have a greater insight into the reasons for the barriers to children participating in sport.
A better relationship between sport at school and sport in leisure time also needs to be created.
In addition, as has been mentioned previously, we need to prioritise resources, time and sports facilities.
I am very pleased with the report; it is a good report and sets out the conditions that are required in order for sport to help improve the health of children.
Therefore, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament wholeheartedly supports the report, but we feel that it is important that it be only the first step towards a major initiative to deal with the problem of obesity.
We believe that it is necessary for us to both use more resources and take more time in this area.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FI) Madam President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Schmitt, for this report.
It has to be said that this is an excellent and timely topic.
It raises the issue of physical education and the role of sport in schools.
If we look back these 20 to 30 years, as Europeans we know that this is one area of school education that we have neglected.
This is conspicuous everywhere in Europe in the shape of a decline in general fitness.
It is also conspicuous as a range of side-effects.
Fort example, there has been a noticeable increase in obesity.
Diabetes has also become a commoner phenomenon, as has cardiovascular disease.
Mental health problems have also become commoner.
We might also suggest, as has already been said here, and as said earlier on by Mr Mavrommatis, who is from the land we know as Ancient Greece, that in olden times it was said that a healthy soul in a healthy body is the very best situation, and this is what we should be aiming for once again in Europe.
We should also understand that exercise is vitally important for a person's general wellbeing.
We live in what we call the information society in Europe, but I hope the information society might become something more.
It could be an education society, which also extends to body education and exercise.
In Finland our Olympic winner Tapio Korjus is now heading a body education project, which is an attempt to promote the view that healthy physical education has an effect on a person's general wellbeing.
We are inclined to think that good results are expected to appear on the horizon.
The core issue, however, is teacher training and schools, with physical exercise actually becoming a priority in teacher training.
This should also be required of teachers because there are special problems with many children in remote areas.
I really hope that improvements will be made to physical education, that schools and fitness organisations will find one another more easily, and that all children and young people can experience the delights of physical education in their own lives and build their future upon it.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Madam President, physical activity is indisputably an important factor in the life of every person.
It could be said to improve the state of our health and of our souls.
According to numerous studies and statistics, the state of health of EU citizens is deteriorating year on year as a result of a lifestyle that is getting faster and faster and is causing us to devote less and less time to sporting pursuits and recreation.
If we add poor diet to this, for example the inclusion of fast foods in the daily menu, we could say that a healthy lifestyle has been abandoned.
What is worse, we are responsible for the health of children and young people who are suffering increasingly from obesity and coronary diseases.
The lifestyle we impose on children is one of travelling to school by car, inadequate physical education at school, returning home by car and, once home, computers and television, which is not the best of lifestyles.
This is why now is the time to take stock and to support all useful initiatives aimed at creating an active lifestyle.
It is time to pass resolutions on the role of sport in education along with the comments and proposals announced by Mr Schmitt.
It is time we took the subject seriously.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (ES) Madam President, on behalf of my group, I would like to first of all congratulate Mr Schmitt on this report, and also stress the importance of increasing the number of hours of teaching of physical education in schools.
Adequate time spent doing the right physical activity is the best possible way to complement all-round personal development, from both a mental and a physical point of view.
Balancing time dedicated to study with the time needed for sport is a challenge that we need to meet for our children as soon as possible, as it will enable us to ensure that they have a good quality of life in the future.
It should also be taken into account that this is a key time for acquiring habits, which means that physical education is vital.
I would also like to highlight the need to introduce campaigns aimed at children, and this is a request to the Commission.
These campaigns and programmes need to be aimed at children and their parents so that they adopt healthy lifestyles that include physical activity and exclude habits such as smoking, which continues to be one of the blots on health in Europe.
To conclude, I think that all the speakers so far have mentioned improving training for physical education teachers, as, at the end of the day, this programme cannot go ahead without them.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (SV) Madam President, this report on the role of sport in education deals in detail with the question of how Member States shall organise the subject of physical education in school.
It is another example of how the EU's politicians and officials go into any area and at any level of detail they choose in their zeal to centralise political power here.
Subsidiarity is embraced in speeches, but is never respected in political practice.
This sets a new record for absurdly detailed regulation.
Let me give some examples.
Paragraph 10 says that the Member States shall be called on to make PE compulsory in primary and secondary schools and that at least three PE lessons per week should be guaranteed.
Paragraph 24 talks about the importance of offering sports coeducation for children at nursery and primary schools.
This is the kind of thing people are getting up to.
It is a brazen and ridiculous attempt to promote the position of the EU in an area which should be decided upon by the peoples of Europe themselves.
on behalf of the ITS Group - (BG) Mme Chairperson, Colleagues, It is gratifying to note that such a famous and prominent name in world sports as PÃ¡l Schmitt has contriubuted his authority to raise a very important issue for the future of Europeans before the European Parliament.
For the attitude to sports is, in fact, attitude to the health of people in united Europe.
I feel honoured and proud to speak on his report as an athlete, as a representative of an ancient people with immense sport spirit, and also as a person concerned with the future of children in united Europe, the future of our children.
In my opinion, things are crystal clear: more sports at school, less drugs at school; more spending for sports at school, less spending for healthcare because it is perfectly obvious that it is ten times better for our children to be happy than to be better cured; more sports competition at the earliest age, less aggression in the other spheres of life; more international sporets races involving school children, less inter-ethnic and inter-state tensions in the European Union and in the world at large.
Therefore, bacause of the time constraint, I would like to highlight those aspects that need further development on the basis of the report by the champion and highly respected athlete and politician PÃ¡l Schmitt.
I would like to see a recommendation of the European Parliament to all Member States to increase the number of sports classes at school to five hours a week.
I suggest that the European Parliament think seriously and include in its future budget a proposal to organise international competitions under its auspices for schoolchildren in some sports that are most useful to adolescents.
The report points out that sports at school is unattractive.
Have you ever thought why football is attractive?
Because football players are stars.
Let us have Europe single out its school sport stars in various areas!
Thus will shall give much more publicity to sports at school that a directive or a recommendation could possibly give.
They will be European school champions in athletics, football and basketball, martial arts or swimming.
In this way, we might not be able to restore the Spartan ideal of a healthy spirit in a healthy body, mens sana in corporare sano, in its authentic meaning, but we shall contribute much more than a report could contribute.
The decision to hold youth Olympics in 2010 follows these lines but the Olympic spirit cannot prevail in school sports if we rely only on the four-year Olympic cycle.
We should use time in between more intensively by offering a meaningful sports calendar for school children.
The European Parliament should make special efforts to prevent the spread of drugs through sports at school.
In closing, I believe that the uderstanding of this Parliament about sports at the earliest age bodes well for the future...
(The Chairperson iterrupts the speaker)
(SL) The importance of physical exercise to the development and health of young people is well known.
However, we also know that present-day lifestyles mean that many children spend a great deal of time indoors and in front of computers.
Therefore, Mr Schmitt's report, which aims to encourage the Member States and all of us to rethink the role of sport in education, is very important.
I would like to point out two aspects which are also referred to fleetingly in the report.
Firstly, the importance of sports education to children with special needs.
There is a tendency for as many of such children as possible to be integrated into mainstream schools.
However, because of the different needs of these children and young people it is not always possible to provide appropriate equipment and treatment in a mainstream school.
On the other hand, precisely these children require special attention and physical activity since movement-impaired children, for example, spend a great deal of time in a sedentary position and therefore need even greater opportunities for exercise.
Consequently, where they are included in mainstream schools, appropriate conditions for physical activity adapted to them should be provided.
The second aspect I would like to point out is the role of sports clubs and the impact of sports coaches on the development of young people.
It is not only sporting achievements that are important but also health and educational work with young people, to which coaches in clubs should also devote a great deal of attention.
Parents want to entrust their children to someone who will not only strive for the best possible sporting achievement but also look after their health and act as an educator and a role model in all respects.
Only in these terms can we speak of the positive role of sport in the lives of young people.
(DE) Madam President, there was of course the European Year of Education through Sport, and I think that we can and should go back to many of the conclusions that Year brought us in the way of insights.
We have already adopted some resolutions on various matters.
There is still much on the agenda, including the report by Mr Schmitt, and I think we have a great deal of material to hand in order to illustrate and confirm everything that is now being discussed; that is, how important sport is and what we should learn and take from it.
But not enough is happening in sport - I mean, not enough is happening for sport.
People are more aware of health, but obesity and diabetes are on the increase, especially amongst children.
We have spoken a great deal about teacher training, and I think that we have to begin with primary school.
There are no specialist PE teachers in primary schools - at least I know that is true of my country - instead, teachers with general training are used to teach PE as well.
Specially trained teachers are needed here as well, so as to begin as early as possible.
I believe that cooperation between associations, schools and public authorities is very important.
Associations do a lot in the way of education and training work with children, and receive far too little support.
They all struggle financially with too little money, while in fact their services are invaluable.
I am proud of the project currently operating in Austria in which sporting administrators have managed to get into schools and increase the physical education offered, in cooperation with teachers and each state's school organisations.
There is a particular focus on the children's aptitudes and abilities.
I believe it is very important to involve the parents.
We cannot and must not leave everything to public bodies; instead we must also make people aware that nutrition and physical activity are important for children.
It is important to start with the parents here, too.
(DE) Madam President, congratulations to Mr Schmitt on his own-initiative report.
I hold the opposing view to Mr Lundgren.
Unfortunately, in school matters, the European Union is being restrained by the Member States, for any objective analysis of the problem quickly reveals how vital it is that the approach to different aspects of schooling be harmonised.
PE is part of this, in the same way as training in creative thinking or social involvement.
Mr Schmitt's report concentrates on PE.
While in the USA only very sporty students who also have excellent grades get a place at a good university, in Europe it is exactly the other way around.
The higher the level of schooling, the less time there is for young people to be involved in sport.
PE has a lowly status in the world of school.
Sport is regarded as being only a leisure activity, and that is a mistake.
Sport enables people to overcome mental limits, and that is exactly what we need in Europe.
These days, people often manage to have a career in sport despite school, and not because of school.
That is an error in our system, one that the present report brings to our notice.
Finally, I should like to speak up for a community that cannot do so here for itself.
Due to the political situation in their country, young sportspeople in the Turkish part of Cyprus cannot take part in international competitions.
They hope that the European Union will bring an end to their isolation.
By now, more than three years since Cyprus joined the European Union, if a solution is not already in place, at least a proposal for one should be under consideration.
- (PL) Madam President, we take care of the balanced development of our economy, but often we neglect the need for balanced development of our children - not only their intellectual development, but also their physical development.
The school years are a period of dynamic growth in children and young people and of rapid biological development and maturation.
Physical movement and the exercise of various muscle groups is particularly important for health during this period.
Young people spend a lot of time in front of television screens or computer monitors.
This may help intellectual development, but it has a negative impact on physical development.
It causes curvature of the spine.
This may be avoided through regular involvement in sport.
Meanwhile, school sports facilities are often not accessible after lessons, and young people are unable to make use of them.
I support the report.
(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission's White Paper and Mr Schmitt's excellent report feature both the educative function of PE in schools and the role of sport in social integration and fostering good health.
Awareness of all aspects of this in society should now be increased.
Alongside what we have learned from the European Year of Education through Sport and from the Lifelong Learning, Youth and Europe for Citizens programmes, it is now time to devise initiatives to make the most, in our times, of the various forms of physical activity comprising sport, both in schools, clubs and associations, and as spontaneous, informal physical activity.
In an era when we do very little physical activity, sport has much greater significance for us than it did for our parents and grandparents.
In a time when children prefer to play computer games, there is a growing need to promote active, healthy lifestyles for children and young people.
Unfortunately, there are many signs that, in many schools, even the time available for PE often fails to correspond to the reality on the ground - that is, implementation sometimes fails to meet with legal obligations.
It seems that a reality check is necessary in many schools in this regard.
I also support the rapporteur when he calls on the Commission to draw up guidelines on the application of the State aid rules to public sports facilities - naturally, fully respecting the principle of subsidiarity - together with the national and European umbrella organisations for sports.
We need clarity on what type of state support is regarded as acceptable and lawful and which aspects can be integrated with one another, possibly including the strengthening of investment in physical education, and with regard to the financing, if necessary with assistance from European funds within the framework of the Structural Funds, of the modernisation and provision of schools.
- (PL) Madam President, I fully support the draft resolution, and I thank the rapporteur for the very good drafting of this text.
For me there is no doubt: in my youth - and the same will be true of most of you - school and youth sport affected a much larger percentage of young people.
Now the number of hours of PE at school has fallen.
Of course this has an impact on young people's health, as Mrs Tomaszewska has said.
Involvement in sport must be given due prestige.
One way of doing this may be to include sport in the scope of application of the European transfer of credit points in schooling and vocational training.
Mutual recognition of diplomas and licences conferring a right to provide services in the sports sector throughout the European Union will certainly help to guarantee the free flow of students, sports people and employees in Europe and will improve the opportunities for people in this industry to find good jobs.
Emphasis should also be placed on the social and cultural aspect of the existence of clubs and sports associations for local people and national communities.
(RO) Madam President, Mr. Commissioner, dear colleagues, I welcome and support Mr. PÃ¡l Schmitt's report on the role of sport in education because it offers us, one more time, the possibility to get actively involved in improving the life of our fellow citizens.
Supporting physical education and sport, the European Parliament gives a signal not only for a healthier life, but also for the promotion of the common European values that we all inherited from Greece and Ancient Rome.
We have to give more substance to the dictum mens sana in corpore sano via concrete actions which are often conditioned by financial aspects.
For this reason, we ask the Commission, the Council and the Member States to find the adequate instruments to increase investments in the field of school infrastructure and equipment.
One extremely efficient way to achieve this consists in the European funds for disadvantaged regions, especially in the new Member States, which need to be supported in order to increase their capacity of absorption.
Moreover, I believe that the European Union should initiate a sustained media campaign, especially in the TV children and youth programmes, in order to encourage them to practice sport so as to reduce obesity, smoking and drug consumption, as well as to promote correctness, team spirit, discipline, solidarity, tolerance and to combat discrimination.
As regards us, many Members of the European Parliament have practiced sport.
I believe we should establish a way to annually reward the best initiatives for promoting physical education and sport, by offering a prize, for instance.
(NL) Madam President, congratulations to Mr Schmitt on this excellent report, and also once more to Commissioner FigeÄŸ on the White Paper on Sport.
I should like to reiterate that clearly, as this represents a very important step forward, particularly in view of the section on sport contained in the EU Reform Treaty.
Ladies and gentlemen, the European Union's involvement with sport is not evident to everyone; however, whether we like it or not, a number of aspects of sport must be examined from a European angle.
I shall select one such aspect: the plea in Mr Schmitt's report for extra financial support for sports clubs that actively collaborate with schools.
This can be fitted perfectly into the 'open sports ground policy', including in the case of professional sports clubs.
Besides, ladies and gentlemen, sport is an excellent instrument to restore enthusiasm for school and education among socially disadvantaged groups of young people.
I think that this aspect of sport, too, deserves maximum support.
Then there is of course the obesity problem.
This needs to be addressed urgently.
As we read in the Schmitt report, ever more young people are having to deal with this.
In the EU-27, one in four children is now overweight, not because they eat too much, or have a poor diet, but chiefly owing to insufficient physical activity.
Hence the report's appeal to the Member States and the regions to allocate a minimum of three hours a week to sport and include this in the timetable of primary and secondary schools.
This appeal comes not a minute too soon.
We cannot impose this at European level - nor do we want to, of course - but we can mark defaulting Member States and regions as being bottom of the class.
Indeed, this is also an economic necessity, for - as we know - childhood obesity is one of the causes of cardiovascular disease, including in later life.
Thus, we have every interest in investing more time and energy in school sports facilities.
Member of the Commission. ?
(SK) I welcome the very encouraging atmosphere during this debate, which confirms that sport and physical education certainly have an effect on health, but also on certain values held by young people and our entire society.
I think we are all in agreement on the very practical arguments that have been put forward about the preventive role of physical education.
It is appropriate and timely to invest more resources in this direction.
Sport also encourages values such as fair play, team spirit, discipline, an understanding of rules, acceptance of others and solidarity.
That is why sport is a great instrument for integration, whether it be social integration, at a local level or a European level, which does not mean assimilating or absorbing other groups, but encouraging participation within agreed rules.
Therefore, the more education and the more sport in education, the better our coexistence.
As many of you stated, there is consensus on this.
However, what do we need to do now to accomplish more: it is one thing to agree but we must act, too.
I think that there are some elements that show a certain amount of maturity and readiness, and I mentioned one at the beginning.
In the Lifelong Learning Programme 2008-2010 sport and physical education have been prioritised in calls for individual projects for mobility, curricular collaboration and school partnership.
It is an invitation, an offer of space.
The same can be said for the Structural Funds and the modernisation of our schools.
The White Paper is a very comprehensive document.
In 50 years these issues had never been formulated like this because we evolved from steel and coal to issues that are today more inclined towards the knowledge society.
In this context, sport is a very popular and important activity, which is why this contribution today is very important and has come at the right time.
It includes 53 activities for the years ahead, many of which have the aspect of education through sport as a common feature.
I will conclude by saying that Article 149, which refers to education and youth, for the first time also includes a section on sport.
I believe that in the ratification process, which will start after the signing of the Treaty, support for sport will be demonstrated in this dimension, too, and that in a few years, with the gradual developments, the EU might even be able to establish a sports programme, based, of course, on the principle of subsidiarity, as stipulated in the Treaty.
That is part and parcel of this debate, but also of decisions that might be made as part of similar discussions.
I would like once again to thank Mr Schmitt and all those who contributed to this inspiring report, and I look forward to further collaboration.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Tuesday, 13 November 2007.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - (HU) Sport is now far more than a leisure activity: it interweaves all of the economy and society.
Sport is the perfect tool for education: it teaches us about social coexistence and that if an individual is integrated into any group, he can become a useful member.
Through sport, we attain respect for companions, opponents and rules, and we attain solidarity, an enterprising spirit and collective discipline.
Its key role in the world enjoys general recognition everywhere, and sport has become an important player in disseminating positive values and messages and in building socially and environmentally sustainable economies.
The surge in sedentary occupations, the increase in cars, the reduction in exercise and the increasing consumption of food and drink with high energy content are causing significant health problems for our citizens.
Therefore, people must now be persuaded from an early age to live a healthier life - in which exercise is one of the main components - and obviously the proper infrastructure and sports opportunities must be ensured for them.
This concerns a wide, distinct range of branches and activities that are based on institutions, social factors, widespread communication, the expansion of services and political responsibility.
In order for European citizens to change their exercise and healthy lifestyle habits, joint efforts by the public and private sectors will be necessary to change ways of thinking, increase awareness, create specific, practical initiatives and develop infrastructure, and local governments will have a special role to play in this.
in writing. - Mr President, as a former javelin thrower and current President of the Estonian Ski Association, I am sincerely glad that PÃ¡l Schmitt has come up with a report on the role of sport in education.
In Europe there is a great variability in popular sports in different Member States - from skiing in Finland to soccer in the UK, from hockey in the Czech Republic to cycling in the Netherlands.
Altogether we have got many talented trainers who could be more involved in professional exchange to promote diverse sports across Europe and to provide students of all ages with more versatile possibilities.
I fully support Article 50 of the report, which calls on the Commission to promote the European mobility of physical education teachers and trainers.
The European Union stands united in diversity and we should take stock of our extensive expertise in the field of sports.
Another article that I consider immensely significant is Article 10, which calls on the Member States to make physical education compulsory in primary and secondary schools and guarantee at least three lessons of physical education a week, even better one lesson a day, which promotes a healthy lifestyle among European youth.
Statutes for the Euratom Supply Agency (debate)
The next item is the report by Romana Jordan Cizelj, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a Council decision establishing Statutes for the Euratom Supply Agency - C6-0131/2007 -.
Vice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, I wish to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on her report.
Nuclear energy is an important component of a European energy policy mix, and today we are witnessing a renewed interest in nuclear energy, both at European and international level.
The Euratom Supply Agency has, during its more than 45 years of existence, helped to ensure the supply of nuclear fuels for the benefit of Community users.
The Supply Agency is a body which was established by the Euratom Treaty, meaning it stems directly from a primary law instrument.
It aims at the long-term security of supply through reasonable diversification of supply sources for nuclear fuels.
Equal access to sources of supply is an important element of the Euratom Treaty, and this is ensured by the Supply Agency.
Today, the Supply Agency operates on statutes from 1958, when the Community consisted of six Member States.
The enlargement of the European Union calls for the modernisation of these statutes.
This is the purpose of our proposal; this is also why the Supply Agency cannot be considered a new agency within the meaning of the Interinstitutional Agreement between the European Parliament and the European Commission.
The European Parliament has long called for the role of the Agency to be revived and for the powers contained in the Euratom Treaty to be used in full.
I would, in particular, mention the Maldeikis report on the 50th anniversary of the Euratom Treaty, which this House adopted earlier this year.
I am pleased to say that the Commission welcomes most of the amendments proposed.
I share your view that the role of the advisory committee needs to be strengthened.
I also agree that it should contribute more to the preparation of the market surveys of the Agency.
In conclusion, I welcome the support that the European Parliament is giving in order to reinforce the role of the Euratom Supply Agency.
I look forward to the discussion.
rapporteur. - (SL) The role of nuclear energy is becoming increasingly evident, not only in Europe but also globally.
Reliability of supply, energy market competitiveness, and minimisation of the environmental impact of the production and use of energy form the bases of European Union energy policy.
At the same time, sustainable energy development is also having a positive effect on the development of technology, economic growth and employment.
All this points to achievement of the Lisbon strategy objectives.
A balanced energy mix is one of the conditions necessary for sustainable development, combating global warming and climate change, reducing reliance on imports, and ensuring secure energy supplies.
In the European Union, nuclear energy also forms a component part of that mix.
We must therefore ensure that we have a secure and reliable supply of nuclear material and competitive, properly functioning energy markets on which we can rely.
The Euratom Supply Agency was set up for this reason.
Its role needs to be strengthened further in the light of the changing conditions on the world energy markets.
Naturally, I also agree with the Commission that the enlargement of the European Union to 27 Member States and the financial regulation adopted for the Agency demand new, modernised and improved statutes for the Euratom Supply Agency.
I have also emphasised the Agency's increased role in my report.
We need a strong body which will, in addition to its basic role of monitoring supply and demand for nuclear material and services, provide and regularly carry out studies of the risk on the market and of long-term price movement on the market in nuclear materials.
It must have control over the conclusion of long-term nuclear fuel contracts and provide a framework for investment, etc.
In order for all these tasks to be performed successfully, I have proposed a greater role for the Advisory Committee, which I see primarily as an expert body.
On account of its diverse expertise it is able to lend the Agency unique support for the tasks entrusted to it by the Euratom Treaty.
I therefore believe that the number of members of the Advisory Committee should be increased, primarily in terms of experts.
I believe that the Member States which have nuclear fuel cycle activities and also contribute the most funds are entitled to an additional member on the Advisory Committee.
In order to ensure consistency in the work of the Committee and enable it to develop high-level expertise, I propose setting up a Bureau or body of executive officers and that that body be composed of a Chair, two Vice-chairs and two advisors.
Consistency can be provided only by means of a simple structure and a clearly defined role for the executive officers of the Advisory Committee, who form a link between the Advisory Committee and the Agency's Director General.
They must coordinate the activities of the Advisory Committee, in particular those which relate to the drawing up, assessment and review of its reports and the expansion of expertise.
Without investment in knowledge and human resources the set objectives for a competitive and technologically advanced Europe will hardly be met.
I would like to emphasise further the need for transparency, which is largely a matter for the Agency's annual report.
I believe that the European Parliament should also be informed of every major Agency project.
Its role in the Agency's budget procedure must be defined more clearly.
The Agency's annual report, the results of studies and other relevant texts should be received not only by the European Parliament but also by the Council, the Court of Auditors and the Member States.
Only with a good flow of information and the establishment of good practice can we improve the Agency's performance.
The method of financing the Agency, which until now has been rather complicated and unclear on account of the Agency's specific nature, can also help provide transparency.
I would like to simplify this method and therefore support the Agency operating in the same way as other European agencies.
Nuclear energy forms part of the energy mix and I would like it to operate under the same conditions as those which apply to other sources of energy.
In order to make the situation simpler, more transparent and consistent with the provisions of the Euratom Treaty, I propose that the Supply Agency have its own budget line which will be separate from the budget of the Commission departments and in which administrative expenditure will be clearly separated from the Agency's operational expenditure.
This would allow the European Parliament, as a branch of budgetary authority, to acquire control of the Agency's budget, thereby also contributing to a more transparent and democratic Europe.
Whether we agree with the increasing role of nuclear energy or not, its existence is a present-day reality.
We certainly want secure supplies and functioning markets, but this can be provided only by a long-term vision and a powerful body with sufficient powers and democratic control.
The new Statutes for the Euratom Supply Agency seek to attain these objectives.
Finally, I would like to thank the Commission for its cooperation and for answering rather difficult questions on the Statutes.
I would also like to thank the members of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy for their constructive cooperation in drawing up and adopting the report.
I would also ask you to support it in the vote at the plenary session and would be pleased to hear the comments of fellow members.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Madam President, first of all may I join in congratulating Mrs Jordan Cizelj on her report.
She has put a lot of work into making many serious and sensible improvements to this proposal.
I have to say that I hope very much that the Council will take them on board.
I am aware that we are only in consultation on this.
I welcome the emphasis in the report on openness - openness as to the functioning of the Agency - and the emphasis on the role that this Parliament should play in the work of the Agency.
In that vein I support the amendments from the Committee on Budgets, which exercises our authority as part of the budgetary authority.
I also welcome the proposals that Mrs Jordan Cizelj has put in for clarification of the role of the Agency, in particular the role of its committee.
Although I might not personally be quite so enthusiastic about an increase in numbers, nevertheless, I think it is extremely helpful to be more open and specific about the role of the committee.
By way of contrast, I have to express my regret at one or two wrecking amendments, particularly Amendment 39, which I think, rather mischievously - but perhaps deliberately - goes in exactly the opposite direction from the intention and role of the Agency and the whole Euratom Treaty.
But there we are.
Perhaps it is not such a surprise, coming from the Verts/ALE Group.
But, finally, I would like to welcome the renaissance of nuclear energy - as the Commissioner has said, at both European and international level - because of the vital role it will have to play in dealing with climate change.
on behalf of the PSE Group - (BG) Dear colleagues, on behalf of the Socialists, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur Mme Cizelj for the thorough work and the good cooperation within the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy in the preparation of the report.
I believe that the adoption of new Statutes for the Euratom Supply Agency should reflect not only the new number of Member States but also the modern financial rules.
First and foremost, the Statutues should provide the groundwork for strengthening the role of the Agency and ensuring regular supplies under the most favourable terms and conditions for the supply of raw materials and nuclear materielle.
In this connection, I support the proposal for the Agency to reinforce its analytical functions with regard to the development of the market for nuclear materials, and to conduct regular reviews, including market risk analysis.
The prestige of the Agency and the expertise in its work will be enhanced by the proposals to specify and foster the role of the Advisory Board at the Agewncy.
Special attention should also be paid to the proposals to promote transparency in the activities of the Agency.
From the perspective of the role of the European Parliament, it would be appropriate to make changes along two lines: clearer definition of the role of the European Parliament in the budgetary procedure and submission to the European Parliament of the work programme, the annual reports and the studies of the Agency with a view to providing regular and detailed information on its activities.
I am confident that the adoption of the European Parliament's proposals by the Council could provide the foundations to promote the authority of the Agency so that to become a leading initiator of the implementation of the European Parliament's address to the international community in point 9 of its resolution of 14 March 2007 concerning non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament, appealing for support to initiatives for multilateral international uranium enrichmnet centres under the control of the International Atomic Energy Agency.
As Javier Solana pointed out in Lisbon on 6 November at the Euromed meeting, this issue has become particularly topical now, when countries like Morocco, Egypt and Jordan have announced ambitious programmes for the development of nuclear energy.
In closing, I would like to express my confidence that the adoption of the new Statutes for the Euroatom Supply Agency will contribute to the fostering of the role of the European Union in the application of stringent rules for non-proliferation and nuclear safety.
(The speaker continues his speech in English)
I would like especially to thank the Vice-President of the Commission, Mr Frattini, for his support for the proposals made by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and for his statement that the Agency should become a viable body of the European Union in the light of the revival of the role of nuclear energy and a new, more balanced attitude to it.
ALDE Group. - (LT) Ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank our rapporteur for the excellent result, a well-balanced report.
The main role of Euratom Supply Agency is to ensure equal access to and security of nuclear energy supply for all users within the European Union.
Today, the Supply Agency operates on the basis of statutes adopted nearly 50 years ago.
The challenges of life alongside the enlargement of the European Union, as well as the necessity for the Agency to adopt a modern financial attitude, have called for new statutes.
The financial attitude of the new statutes is in compliance with the European Community's general financial framework and is also in line with the enlargement of the European Union.
The discussions on the new statutes have not been easy in view of the composite nature of the Agency.
It is obvious that the agency has actually acted as a Commission body, although, according to the Euratom Agreement, it was established as an agency with legal status and considerable financial independence.
Otherwise it would not have needed statutes, which Commission bodies do not usually have.
It is of great importance to certain Member States because of the type of activities it was expected to carry out.
That is why it does not constitute a typical decentralised agency in an EU sense.
I would like to express my joy at the fact that a consensus has been reached within the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy on the number of members of the Agency's Advisory Committee.
With due respect for the Commission, I would like to point out that the suggestion on limiting the Committee's influence and cutting the number of Committee members down to 42 was not very good, especially in view of the Commission's recommendations to establish such instruments, structures, as the Office of the Energy Observatory, with a view to creating efficient European Energy policy.
The Committee shall assist the Agency in carrying out its tasks by giving opinions and providing information.
It shall act as a link between the Agency and both producers and users in the nuclear industry.
Because of its varied expertise the Committee could provide the Agency with unique support in the tasks assigned to it by the Treaty.
I am in favour of not limiting the terms of office of members of the Advisory Committee.
That way we will be able to achieve stability in the Committee and consistency in its competence.
This amendment is of great importance to small countries, and here I am thinking of my country, Lithuania, and certain others, so I am in favour of it and welcome it.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - Mr President, I fully recognise that energy choices are matters to be decided by individual governments in Europe.
However, I believe that the time has now come for the European Union, possibly via the Euratom Treaty, to set up an independent nuclear inspectorate in Europe, which would have the power to fully investigate safety standards at nuclear plants in Europe.
That said, the British Government should map out a timetable for the orderly closure of the Sellafield nuclear plant, because of the history of serious safety deficiencies and system failures at this facility.
The notorious B30 pond has been home to vast quantities of untreated radioactive materials since 1959, at the Sellafield nuclear plant.
Even the British decommissioning authority is not aware as to the exact levels of untreated radioactive materials at this B30 plant.
The British Government must spell out a detailed plan as to how it is going to decommission this radioactive dump, known as the B30 pond.
Eighty-three thousand litres of radioactive materials which leaked from the THORP nuclear reprocessing facility in April 2005 has ensured that this plant has remained closed since that date.
The British Government should now state that, due to the well-documented safety problems at the THORP plant, this facility should never be reopened.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FI) Mr President, may thanks go to the rapporteur for a serious survey of this issue, although my Group disagrees with many aspects of the matter.
For the Greens the entire Euratom Treaty is the bane of our lives, because it favours nuclear power over safer forms of energy.
We could nevertheless accept the Statutes for the Euratom Supply Agency if they met three conditions: transparency, self-funding and independence of monitoring. Unfortunately, that is not the case.
First of all the Supply Agency is financed by the taxpayer.
This means hidden subsidies for nuclear power.
Article 54 of the Euratom Treaty allows the Agency to collect funds when nuclear material is being sold by means of a charge.
The Greens believe that self-funding should be made compulsory under the law.
Secondly, independence of monitoring should be guaranteed.
This proposal would result in a situation where the Directorate-General for Energy and Transport is both promoting the use of nuclear energy and monitoring it, which is not right, especially as at international level the International Atomic Energy Agency also has an inconsistent role as a monitoring body for nuclear safety and one that promotes nuclear power.
Thirdly, the structure of the Supply Agency's Advisory Committee is distorted, having a disproportionately large share of countries producing nuclear power on it, something which will be made worse by the amendment adopted by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy.
Because of these drawbacks we unfortunately cannot support this proposal.
(SK) I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Cizelj, for her excellent and inspiring report.
The adverse energy situation in the world, the EU's high dependence on energy imports and the rise in greenhouse gas emissions all mean that nuclear energy, despite its many ideological opponents, is receiving more attention at EU level and has already become an integral part of the energy mix of some European countries.
In this context the Euratom Supply Agency has to face these challenges with a view to offering its customers comprehensive and effective services with a high degree of flexibility and access to supply sources.
Allow me to touch briefly on three aspects that are fundamental to the fulfilment of this Agency's mandate.
First of all, I would like to mention the Agency's tasks.
I fully agree with the rapporteur that its tasks should be more clearly defined, in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty and the objectives of a common policy on security of supply of nuclear materials in a renewed energy context.
My second point relates to the Agency itself.
The new Agency Statutes proposed by the Commission seem at first glance to be sufficiently effective with regard to both the organisational structure, for example the reduction in the number of members of the Advisory Committee, and the budget.
Taking into account, however, the Agency's overall role, it should maintain a high level of competences in order to perform its mission in monitoring evaluations, proposing recommendations and conducting specific market studies.
The Agency should have staff with a high level of expertise from the industry at its disposal, with broad experience of the market and fuel cycle operations.
In the area of inter-institutional relationships the European Parliament should receive on a regular basis any important reports from the Agency, which would also increase the transparency of its activities and budget.
The third point concerns the transparency surrounding the financing of the Agency.
Despite the fact that the Agency was established on the basis of the Euratom Treaty, as a legal entity with a high degree of financial autonomy, its relationship to the Commission creates a complex and opaque financial mechanism, allowing only limited access to financial information.
Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, once again I would like to thank the rapporteur for the useful work done.
I also thank you all for the debate, which shows and confirms that there is a need for the modernisation of the Statues of the Euratom Supply Agency.
We adopted the proposal on the Statutes of the Agency in the spring of this year.
Your report will enrich the initial proposal of the Commission.
For this reason, I can assure you that, during the final discussion in the Council, the Commission will support most of the amendments tabled by Parliament.
Once again, I thank you for your support and your attention.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Application of Directive 2004/38/EC on the right of citizens of the Union and their families to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States (debate)
The next item is the Commission statement on the Application of Directive 2004/38/EC on the right of citizens of the Union and their families to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States.
Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, we followed very closely the evolution of the situation in Italy.
We are worried about the growing street crime and wish to express, first of all, our sympathy to the families of individuals who have been victims of criminal activities.
We welcome the bilateral cooperation measures announced last week by the prime ministers of Italy and Romania.
We will ensure that the rights of Romanians are respected, as all citizens' rights should be.
Under the transitional arrangements to the complete opening of labour markets, Romanian nationals must apply for job permits in certain Member States.
We will make sure that Member States observe the principle of non-discrimination in their national legislation and administrative practice.
The Free Movement Directive, Directive 2004/38/EC, allows for the expulsion of European citizens when an individual represents a genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting one of the fundamental interests of society.
This is a decision to be made on a case-by-case basis and in the full respect of the guarantees of substance and procedure.
In cases of immediate expulsion, the urgency must be duly justified.
Under the Directive, the host Member State may expel European citizens also if they no longer fulfil the conditions attached to their right of residence.
Inactive Union citizens may be expelled if they become an unreasonable burden on its social assistance system; in other words, if they do not have legal financial means to guarantee proper daily living conditions.
In this case, expulsion shall be based on objective elements and a ban on re-entry cannot be imposed.
Expelling European citizens is an extreme measure.
It is a limitation of one of the basic freedoms of the Treaty.
Measures should be taken to strike the right balance between the right to free movement and the duty of each Member State to react in the interests of honest citizens when the legal conditions to stay are not fulfilled.
The Italian authorities officially notified the Commission of the text of the decree on 7 November 2007.
The decree must be adopted by the Italian Parliament within 60 days.
As you know, the Italian Parliament has the power to change the text of the decree.
The position of the Commission on the Italian legislation transposing Directive 2004/38/EC will, of course, depend on the final version of the law as it emerges from the Italian Parliament.
The decree entered into force immediately, but the Directive is sufficiently precise in its terms to be directly applicable by national courts.
This means that if a Union citizen considers that the individual expulsion measure taken against him or her does not respect the guarantees laid down in the Directive, he or she can appeal before the national courts.
In case of doubt on the application of European law, as you know perfectly well, national courts are obliged to refer the issue to the European Court of Justice.
We will continue to monitor the situation, pending the examination of the decree by the Italian Parliament.
We are also worried about some racist and xenophobic demonstrations that have accompanied the introduction of the decree in Italy.
Roma groups are the largest minority in Europe.
Roma communities throughout Europe face difficult conditions.
There is a long past of persecution.
This situation leads to human suffering and social tension.
Inclusion requires efforts by everyone concerned, including the Roma themselves.
Specific protection must be given to individuals, children and women especially.
Criminals of whatever nationality very often exploit particularly vulnerable people such as children.
Roma children face double discrimination.
Firstly, they are victims of stereotypes and prejudice.
But also they may face violations of their fundamental rights, even from within their communities.
We see, too often, neglected Roma children on our streets or living in poor, often tolerated conditions in modern European favelas.
Children may be brought into a life of crime or forced to beg.
Roma schoolchildren tend to leave school early without qualifications for the future or skills to care for themselves and their families.
If we only look at a group when we consider how to protect fundamental rights, then we risk missing the protection of individuals within that group and we miss the opportunity to break the circle of wrongdoing and fear.
We are ready to assist Italy and Romania in making the best possible use of all possibilities already existing under European law and under European funds.
It should be also stressed that Roma communities live in many other Member States such as France, Ireland, Spain, Slovakia, the Czech Republic or Hungary.
The social inclusion of Roma communities can also be further improved in these Member States, notably through the structural funds, which can be quite helpful.
European funding, specifically targeted at the needs of Roma communities, is already available in areas such as social inclusion, the fight against discrimination, regional development and education.
In the previous programming period, the structural funds made available more than EUR 275 million for Roma-related projects.
An additional EUR 60 million was made available to Romania and Bulgaria between 2004 and 2006, under the pre-accession instruments.
The funding of Roma-related projects will continue in the structural fund programming period 2007-2013.
The European Racial Equality Directive (2000/43/EC), which covers Roma people, provides for protection against discrimination in employment, education, social security, health care, goods and services, and housing.
We are actively ensuring that this legislation is applied across the EU.
Finally, as much as the Commission is not prepared to tolerate any form of discrimination or intolerance of its citizens, we equally will support Member States who lawfully protect their citizens from criminality, whether they are nationals or citizens of the Union in general.
After all, freedom, justice and security go hand in hand.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate Mr Frattini on his comprehensive report and on the proposals, ideas, content and values defended in his speech.
Certainly the reunification of Europe has led to the growing movement of citizens within the Union, which in some cases has transformed into a real migratory phenomenon.
This is the case in Italy, where today there are around half a million Romanian citizens.
The EU has tried, with Directive 2004/38/EC, to guarantee respect for both the rights of Community citizens who emigrate from one country to another, and the right of the Member States to expel EU citizens who do not obey certain rules: I am referring to the ability to support themselves and to the risks to public policy and safety.
Unfortunately, in Italy the way the EU directive has been applied is too little, too late.
The result?
A failure to expel many citizens who, if deported, perhaps would not have committed crimes in Italy.
Unfortunately, crimes have been committed which have shaken public opinion, committed by people with a European passport.
The reaction has been one of unacceptable xenophobic violence.
The violence and murders committed in Italy must be strongly condemned and solidarity shown for the victims' families.
The violent and xenophobic reaction must also be condemned, although unfortunately, when the rules are not applied, when the laws are not enforced, citizens risk dispensing justice themselves, and this is quite frankly unacceptable.
Member States have very clear responsibilities, as do local authorities.
In Rome, despite numerous reports, unfortunately no action has been taken in response to certain social situations, such as the slums inhabited by Roma citizens.
These are situations where quick action should have been taken.
Sometimes belated measures do nothing to solve problems that have blown up.
We are not in favour of mass expulsions.
Every citizen who commits a crime is personally accountable.
It is not a question of nationality or of belonging to a particular ethnic group.
Further collaboration between Romania and Italy would of course be useful.
It is no accident that the PPE text was signed by me and by my colleague Mr Marinescu.
This is a question that specifically concerns the Roma people.
It does not concern Romanian citizens and this is why we are asking for a specific agency be set up for the social integration of the Roma communities, a European agency to show that Europe is doing its part to solve a problem that otherwise risks instigating even greater social panic.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are in a very difficult situation. It is difficult because the events that have transpired in Rome merely bring to the surface something that we have not seen until now, or did not wish to see.
The murder that occurred there was a profoundly condemnable, abhorrent act.
The reactions unleashed by this murder are alarming.
However, the fact that a single offender who commits a criminal act is embedded in his judgment as part of a large group of people who, so to speak, are held collectively responsible for the acts of one individual, is nothing new in the history of humanity - it has always occurred - but it is always equally condemnable.
Therefore, the first thing we must do is to differentiate.
We must look very carefully.
It is all true: integration of the Roma into our society has not been working for a very long time.
This is also linked to the fact that there is very little commitment to integrating the Roma into our society.
They are a difficult people, with their own autonomous culture, and it requires a great deal of effort to integrate them, but it can be done.
It can be done if we respect them and their culture.
Nevertheless, it must be made clear that a state under the rule of law must be able to ensure its survival by all constitutional means.
A state under the rule of law must use every means at its disposal to maintain public safety and preserve order.
What is the best way to do this?
The best way is not to generalise but to assess each individual case, and that is exactly what must happen in Europe.
When it comes to freedom of movement, we have to check, in each individual case, what right a citizen of the Union has gained and, when he moves from one country to another, what rights form the basis of the way he should be treated.
In the European Union, we guarantee freedom of movement.
All citizens of European states - at least, those which are part of the Schengen area - enjoy this integral freedom of movement.
This does not mean that they can do what they like when they move from one state to another.
They must respect the rights and laws there; but, conversely, the state that belongs to the Schengen area must also respect the rights of the citizen of the Union on its territory.
It is not possible to say in a general way' 'it is this group's fault, and this group has to go, because none of its members have work permits, or because they do not fit in with our idea of our culture, or because they are all unemployed, or because they are begging'.
Instead, in each and every case, we must ascertain what rights a citizen has, just as in each and every case it is ascertained what rights he has violated.
This is precisely the task that the Italian and Romanian Governments are now undertaking, and that the Commission must also undertake.
Here I must say, Commissioner Frattini, that you are not doing justice to your role.
I was extremely surprised to read your remarks in Il Messaggero.
Until then, I had the impression that you were a very moderate Commissioner.
You won the respect of my group because you had hitherto worked very sensitively in what is a sensitive area of politics.
However, the remarks that you made in Il Messaggero regarding work permits and people's income structure - suggesting that it was possible simply to go into a camp, ask someone how they earned a living and, if they could not explain on the spot what they lived off, deport them - are reminiscent of a totally arbitrary state.
We do not live in such a state, however.
It is your task, Commissioner Frattini - especially as the Commissioner responsible for human rights - to defend the principles of the European Union and not to promote yourself again as a minister in a future Italian Government when required.
(Applause from the centre and left)
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, most of us recognise the benefits of migration.
The Member States which have opened their borders to migrants from other Member States have not seen a rise in unemployment; rather, they have seen a growth in productivity, a rise in economic growth and the creation of new jobs.
It is the old, old story.
The incomers do jobs that the natives do not want to do, they work hard, they cost little and they bring new ideas.
But it is important to recognise that some people cross borders not wishing to work - or at least not wishing to work legally.
European Union law recognises this, as you have laid out, Commissioner.
While giving the right to reside in other Member States, it allows the host state to limit the right of residence to three months if there is no means of subsistence and to terminate that right if there is a threat to public order.
One of the great successes of our Union has been this right to move freely, now enjoyed by millions of citizens in their studies, in their working lives, in retirement.
It is not without its challenges and, just as the Jews, a people lacking a homeland, were often unwelcome in ages past, so today the Roma, some nine million people, are discriminated against in many host countries.
Yet to equate the Roma people with the country of Romania, even if many of them are Romanian citizens, is to misunderstand the nature of both.
You might as well equate them with the city of Roma.
European Union funds have been made available for the integration of the Roma.
We are working with George Soros and his Decade of Roma Inclusion.
But we need all Member States to sign up to that and a common Community framework strategy for Roma inclusion if this is to work.
It is a pity that Italy did not draw down any of these funds.
Spain drew down some EUR 52 million and Poland some EUR 8 million.
But it is not only a lack of foresight on the part of the Italian Government; it is also matched by a lack of foresight on the part of the Commission.
I think Mr Barroso was wrong when he said in his interview in La Repubblica yesterday that it is inconceivable that European Union authorities should promote integration on the ground.
It should not be inconceivable.
I share, Mr Frattini, the views of Mr Schulz.
You should not be playing party politics in this matter.
This House demands that you concentrate on your current responsibilities, not on your possible future career.
Italians know as well as others the vulnerability of migrant communities.
In 1893, at Aigues-Mortes in France, Italian salt workers in the Peccais were lynched in xenophobic attacks about the protection of local jobs.
But one of the great achievements of the Union is that such pogroms are a piece of the past.
Too often, nonetheless, democracies are run by crisis management.
It is, perhaps, more evident in Italy than elsewhere.
But if there are problems in Italy, there will be problems in other countries too.
If the right of residence abroad is an EU right, we cannot allow Member States to rewrite the exceptional provisions, as the Italian Government has done in its decree.
There is nothing to stop a country giving powers to prefects to deal with it as long as there is a right of appeal.
An appeal to a justice of the peace who is not a legal expert is insufficient, just as is the use only of Italian or English in legal documents.
But I trust the Italian Parliament will correct these provisions and ensure consistency of the national legislation with EU provisions.
For us, this is the first real case of the European Parliament overseeing the application of justice and home affairs legislation, together with national parliaments.
