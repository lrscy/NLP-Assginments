Lastly, I am glad that we are having this debate in Brussels and not in Strasbourg.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I only intend to sum up briefly, because we are in agreement on the objectives.
I can understand your disappointment, Mr Lambsdorff, about the things you have just enumerated.
You are not the only one who is disappointed either, for all of us had quite different expectations.
I share the view of Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, who said that the Council had been in existence for a year, that we had imagined everything would be different but that we should not make snap judgments about the Council.
I urge us not to drive a wedge now between parliaments and governments.
That is not helpful - quite the contrary.
Even though there is room for improvement in this or that area, the European Union - and the national parliaments, the European Parliament, the governments and the Commission are all part of the Union - must stand together and send a clear signal that we are too firmly committed to human rights to let anyone sow division among us.
I can only hope that progress can be made in one area or another during the second year, even though a sobering interim assessment is in order after one year.
But I am spreading the word that we shall succeed together with you, who so fervently champion the cause of human rights.
I hope we can draw a more favourable conclusion in next year's report than we were able to do today.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I regard the Human Rights Council as a body in its infancy that is still experiencing certain growing pains.
It is not easy for the European Union to achieve any real progress in asserting our human-rights standards in the UN framework today.
Why?
Because we have few permanent allies.
The support we receive usually comes from Canada, Switzerland, Norway, the countries applying for EU membership and individual countries covered by our neighbourhood policy, to name a few of the main sources.
This list is not exhaustive, but we are often faced with a united front of G77 countries, and we can rarely achieve anything if a confrontational approach is adopted.
We must draw our own conclusions from this.
Where does the problem lie?
What can we do? We could, for example, strengthen the Special Rapporteur, support the High Commissioner for Human Rights and introduce universal reviews, but we could also condemn the most serious cases and denounce the most flagrant violations.
In other words, in specific instances we must continue to do some very plain talking on behalf of the victims of abuses.
I often wish we could respond and react more quickly to developments.
From the very beginning, for example, I have been calling for a kind of warning mechanism.
I very much hope that we can move gradually in that direction.
In the longer term, however, the achievement of the aims of the Human Rights Council will depend on the establishment of a new approach to human rights within the United Nations.
The transition to this new approach, indeed, was at the heart of the resolution on the creation of the new Council.
The resolution states that the work of the Council 'shall be guided by the principles of universality, impartiality, objectivity and non-selectivity, constructive international dialogue and cooperation'.
We must also be aware, of course, that there will never be an apolitical UN forum.
It therefore goes without saying that we must not only promote our values but also defend all of our interests.
I have received two motions for resolutions tabled in accordance with Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
Management of Europe's maritime borders - European Solidarity and protection of migrants' rights (debate)
The next item is the debate on the Council and Commission statements on the management of Europe's maritime borders, European solidarity and protection of migrants' rights.
Mr President, may I, on behalf of the Presidency, state very clearly that the latest reports on migrants who have lost their lives when their boats have foundered in the Mediterranean, the reports of tragedies that have occurred there, remind us of the responsibility that we as Member States have in this domain.
Regardless of all the tenets of immigration policy, when there is a real and present danger to life and limb, the protection of human life, as the supreme value, must have absolute priority.
This principle is not only enshrined in a number of international conventions; it also accords with our common understanding of the values on which the European Union is based.
Irrespective of the question of legal jurisdiction, the European Union undoubtedly bears political responsibility, and we should shoulder that responsibility together.
This is why the Presidency, by agreement with the Commission, has decided that the Council of Justice and Home Affairs Ministers should debate this issue at their next meeting on 12 June.
We cannot close our eyes to the fact that there have been problems in the past in the interpretation and application of international conventions and that these problems still arise today.
We as Member States must recognise the responsibility we have to prevent such human tragedies, and the Hague Programme rightly and explicitly emphasises the need for close cooperation among all states as well as for solidarity and shared responsibility.
Besides the need to save human lives, the decisive message is that we must not let it come to the point at which unscrupulous criminal organisations put these people's lives in danger by trying to transport them illegally to Europe.
This is why it is important that, as part of a general strategy for the resolution of the migration issue, we also achieve better cooperation with the countries of origin and transit.
It is essential to step up this cooperation in the framework of the political dialogue on migration issues with the governments of these countries, especially in the context of the Euromed partnership and the follow-up process to the EU-Africa migration conferences in Rabat and Tripoli.
We believe that our efforts of the last few months and the debates at all Council meetings during the Finnish and German presidencies have been a first step towards ensuring that the European Union will be able to deal with these tragedies more effectively and convincingly in future for the sake of the people concerned.
Member of the Commission. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Altmeier, has said a great deal and I agree with the position he has taken.
I shall certainly emphasise one essentially political aspect of it, which is the requirement to tackle the immigration issue by combining the need to stop the traffic in human beings and any kind of illegal activity with the absolute need for solidarity, and solidarity means first and foremost saving human lives in danger.
When we are faced with the risk of losing even a single human life, as has quite rightly been mentioned and as we emphasise in our joint statement, strictly legal questions concerning the implementation of international conventions on maritime law - which also needs to be done rigorously and thoroughly - take second place.
Human lives in danger need to be saved first.
Of course, solidarity is not just that.
Solidarity lies at the basis of the global approach that the Commission is taking, in the wake of the unanimous support given by the European Council last December and in strict collaboration with the German Presidency of the European Union in this first half of the year.
First and foremost, there must be solidarity among the EU Member States, which means that every State in the Union, even those that are convinced that they are less affected by the daily immigration tragedy, must understand that the problem is also theirs and concerns the whole EU, with no exceptions.
It would seem to be an obvious decision, then, to provide patrols in the Atlantic Ocean to support Spain, which would otherwise have to face the enormous flow of migrants to the Canary Islands all alone, or a patrol in the Mediterranean to meet the demands of countries like Malta or Cyprus, the smallest Mediterranean members of the EU, not to mention the larger ones.
All the Member States must play their part in the patrols, and I shall very amicably tell all the ministers next week that not enough has yet been done or is being done, after the commitment to make equipment available.
That is the first aspect of solidarity among the Member States.
Then there is a financial aspect to solidarity.
The sums needed to introduce the patrols and to offer people in difficulty protection and a decent reception need to be shared.
In that respect, ladies and gentlemen, I am forced to appeal to you as well, with my usual sincerity.
This Parliament is still holding in reserve EUR 12.7 million that is vitally needed right now, not in a week's time, if the Frontex missions are to continue.
I respect this Parliament's decisions, but I must say quite frankly that if the reserve, which is due to be examined on about 24-25 June, is only released at the end of this month, we run the risk of having to stop the Frontex missions in the central Mediterranean and the Canaries owing to lack of funds.
Immediate steps are needed to release the funds, which are available but have been put on one side.
There is another matter that has to do with solidarity: our commitment to the other countries involved.
We have promised to work more closely with the countries of origin and of transit.
We have said very clearly that we want them to contribute effectively and that we are ready to help the countries of origin through a system of legal, regular and monitored immigration.
We put forward a clear proposal on this subject two weeks ago.
At the same time we are asking for support from the countries of origin and of transit to prevent human trafficking and to explain very clearly to all those who want to set off across the Atlantic or Mediterranean that they will be embarking on a journey not to riches but into serious danger.
What is needed before anything else, therefore, is political cooperation, not police cooperation, so as to create the conditions for providing even clearer information on this issue in the countries of origin, information that is currently lacking.
Conversely, Europe is ready to welcome people who want to work honestly and within the law.
As we all know, such people are needed in many Member States where there is a shortage of labour.
That is another aspect of solidarity.
Then there is an important form of solidarity in receiving immigrants, including illegal ones.
It is my conviction that every Member State has a duty to do all it can to save human lives at sea, but it is also necessary for the other Member States to realise that we cannot leave Malta, for example, to bear the whole burden of receiving all the immigrants saved in the middle of the Mediterranean by Maltese vessels.
The situation requires solidarity and also a politically based outline agreement to determine where we can receive the immigrants that arrive in the most exposed countries.
This is another face of solidarity: offering to receive immigrants in a broader range of Member States, and not just in those that are in the front line.
That is another point on which we have to find an agreement in principle, which sadly has not yet been found.
I think we will have to address a further issue at the Council of Ministers next week: who is responsible for patrolling the search and rescue regions on the high seas that come under third-country responsibility?
The case of Libya has been mentioned.
According to international conventions, every country has a region of the open sea where it is responsible for search and rescue on the high seas.
What happens if a non-EU country like Libya does not carry out its search and rescue duty at sea?
What can we Europeans do to intervene in that region?
Who should take responsibility?
These are rules that need to be established and do not yet exist.
The problem concerns the implementation of international conventions, not of European laws.
The time has come, however, to address this subject within the EU, and I think it will be a good idea to start debating this as well at the Council of Ministers next week.
Finally, where does the responsibility lie and what kind of solidarity is needed for the initial reception of immigrants when they first arrive and have to be received in conditions commensurate with human dignity, which are inalienable and non-negotiable?
Who should take the responsibility and how should we share out the tasks among the Member States?
Again, can we expect a small country in the middle of the Mediterranean to do it all alone?
That would not be an example of solidarity among the Member States, so that is another aspect with which we should be concerned.
The European Union can do a great deal in that respect: it can help to fund and organise repatriation operations in the countries of origin in compliance with the rules that guarantee the absolute dignity of everyone being repatriated.
Of course, all immigrants, even illegal ones, have every right to respect for their human dignity, but we cannot impose our views if there are any Member States that refuse to play their part.
That is the solidarity to which I am referring, and those are the guiding principles to ensure that the tragedy that occurred a few days ago - it is not a question of accusing or blaming anyone for it, but of learning a tragic lesson - can never happen again.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (MT) Mr President the worst thing we could do would be to point the finger at one another instead of working together to find a solution to this serious problem, a problem that, as has been said, does not simply pertain to one country, but to all countries.
To point a finger at Malta in connection with the incidents that occurred in Libyan waters and therefore not under Malta's responsibility is wrong and unfair.
Malta is well aware of its obligations and is honouring them while maintaining full respect for human life.
So much so that the majority of immigrants who arrive in Malta every year and who are picked up from the sea are saved from death's door.
However, the burden Malta has to carry is already disproportionate.
To cite an example, Mr Altmaier: the maritime area that Malta is responsible for monitoring is about two thirds the size of Germany or almost three quarters the size of Italy.
We are responsible for the whole of that area.
Until now Malta has patrolled this area single-handedly because Frontex has not even begun its rounds as yet.
Commissioner, this Parliament is so eager to get Frontex's operations started that it has doubled the Frontex budget.
However, up till now Frontex has proved to be completely ineffective in the Mediterranean.
Therefore, the fact that Malta has to shoulder the blame for incidents that take place in Libyan waters is unjust and unfair.
Instead of accusing one another, we must work together to come up with a solution.
Indeed, the solution, if we want it, is a clear one.
Seeing as this is not the problem of solely one country, the burden constituted by the immigrants rescued from Maltese waters ought to be distributed between everyone: - yes, between the 27 Member States of the European Union.
This is perfectly clear.
What is not clear, Mr President, is whether national governments are willing to shoulder this responsibility and share out the burden.
Thank you.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Mr President, it is absolutely intolerable that, every summer, we witness human tragedies on the borders of Europe.
In spite of our indignation, every year these tragedies are repeated.
How can the European Union leave these people alone faced with their despair at the gates of Europe?
The Commission must ask for commitments from Member States at the next Justice and Home Affairs (JAI) Council: we must ensure that no events of this kind can ever happen again.
It is intolerable that we should be debating the responsibilities of individuals while there were people in danger at sea and they were not rescued.
Malta bears a large part of the responsibility, that is sure.
Giving assistance to people in distress is a duty and not a choice, but they were left to die.
I believe, however, that we are all responsible for this tragedy.
I received messages from many Maltese who are people who care and who are distressed at seeing immigrants treated in this fashion and their country in this situation.
At the same time, however, they are aware that their little country has been abandoned.
I should like to say here that these events demonstrate the lack of European solidarity in relation to the management of borders and the reception of emigrants.
It is intolerable that the burden should rest essentially with the countries of the South and East of Europe.
Europe must show its solidarity and take action so that costs and responsibilities are shared by all Member States.
That is why I call on Member States to grant more resources to Frontex so that maritime missions can begin before the end of June and be broadly developed, particularly in the Mediterranean.
I was satisfied to learn that the evaluation of the Dublin II regulation is to be presented to us in the days to come.
That is what we have been told recently.
We have been asking for it for several months, even though now it is no longer an evaluation that is needed but a swift revision.
The Dublin II regulation is obviously not appropriate, especially for a small country like Malta.
Finally, we ask the Commission where the discussions with Libya have got to concerning immigration.
Recent events have shown Libya's inability to give help to migrants and people in distress.
We have already said it and we repeat: the European Union must not shrug off its responsibilities and pass them on to a country that does not apply appropriate standards in relation to the protection of fundamental rights.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) Mr President, illegal immigration should be addressed as a matter of urgency, because that is what it has been for a while.
The first hesitant steps have been taken.
This does not alter the fact, though, that in 2007, there is still much interference on the line where the issue is concerned of who is responsible for rescuing people from drowning, whether they are legal or illegal.
Staggeringly, it appears that not everybody takes the moral and lawful duty equally seriously.
Of course, as Mrs Roure pointed out a moment ago, Malta has a difficult job where the large influx of illegals is concerned.
This is beyond dispute.
We should therefore get this so wished for and much-discussed solidarity underway as quickly as possible.
It also strikes me that the swift introduction of a burden sharing-mechanism is called for.
This reality, though, does not in any way justify the way in which Malta thinks it should handle its moral and lawful duty.
After all, we are talking about an EU Member State, which means that we as a Union are responsible.
While Malta and Libya cannot agree on the precise location of 27 people drowning, they hang on to fishing nets for three days.
This is not an isolated incident, unfortunately.
Absurd.
We all know that Libya is not exactly renowned for being the paradise of human rights or humane opinions, far from it.
The fact that the Union is at risk of adopting the same view on these drowning people is an outright scandal.
Yesterday in my discussion dossier for the Committee on Transport and Tourism, I came across a study on illegal immigrants at sea, the actions proposed in which should be implemented as a matter of priority.
Commissioner Frattini will need to join forces with Commissioner Barrot in this.
Money alone is not enough.
You know very well that it is precisely the Council that has the key where the conditions regarding the return of illegal immigrants are concerned.
Let it at the same time and above all be clear that nobody, yes nobody, should hide behind so-called legal loopholes in international maritime law, for example.
Where there is a political will, there is definitely a way.
I should like to finish off with a comment to the Council.
Presidents of the Council, you can include Berlin declarations, in which European values are central, until the cows come home.
If nothing at all is done in practice, however, then reality gives us a totally different picture and you as President of the Council are putting the EU's credibility in the balance.
Translate the fine words you so like to proclaim, and which you did a moment ago, into action.
I would urge you to fulfil the ambitions you enshrined in the Tampere and The Hague programmes, among others. Deliver on your promises.
With all due respect, a debate next week is fantastic, but is really not good enough. The issues are not new.
Action is what is called for right now.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, I think many of the recent incidents and the shocking pictures that we have seen of a small boat towing people in its net, are the result - as we have been hearing - of a catalogue of failures, many of them absolutely avoidable with a bit of forward planning.
We assume that the next Justice and Home Affairs Council will be doing some of that.
It would have been avoidable if Member States had delivered on their promises regarding logistical and other support for Frontex and other measures promised in the wake of the experience in the Canaries, Lampedusa, Malta, Cyprus, etc. It would have been avoidable, as Commissioner Frattini said, if Member States had prepared a plan B for when Libya fails to carry out its obligations.
Indeed, it appears that Libya has not clearly defined its maritime rescue area, so why are we negotiating in an emergency when we know there is already disagreement and we could have planned ahead?
I agree with Mrs Roure: we need to beware of the agreements we negotiate with a country which has such a poor record on human rights.
That covers many of the transit and origin countries too.
Such agreements have to be in the public domain, whether multilateral or bilateral, and this Parliament has yet to receive documents promised by the Italian authorities after our visit to Lampedusa.
My group believes we need an asylum agency to organise expert teams to help countries under stress assess claims.
With reference to Dublin II, we are also aware that the fear of consequences makes some states reluctant to act and assume responsibility because they feel they are on their own.
But there is also an issue about the reception and procedures directives and the quality of their implementation.
The EU must again provide support to ensure a quality procedure: another task for an asylum agency.
But we also have to provide back-up in other countries to deal with the processing of arrivals.
We also need to be clear that we do not penalise those who carry out rescues, so we have no more Cap Anamur-style prosecutions.
We are told that the law of the sea is clear: people in distress should be rescued regardless of their status.
I am absolutely certain that, had those people pictured in our media been cruise-line passengers, they would have been picked up far more quickly than was the case.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Frattini was right to talk about solidarity, but for us the first solidarity that we should show is to the families of the people drowned in the Mediterranean, solidarity to explain to ourselves as well that we should stop calling them illegal immigrants but should probably refer to them as shipwrecked people.
That is in fact what they are: people - men and women - who drowned in the Mediterranean while trying to reach Europe and who were not even given a chance of being saved or rescued at sea, but were actually left for three days clinging to a tuna net.
It has to be said quite plainly: someone has to take serious responsibility for that!
Mr Frattini said so clearly in an interview to an Italian newspaper, when he mentioned the serious responsibility of the Maltese Government.
That needs to be repeated here in this Chamber, as well as the fact that they did not even have the decency to bury those people; even the idea of taking them in after death was rejected.
Therefore we ought seriously to consider the fact that, although Frontex may have a specific task to perform, its priority must be to rescue people at sea.
That is something we said a short while ago when we were debating the Rapid Border Intervention Teams.
This, sadly, was by no means the first tragedy; over the last ten years more than 9 000 human beings have drowned while trying to reach Europe, but this was the worst tragedy in the last ten years.
We should also carefully consider the need to expand the legal channels for people to enter legally and also the possibility of reviewing the Dublin II regulation in order to prevent what has been happening.
Look, in my view something serious is taking place: we are losing sight of the guiding principles of Western civilisation, which is based on hospitality and the right to burial.
As the great tragic playwrights of ancient Greece taught us, we ought to start afresh from that point, not least so that we can develop a new idea of reception and hospitality for Europe.
(DE) Mr President, Mr Gloser, Commissioner, it is important to recall today the pictures we have all seen in the newspapers and on television.
A boat would be spotted from the air, and by the time the local rescue operation was launched, the boat was no longer there, and 53 to 57 people had drowned.
We are talking today about other cases too, in which almost everyone found on these boats was dead.
We are talking about children, about babies, about many unknown people - in short, about an appalling tragedy which must surely horrify us.
Allow me, therefore, to say first of all on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats that this issue goes right to the heart of Europe.
It is about fundamental rights, about the very foundation stone of our values, namely the right to life.
Today's debate is not about the immigration argument, about whom we let into Europe and whom we exclude, but about quintessentially humanitarian matters.
I must therefore stress that values do not stop at borders; we Europeans believe that values are indivisible, and we must apply them.
Secondly, I would like to emphasise that, as many of my honourable colleagues have said, there is now a pressing need for European solidarity.
Leaving a tiny country like Malta and other countries along our southern rim to their own devices and then pointing an accusing finger at them is not the way to act.
No, this is a European issue.
I find it a great pity that this tragedy has had little media impact in central and northern Europe and that people in those parts have shown no interest in it.
Action is needed now.
For that reason, Commissioner, I gladly embrace, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party, the idea that we should discuss a spending freeze if funds are needed for this purpose.
I ask the Council through you, Peter, not only to adopt decisions but to take long-overdue action now.
Decisions will not save people's lives; only practical measures can save lives.
That is why I am calling quite specifically for this humanitarian disaster to be one of the main items on the agenda at next week's meeting of the Council.
(ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have once again had pictures shown in our homes of desperate situations and deaths of emigrants.
These pictures once again show the most dramatic and visible face of illegal immigration.
They once again illustrate a repeated humanitarian emergency that requires an immediate and vigorous response.
This situation will not come to an end on its own.
More than 9 000 people have already died trying to cross the Mediterranean and, with the arrival of the good weather, this figure will continue to grow.
Last week, the authorities of a Member State failed to comply with their fundamental international obligations with regard to the rescue and reception of shipwrecked people.
Well, it is not sufficient to condemn that State for its unacceptable attitude and ask it to take on its responsibilities in order to ensure that that situation does not arise again.
Nor can we delegate the fight against illegal immigration to captains of fishing vessels.
We are not talking about a Maltese problem.
It is a European problem that requires a generalised response based on solidarity amongst all of us.
I shall insist: all of the Member States, shared responsibility, transparency and mutual trust.
For all of these reasons, I would like to call upon the Council, the Commission and this House immediately to adopt specific measures to put an end to this unacceptable situation.
Frontex must cease to be a mirage and it must be provided with the resources necessary for joint monitoring patrols to operate permanently throughout the year in the high-risk areas.
Ladies and gentlemen, we Europeans cannot carry on debating and squabbling amongst ourselves while immigrants are still drowning.
Let us act now.
(ES) I would like to begin by congratulating the Commissioner on taking on her responsibility in relation to this issue.
I hope that they are not just words, though it is of course good to begin with words.
It is absolutely intolerable that we should leave a group of human beings to die while the governments and bureaucracies of various Members States argue about who is obliged to rescue these shipwrecked people who are dying from starvation, from drowning, from exposure to the sun ...
Malta has its obligations and its attitude has been intolerable and deserves to be condemned.
The Union, however, must of course be in a position to support Malta today, Spain, in the Canary Islands, yesterday, and wherever else tomorrow, when it comes to saving the lives of people who wish to enter the European Union.
The summer is beginning and, with it, we are once again seeing the human flow of people who wish to live out their dreams in London or Hamburg, but who are destined to die on the beaches of the south.
That is the message that we must send.
We are currently in the midst of a debate on the future of Europe, on what we want and what we can do together.
Well, it is in fields such as this that the European Union can find its legitimacy.
I am not just talking about credibility.
I am talking about legitimacy.
The European Union can also lose its legitimacy in this area, however.
What kind of Union do we have amongst us that can organise and regulate all sorts of things - some of which many of our citizens consider to be absurd, and even idiotic - but which is incapable of organising things in such a way that people who are trying to reach our borders do not die, that people trying to reach our castles are not doomed to die at the castle gates?
Mr Vice-President, you have an historic challenge, a political and historic challenge.
You have the responsibility to promote solidarity, but if solidarity does not emerge, you have the responsibility to impose it.
You have the power to do so.
If solidarity does not emerge, you will have to impose it.
Impose it politically, shaming those States that do not take on their responsibilities, and impose it by force by means of legislative proposals so that everybody assumes their responsibility towards the present and the past, with so many deaths attributable to governments that do not play their part.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, every day more would-be illegal immigrants try to reach the European continent, and every day we experience intolerable situations and intolerable tragedies in southern Europe.
The European Union has created Frontex.
The European Parliament was prepared to double the annual budget for border surveillance.
Frontex now has a budget of 35 million euros.
Nevertheless, more illegal immigrants are entering the European Union daily.
The plain and simple fact is that border surveillance is not working.
The assistance to Member States and the coordination that Frontex is supposed to provide are not working.
If the coordination is defective, the work of Frontex invites criticism.
If, however, the Member States do not deliver the manpower and equipment they promised to provide, it is they who must be held to account and made to honour their obligations.
In no circumstances should we put the entire onus on the countries of southern Europe.
In this context I have a question to put to our Commissioner.
In a press release on 24 May, the Commission reported that the number of aircraft, ships and other items of equipment made available to date had been satisfactory.
Today, in another report from the Commission, we learn that it is criticising the Member States, which have delivered only a tenth of the promised aircraft, ships and helicopters.
So which version is correct?
Can you please put the record straight, Commissioner?
If the Frontex agency has been set up by us and is so well funded, it must perform.
If that is not the case, let us please abolish it and explore other avenues.
One way or the other - and I appeal here to everyone in a position of responsibility - the European Union, as well as monitoring our own borders, must provide assistance for the establishment of a functioning system of border surveillance in the transit countries - that is a form of local assistance which will help us in turn - as well as granting stabilisation aid and conducting local information campaigns in the countries of origin.
It is certainly high time we took action instead of continuing to discuss an intolerable situation.
(MT) Mr President, it is a disgrace that, once again, so many people had to lose their lives before the European Union's lack of concrete action on immigration was exposed.
Although I believe that all the Member States must shoulder their burden of responsibility, especially when it comes to life or death situations, the Commission and, especially, the Council must also share part of the responsibility.
In my opinion, the Commission and the Council are not treating the situation with the urgency it deserves or giving it the commitment it merits.
Looking back at what has been done during these past four years, it is easy to see that, if you eliminate the meaningless buzzwords of 'solidarity' and 'mobilisation', few measures have actually been taken to address this alarming situation.
We expect immediate action to be taken on the burden-sharing principle, on the revision of Dublin 2 and on logistical and administrative assistance in order to effectively coordinate the joint patrols, which up till now have been practically ghost-like and which were promised to us long ago by Frontex.
Until now, it seems that Frontex has simply been an agency that has been too stunned to take action, due to the enormity of the crisis facing it.
Yet, no country can go on trying to cope with this tragedy alone, especially one as small as Malta and one that is already carrying a far greater load than it can bear.
At this stage the priority should be the actual crisis and not identifying those who are to blame.
We have to carry out an emergency Marshall-type plan before we find ourselves obliged to repeat the same speeches again when another tragedy takes place.
We have no time to lose; too many lives have been lost.
I hope that the definition of solidarity given by Commissioner Frattini will in fact be implemented.
Thank you, Mr President.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with all those who have said that we need action rather than mere words.
And the Council has indeed been taking action in recent months.
The Council ensured that the centralised record of available technical equipment, the Frontex toolbox, was stocked up and that Frontex, at least in principle, has more than 100 ships, aircraft and helicopters at its disposal.
With the support of this Parliament, the Council ensured that the Regulation on the RABITs, the Rapid Border Intervention Teams, could be adopted.
There will be a Frontex operation in the waters around Malta, where we shall try, with the assistance of experts from the Member States and the support of helicopters from the Member States, to put an end to this human tragedy.
I must say, however, that it would have been better if we had been able to launch these operations a few weeks earlier.
That is a responsibility we must all accept collectively.
In the past few months we also agreed, in response to a proposal from the Commission, to implement regional protection programmes in countries of origin and transit.
We took positive action by agreeing on the conclusion of partnership agreements and by discussing incentives for legal immigration and circular migration.
We are engaged in negotiations on the subject of readmission agreements with countries in Africa and elsewhere.
All of these things are taking us in the right direction.
It is nevertheless true that many of these measures have come too late and that it would have been better for the people concerned if more rapid and efficient action had been taken.
(NL) Mrs Hennis-Plasschaert, I think this is also attributable to the lack of efficiency in the Council's decision-making procedure.
It is unfortunate that the European Constitution has not yet entered into force, because the European Constitution and the reforms it provides for would enable us to take the necessary decisions much more swiftly and much more efficiently.
In the coming days and weeks we shall have to ensure that we live up to our humanitarian responsibility for the people in distress.
We shall also have to ensure that we do not leave Malta in the lurch.
Malta is a small country with a great responsibility in the area in question.
For this reason Malta is entitled to the solidarity of the European Union.
Thirdly, we shall have to ensure that none of the action we take creates new pull factors that lead to more and more people trying to make their way to Europe, because we shall otherwise run the risk of multiplying rather than alleviating the human misery.
This is why I firmly believe that the Council will summon up the strength to send out a clear signal at its meeting next week.

Written statement (Rule 142)
in writing. - (FR) How many corpses will we have to fish out of the Mediterranean Sea before effective solutions are put in place?
Let us stop pointing the finger at small countries like Malta that can no longer manage the constant flood of immigrants who are washed up daily on their beaches.
This is not the way to fight illegal immigration.
There is no barbed wire, no barrier that will stop these men and women, who are prepared to do anything to provide life's essentials for their families, from crossing the seas.
In September 2006, Parliament launched an appeal to Member States and to the Commission in a resolution adopted by all the political groups.
We were insisting on the need for strengthening partnerships and dialogues with the countries of origin.
We also asked for revision of the Dublin II regulation which puts too heavy a burden on the countries in the South and East of the Union.
It is of the utmost urgency to establish a fair mechanism for solidarity and for sharing responsibilities between all the Member States.
What is more, we have to recognise the lack of results from Frontex.
Genuine political willingness is fundamental if Member States are to give adequate resources to this agency to enable it to function effectively in the future.
PrÃŒm Treaty: cross-border cooperation in combating terrorism and cross-border crime - Visa Information System (VIS) - Consultation of the Visa Information System (VIS) - Protection of personal data (debate)
The next item is the joint debate on
the report by Fausto Correira, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the initiative by the Kingdom of Belgium, the Republic of Bulgaria, the Federal Republic of Germany, the Kingdom of Spain, the French Republic, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the Republic of Austria, the Republic of Slovenia, the Slovak Republic, the Italian Republic, the Republic of Finland, the Portuguese Republic, Romania and the Kingdom of Sweden on the stepping up of cross-border cooperation, particularly in combating terrorism and cross-border crime (PrÃŒm Treaty) [06566/2007 - C6-0079/2007 -
the two reports by Sarah Ludford, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, one on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the Visa Information System (VIS) and the exchange of data between Member States on short stay-visas - C6-0004/2005 - and the other on the proposal for a Council decision concerning access for consultation of the Visa Information System (VIS) by the authorities of Member States responsible for internal security and by Europol for the purposes of the prevention, detection and investigation of terrorist offences and of other serious criminal offences C6-0053/2006
the report by Martine Roure, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council Framework Decision on the protection of personal data processed in the framework of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters (renewed consultation) [07315/2007 C6-0115/2007.
President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are dealing today with three matters that mark very significant progress in cross-border police cooperation in the realm of European home-affairs policy.
The first of these matters is the PrÃŒm Convention, an international agreement that was originally concluded by a small number of Member States - there were initially seven, but a further ten states have subsequently acceded to it.
The Convention paved the way for Europe's first network of national DNA and fingerprint databases and vehicle registers.
In this way we laid the foundations for a modern information exchange for police forces in Europe while applying high standards of data protection.
This Convention that was concluded by some of the Member States is now to become an EU-wide instrument.
It is to be incorporated into the legislative framework of the European Union, and its core provisions will apply in all 27 Member States.
We are thereby contributing to the security of the people of Europe, because DNA-matching among a small number of countries has already resulted in the identification of criminals and in convictions for serious crimes.
We are also helping to enhance the capacity of the European Union to act, for it is only right that this Convention should no longer be treated as an instrument of international law but as part of our common European legal framework.
I should like to thank all Member States, as well as the European Commission and the Members of the European Parliament, for having helped to clear the way for the replacement of the Convention in spite of a very tight time frame.
In converting the Convention into a Council Decision and in implementing that Decision, we shall also take due account of the opinions of the European Parliament.
We shall decide next week on the visa-information system on which we reached political agreement with the European Parliament back in May.
Now that an agreement has been reached in Coreper, there is a good chance that the Council will confirm the decision on access next week.
A formal agreement will then be concluded once the wording has been checked by the lawyer-linguists.
The visa-information system is a particularly important means of consolidating the area of freedom, security and justice.
It will mean that alphanumerical and biometric data can be stored and retrieved during visa procedures.
This will help to ensure that we are able to combat multiple visa applications, identity frauds and other forms of deception more effectively than hitherto.
The decision on access to the VIS will also enable security authorities to search the VIS for the purpose of preventing, discovering and investigating terrorist crimes and other serious offences.
These new research facilities for the security authorities will be a vital step forward in efforts to protect the public, especially from terrorism and organised crime.
Let me stress that the agreement we reached with the European Parliament is a very balanced and sound agreement which reconciles the diverse arguments that have been advanced.
If we manage to improve police cooperation in Europe as these two measures are designed to do, thereby creating more security for our citizens, we must also ensure that data protection is given a high profile in the European Union and that the abuse of data transmitted between Member States is prevented and effectively combated.
For this reason I am delighted that major progress has been achieved in recent weeks on the assignment of the framework decision on data protection to the third pillar, that we were able, with the agreement of the rapporteur of the European Parliament, to deal with a new draft in two readings within the Council working group and that we have sharply reduced the number of the reservations which have been a barrier to rapid progress in the past.
This new revised draft guarantees a high level of protection.
The protection level prescribed by Council of Europe Convention No 108 of 1981 and by the additional protocol of 2001 will be fully guaranteed.
On the issues of the scope of the decision and the rules relating to non-EU countries, we shall also find sound solutions.
The European Parliament has made a very important contribution in this respect, and I should like to thank you most sincerely again on behalf of the Presidency for your extraordinarily rapid treatment of the revised draft.
Particularly with regard to the adequacy of the protection afforded by states outside the Union and the inclusion of a provision on the forwarding of data to non-public bodies, we are on the way to finding effective solutions.
I also believe that the evaluation clause proposed by the European Parliament with regard to the scope of the decision is a thoroughly constructive solution, and we shall use the remaining term of the German presidency to achieve further progress.
With his fifteen principles for data protection, Commissioner Frattini helped to ensure that we were able to frame the key provisions in this area.
At the Council meeting we shall propose a Council statement and press for due adherence to these principles in subsequent deliberations.
Vice-President of the Commission. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not have much to add after the considerations put forward by Mr Altmaier on behalf of the Council.
Concerning the first of the topics being debated, we have from the outset supported the German Presidency's initiative to transfer most of the third-pillar provisions of the PrÃŒm Treaty into European legislation.
That will facilitate and strengthen cross-border cooperation among police authorities and will certainly facilitate one factor that is absolutely essential if we want to enhance security in the European area, and that is the exchange of information needed to prevent and suppress crime.
This exercise is of course also based on the fact that the provisions of the treaty have been shown to be useful where they have already been applied.
We have had the opportunity to read an interesting report supplied by the Presidency on how application of the PrÃŒm Treaty between Germany and Austria has produced some positive and surprising results.
It has led to the detection of serious criminal acts precisely because certain provisions of this treaty have been used.
There is an important aspect to this: the application of the principle of availability - that is, the exchange of information, which promotes a flow of information - has to be accompanied by adequate protection of personal data.
In the event of improper use, there need to be clear rules on prevention that can stop all that happening once and for all.
In my view, it is vital that the Council's decision, already given by the Presidency, is confirmed, and I strongly hope it will be.
I am confident that it can be adopted in Luxembourg next week.
It contains a clear reference to personal data protection, because unfortunately we do not yet have a framework decision on data protection in this area.
This Council decision transferring the articles of the PrÃŒm Treaty into the European acquis therefore clearly has to deal with data protection, as a precondition for making the exchange of information compatible.
A final aspect of the decision concerns periodical assessment.
This will be an important assessment of both operational effectiveness - in other words, how this series of measures will work - and the operation of the safeguard clauses.
The assessment will also be useful for Parliament, which will of course receive a copy of it.
On the Visa Information System, I have to congratulate the rapporteur, Baroness Ludford, and the Presidency, and also commend them on their joint efforts to reach a good agreement.
A good agreement may in any case be useful to ensure that both the security requirements demanded by many governments and the demands for personal data protection are met.
These are non-negotiable rights for the European Union.
In our consulates and at our border posts we will have better instruments that will work more effectively and will be made available to honest travellers, while they will also enable the police to detect serious infringements of the law.
Data protection rules have been firmly incorporated into the VIS.
These rules, including those on fingerprints, were absolutely crucial.
Thanks to this agreement the Commission can now develop the technical application that will be needed, because, as you know, our aim is to have the VIS up and running by the spring of 2009 as planned.
There is a specific requirement regarding the operational management of the system, which is that the operational management should be entrusted to a technical body, after an impact assessment has been carried out.
This technical body may be proposed operationally within the first two years of operation of the VIS, either because of the economic implications that are yet to be assessed or because of the technical impact assessment that is to be performed.
I can give you my personal assessment now: if there is going to be an operational management body, it should not be limited just to the VIS, but there should be a single operational body managing both SIS II and VIS together, so as to make the best use of the resources and its capacity for work.
The third topic is the framework decision on data protection.
Here again I must thank Mrs Roure for her report, which gives the Council some encouragement.
I put forward the proposal way back in 2005; since then I have appealed to the ministers in Council on several occasions; and today we are getting close to a joint solution.
On one aspect, I shall repeat my views, which are well known: I would have liked these data protection rules, which are under the third pillar, to apply to the Member States' internal legal systems and not just to cross-border exchanges of data and cross-border cooperation.
I therefore agree with Mrs Roure's proposal that, no more than three years after the framework decision is adopted, we should re-examine the purpose and scope of these rules and therefore perhaps also the possibility of extending them to the countries' internal legal systems.
Three years is a long enough time.
Mrs Roure mentions an assessment, precisely the one that we are talking about, in order to harmonise the rules on data protection even more.
One thing does not rule out the other: both can be done if we use the report which, three years after the system enters into force, should say whether the mechanism is working, where it can be improved and where further harmonisation is possible.
We all ought to agree on one thing, which is the need to rule out any use of the data for purposes not specified in advance; in other words, personal data may be used for police and security purposes only if the categories of purposes for which the security authorities may use them have been set out first.
That is a key principle, on which we should stand firm.
A debate has yet to be held on the data protection supervisory authorities.
Some very careful consideration will certainly be necessary, because the current authorities and the future European authority will have very different attributes, and so more thorough deliberation is probably needed.
I have put forward an idea of 15 basic principles to help facilitate agreement.
I am very pleased that the President-in-Office of the Council considers the exercise of examining the 15 basic principles that I have proposed to be useful.
To conclude, we can make up for lost time, but on this topic we are a long way behind.
rapporteur. - (PT) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Frattini, ladies and gentlemen, I should like, if I may, to make a few brief personal observations on the PrÃŒm Initiative, which Parliament is debating and scrutinising today and tomorrow, and on which I was rapporteur for the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs.
The Council's proposal, presented by Parliament three months ago in almost forensic detail, was debated and analysed with bewildering speed by the committee.
To this end - with the constant and total commitment, skill and dedication of the Committee's secretariat - the idea of a public hearing was proposed, involving all public and private actors, in order to gain a suitable understanding of their concerns.
This is a process that seeks to strike the right balance between the demands of effective police cooperation and the defence and promotion of fundamental rights.
This exercise in reflection is extremely important given the nature of this proposal, which establishes mechanisms facilitating action on criminal matters and criminal investigations, but which is potentially damaging to the citizens' rights and freedoms, an aspect that cannot and must not be overlooked.
As rapporteur dealing with an initiative of such importance and visibility, my main concerns were, accordingly, to strike a balance between, on the one hand, the demands of effective policing in the fight against the main threats to the very foundations of the EU, namely terrorism and crime, and, on the other, the protection of people's fundamental rights.
Clearly, striking such a balance and transposing it into a text to be accepted by an overwhelming majority of MEPs represented in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, who come from a range of political backgrounds, was no easy task, but was certainly a rewarding one.
I honestly believe that the proposals to be put before this Chamber substantially improve upon the draft submitted by the Council.
I therefore welcome the fact that the amendments we agreed on, which were the result of a broad consensus among the various groups represented in Parliament and of close collaboration between the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs, were adopted almost unanimously by the committee, with just one abstention.
I now hope that they will receive a similarly positive response from this Chamber.
Among the amendments that have been tabled, I should like to highlight the following amendments for their importance to the economy as distinct from what I feel should be subject to a formal framework decision: greater harmonisation of the conditions of access to biometric databases, ensuring that such access is limited to investigations, and, in the case of fingerprint data, to the prevention of serious criminal offences; clear definition of rules applying to joint operations; establishment of strict necessity criteria so that the transmission of personal data is legitimate, especially when it comes to the most delicate situations, major events and preventing terrorist attacks; extending the scope of the chapter on data protection to all forms of processing data, ensuring compliance with all recommendations put forward by the European data protection supervisor; implementation of a maximum period for keeping personal data; establishment of specific safeguards prohibiting the processing of sensitive data that may be used for the purpose of ethnic profiling; strengthening Parliament's role in following up the proposal for a decision, in particular when implementation and assessment measures are adopted; and lastly, clarification of the relationship between this proposal for a decision and the proposal for a framework decision on data protection under the third pillar, the latter always being a general regulatory framework in the matter, in any situation.
Lastly, I should like to acknowledge the importance of integrating intervention mechanisms introduced by the PrÃŒm Treaty - undeniably important mechanisms in the fight against terrorism and organised crime - into the EU's body of law.
I must say, however, that I am worried about how the Council will vote on Parliament's opinion.
I should like to conclude by saying that the adoption of the framework decision aimed at stepping up cross-border cooperation, in particular in the fight against terrorism and crime, will clearly lack democratic legitimacy if Parliament's role is either partially or totally ignored.
That would do nothing to enhance the citizens' trust in the Union when it comes to the process of building the Community; in fact, it would have quite the opposite effect.
Welcome
Ladies and gentlemen, if you will allow me, I would like to point out that a group of guests have been in the gallery, a group of men and women who are known in my country as 'war children'.
They were children who, between 1936 and 1939, fled Spain, the fascist bombardments, who were evacuated and who found solidarity and care in families in Belgium and the United Kingdom.
Today, with all of them over 75 years old, they have come to visit Parliament, to be amongst us, and it is very important and very moving for us to pay tribute to them and, in particular, to pay tribute to the solidarity of the British and Belgian people, who took them in and provided them with the families that they had been denied in their own country.
Baltic Sea cod (debate)
The next item is the report by ZdzisÅaw Kazimierz Chmielewski, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing a multi-annual plan for the cod stocks in the Baltic Sea and the fisheries exploiting those stocks - C6-0281/2006 -.
Mr President, firstly I would like to express my thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Chmielewski, and to both the Committee on Fisheries and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety for the report.
The objective is to have the proposal agreed at the June Council next week.
During discussions held in the context of the Council preparations, many changes have been introduced to the original proposal, some of which go in the direction of your suggested amendments.
As you are well aware, both cod stocks in the Baltics suffer from over-exploitation, with the eastern cod stock falling so far below safe biological limits that it may be in risk of collapse in the near future.
At the same time, ICES has indicated that misreporting of catches occurs in 35 to 45% of cases in the eastern Baltic, which not only results in an additional unaccounted fishing impact on the stock but also affects the accuracy of scientific advice.
The current situation not only harms the cod stocks in the Baltic but is also threatening the fishing sector reliant on this resource.
Cod is one of the most important fish stocks for the industry in the Baltic.
It is therefore crucial, not only from an ecological but also from a social and economic perspective, to bring fishing into balance with resource availability as soon as possible, so that fishers can once more count on stable and high catches.
The multiannual plan presented by the Commission has been developed on the basis of past experience with managing cod fisheries in the Baltic and on several consultations held with stakeholders, Member States and scientists.
It aims at rebuilding the stocks not only towards safe biological limits but even beyond, to levels that will provide the highest sustainable catches, thus providing stability in the long term for the fishing sector concerned, by reducing total allowable catches and fishing efforts step-by-step to the levels corresponding to this objective.
Turning now to the report, the recitals of the plan correspond to the measures that are later outlined in the actual provisions.
I can therefore only accept Amendments 1 and 5, which correspond to the provisions of the plan, such as the request to specify the status of the eastern cod stock in the first recital.
Amendment 4 is acceptable in principle.
However, the split into western and eastern parts is determined by scientific evidence that there are two separate cod stocks in the Baltic, and not by the ecological features of the two areas.
The report proposes several amendments to the rules outlining the procedure for reducing total allowable catches and fishing effort to sustainable levels.
Amendments 8 to 11 would result in a mitigation of the reduction process and would limit its application.
In view of the serious situation of the stock and the need to limit all types of fisheries catching significant amounts of cod, I cannot accept these amendments.
I am, however, aware of the need to define a system that the industry can deal with.
The Commission has therefore changed its plan by combining the summer ban and the days absent from port.
This will increase flexibility for the industry, and will thus particularly benefit small-scale fleets, for which a fixed and rigid system is more difficult to work with.
Moreover, an article on the European Fisheries Fund has been included in the plan to ensure financial compensation for the industry.
Changes to the effort system mean that several of the provisions on control and monitoring have also been changed.
The margin of tolerance has been raised to 10%, except for cod, and the rules on discharging have been deleted, which should correspond to the provisions of Amendments 14 and 16 of the report.
Concerning Amendment 15, the rules on entry and exit from the area have been changed as well, meaning that the specified requirements apply only where the vessel is leaving the area in which it has been fishing.
As misreporting is presently one of the key problems in the management of the Baltic cod fishery, it is crucial to improve these rules to monitor comprehensively how much is taken from which cod stock, and when.
For similar reasons, I cannot accept Amendment 13, which limits the requirement for a log book to vessels with a special permit for cod fishing.
The report proposes to reduce the valuation period from three to two years and to introduce a provision on the monitoring of the socio-economic impact of the plan in Amendments 17 to 19.
New cod recruits enter the fishery at the age of two to three years on average.
If an evaluation began during the second year, it would be very difficult to detect any effects on the stock and, consequently, on the industry.
The Commission is, however, planning a project that will monitor not only the ecological but also the socio-economic impact of the plan as a first step towards the impact assessment to be made in the third year of the application of the plan.
Finally, I turn to the three amendments tabled by Mr Schlyter last week.
They are not acceptable to the Commission for the following reasons.
The objective of the basic regulation for the common fisheries policy is to ensure sustainable management in ecological, social and economic terms.
It is therefore the Commission's responsibility to strive for a balance between these three pillars, albeit based primarily on scientific advice regarding the stocks.
I thus consider a gradual reduction of TACs and fishing efforts until target levels are met, as advised by ICES, to be a good balance in this respect.
ICES also recommended using relative targets such as fishing mortality instead of fixed ones such as biomass, because they are less sensitive towards scientific uncertainty and the environmental variations affecting the stock.
In the current situation whereby a high level of misreporting is interfering with management and scientific advice and in view of the possible upcoming revision of the biomass reference points for the eastern stock, the inclusion of biomass targets is not appropriate.
However, as an expected outcome of the plan is the improvement of the basis of scientific information, the inclusion of biomass reference levels could be considered in the course of the revision of the cod recovery plan, which is envisaged to take place after the plan has been in force for three years.
rapporteur. - (PL) Mr President, the Council regulation which is the subject of this report is a long-awaited important legislative proposal, and constitutes an attempt to deal with the very considerable needs of the fisheries sector in one of the most significant bodies of European water.
This in itself is good reason to congratulate those responsible for the report.
They have tackled the difficult challenge of drafting a long-term programme for the regeneration and catches of Baltic cod.
Cod is a fish that provides many families with their livelihood.
It is the most important fish in the Baltic and therefore generates great interest amongst those involved in fisheries.
Emotions are running high in the Baltic region concerning Parliament's opinion and subsequent Council rulings.
A report referring to verified data taking scientific forecasts on the development of cod stocks and fishing possibilities as a content-related starting point represented an opportunity for achieving satisfactory compromises in these circumstances.
It was essential for the Committee on Fisheries to intervene with regard to the Council's legislative proposal because it was necessary for the document to take account of the inevitable socio-economic consequences of the planned catch restrictions.
I am glad the Commissioner mentioned this.
One of the amendments adopted was tabled by the rapporteur and bound the European Commission to monitor these consequences and propose essential management measures to Parliament.
Another amendment adopted involved reducing the restrictions on fishing days laid down in the regulation from 10% to 8% and increasing the so-called reporting limit from 100 kg to 300 kg.
I am referring to the Committee on Fisheries.
The Committee on Fisheries also adopted the suggestion made by the Council of Ministers regarding adjustment of the margin of error in fishing log book entries from 8% to 10%.
The proposal on increasing the minimum size of cod caught in the Baltic to 40 cm was endorsed too.
It is difficult to avoid the impression that report was strongly influenced by the view that the fishing capacity of the Baltic cod fleet is currently far too large in relation to the available fishing quotas.
There is still no proposal for a systematic resolution of this problem at the level of the Union and the individual Member States.
Stronger and stronger warnings are being voiced urging great caution with regard to automatic decisions on scrapping the fleet.
It would be preferable to seek solutions allowing the fishing capacities defined to be retained until stocks are replenished.
We shall obviously need something to fish with when that time comes.
I believe that sooner or later the issue of the length of the summer bans will become part of the debate on the plan for rebuilding cod stocks.
The Commissioner referred to the bans today.
It should be noted that a tendency to favour so-called days absent from port rather than the bans used to date is gaining strength in those Member States seeking ways to further reduce the fishing effort by introducing additional days when fishing for cod is banned.
The scientific advice accompanying the general discussion on the Council regulation has indicated the need to review the assessment of biological reference points used to date, and I am glad the Commissioner mentioned this today.
It should be added that none of the Baltic countries queries the introduction of fishing mortality as a method of defining the achievable aims of the multiannual plan for rebuilding Baltic cod stocks.
I refer to Article No 4 of the plan.
It does seem essential, however, to launch an in-depth debate on the subject of appropriate values of biomass reference points adjusted to the actual state of the stocks and the current general situation of the Baltic Sea ecosystem.
This will be in line with the Community's commitment to introducing the ecosystem approach to fisheries management.
I refer to Recital No 5.
I should emphasise that the biomass limit values currently in force were adopted in 1998 on the basis of data gathered in the 1960s and 1970s.
They cannot therefore be appropriate to the current condition of stocks.
In conclusion, it should be pointed out that the intention of the earlier Council Regulation 2371/2002 mentioned in the document dealt with in the opinion was to retain the precautionary principle in connection with the introduction of fundamental changes to the fisheries policy.
The precaution applied to both management of the stocks and assessment of the socio-economic impact of the changes.
This principle should remain in force following the accession of the four Baltic countries to the Union.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. - (SV) Thank you, Mr President.
As the person in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety responsible for cod fishing, I wish to begin by complaining that so few of our views are included in the report on which we are to vote tomorrow.
We have a shared responsibility for ensuring that it is possible to fish for cod in the Baltic Sea in the future too.
The situation where cod is concerned is a serious one.
In spite of reduced quotas, cod stocks are close to critical level.
If we are to prevent stocks from collapsing completely, we need still stricter distributions of quotas.
These quotas need to have a scientific foundation rather than be based on long drawn-out political wrangling, as the focus in fishing must in the first place be on the environment and on a long-term approach, not on short-term labour market policy objectives.
I am only sorry that the Committee on Fisheries appears to think in precisely the opposite way.
The Commission's proposal for reduced fishing quotas is a step in the right direction, but it will be of no help if we do not make sure that it is complied with, because the greatest among the many threats to cod is illegal fishing.
It is said that between 35% and 45% of the total share of cod landed has been fished illegally.
What is most important, therefore, is not new rules but guarantees that the existing rules are complied with.
It is therefore incomprehensible to me why the Committee on Fisheries refuses to accept, for example, my demands that strong measures be taken against those countries that close their eyes to illegal fishing.
What, moreover, is most terrible of all is that we know which countries they are.
I am convinced, however, that, in the long term, we need an entirely new system for fisheries policy - one that makes fishermen themselves have a sense of responsibility for the survival of cod.
One system that has shown itself to be effective is that involving individually transferable fishing quotas.
Fishermen should be given an incentive of their own to take responsibility for the survival of the stock.
I believe that, in that way, we can obtain a better fisheries policy in the EU.
Annoying as it is that the Committee on Fisheries does not appear to want this system, it is gratifying that the Commission seems to take a positive view of the possibility of introducing individually transferable quotas.
In conclusion, I would just point out one thing I do like about the report by the Committee on Fisheries, namely that it incorporates my proposal for an increase in the minimum size of the cod that is caught.
This would give the fish more scope to reproduce and would make for more stable stocks.
In common with my fellow Swedish Conservatives, I unfortunately cannot, however, vote in favour of the report before us today.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, against the backdrop of the decline in Baltic cod stocks identified in the ICES studies and of demands from the relevant fishing crews for operating conditions that will enable them to preserve their livelihood, I would like to commend the work of my honourable colleague, Mr Chmielewski.
He has had to do the splits in order to reconcile the Commission's proposal and sustainable fisheries on the one side with the resolute demands of the fishermen on the other.
If sustainability is to be more than an empty word, however, it must be reflected in working practices on fishing vessels and in personal attitudes to scientific prescriptions.
Accepting catch quotas is one side of the coin.
In particular, this means not only fulfilling the prescribed basic conditions but also supporting the new measures to improve stocks and more effective supervision by the Member States.
Unfortunately, supervision is a weak point in some Member States.
There is sufficient untapped potential in this area.
The involvement of regional advisory bodies is not only helpful; it is also an urgent necessity.
The proposal from the Commission therefore points in the right direction, and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament supports both the proposal and the rapporteur's efforts to strike a fair socio-economic balance.
I appeal to all those in positions of responsibility to take good heed of the information provided by ICES and other scientific bodies when fixing the total allowable catches and quotas for cod and devising measures to halt the decline in cod stocks.
The Baltic is a sensitive sea, and we should bear that in mind whenever we consider any measure.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (SV) Thank you, Mr President.
The situation for cod in the Baltic Sea is a very serious one.
For 2007, the ICES has recommended that no cod be fished in the eastern part of the Baltic, yet in spite of these recommendations a considerable quantity of cod will be landed.
Where western stocks are concerned, 30% more than the recommended number will be fished, and in addition there will be unreported and illegal fishing.
The Committee on Fisheries is trying to water down the Commission's proposal, which basically does not consider the consequences for biological diversity, either.
As always when fisheries issues are debated in this House, the socio-economic consequences of fishing are referred to.
Certainly, a ban on fishing for cod may harm professional fishermen.
However, overfishing means that, before long, there will be no fish left to catch.
In the era of globalisation, it is necessary to be flexible and to be prepared to make structural changes in society.
Tomorrow, I shall vote against Parliament's proposal, even though I believe that the Commission's proposal is unsatisfactory too.
(SV) Mr President, I myself live on the Baltic Sea and have therefore been able to monitor at close quarters how bad things are there.
The situation not only causes a deterioration in people's quality of life, but also, as Commissioner Joe Borg himself pointed out, threatens economic development along the whole of the Baltic Sea coast.
People throughout the EU expect us, in this House, to make vigorous efforts to save the eco-systems in our seas.
I should therefore ideally have liked to have seen the House support a ban on cod fishing, as proposed by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety in its opinion.
A ban would also have made it simple to get to grips with the illegal fishing that quite a few Members have talked about.
There is obviously no majority in favour of this in the House at present, but I nonetheless hope that a majority is able to support Amendments 20 to 22, one of the provisions of which is that the largest permitted catch shall be based on advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.
That really should go without saying.
The fact that we do not act on the basis of existing scientific knowledge is one of the reasons for the current threats to cod and to the whole of the Baltic Sea's eco-system.
(ET) The Baltic Sea is an inland sea and, thanks to its poor connection with the open seas and oceans, it is a very distinctive sea.
The limited water exchange with the Atlantic Ocean unfortunately also means that the Baltic Sea is very vulnerable - the sea lacks the ability to dilute large quantities of pollution and, what is more, fish stocks recover very slowly there after overfishing.
In the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, we discussed at great length the topics of overfishing for cod and illegal fishing in the Baltic Sea.
The committee agreed that cod fishing should be prohibited for some time in the eastern part of the Baltic Sea or that a zero fishing mortality rate should be established.
The objective of this would be to permit cod stocks, which are in very bad condition, to recover, so that they might later be managed sustainably once again.
I regret that the Committee on Fisheries has not taken that one key position of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety into consideration in connection with managing the cod stocks of the Baltic Sea.
It should also be in the long-term interests of fishermen to halt fishing at the moment, so that cod stocks, which are in a critical condition at the moment, might recover.
Mr President, I would firstly like to thank you for the number of points that have been raised.
I think it is clear that we share a common objective, that of ensuring the long-term sustainability of cod stocks in the Baltic and thus the livelihood of the fishers in the region.
While we may differ on the means of achieving this objective, I have no doubt that our aim is the same.
On the specific points raised, I would like to make the following points.
Firstly, we must propose schemes for effort limitations and take into account the effort exerted by small-scale fleets since their catches represent around 50% of total catches.
We are, however, ready to consider flexible mechanisms in order to enable them to apply the plan without it being too much of a burden.
I would like to stress that the eastern cod stock has been declining continuously over the last decades, as has the average catch size.
The serious situation of this stock is therefore self-evident and, while it is crucial to take account of the socio-economic perspective, it is primarily the ecological status which requires recovery, that is of paramount importance.
In this regard, an annual reduction of 10% has been identified as the minimum in order to be able to detect changes in the development of the stock status or the sector deriving from the plan.
A decrease of the annual reduction would also confront the sector with a longer reduction period and therefore delay the benefit of bigger and more stable catches and would make it unlikely that the MSY levels can be reached before 2015, as is required under the Johannesburg Commitment.
Finally, it is important to underline that control is the key issue, particularly in this fishery.
We hope to reach a solid and workable solution to this issue in the Council next week.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
Specific rules as regards the fruit and vegetable sector (debate)
The next item is the joint debate on the report by Mrs Salinas GarcÃ­a on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the proposal for a Council regulation laying down specific rules as regards the fruit and vegetable sector and amending certain Regulations. C6-0075/2007.
Mr President, we are currently in the final and decisive phase for the approval of the reform of the fruit and vegetables sector.
We launched the debate on 24 January 2007 and since then we have received lots of very valuable input, not least from the European Parliament and the report of Mrs Salinas GarcÃ­a.
I thank you for this and for your constant support for the general objectives and the general principles of the Commission proposal.
When considering the substance of your opinion, I have chosen to focus on a few issues to which you have given very special attention.
Firstly, on producer organisations, it is clear that both the Commission and the European Parliament believe that producer organisations should be maintained and even further reinforced in order to increase the degree of the concentration of the supply.
This is absolutely fundamental if the sector is to match the huge concentration that we see these days in the retail sector.
As you know, we have proposed a number of new initiatives in order to make our producer organisations much more attractive.
We have proposed additional Community financing of 60%: firstly, for mergers between producer organisations and associations of producer organisations; secondly, for regions where the level of the concentration of the supply through producer organisations is below 20%; thirdly for organic farming; fourthly for new Member States and, finally, for the outermost regions.
I am aware that you have requested even more action to be included in the additional Community financial assistance of 60% to the operational funds, such as joint action between producer organisations or integrated production.
However, what we have proposed will already make a very positive difference.
I should like to stick to these measures in the first place.
As you surely know, we also need to be attentive to the budgetary constraints.
On crisis prevention and management, I agree with you that it is one of the most sensitive points of the reform and I should like to thank you for the ideas that you propose in your opinion.
However, I cannot accept the idea of a separate fund for crisis management and the need to define what we actually mean when we talk about a 'crisis'. A separate fund would result in a substantial budget increase and, moreover, will not contribute to further simplification.
With regard to the use of a percentage of the national reserve for crisis management, this is not acceptable either.
The national reserve was created at the very beginning to accommodate particular situations in the framework of the single payment scheme and it is not appropriate to devote this budget to another objective or other measures.
However, I understand your call for more flexibility in order to facilitate crisis management.
Rather than making a completely separate structure, I should therefore positively consider adding more flexibility to the structure proposed in our initial Commission proposal in order to make the scheme as efficient as possible and to avoid a major decline in prices.
Nevertheless, I want to underline that we also need to bear in mind that any modification of the current proposal has to respect the overall budgetary constraints, as well as the need for simplification.
On the inclusion of fruit and vegetables for processing in the single payment scheme, you have requested an optional transitional period, in particular for tomatoes.
You are also in favour of a separate payment for tomatoes for historical producers in the new Member States.
I am open to accept a short transitional period in which Member States could decide to grant aid per hectare.
Nevertheless, one should bear in mind that full decoupling must be both the precondition and the end goal - so final decoupling at the end.
I am also aware that the soft-fruit sector is facing difficulties.
The Commission analysis has shown that fragmentation of both production and marketing has contributed to the difficulties faced in recent years by the soft-fruit sector.
On the basis of this report we have considered that the best way to address the problem is to add incentives to increase the number of producer organisations in the new Member States, which is what we did in our original proposal.
Nevertheless, taking into account the sensitivities of this soft-fruit sector, I am open to considering specific smaller support, but I want to make it absolutely clear that it must be transitional and limited to certain products.
Finally, on promotion of fruit and vegetables, I fully agree with you that this issue is of huge concern not only to agriculture but also to health and to consumer policies.
We produce plenty of high-quality fruit and vegetables in the European Union, but our citizens do not consume enough of them, with growing consequences for their health.
I would be in favour of a school fruit scheme to be implemented in line with the position taken by the Commission on 13 May 2007 in the White Paper on a strategy for Europe on nutrition, weight and obesity-related health issues.
However, before doing this we would need to carry out the necessary impact assessments of such a measure. I have asked my services to undertake such work immediately.
Those are my first comments and I am looking forward to a constructive discussion with the honourable Members of the European Parliament.
rapporteur. - (ES) Commissioner, I would like to begin by thanking you, not just for being here, but also for your cooperation and willingness to work with me.
The truth is that we are dealing with the reform of a very important sector, which you know very well. It represents 17% of our end agricultural output, but it only receives about 3% of the aid.
It is true that the sector that we are discussing today is very dynamic.
It is also, however, a very fragile sector, with structural problems, exposed to increasing external pressure and the pressure of large-scale distribution.
The report that we are debating today and that we will vote on tomorrow is the result of a long period of work.
It is an open report, and I believe that this Parliament's position has always been open with regard to the Commission.
We have always sought agreements, but at the same time it is a realistic report.
It is complicated, because we are dealing with forty different products for twenty-seven countries.
It is no surprise that it received more than 380 amendments in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, but it is also the case that there were only two votes against it.
Not everything in your proposal, in the Commission's proposal, seems to us to be negative, by any means.
It is very important that producer organisations should be seen as the cornerstone of the reform from the outset.
The truth is, however, that in Parliament, and in the whole of the European Union's sector, there are certain problems that, in all of the Member States, we have seen as priorities within the reform.
Firstly, the decoupling of aid for processed products, as the Commissioner has quite rightly pointed out.
The second problem is the lifting of the ban on growing fruit and vegetables in areas eligible for the single payment.
And, above all, we in Parliament would stress the lack of a genuine crisis management mechanism.
I believe that the European Parliament has made a great effort to achieve consensus with a view to reaching agreements on these three issues.
Firstly, we are in favour of maintaining the current marketing rules.
It is true that they should be rather simpler, but we are in favour of maintaining those marketing rules.
Parliament has expressed, and will express tomorrow, its opposition to the lifting of the ban on growing fruit and vegetables in eligible areas. At least until the Commission presents an impact study, as demanded by the Court of Justice.
We are calling for the strengthening of producer organisations, in the way that has already been mentioned: increasing their funding to 6%.
And in cases of the 60% increase in assistance, as the Commissioner has quite rightly said, I hope that certain requests will be taken into account, such as integrated production or designations of origin.
Where we have achieved a great compromise, because it is very important, because it is a fragile sector, is on the need to create the Security Fund for crisis management.
Having heard what you have said, I believe that, right now, this is where Parliament's almost unanimous position differs most from that of the Commission.
We have expressed our support, and we continue to do so, for a crisis Security Fund that is open to all producers - including non-associated producers - and two-thirds funded by the European Union and a third by producer organisations.
We also stress the need for a price observatory.
Our future in this sector does not lie in subsidies, but in the market.
And we must have reliable and up-to-date information on the evolution of the markets.
Finally, decoupling, I am delighted to hear that there is at last a glimpse of the possibility of a transitional period.
There are certain dual-use products, such as tomatoes and citrus fruits, which, under the initial proposal, could lead to the abandonment of production.
We therefore firmly advocate a transitional period, and let us hope that it is not as short as has been suggested here this evening, but sufficient for the sector to be able to continue adapting to the single payment scheme.
I hope that that voluntary transitional period can allow for some kind of partial decoupling that could be a transitional measure.
We also stress the need to strengthen aid for red fruits.
I am also delighted to hear what you have said, because I believe that this is clearly a need that Parliament has indicated and the Commission has considered.
I would like to end by thanking everybody who has helped me during this year of work, the shadow rapporteurs and all of the officials from the European Commission for their contributions, for cooperating with me, the committee secretariat and everybody, because I believe that the report that we will vote on tomorrow, which is the result of a broad consensus, has also been enriched by the contributions of the other groups and of the whole of society.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (ES) Ladies and gentlemen, today, the fruit and vegetable sector is one of the most dynamic sectors of European agriculture, thanks in particular to the efforts of the farmers, the producers, to improve the marketing networks and to increase the quality of their products and concentrate supply.
In no way can it be argued that the fruit and vegetable sector relies on aid from Brussels.
In fact it succeeds in a very aggressive market, owing to the fact that the people participating in it work hard, and the money they receive represents no more than 1% of the turnover of farms.
The great majority of these producers are not currently asking for subsidies or early retirement aid.
What they are asking for and demanding are mechanisms for tackling the current problems, which can only get even worse in the future.
I hope you will allow me to remind you all that the fruit and vegetable sector is the great bargaining chip in the European Union's agricultural negotiations within the World Trade Organisation.
In the future, the current pressures in the market will get worse as the existing tariff barriers are dismantled.
I would therefore like to call upon the Member States to draw up appropriate crisis management mechanisms within the context of the reform of the sector that will probably be adopted next week at the Council of Agriculture Ministers.
As the rapporteur has already said, and as many of you also know and acknowledge, crisis management is a fashionable topic and it will be important in the future for all of the sectors of the common agricultural policy as a result of the dismantling of intervention measures.
In the case of fruit and vegetables, however, this problem also needs to be resolved urgently in view of the strong competition from third-country imports and the pressures resulting from large-scale distribution.
An imaginative solution needs to be found to help the sector to deal with the critical times ahead, and this Parliament is offering the solution in the report by Mrs Salinas.
This involves a specific fund for serious crises intended for the implementation of certain actions such as pension funds and to which the whole of the sector would have access.
This would represent a very positive step, bearing in mind that we are not deviating from what we have done until now, which is co-responsibility for the producer.
I believe that, for the fruit and vegetables sector, this report proposes a pioneering form of crisis management that other sectors will have to copy in the future.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PL) Mr President, reform of the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables is one of the last to be undertaken.
It has still not been covered by the 2003 reform.
It is also one of the most significant market reforms in the current Financial Perspective.
I should like to congratulate Mrs Salinas GarcÃ­a on a very objective report, which covers many issues of importance for both old and new Member States.
As my colleague has already dealt with all the points we wished to make in the House, I shall refer only to the soft fruit sector, which is of vital importance for the new Member States.
The reform must include effective solutions for this sector, bearing in mind the need to ensure that growing this fruit in the Community will remain profitable and that Community growers can obtain a suitable level of income from it.
Soft fruit is a delicate product and should be dealt with in the same way as other Community products considered delicate.
It is essential to apply different payments to the soft fruit sector beyond the SAPS financial envelope. Such a payment would be directed exclusively to soft fruit producers.
Support in the form of separate area payments would lead to restructuring and improve the effectiveness and competitiveness of this sector.
It would therefore stabilise the income of soft fruit growers.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I should first of all like to thank the rapporteur.
I admire her for the way she has fought her way through the many amendments that have been tabled.
We as the ALDE Group support the result as a whole, and hence the gist of the Commission proposals.
Making producer organisations stronger is a good thing.
The market of horticultural products is increasingly being dominated by large supermarkets and other trade organisations, and producers must combine forces in order to form a counterweight.
Most of the ALDE Group would beg to differ with the rapporteur and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the already much-debated crisis fund and crisis management in general.
We think the Commission proposals are better.
For starters, I would not know where the money would come from.
Also in the long term, it is impossible to assume that any authority could be responsible for crisis management.
The authority will always make a contribution - this has been provided for - but the producers will need to shoulder the lion's share of the responsibility.
If, moreover, we encourage crisis management to be taken care of via the producer organisation, this will also draw in more members, which will at the same time mean that producer organisations will gain more power compared to traders and supermarkets.
Our vote will therefore be different from what the Committee on Agriculture proposed in this respect.
I should once again like to stand up for quality policy.
The Commissioner knows that this is a subject that is very close to my heart.
After the last conference on this subject, I left in a frame of mind that was anything but optimistic, but I am heartened by the fact that an amendment concerning the need for a quality label for horticultural products, tabled by the ALDE Group, was adopted unanimously in the Agricultural Group by all parties.
This is quite unique.
With this support from the Committee on Agriculture, the Commissioner may therefore want to reconsider a quality policy for certain agricultural products, because we still believe that this is called for.
I am unaware of the latest developments as regards school fruit, but we thought the Commissioner's idea in this respect was endearing.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, this reform is justified but it is unfair.
The principles laid down five years ago at Copenhagen are unfair to the new Member States.
It was established that farmers in the new countries would receive several times less aid than those in the old Union.
We agreed to this hoping that we would come to receive equal treatment in due course.
Subsequent reforms of the common agricultural policy have perpetuated the division into more and less favoured countries, however.
The reform of the fruit and vegetable market is one example of this.
The old Union was receiving hundreds of millions of euro and will continue to do so.
The new Union receives token sums.
Allow me to pose the following questions: where is the actual aid for soft fruit producers in the new Member States to be found?
Why has the Commission not responded to the European Parliament resolution of October 2006?
Much has been said about supporting the European Constitution and the danger that failure to do so will lead to the emergence of a two-speed Europe.
In fact, as far as agriculture is concerned we already have a two-class Europe, namely the more favoured old Union that retains the status it created for itself in the past and the less favoured new Union that cannot expect equal treatment.
We tabled an amendment that would include cherries and apples for processing in the reform of soft fruit production, accompanied by a EUR 148 million increase in the national envelopes.
I call on the House to support this amendment.
At the level of the Union as a whole, it does not represent much money.
It is a matter of principle, however, not of money.
There must be an end to this division into better and worse Member States.
We respect the Accession Treaties, but new principles must be introduced, transcending the division into 15 more favoured Member States and 12 less favoured ones.
All 27 Member States must enjoy the same rights.
The Union for Europe of the Nations Group, bringing together members from both old and new Member States, is resolute in its demand for this.
We call for a reform that is not only justified but also fair.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I in turn must especially thank the Commissioner and the rapporteur of the report that we are about to examine in this Chamber, but my group is unlikely to vote for it because of two points that I should like to highlight.
The first is that this reform, which is so important for a sector that employs thousands, if not millions, of workers in both agriculture and processing, may change the landscape completely once we have directives on climate change.
If it is true that Europe is rightly starting to expand alternative forms of production - biodiesel, biofuels, and the production of mass and biomass from wood - then it means that several million hectares will be taken out of agricultural and food production for human and animal consumption.
That is already happening in large countries like China: it was in the news a few days ago.
The second point is the fact that the reform in question does not address one of the problems raised in this Chamber, which is that in recent years the profit from agricultural production has all gone to commercial businesses and large multinationals.
According to some statistics, between 60% and 70% of agricultural profit is kept by the distribution chain.
The reform we are examining does not address this problem.
Those are the basic reasons that we want to raise, and we are therefore unlikely to vote for the report in this Chamber tomorrow.
(SK) I would like to praise the efforts of my colleague, Mrs GarcÃ­a, in drawing up her report into the proposal for a Council regulation for establishing specific provisions in respect of the fruit and vegetable sector.
The heated debates within the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development about this proposal identified certain risks associated with the substance of the proposal and, in particular, risks arising from the philosophy behind this piece of legislation.
The most serious risks concern the early practical implementation of some of the regulations and the low level of EU budget participation.
At stake is a mere 3.1% of the budget, while the sector accounts for 17% of the EU's total agricultural output.
In marketing terms, lettuce, radishes and small fruits - virtually the entire fruits and vegetables mix - are the most sensitive of agricultural commodities, and ensuring their smooth transfer from the farm to the table is a daunting logistical task.
Therefore, the European Commission should not delude itself into thinking that in future it might be able to transfer to farmers the entire responsibility for fruit and vegetable CMO.
Another major risk of the proposal under consideration is the fact that it puts the new Member States at a disadvantage.
The problem is that the new Member States do not have functioning producer organisations, and it will take several years for them to become fully operational.
Fruit and vegetable producers in the EU-15 have over the decades gradually learned to interact with trading systems and have become trading partners of equal standing.
One can reasonably expect that if the proposal were implemented in its present form, the output of the new Member States, already massively reduced, would shrink still further.
This is why I believe that the outlined risks should be addressed as a matter of priority when amending the proposal.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me add my thanks to the rapporteur, for the reform of the fruit and vegetable sector was truly not an easy subject.
As the previous speakers have pointed out, fruit and vegetables account for a very large share of our agricultural output.
These reforms will enable us to take a major step towards the modernisation of European agriculture in this sector too.
Particularly in view of the increasingly fierce international competition resulting from globalisation, it must be our prime objective to enhance the competitiveness of European fruit and vegetable growers while safeguarding the availability to consumers of high-quality European produce at reasonable prices.
One means of doing this is the creation of producer organisations, which enable growers to market their products more effectively.
Measures to promote fruit and vegetable consumption are particularly worthy of support, because they are also beneficial to public health.
Mrs GrÃ€Ãle of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will table an oral amendment tomorrow in which she will ask the Commission not to wait until the scheduled date of 2013 before compiling an initial report on the execution of the title covering producer organisations, the operating fund and the operational programmes.
In fact, we want to have that first report by the end of 2010, followed by progress reports at three-yearly intervals.
We seek transparency, and we would also like to be sure that support is actually reaching our intended targets.
Seven years is too long to wait for that assurance.
It is therefore our responsibility to safeguard the future of Europe's fruit and vegetable growers by creating a safety net with the aid of targeted assistance in order to combine sustainable production with high quality and a healthy environment.
(EL) Mr President, first I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Salinas Garcia, on her exceptional report, and the Commission, which truly has made a serious and brave proposal in the fruit and vegetable sector.
I say 'brave proposal', because it is a sector which has a clear structure with the producer organisations and operational programmes and the main issue raised is that of decoupling.
I should like to highlight, both at a personal level and on behalf of our group, the two basic issues which we shall support.
Firstly, a stable financial budget and, secondly, a stable timeframe for reform up to 2013.
Subversive policies seeking a transitional reform period in fruit and vegetables, which is something which has not happened in any other product, will I am absolutely certain - from the point of view of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament - not be accepted.
I have just two comments: you know very well, Commissioner, that Mrs Salinas's proposals are not a very far cry from the Council's proposals and I shall come to the specific issue of the crisis management fund, which I would like you to think about much more positively.
The crisis management fund does not need additional resources, but it does need to be outside the operational programmes, otherwise there will be total confusion.

(LT) It is understood that reform of the common agricultural policy is essential; however, implementation of the reform is being applied to EU Member States with different levels of agricultural subsidies.
New Member States, which get almost three times less in payouts than the old Member States, and having significantly worse exit situations, are obliged to reform their agriculture by further worsening the state of it.
A general payout scheme is being offered as a proposed solution for reform of the fruit and vegetable market.
For the new Member States this will mean even smaller subsidies than there have been to date, and even less chance of competing in the market.
The requirement for fruit and vegetable producers to establish producer organisations in order to receive EU subsidies seriously distorts the fruit and vegetable market.
Retail networks may dictate their terms and refuse to accept for resale the produce of small producers.
I would like to draw attention to the fact that the regulation proposes to increase consumption of fruit and vegetables by encouraging their use among certain sectors of the population - young people, school-age children and teenagers.
What about the rest of the population?
(PL) Mr President, some appropriate action has at last been taken with regard to the situation in the fruit and vegetable sector, which is generally perceived to be unfair.
Following lengthy discussions, an anti-dumping price for Chinese strawberries was introduced.
It was unfortunate that it only applied to such a short period of time though.
Next, a minimum price was introduced.
Again, it is unfortunate that this price was so low.
We are now presented with an opportunity to allocate additional payments to cherries and sweet cherries, and also to soft fruit such as raspberries, strawberries, blackcurrants and gooseberries.
Without these payments many growers affected by the severe frosts will most certainly be bankrupted.
In its Amendment 116 to the regulation the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development suggests aid amounting to EUR 120.77 per hectare.
In my view this is too low a figure.
It will not deal effectively with the growers' problems.
Aid should be increased to EUR 400 per hectare.
Apple orchard owners were affected by the severe frosts too.
Their predicament is also a difficult one, and they are hoping for some aid.
That is why I urge the House to adopt Amendment 113, which constitutes a response to all those hoping for aid.
(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, I am delighted that you are here and I thank you for the efforts you are making.
I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on a job very well done.
The fruit and vegetable sector is extremely important for us.
However, I should like to highlight certain points:
Firstly, in a sector such as the fruit and vegetable sector, which includes the most sensitive agricultural products, financing crisis management is extremely important.
If it is to be integrated, it should not be included in the operational programmes and be cofinanced by producers; it should be financed from additional Community resources and be extended to the field of prevention, as I also requested as shadow rapporteur when we debated future support measures for agricultural production eighteen months ago.
Secondly, the obligatory inclusion of agri-environmental actions in the operational programmes of producer organisations, as a precondition to their approval, is a positive move.
However, setting compulsory expenditure at one-fifth of the budget for the actions is excessive and should be reduced.
Thirdly, we should at some point perhaps turn our attention to small crops, to small-scale producers, such as those growing saffron and mastic in Chios.
We must also look at small-scale producers.
Fourthly, for producer organisations, financing at a rate of 60% in under-organised areas is positive, but capping at 4.1% of the value of the marketed production is marginal and will not allow them to honour the new, important duties they are taking on.
On the same subject, we should also refer to the difficulties faced by the Aegean islands, which is why they need to be treated with a certain degree of flexibility.
Fifthly, information and promotion campaigns aimed at our youth in the European Union are not just to increase the consumption of fruit and vegetables; we have a very poor diet and our youth must adopt a healthier diet.
Finally, I have the following to say: I should like to point out that we are totally against the oral amendment which may be tabled tomorrow calling for a report to be drafted in 2010 on the operation of the new COM, because this means a different approach to fruit and vegetables, while the other COMs have been regulated quite differently.
This is unacceptable under the principles of the European Union.
(HU) The excellent report by Mrs Salinas GarcÃ­a indicates that this is fundamentally a good report.
I will mention four positive points: the national envelope system, support for producer organisations, risk management and the school fruit scheme.
This would be a very good reform if I did not come from one of the new Member States.
But this reform is discriminatory in several areas against the new Member States.
On the one hand it is discriminatory as regards direct payments.
For example, Hungary provides 2% of the Union's vegetable production, and receives 0.61% of the costs of vegetable production.
The other area of discrimination has to do with processed products.
Neither Polish berry fruit, nor sour cherries, nor the products of the new Member States have been included among the produce that is to be processed. And now these monies will be distributed on a historical basis, and it will be primarily three of the old Member States who will receive 800 million of the 1.4 billion.
This is a very great injustice toward the new Member States, and I ask that it be rectified.
(PL) Mr President, Mrs Salinas GarcÃ­a's report is very significant for the agricultural production sector.
Unfortunately, however, it does not apply equal terms to producers in the old and new Member States.
Supporting farmers by way of direct payments is particularly important for countries where the structure of agriculture is fragmented, with small holdings and monoculture, and where the income barely suffices to sustain farming activities.
These holdings operate in a traditional and environmentally-friendly manner.
The amended regulation should even out the opportunities for payments to farmers in the old and new Member States.
It is hard to anticipate the effectiveness of fruit and vegetable production. Products of this nature can easily be damaged, prices fluctuate and there is competition from third countries.
Climate change and increasingly frequent natural disasters also impact on effectiveness.
By way of example I could refer to the spring frosts in Poland which affected 70% of currant, plum, pear and sweet cherry blossom.
Polish fruit growers and market gardeners estimate that this year's losses will amount to 60%.
Amendments 6, 7 and 12 to the regulation concerning Recitals 11, 13 and 18 and also Amendment 113 are particularly worthy of support.
(PL) Mr President, today's debate on the report concerning reform of the fruit and vegetable market and tomorrow's vote on the matter bring to an end several months of work within the European Parliament.
I believe that during this period we have succeeded in raising awareness of the problems affecting the Polish soft fruit market and convincing most Members of the House of the need to introduce appropriate support mechanisms. Such mechanisms would serve to restructure the sector and improve its competitiveness.
Two features of this sector in the new Member States are the fragmentation of production and the fact that there are no strong groups or associations of producers.
In addition, the sector is particularly vulnerable at times of crisis.
The existing support instruments and those proposed in the draft reform of the COM of fruit and vegetables do not provide sufficient aid and do not offer effective solutions to the problems arising in those markets.
We are therefore requesting special payments for growers of soft fruit and cherries intended for processing, so as to improve incomes and stabilise the fruit and vegetable market.
I urge the Commissioner to study Amendment 132, which I tabled jointly with Mrs Herranz GarcÃ­a on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.
I also ask for support for Amendment 122, on aid for the market of tomatoes for processing in the new Member States under the SAPS system. Adoption of this amendment would ensure that tomato producers in those countries retained the aid they are currently receiving.
Commissioner, there are two issues Polish soft fruit growers cannot understand.
The first is why they have to wait so long for relevant proposals.
The second is why the Commission cannot even come up with a few tens of millions euro to support the soft fruit sector, when it has an annual budget in excess of EUR 1.5 billion.
Strawberries, raspberries and currants are just as important for Polish farmers as oranges, mandarins and figs are for their opposite numbers in southern Europe.
Commissioner, we earnestly hope that at the forthcoming Council of Agriculture Ministers of the 27 Member States of the European Union you will propose appropriate support for this group of farmers.
I trust the negotiations will prove fruitful.
(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the support given by Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development to the proposals contained in the Salinas GarcÃ­a report is proof of, firstly, the rapporteur's excellent work - and I add my own congratulations - and, secondly the very positive spirit of compromise displayed by MEPs from almost all of the political groups.
I particularly welcome Parliament's recommendations on crisis management and on strengthening producer organisations.
I welcome the adoption of my proposal to establish a transitional period aimed at ensuring the continued viability of tomato cultivation in some Member States, in particular my country, Portugal.
I hope the Commission will take this on board.
I am disappointed, however, that it was not possible to go further on other equally important issues, such as greater flexibility in the management of financial resources earmarked for operational programmes and positive discrimination, which should have been given to the Member States in which those programmes are particularly poorly organised.
Your speech at the start of this debate, Commissioner, made me fear that the aspect of Parliament's political support for the proposals has not been correctly interpreted, but I trust that common sense and a spirit of compromise will ultimately prevail in the Council and the Commission.
- (PL) Mr President, the fruit and vegetable sector is very important for the agriculture of the Union in general and of countries like Poland in particular.
Unfortunately, the proposed solutions are not beneficial for us.
Firstly, as part of the significant changes to be introduced in this sector, it is proposed that the existing support for the old Member State be maintained, but the new ones are to be treated as if they were not actually Members, but still mere applicants.
Supporting the national envelopes of countries such as Italy, Greece and Spain with sums of between EUR 316 million and EUR 167 million, whilst Poland's envelope is to be increased by barely EUR 6.7 million even though it has a large fruit and vegetable sector must surely run counter to the principle of European solidarity.
Secondly, there is no tradition of producers' groups in the new Member States.
This is bound to mean that a sum of almost EUR 700 million a year will go mainly to producers' groups and associations in the old Member States.
Finally, the reform fails to deal with the issue of the Union's market becoming increasingly open to imports of fruit and vegetables from third countries.
The European Union has an annual trade deficit in excess of EUR 8 billion in this sector.
These imports are often sold at dumping prices, which is detrimental to the production of fruit and vegetables within the European Union.
Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on her report.
From my point of view there are still some outstanding issues to be clarified.
We must be able to ensure that the impact within different regions in Member States is not too harsh.
The mechanism of this proposal is complicated for those regions that applied the hybrid area-based model for the single farm payment, including my own area, and this, in particular, must be resolved.
This is a difficult, complex area that must be addressed.
There are many different outside pressures that impinge on the marketing process. High among those is the purchasing power of the large supermarket chains, where one supplier or producer is put against another to drive the price down.
There are also those who import cheap produce, turn it around and add value to produce of unknown origin.
We seem to be unable to stop this.
I am now going to be rather parochial.
Last week I led a delegation to my local minister in Northern Ireland to raise the plight of mushroom growers in that area.
Four years ago in Northern Ireland we had over 226 mushroom growers, today we have 40 - an 80% drop in those involved in the industry.
I have to ask whether anyone cares, and I have come to the conclusion that the answer is no.
Farming families have been destroyed and their incomes done away with.
They have been totally disregarded by those capable of importing cheap mushrooms, adding value and selling them to the supermarkets, which pretend that they are local.
If we stand back and allow such a situation to continue in this and other areas, we will totally destroy the fabric of rural society as we know it.
These commodities keep families and communities together.
We destroy them at our peril; we must defend rural society.
Mr President, my thanks to the rapporteur.
My colleague Mr Nicholson has not exactly stolen my thunder, but I want to repeat some of his thunder, and the Commissioner will know that I am like a long playing record.
I support the idea of producer groups but I am not at all convinced that we will ever have the matching power of the retail sector.
I have said it before and I repeat it now that the Commission is unwilling to take on the elephant in the room, i.e. the very powerful retail sector in Europe which is particularly powerful in the UK and in the Republic of Ireland.
After you launched your debate on this particular subject we had farmers in Ireland on television declaring that they would no longer grow fruit and vegetables because there was no profit to be made in it because they could not get the prices they needed.
However, let us see what happens from this reform.
I hope that this report which we propose for 2010 will look at the impact in terms of the balance of power, which currently lies in the wrong direction.
The idea of consumption and health is a very positive one but I think every time we tell the European public that it is healthy to eat fruit and vegetables they seem to eat less of them, so we need to think of a different message.
I like the idea of school fruit schemes and I would ask that your impact assessment take into account the many pilot projects.
There is one in particular in Ireland that works and you probably have details of it, but good luck with it and I hope it works for the fruit and vegetable producers of Europe.
Mr President, I would like to conclude quickly, because it is late.
I would like to stress again the very constructive cooperation that we have had on the food and vegetable reform.
I think your opinion supports the general line of the Commission proposals and the improvements that are being contemplated.
I would like to make a few comments because I am sure that some Members of this Parliament did not listen to my first speech, when I talked about the soft fruit sector.
I made it clear that I am aware of the difficulties in the soft fruit sector within the European Union.
I am ready to take into account the sensitivity of the sector and to try to find money within the budget to support this sector for a transitional period.
But do not expect the figures that you mentioned.
I think you said EUR 800.
This cannot be achieved within the budget.
However, I have clearly said that I will do my very best to find a solution.
I believe that the anti-dumping measures taken in April have clearly been a step in the right direction.
Problems faced due to frost will be handled separately.
It is possible to deal with specific situations involving climatic catastrophes within the state aid rules, so we will try to handle this issue separately.
A question was raised on funding.
In my opinion, trying to create a fund outside the producer organisations is not really simplification.
As you know, simplification is very high on the Commission's agenda.
It will be a very complex instrument and we have to take into account the fact that we have to act within an annual budget.
We could lose quite a lot of money on the fund's construction because it is multi-annual, but I am sure that we will find a decent solution and a crisis management tool that can work efficiently.
I hope that it will be possible to achieve a political agreement at the Council meeting next Monday and Tuesday.
I am quite sure that we will manage to find a political agreement that will benefit the whole fruit and vegetable sector within the European Union, so that it will have a sustainable future, which, I presume, is what we all want.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
Written statements (Article 142)
in writing. - (PL) It is now three years since the new Member States acceded to the European Union, but they are still being discriminated against in terms of budget appropriations for the fruit and vegetable market. This is clear from the size of the payments allocated per hectare of land devoted to growing fruit and vegetables.
In 2005, the old Member States (EU-15) received EUR 561 per hectare, whilst the new ones (EU-10) only received EUR 20 per hectare.
The poorer countries therefore receive 28 times less support than the richer ones.
There is no reason for such discrimination.
The new Member States have introduced many important and specific products into the Union.
At the same time they experienced and are continuing to experience problems regarding the profitability of these types of products. Amongst other reasons, the problems are due to cheap imports from third countries and the fragmentation of production.
The new countries therefore had good reason to expect that their difficulties would be recognised and that they would be able to benefit from the same wide range of support as the old Member States.
The European Commission has conducted missions and undertaken a series of consultations and studies.
Nonetheless, the Commission's proposal for reform of the market still discriminates against the new Member States.
The Commission has also disregarded Parliament. In its resolution of 11 May 2005 this House called for Union support for soft fruit, cherries, sweet cherries and apples intended for processing to be provided at the earliest opportunity.
Discriminatory action against the new Member States on the fruit and vegetable market is detrimental not only to growers in the new Member States, but also to the Union as a whole and to its consumers.

Application of the Schengen acquis relating to the Schengen Information System (vote)
- Report: Coelho
- Before the vote:
rapporteur. - (PT) Just three brief remarks if I may: a thank-you, a warning and a point of information.
I should like to thank all those MEPs from the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and all the political groups, whose goodwill enabled this report to be adopted quickly.
I should like, too, to thank the Portuguese Government - and in particular Secretary of State JosÃ© MagalhÃ£es - for taking the initiative and putting forward this system whereby new Member States that fulfil the Schengen assessment criteria do not have to remain unjustly suspended and can join the system immediately.
Secondly, speaking on behalf of Parliament as its rapporteur, I would like to sound a warning to the Council and the Commission.
In our opinion, this transitional measure must never be allowed to hinder the rapid conclusion of SIS II, which must not be delayed and must remain a priority in view of the value-added and important innovation it encompasses for our collective security.
Third and lastly, a point of information.
I should like to draw the attention of the Council and the Commission to the need to exert pressure on the Member States.
Each Member State is responsible for getting ready to enter the system and to remove internal borders.
Entering the Schengen system means that we have mutual trust when it comes to monitoring our external borders.
During this Schengen assessment process there is no place for political agreements between governments to water down criteria and requirements.
This is not an exercise in sympathy.
This is about our shared security, and the security of Europe's citizens is not something to be dealt with lightly.

Roadmap for the European Union's constitutional process (vote)
- Report: BarÃ³n Crespo/Brok
- Before the vote:
Mr President, I would like to make a point of order based on Rules 166 and 167 on the admissibility of part of a resolution.
Parliament's Legal Service has said that we cannot use a non-ratified Treaty as a reference in our reports.
This applies to the first indent of the BarÃ³n Crespo/Brok report.
(Applause from the IND/DEM Group)
I would like you to delete the reference, if the House should be so unwise as not to adopt our alternative resolution, which could solve the problem of inadmissibility much more easily.
May I also ask you to change all other reports referring to the proposed Constitution or the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
According to Eurolex, 117 adopted legislative acts now include such references to the Charter.
There are seven references to the Constitution.
This information comes from Commission President Barroso, in an answer to a written question.
Mr President, I am sure that you and Mr PÃ¶ttering, in particular, as a skilled and very well educated lawyer, are the right people to establish law and order in our House.
The Constitution has only been ratified by 16, not 18, of the 27 Member States, representing 37% of the citizens.
This is still far from the unanimity required to make it a legal-base reference point.
Your Legal Service is entirely right.
(Applause from certain quarters)
Mr Bonde, the interpretation of the Presidency, which, as you know, is responsible for interpreting the Rules of Procedure (with the greatest of respect for the Legal Service, of course, but it is not the Legal Service that interprets the Rules of Procedure, but rather the Presidency) ...
As I was saying, the reference to a document that exists, regardless of whether or not it has been ratified by all of the Member States, and which has been signed by all of the Heads of State or Government, regardless of whether or not it has been ratified by all of the Member States, can be quoted as a reference in the motion for a resolution.
The Presidency's interpretation, therefore, is that your objection is unfounded.
(Protests and applause)
(Parliament rejected the oral amendment)
- Before the vote on paragraph 21:
Mr President, on behalf of the PSE Group, we suggest replacing the word 'possible' with 'reasonable' so that it would read: 'Emphasises that everything "reasonableâ must be done to avoid the creation of a two-speed Europe'.
I am sure you will accept the logic of this, that if we wanted to do everything possible, that might include shooting all opponents of this point of view.
That is possible, but not reasonable, and as we are very reasonable people, we think we should say 'reasonable'.
(Laughter)
(Parliament rejected the oral amendment)

United Nations Human Rights Council (vote)

The social status of artists (vote)
- Report: Gibault
- Before the vote:
rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to say that I have had great pleasure in drafting this report and that I am grateful to all my colleagues and all the shadow rapporteurs.
This report was unanimously adopted by the Committee on Culture and Education on 7 May.
I am tabling two new amendments today that I devised with eminent colleagues who have been ministers of culture.
I would emphasise the fact that the measures that they contain will be submitted to the Member States in their definitive version only when we have the results of a study that I request in my report and that will be entrusted to the Commission.
In the light of the elements that will subsequently be communicated to us, we will have an opportunity to analyse together the advantages and disadvantages of these measures and to take the most appropriate decision.
I should like to say that I was very shocked when, yesterday, a lobbyist, whom I find pretentious, woke up - even though he had had my report for two months - and took the liberty of calling my colleagues to ask them to vote against these two amendments.
I find this attitude unacceptable and I hope that all those who have supported me on the occasion of this report will not let themselves be influenced.
As I see it, our honour as MEPs is at stake, and I hope that you will put your trust in the artist that I am and that you will support the two amendments that give hope to European artists.
(Applause)
Mr President, as someone who was not phoned by the lobbyist but is delighted to vote against these amendments, I was just wondering what the point was of having a Legal Service at all.
The two amendments that my colleague is suggesting are well beyond the bounds of what this House can do: they are, indeed, ultra vires.
I am sure that under the Corbett reforms that we voted on in our previous term there was meant to be some sort of impact assessment and common sense applied to amendments that we are trying to pass through this House, which obviously has not happened in this case.
For example, I believe there is a call for a European social security card in this report, which really should not be allowed through this House at this stage.

Draft estimates of the European Parliament for 2008 (vote)
- Report: ItÃ€lÃ€
That concludes the vote.
Voting time
The next item is the vote.
(For results and other details of the vote: see Minutes)
Explanations of vote
The purpose of this Commission proposal is to incorporate into the Community acquis conservation and enforcement measures adopted by the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation (NAFO), to which the Community is a signatory.
In keeping with the simplification of other legislation, the Commission has taken the opportunity to update and bring together in a single legislative document all of the rules spread across several regulations.
The rapporteur has updated these rules with other texts adopted following the Commission's proposal, as part of the regulation on total allowable catches and quotas for 2007.
The simplification proposal is, in itself, a good thing.
We feel, though, that the consequences of some of the measures incorporated for the long distance fleet, for the fisheries sector and by extension for national economies should be pre-empted and managed.
I wish to point out that Portugal was one of the founding Members of NAFO, represented by the Community when it joined in 1986.
This has not brought us any great benefits - quite the opposite in fact, as evidenced by the difficulties facing the Portuguese long-distance fleet.
in writing. We have problems with the SIS and particularly the planned SIS II, which will create enormous databases with too few guarantees to protect the privacy of citizens.
However, this report does not change the nature of the current system, just extends it to new Member States.
Without access to SIS, the citizens of these countries will not be allowed to travel freely in the rest of the EU.
For these reasons we voted in favour of the report.
The legislative resolution of the European Parliament on which we have voted today, which Parliament has already adopted and which I also backed, is a major milestone in the enlargement of the Schengen area.
This resolution will contribute to the speedy implementation of the acquis communautaire as it applies to the SIS in Slovakia and the other Visegrad Four countries, as well as in the Baltic States and Slovenia.
Some time ago all of the Members elected from Slovakia urged the Council to refrain from postponing the Schengen area enlargement date until 17 December 2008, which we found unacceptable.
It appears that this intervention was a factor in the reassessment and acceleration of a process which will now, I believe, make the Schengen area a reality for Slovak citizens before the end of 2007.
I welcome the fact that the implementation of technical assistance, as well as the SIS, SIS II and SISone4ALL, will proceed on time; and that the European Parliament has gone to great lengths to ensure agreement during the first reading, thus avoiding risk of Parliament causing any delays in the implementation of SIS II.
The citizens of the new Member States are looking forward to the enlargement of the Schengen area, an act generally perceived as the genuine, definitive and complete accomplishment of EU integration.
in writing. (SK) The free movement of persons in the Schengen area is a visible and practical exercise of the basic rights guaranteed under the European Community Treaty.
To our citizens, the free movement of persons, unimpeded by passport checks, is a concrete example of the benefits associated with EU membership.
Thanks to the Portuguese proposal, the European frontier of the Schengen area will, from 1 January 2008, move east from the Czech-German border to the Slovak-Ukrainian one.
The interior ministers of the Member States agreed on this enlargement date after many months of negotiations and innumerable discussions.
In 2004 the European Commission announced that, due to technical delays, it had to propose a new timetable envisaging an operational SIS II as of 17 December 2008.
