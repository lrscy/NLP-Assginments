I think that Mr Grosch's point that we need a level playing field in a European single market is decisive.
We cannot have the situation in which we introduce freedom of choice that makes it possible for certain districts, because they are under financial pressure or because they want to invest their taxpayers' money properly, to invite tenders, and then these are submitted by firms from protected monopolies.
It is therefore so important that this Amendment be voted down tomorrow, so that there may be a level playing field.
The Commission has laid down very tight deadlines for the duration of licences and for transitional regulations.
I think we, as a committee, reached a fair compromise between the various interested parties.
I would, in fact, like us to make a start on introducing time limits and licensing systems throughout Europe.
Commissioner, we will be able to talk about this at future stages, in order to make it even more competition-friendly.
However, let us take this first step together.
This is for the good of the people of Europe.
Mr President, as one of the previous speakers said, what we are all after is the best possible public transport at the lowest possible cost.
As another speaker said, we need appropriate solutions for each particular environment.
That is the main reason why the principle that local authorities can be free to decide how best to organise public transport within their own areas is such an important one.
I would like to make a few comments about running metro systems in large urban areas such as London, where there is a real danger that if we do not allow local authorities to make those decisions, the contracting out will lead to the creation of a monopoly and we will not be any further forward in what we are trying to achieve with this report.
The other thing that could happen in areas such as London and other large cities is that the system could be broken up, which could lead to quite severe chaos.
So I would urge you all to support Amendment No 61.
Mr President, I strongly support the principle that high quality and reasonably priced public transport should be available in all areas.
However, this report is particularly important to my constituency, Wales, due to issues relating to concessionary travel.
The Welsh National Assembly has introduced a scheme, which will come into force next spring, whereby local bus travel will be free for all pensioners in all areas of Wales.
The scheme would offer free bus passes and free travel on local buses and would theoretically enable pensioners to travel throughout Wales if they wanted to without paying a penny.
Whilst I appreciate the importance of ensuring that groups such as disabled people, schoolchildren and trainees are also eligible for reduced cost public transport, it would be ridiculous to undo the good work the National Assembly has done for pensioners in Wales by preventing pensioners enjoying concessionary travel under this regulation.
I am pleased that the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has already voted to abolish the ceiling on concessionary fares that was proposed by the Commission, thereby protecting these pensioners in Wales.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Meijer, for the work he has done; it has been complex and complicated work on a proposal which has given rise to many amendments and positions.
The good work by Mr Meijer, and by all of you, has led to an important debate in Parliament.
In many ways, this debate has helped to generate another broad public debate.
The analyses of this subject, both inside and outside the institutions, help the Commission to improve on its own ideas.
The debate has demonstrated the controversy surrounding these issues, although there have been times when feelings have obscured the real background to the proposal we are dealing with.
Firstly, at the moment there is legal uncertainty in this sector and our intention through this proposal, ladies and gentlemen - we must make this very clear - is to resolve a situation of legal uncertainty which may create serious problems in public transport.
The first intention of this initiative, as Mr Jarzembowski has said, is to promote public transport; we all agree that the European Union must promote high-quality public transport at the best possible price.
The Commission believes that many current contracts and agreements, which grant exclusive rights and financial compensation, may be questionable under the Treaty' s competition rules.
This is the risk we are dealing with and which this proposal is intended to resolve.
Secondly, while the problem of legal uncertainty is serious enough in itself, it is also clear that regulated competition in public transport must benefit both users and society in general.
The facts have demonstrated that systems open to competition controlled and regulated by the public sector have experienced a quicker increase in the number of passengers, during the 90s, than systems which have not been subject to any type of competitive pressure.
The reality is that we do not want private monopolies either.
You will understand that it would take hours to present the Commission' s position on each and every one of the 130 amendments which have been tabled on this subject.
I am therefore going to comment on the fundamental issues you have raised and, with regard to the specific amendment numbers, the services are at your disposal.
With regard to what we can accept, firstly we are in favour of the proposals intended to reinforce the quality criteria which the authorities must take into account on assessing transport needs and awarding contracts.
When the markets open up, the authorities must deal with all issues relating to employment, the environment and consumers, and possibly even more so if the services remain closed to competitive pressures.
We must therefore promote the opening up of the market in order to guarantee these levels and standards in terms of employment, the environment and consumers which we all want to see.
Secondly, the Commission can also accept a longer maximum duration for contracts.
The periods proposed in Amendments Nos 15 and 54 seem to us acceptable (8 years for buses and 15 years for railways).
Thirdly, with regard to the exceptions to the principle of competition, we can only accept those amendments which do not contradict our initial proposal, and not those which intend to further limit the scope of the regulation.
We can also accept those amendments which increase the de minimis thresholds applicable to direct awarding of contracts.
Having heard the debate, we accept that emergency situations may arise where it is impossible to organise competition on time and in a manner which allows the service to be maintained.
The amendments which deal with this issue are therefore acceptable in principle, although they may require some rewording.
We believe that they should be combined in a single emergency clause which also covers other similar circumstances.
The Commission could also accept those amendments which contribute to ensuring that the authorities responsible for compensation have greater flexibility with regard to the general rules laid down for all operators, such as those which establish maximum charges, and which, in some cases, must be applied as appropriate.
Lastly, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission can accept the idea of a transitional period which lasts eight years, as proposed in Amendment No 90.
However, instead of a 'big bang' on that date, we believe that the regulation should lay down a gradual opening up of the market by the authorities, with a first step after four years.
It is also acceptable that existing contracts, awarded in accordance with competition, may continue their natural course, provided that their duration is fixed (that is, that they are not indefinite contracts) and reasonable.
However, ladies and gentlemen, there are things which we cannot accept, because they would undermine the aim of the Commission' s proposal.
For example, we cannot support the exclusion of complete sectors from the scope of the regulation; we cannot accept Amendments Nos 23, 28 and 128, which would exclude all long-distance services.
It may be that Parliament is in favour of increasing competition in long-distance passenger rail transport, but I would prefer this issue to be dealt with under the second package of rail measures.
The draft report raises legal problems in certain cases.
Amendment No 24 would give priority to the regulation over the directives on public contracts.
Ladies and gentlemen, the Commission believes that this could lead to the European Union failing to comply with its commitments contained in the World Trade Organisation agreement on public contracts.
We cannot therefore accept this amendment either.
The second legal problem relates to reciprocity.
The permanent and structural reciprocity clauses are contrary to the non-discrimination requirements laid down in the Treaties.
We cannot therefore accept those amendments which simply propose structural reciprocity clauses.
However, we believe that, until certain exceptions are incorporated, it is necessary, in a transitional and exceptional fashion, to accept certain types of clause which limit access to a market.
It is important that transition towards controlled competition be accompanied by adequate safeguards, also in the field of social protection, an issue which some of you have mentioned.
We cannot therefore accept amendments which would leave the competent authorities without room for manoeuvre in this respect.
I have presented the Commission' s opinion on the majority of the most important issues dealt with in Mr Meijer' s report, but - I am sure you will have noticed - certain crucial issues still remain.
For example, the report includes a group of amendments (Amendments Nos 3, 12, 14, 61, 100, 126 and 129) which intend to safeguard the capacity of public operators to continue to exist without their ability to compete and provide services adequately and to the benefit of the citizens being questioned periodically, by means of public tenders.
In legal terms, there is no fundamental problem in relation to the principle that public authorities should decide to provide the transport service themselves.
The initiative states that.
The main legal problem arises when the public authority continues to deny all the other companies the opportunity to provide those services in the same area, in a situation of transparent and honest competition.
We are talking about a certain level of transport, not small-scale transport between two towns, which is excluded from the scope of this directive as a result of the de minimis stipulations, as is stated clearly.
We are talking about significant transport markets.
We cannot therefore accept those amendments as they are worded.
We do not believe that they benefit the citizens, because they go too far, isolating operators from market pressures to maintain and improve the situation.
However, we believe that the option of self-production laid down in those amendments could be maintained, with certain strict and clearly established conditions.
It is clear that this approach should be accompanied by provisions which guarantee that all operators preserve standards of quality and integration, and which ensure that the authorities remain capable of controlling competitions to the benefit of the users of the services.
The final part of Amendment No 112, which proposes the direct allocation of up to 10% of public services to a private sector operator, is also acceptable, provided that the authority cannot invoke this or other exceptions in simultaneous tendering for a single mode of transport.
Lastly, ladies and gentlemen, if Parliament votes for this report in its current form, I fear that the text, the spirit and the objective of the Commission' s proposal will be seriously affected.
In this respect, we would have to re-examine the real overall contribution of this modification to Community legislation.
The Commission still believes that we must modernise the current regulation (which has existed for several decades), that we must bring things up to date so that public transport may enjoy sufficient legal certainty to guarantee that it is of the highest quality, as competitive as possible, with the best prices and with the legal certainty which will allow public authorities to subsidise and economically support certain routes and certain requirements, such as those of pensioners and other groups, without having to argue this before the courts.
We need efficient public transport, at the service of the citizens, which contributes to rebalancing the transport systems and preventing a future situation of gridlock within the European transport system, which would damage our productive, economic and competitive capacity, job creation and above all the quality of life of our citizens.
Thank you, Commissioner De Palacio.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Market access to port services
The next item on the agenda is the report (A5-0354/2001) by Mr Jarzembowski on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council decision [COM(2001) 35 - C5-0078/2001 - 2001/0047(COD)] on market access to port services.
Mr President, the Commission proposal for a decision on market access to port services should be considered and appreciated as part of the comprehensive Commission communication on improved quality of services in ports.
This communication was to draw conclusions from the positions of Parliament and of the Council on the Commission's 1997 Green Paper.
When we consider the past weeks, we must observe that, whilst the European Parliament was in 1999 still able to agree by a large majority on a position on the Green Paper, the present Commission proposal, which is only intended to regulate market access to services in individual ports, has aroused a great deal of controversy in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, as attested by the result of the vote on the report - 26 in favour, 21 against and 11 abstentions.
So I hope that today's debate and tomorrow's vote will produce a clear position from this House, something in which I intend to play my part.
For if we cannot work out a clear position at first reading stage, the Council then has the last word.
We do not want to trust the Council to that extent, but rather we want to pull our own weight.
In Committee, the majority supported the Commission's desire to adopt only regulations on competition in individual ports and include in this all service providers.
The report is, though, ambiguous on one point, that is, on whether pilot services should fall within the scope of the decision.
On the one hand, Amendment No 14 in the Committee's report states that pilot services are not to be affected by the provisions, but the application to delete pilot services from the appendix to the opinion, which alone defines the opinion's scope, was not accepted.
That being the case, we, as Parliament, must give a clear lead tomorrow.
Among the other amendments in the Committee's report, I would like in particular to highlight the fundamental extension of the scope of the proposal to include port access, be it by sea routes or canals, likewise a more restrictive definition of self-handling and the abandonment of the requirement for at least two service providers per category of cargo handling, likewise the requirement we have incorporated into the opinion, that, when tenders are invited, the new service provider should compensate its predecessor for the investments.
A minority in the Committee tried to highlight, above all, the Commission's failure to comply with Parliament's 1999 demand for conditions for fair competition between ports in the EU, and produce a proposal for a regulation to create them.
The Commission has produced neither a transparency study nor guidelines for the monitoring of aid.
A minority in the Committee therefore proposed the adoption of new regulations on transparency in financial relations between ports and State offices and also on permissible State aid measures for ports, the intention being to provide legal protection for ports and also to prevent excessive aid provision.
For me personally, this is very much about our need to agree tomorrow on this transparency issue, for the issue of transparency and fair conditions for competition between ports is crucial to the ports' ability to function.
All of us have repeatedly emphasised that ports play a central role in European transport policy, with 70% of foreign trade and 30% of trade within the Community passing through them.
They are significant junctions, and they must work well.
I believe that nobody need fear transparency, which leads to fair conditions for competition.
That characteristic and criterion is, I believe, a good basis for a real increase in the efficiency of ports.
In that spirit, I hope we will have a good discussion this afternoon and that this House will vote wisely tomorrow.
Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, all of us who have participated in the work of the committee know that this has been a difficult and controversial debate which has even, at times, caused tension in Parliament.
I would like to make several things clear: firstly, this is a good proposed directive by the Commission.
I repeat: I believe that it is a good proposal, and this has been reflected in the vote in committee.
I believe that it is a positive regulation and is very important if the European Union is to have efficient maritime and port services.
We must not forget that 80% of the European Union' s trade is carried out by sea.
And this liberalisation proposed by the Commission will no doubt benefit short sea shipping.
Furthermore, there is clearly a need for Community regulation of these services in accordance with the liberalising approach established at the Lisbon Council and which has already been applied in other sectors of services.
The proposal we are dealing with today includes technical-nautical services (pilotage and mooring) and cargo-handling services.
There are no reasons, on the grounds of safety, training or anything else, to justify their exclusion from the scope of the directive.
We must clearly take account of the particular nature of ports and the fact that there are services whose provision begins or ends outside the physical area of the port.
Another essential element of the system proposed by the Commission is the concept of self-handling, which is already laid down in Directive 96/67/EC on access to the groundhandling market at Community airports.
I would like to briefly mention certain other elements of the port package.
We are talking about public funding of ports and the need for great transparency in the financial relations between public authorities and ports and State aid.
I agree with certain amendments which try to describe this aspect.
But with regard to State aid, it seems clear that this directive is not the right place to discuss this issue.
Lastly, I would like to thank the rapporteur, although we have disagreed on certain points, for the enormous amount of work he has done and the huge effort he has made to try to reconcile all the proposals.
Mr President, ports, particularly seaports, are normally cosmopolitan systems and they are junctions in the TENs for traffic by ship and sea, which is in principle the most environmentally-friendly mode of transport.
The openness of seaports, though, bears no relation whatever to the system by which they are financed.
Far from it; I think opacity, very often intentional, is the right word to use for it.
To put it in nautical language: when it comes to financing seaports, the bulkheads are closed.
The present financial structures could be described as hazy and must be changed.
I believe that tomorrow's vote must be about transparency in financial relationships and in State finance, for that is the first requirement for fair competition between seaports.
Granted, that is not exactly easy.
Ports are under private, State, joint State and private, and public control, but all of them are enterprises in competition with each other, and so we need fair conditions.
Aid is unobjectionable, but it must be aid for all.
The problem is, I think, that competition between ports has to be organised.
In principle, it occurs within ports or should do so, if all the Community regulations are brought into play.
Pilot services are another issue.
We see them as a public duty, serving safety at sea and the safety of man and nature, and the Member States have essentially reasonable regulations on them.
I believe it would be possible to extend them in view of the recurrent accidents off the German Baltic coast.
One sometimes gets the impression that, when it comes to navigation, many ships use the Shell atlas and nothing else.
So, safety at sea with pilot services must not fall victim to the alleged pressure on costs exerted by competition.
I extend my warmest thanks to the rapporteur.
I know that he has had a difficult job, but his shadow does not always have an easy time of it either.
To start with, I agree with the previous speaker' s last sentence.
I do not need to repeat that ports are important.
In my view, the Commission proposal helps us to enhance the efficiency of ports.
Like a few of my fellow MEPs, however, I have noticed one shortcoming: there are no proposals on state aid and transparency.
It would be best, and I have tabled an amendment to that effect, if these new proposals were to come from the Commission and not from the text which we as Parliament are now drafting.
Commissioner, I should like to ask you if you would be able to tell us more about possible plans in that direction during this debate.
In any event, I hope that my fellow MEPs will support this amendment and that we will therefore ask the Commission to submit new proposals concerning those two points.
For the rest, I back the Commission proposal.
We must increase competition at ports.
This must also include maritime access, not only for technical-nautical services, but also for the handling of cargo and passengers.
We should therefore not dispose of the handling of cargo.
I think that pilotage can also be retained in the directive.
As you rightly stated, it forms a significant link in the life of most ports.
However, if we prescribe a few requirements, impose a number of conditions in the social field, and give due consideration to economic aspects, the environment and public services, as is the case in the directive and in my amendment, we will have more guarantees than if we simply fall back on the Treaty.
For I believe that that is the choice: either we include a special rule for ports in a directive, or we fall back on the Treaty and simply apply to pilotage the general rules of the Treaty which provide for the free movement of services.
I think it would be preferable to adopt the Commission proposal in this respect.
In any case, I am of the opinion that we as Parliament need to cooperate with the Commission constructively, possibly allow for a conciliation procedure with the Council, and ensure that we reinforce the operation of ports and competition in and among ports in a constructive manner to encourage the vital aspect of transport by water as much as possible.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Jarzembowski, thank you for all your work, but we have not reached our goal yet.
Particularly since the Green Paper actually asked for something else on behalf of Parliament and its handling than what we have now received, namely a consideration of the competition among ports instead of in ports.
Why?
If we look at the various coastlines in Europe, and I can think of a few, there are two, maybe six, seven or eight major ports located within a few hundred kilometres of each other, where competition is mainly generated from that small distance between the ports.
Antwerp, Hamburg, Rotterdam, and so it goes on.
The same happens in the Mediterranean in the south.
However, this leads to distorted competition which does not really benefit us.
So that is the first problem.
It also leads to overcapacity and the funding of this overcapacity.
That too is a thorn in our side, and we should like to see common guidelines in this respect.
This, in turn, impacts on the environment, it results in an excessive use of space and generates all kinds of additional problems which we as Greens are also being faced with to a considerable extent.
In terms of competition among ports, we would therefore actually like to propose more transparency and that a reasonable amount of thought be given to state aid.
We would sooner call for coordination among ports, which we would like to add to the objectives of this study along with transparency, and not only the opening of competition in ports, which has been the subject of discussion thus far.
If we turn our attention to competition within ports, as is formulated here, we would particularly like to see the pilotage scrapped for safety and environmental reasons.
I believe that we can rely on majority backing for this.
We also believe it would be wise to delete the handling of cargo, since it does not in any way benefit competition.
Finally, following on from transparency, we call for autonomous research to be carried out. This research should be autonomous vis-Ã -vis, yet commissioned by, Parliament.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission's proposal for a directive on market access to port services was not acceptable.
The removal of constrictions on free movement of services within the Community does not in fact mean only liberalisation and privatisation, but also European harmonisation with due regard being given to Member States' rights to provide public services in defence of the common interest.
It is noticeable that the rapporteur took account of data specific to ports and attempted to include in his report not only requirements for safety, environmental protection and social standards but also the economic needs of ports.
The vote in Committee is evidence of the fact that opinion was not divided on group lines but that there were differences of outlook specific to different countries.
Removal of pilot services, cargo handling and passenger services from the scope of the directive is something I can go along with, as is the retention of licences granted to previous service providers and the setting of minimum standards for new ones.
The Commission's draft has also undergone radical amendment with regard to financial settlement for investments made and the transparency of the financial relationship between ports and State authorities.
Briefly, Mr Jarzembowski's report changes the Commission's document in the right direction.
As, though, I thoroughly share the view of many of my fellow Members, namely that port services should generally be left to the Member States, I intend to abstain in the vote.
Mr President, this report has had a rather odd journey.
Whereas initially, it was a very logical report which, in my view, contained a reasonably correct interpretation of the facts, we now have before us an incoherent document which spawns many comments.
I shall confine myself to the key points.
Firstly, the alleged state aid of Member States for their ports forms the root of the problem.
If government funding for ports does not become transparent, other measures can hardly take effect.
Closer examination of this funding should therefore be given the highest priority, followed by a clear, financial framework which distinguishes legal from illegal support.
Secondly, the inclusion of cargo handling in the proposal prejudices the port authorities' sovereignty to pursue their own strategic policy.
It is reported to lead to the breach of existing, long-term contracts, which will have far-reaching financial implications for the relevant services.
Furthermore, the maintenance of existing contracts renders the present legislation superfluous.
When these contracts lapse, it is likely that economic insights will have changed yet again.
Thirdly, I am of the opinion that pilotage can also remain excluded from this legislation.
I would draw your attention to an amendment which aims to secure surety from governments to render the use of technical-nautical services, in particular, mandatory.
Without surety, considerable problems can arise in the smaller ports.
That cannot be the intention, if I have understood everyone correctly.
Let it be clear: without a number of essential changes, we will be unable to vote in favour of the present report.
Thank you.
Mr President, Mr Vice-President, first I think we should all congratulate Mr Jarzembowski on his excellent work, the time he spent on it and, of course, his patience, because this is an exceptionally tricky issue.
We should also congratulate Commissioner de Palacio on the substance of the proposal which she submitted to us and which is based on the liberalisation of port services, which she wishes to push on with.
Not as an end in itself, but as a means of bringing about better, cheaper services and improving the competitiveness of the European economy.
And, of course, when we speak of competitiveness and liberalisation and apply them to telecommunications, energy, the railways, we cannot leave out port services.
This too is another brick in the wall of the single market.
There can be no doubt that ports are a rule unto themselves, as is every sector.
Obviously we need to look at the question of aid and how it can be reconciled with the rules of transparency.
We need to look at the specific problem of pilotage, which several Members have already mentioned, and see how pilotage relates to safety.
Consequently, we need to look at a whole host of other issues.
But this should not lead us into ignoring the material facts and the material facts are that liberalising port services will have a beneficial effect on competitiveness and our objective of providing better, cheaper services to those who use them.
So the message which we need to send out from this debate is clear: a dual message of liberalisation and transparency.
Of course there are groups which will be affected by these proposals.
Of course there are interests which do not like these proposals.
But the greater good is the objective of competitiveness, and the growth and jobs which it creates.
And I believe that the philosophy behind the proposal before us serves precisely this objective.
Mr President, Commissioner, this is one of the rare occasions when politics must swallow its pride and take into account geographical requirements.
Chairman Hatzidakis is right: we must have the courage to say 'no' to those pressure groups which sometimes attempt to prevent the Commission and the institutions from tackling areas affecting them which Europe has never clearly addressed.
I therefore feel this proposal for a directive is appropriate in order to regulate and improve access to the port market and services.
The calls for safety, the protection of workers, quality of service and, of course, respect for the environment, are appropriate and vital.
I would like to make two points on this subject: we, like the Commission, believe that it is right and proper to include in the scope of this directive terminal cargo handling services, in particular, that is those services which represent over 90% of the volume of business of ports.
In addition, we feel that, if an exception is to be laid down to the application of this directive on grounds of safety or environmental protection, it would thus make no sense to limit it just to pilots and exclude the other technical-nautical services.
Lastly, we do not feel that this directive is the most appropriate instrument to address the issue of the public financing system.
There are too many discrepancies between the systems of the 15 countries of the European Union and some extremely grey areas continue to remain.
Consider - and we must be quite honest about this - how, in some of the major ports of northern Europe, there is proof of commitment to State financing in the fact that representatives of public authorities sit on the managing bodies of the individual ports.
This must be made clear in the name of the transparency rightly advocated by Mr Jarzembowski.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we all agree that this proposal is very significant for port services insofar as it affects one of the most important transport infrastructures of the European maritime regions and because of the process of liberalisation of access to the market in these services.
I would like to make several points:
Firstly, the philosophy of liberalisation must include making the process more flexible so that it does not lead to dangerous or inappropriate radicalism.
Secondly, we must take account of the geographical reality of the seaports in the various regions of the European Union.
Thirdly, the jobs of the port workers affected must be guaranteed, as well as their social protection.
And on transposing this directive in the various Member States, the principle of subsidiarity must be taken into account.
These are the reasons that have allowed me to support this directive with certain clarifications, and justify certain particular amendments, which are coherent amongst themselves, and which deal with the fact that certain regions of the Member States affected are of an insular or peripheral nature, where the port is paramount and, in many cases, quality services are already provided.
Despite everything, I thank the rapporteur, Mr Jarzembowski.
Mr President, the aim of the directive proposed by the Commission is indeed to open up all port services to competition.
In my opinion, these proposals will address the living and working conditions of port staff but I do not feel that they will improve them.
We are told that improvements are taking place, but, as is all too often the case, there has been no prior study of the effects of this liberalisation, in particular with regard to such important issues as safety, the environment and employment.
Those affected have not been consulted, in particular, trade unions (we can always call them 'lobbies' if you prefer), even though they know the safety needs of people and the environment, and have unrivalled knowledge.
Although the amendments made to Mr Jarzembowski' s report take into consideration certain problems that I have just raised, in my opinion they are far from adequate.
They do nothing to temper the line taken by the text as a whole.
Self-handling in the ports would therefore equate to allowing social dumping.
Given the current practices of commercial fleets, this measure will lead to inadequate safety levels and the deterioration of environmental safety, employment and working conditions.
I will support the amendments that seek to exclude dockers from the directive.
These staff carry out an important economic task under difficult conditions, while still ensuring safety.
Nautical services for piloting and mooring are universally recognised as services of general interest.
They should, in my opinion, be considered as partners in their own right, with a view to sustainable development.
Well then, the proposals of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, do take account of pilots but not of mooring service providers, which I personally regret.
I believe that the European Union should work towards harmonisation at the top end of working and employment conditions for employees in this sector, which is the only way to genuinely guarantee economic and social effectiveness while respecting the environment.
The proposals made to date will not, in my opinion, take us any further towards these essential objectives.
Mr President, in my constituency lie the ports of Felixstowe and Harwich, the largest privately owned port complex in Europe and a model of commercial success.
The owners tell me that this directive has been prepared without thorough consultation and that, if passed, it will be seriously damaging to the whole UK port industry.
They say that it would force many ports to restructure, yet would do nothing to improve efficiency in a cargo handling market characterised by competition between ports, not within ports.
Thus, if there are problems of restrictive practices in cargo handling and pilotage in some continental ports, they should be tackled by individual Member States.
As is so often the case, one size does not fit all.
I urge the Commission, even at this late stage, to rethink this damaging proposal.
Competition is one thing.
Destruction of a successful industry is quite another.
I ask you to take this directive back and consult properly with those who are affected by it.
Mr President, it is a real pity that the Commission completely ignored Parliament's position on the 1997 Green Paper which stated: "No need for Community legislation on organisational structure and market access for port services".
That was our position then and I hope it is going to be our position tomorrow, but so far the Commissioner has failed to explain why she has ignored that.
Secondly, so far the Commission has ignored the question of why there has been no regulatory impact assessment on this proposal.
Whether you are for it or against it, it is extraordinary that such a proposal as this is not subject to the assessment that President Prodi assured the House would apply to all new Commission proposals.
Why is Mr Prodi not honouring commitments given to this House?
Thirdly and finally, why is this proposal so over-prescriptive?
Why is it going to burden a successful industry with more red tape, with no justification whatsoever?
Why does it seek to regulate in minute detail every aspect of a port's operation?
Why, for example, does it call for cargo handling to be provided by at least two service providers for each type of cargo?
How can that make any sense when you are trying to organise the arrangements at ports?
Bearing all that in mind and unwelcome as the proposal is, it is even more extraordinary that it does not address the issue of state aids or transparency of accounts.
The whole package is unbalanced and unworkable.
I hope the House rejects it tomorrow.
Mr President, I come from Sweden where we have quite a high degree of exposure to competition and privatisation of various services.
The lesson to be drawn from our experience is that the crucial issue is not really market competition or privatisation, as such, but quality, greater efficiency and good, cleverly designed organisation.
These are aspects to which the Commission has given insufficient consideration in its proposal.
I want to express my thanks to Mr Jarzembowski who, as rapporteur, has come up with many criticisms of the Commission' s proposal.
I should like to make a number of important exceptions, and I shall point out a couple of these.
Quite a few speakers have referred to pilotage.
I believe that pilotage is quite clearly a service for the benefit of everyone.
Pilotage must not therefore be regarded in terms of the same economic criteria as ordinary production, but from a safety perspective.
Taking responsibility oneself can have very serious consequences when it comes to loading and unloading.
That especially applies in view of the fact that flags of convenience are a common phenomenon.
I am in favour of transparency and public scrutiny where ports are concerned. I am in favour of self-financed ports.
I want to see quality and efficiency brought about through ports' preparing their own development programmes instead of being subjected to extensive forms of control from Brussels.
Such programmes must be carried out in cooperation with staff and clients at the ports.
Mr President, over the next few years the present directive will determine the operation of our ports, which will play an ever more important role in trade traffic on account of ever increasing traffic flows among other things.
Unlike in the past, modern port users are uncommitted: they choose their port on the basis of price and quality.
There are important financial channels that run from authorities to port companies.
A need for more insight into the investment flows has arisen.
In addition, a level playing field is needed for all interested parties.
This situation could be improved by setting up a number of basic rules.
I should like to highlight a few aspects in this context.
First of all, there is the scope of the directive.
It does not simply cover the port itself, but mainly the port users.
Deleting cargo handling from the directive will not benefit the quality of the service which ports offer their customers.
Freight services, or cargo handling, should simply remain in the directive.
Secondly, ship services, also referred to as pilotage and towage services.
Amendments Nos 3, 14 and 51 aim to keep pilotage outside the scope of the directive, based on the outmoded notion that pilotage services are always public services.
I will not support these amendments.
In my country, pilotage services have not been a public service for a very long time, and that has worked out very well.
A directive which regulates market access to port services therefore covers both ship and port services.
Needless to say, we must move towards more transparency of the financial flows with regard to infrastructure, but I should like to leave the powers where they are, and will therefore vote in favour of Mr Sterckx' Amendment No 47 in which the Commission is still being requested to submit proposals in this field.
What matters is that ports facilitate reshipment and receiving companies.
Ports and their users deserve solid, well-thought-out legislation.
I regret that the way in which this directive has been dealt with in Parliament has created unnecessary tension between northern, southern and western Europe.
Mr President, Commissioner, it was very difficult to assess this text as its focus has shifted slightly.
We were supposed to address the issue of competition in ports and we are now being presented with a text on competition between ports.
I do not know what will happen tomorrow, but I am sure there will be some confusion.
In passing, I regret that the mooring service providers' lot is not the same as the pilots' .
I do not see why we would maintain competition for mooring service providers while excluding pilots.
These professions are fairly similar.
With regard to competition between ports, I feel that transparency is a good thing, but I would warn you against going straight from that to decreeing competition between ports without closer analysis, for ports are first and foremost tools for regional development.
They do not have the same nautical qualities.
Moreover, if we were to increase competition, your entire sustainable mobility policy would fall through.
I actually think that, in years to come, we will have to help the southern ports and the ports on the Atlantic coast take over from the over concentrated mass of North Sea ports.
Otherwise, we will be going against both the Erika-Maritime Safety package and our desire to remove lorries from the major transit countries.
In my opinion, the Commission will actually have to present us with specific proposals on State aid to ports focusing on regional development rather than just competition between products.
Mr President, as other Members have already said, the full complexity and problematic nature of the work over which Mr Jarzembowski has presided, competently and doggedly, must be recognised, and we all hope that the final result will be positive in terms of providing the necessary safeguards for the different principles.
We support the Commission' s proposal, particularly insofar as some of the amendments tabled by Parliament have helped to make opening up the port services market a viable possibility, and, although this does not in itself appear to be the most remarkable result, it is positive in terms of revamping services and of introducing elements of competition, provided, as some of the amendments advocate, that certain social clauses remain untouched, that certain requirements relating to environmental safety, professional standards and continuity of authorisations continue to be met.
Parliament' s vote will make it possible to consolidate all this provided that, as far as the internal port services to be opened up to competition are concerned, there are no obscure exemption clauses which would render the scope of the directive meaningless.
That applies to cargo handling and terminal services, and we feel that, in due respect not least for the principle of subsidiarity, certain services in which safety and professionalism are of paramount importance, such as pilotage, could be revitalised.
Finally, subjects which do not fall within the scope of the directive must not be allowed to infiltrate it.
The Commission will certainly have the opportunity to present a proposal on public financing for ports, and we look forward to it, but we must not now make the mistake of anticipating the proposal and bringing forward its introduction without a legal basis, creating unacceptable areas of discrimination between the port systems of the Member States, which differ too widely in this respect.
Mr President, Mr Jarzembowski has undertaken a very difficult task, but he has carried out a major, carefully considered piece of work affecting crucial areas.
Ports are clearly a very important factor when we discuss fulfilment of the Kyoto commitments in as much as they can ease the pressure on land transport and make things easier in a wide range of other areas.
It is therefore essential from an environmental point of view to have some of the goods at present conveyed by land transported instead by sea.
If this is to happen successfully, ports must be efficient, and we must therefore see liberalisation within those areas proposed by the Commission: loading and unloading, passenger services and whatever else has been mentioned, presumably with some exemptions in special regions. Perhaps outlying districts, in particular, can ask to be accorded special consideration.
However, that too has, of course, been mentioned in the report.
I hope that, in the light of the many views presented in this House, we shall now be able to agree upon a proposal so that together we are able to support the Commission' s overall goal for the benefit of the whole of the EU.
Mr President, Commissioner, as you know, I come from a small port, but nonetheless one with European credentials as regards the trans-European networks.
I will quite happily note in our logbook that it is not about seeing things in black and white when liberalising and creating free and fair competition, simply in order to adhere to a principle.
The unedifying dispute about duty free is still in my mind.
This discussion about ports is also about jobs, attractive business propositions and public profile, and I want to take part in it, we need to define transparency rules for the calculation of costs and the use of public funds by ports, in order to establish fair competition within ports and between them.
Only transparency about the flow of public funds and services will make it possible to compare the services offered by the various seaports and in that way demonstrate which works more efficiently.
Comparability of services creates competition, and transparency is, in consequence, indispensable if we want to have long-term liberalisation of the market in port services.
I will say in addition that, at this time, we should not yet liberalise the pilot services.
Pilots have, as at present organised, long maintained a high standard of quality and safety on sea routes.
These extraordinarily high standards would be needlessly jeopardised by liberalisation at any cost.
Every market structure contains components for which quality rather than competition must come first.
Of course, the pilots will one day have to adopt a new approach - one day.
Even they will not be able to resist the opening-up of the market forever, but as far as safety at sea is concerned, there are at present more pressing matters such as, for, example, the introduction of a 'black box' for ships.
Immediately forcing pilots to be subject to competition would, under certain circumstances, lead to a price war that could compromise the safety of shipping lanes in the long term.
Mr President, while the European economy is having a coughing fit we must decide whether to say a final good-bye to 'Eurosclerosis' and protectionism, whether to allow port monopolies to remain as they are or whether we should give free rein to the dynamics of economy.
Sabena is a warning example of the kind of inefficiency that centrally managed industrial policies can produce in the worst possible case.
Should we exclude cargo handling from the directive on ports, all that would be left of it would be an empty shell.
This is why Amendment 52 is dangerous.
Although I am in favour of the inclusion of all major ports, I can, nevertheless, give my support to Amendment 79 proposed by Mr Atkins.
This amendment would restrict the directive to covering public ports only.
My British colleagues could then accept the inclusion of cargo handling without any concern.
We must not forget that British exporters benefit from reasonably priced port services in continental Europe.
The numbers of port operators should not be restricted except for compelling reasons.
Should economic efficiency be accepted as a criterion for restricting the numbers, this would leave a great deal of room for speculation as to when operations are efficient and when they are not.
This is a reason why Amendments 6, 25 and 44 should not be seconded.
On the other hand, Amendment 50 on the definition of the port system is not acceptable because, according to the amendment, a port in Greece and a port in Germany, for example, could be construed as forming a single port.
I am sorry but this is an absurd idea.
As regards pilotage, we, the members of the committee, concluded that strict national rules should apply.
Therefore, safety aspects cannot be used as an excuse for a monopoly.
Is it our intention then to prevent the development of EU ports by diluting the directive that has been awaited for so long?
Cargo handling and pilotage, based on national rules, should be included, absolutely.
Also, the port system should be defined in a concise manner.
My highly honourable colleague Jarzembowski' s ideas on this matter are, unfortunately, a long way away from the actual needs of port users.
We cannot change Europe into a giant Hamburg.
The committee has reached a good compromise and we should clearly stick to that.
'Eurosclerosis' hits the poor hardest.
Now we have a good opportunity to do a favour to European employment and sustainable development.
Let us pilot Europe towards competitive ports.
Mr President, as a former member of the Amsterdam City Council Port Committee and as a current inhabitant of Rotterdam, I know what is wrong with competition, expansion and labour relations in ports.
The ports along the coast between Hamburg and Le Havre, spanning Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and France, largely service the same hinterland.
They have traditionally competed with each other with low tariffs and large public investments to secure the highest possible cargo levels for their quays.
This competition involves taxpayers' money, and there is unnecessary secrecy about the use of taxpayers' money.
An orderly and scheduled distribution of tasks among those ports saves public funding and better provides the port workers with sustainable employment without the unnecessary peaks and troughs.
That is why I support the remarkable agreement between a large contingent to the Left and rapporteur Jarzembowski, which reminds us of the position which this Parliament has adopted once before, namely the position that transparent competition among ports is far more useful than organising competition in the ports.
Competing pilotage and towage services are at the expense of safety, working conditions and job security.
That is why we need to avoid the wrong interventionist measures from the powers that be.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to thank Mr Jarzembowski for all the work he has done as rapporteur throughout this debate. It has clearly been difficult work, and we must all be aware of what is at stake here.
I would therefore ask Parliament as a whole to try to give the rapporteur the greatest support possible, with certain slight modifications to what Mr Jarzembowski proposes, since, for once, I do not agree with some of his suggestions.
I would like to remind you that 70% of trade with third countries depends on the efficiency of our ports.
It is clear that sea ports play an essential role in relation to the European Union' s trade.
But furthermore, if we want to deal with the future of transport within the European Union in a credible fashion, not trade between the European Union and third countries, where we will continue to depend largely on sea transport, but within the European Union, we must move on from words and declarations to actions, once and for all, and make short sea shipping a reality.
This requires our ports to be as competitive, as efficient and as well-interconnected with adjacent territories as possible.
As you know, to this end, a few months ago, ports were incorporated into the trans-European networks for the first time, precisely so that they may be fully integrated into the Union' s internal transport system and thereby play a crucial role in making that system sustainable and competitive.
The Commission' s proposal is part of a package which deals with various issues of port policy: the transparency of flows of public funds destined for ports; criteria for what is State aid and what is not.
It deals with aspects relating to competition between ports.
The proposed directive which you must vote on deals with the issue of competition between service providers within ports, covering all the services that are normally provided to port users and are of commercial value.
In a moment I will mention something which several of you have referred to; competition between ports.
However, now we are going to talk about the proposed directive relating to competition within ports.
The proposal is based on two pillars: one relating to content and the other to procedures.
With regard to content, we propose bringing ourselves into line with the legislation passed by Parliament and the Council in similar areas, where rules have been established to open up the markets.
I am talking about telecommunications, gas, electricity, but especially, in the transport sector, ground services at airports.
Although the Treaty does not in principle allow restrictions to market access, the ports have their own specific characteristics such as possible space limitations and the fundamental importance of safety and environmental issues.
Our proposal guarantees a fair balance between these needs.
I am pleased to note that, in its vote, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism expressed its satisfaction with this approach.
We must allow self-handling in ports where operators consider that they can obtain better performance from their own personnel and equipment and we must guarantee that, as in the case of all the other sectors, the number of service providers can only be restricted for justifiable reasons, such as space limitations, or the safety of sea traffic in this case.
All competent service providers must have equal opportunities to operate in the ports of their choice.
This brings me to the second pillar of our proposal: procedures.
The procedural rules must be transparent, non-discriminatory, objective and proportionate.
This is not always the case at the moment.
I am convinced that what was possible for ground services at airports must also be possible for ports.
And I believe that, although it is going to create certain problems, as is always the case when there is a change to a situation that has remained the same for a long time, perhaps even for centuries, it is certain that this change will be of benefit to the whole system, to the economy and to the quality of life of the citizens of the European Union in general.
Of course, specific local characteristics must be taken into account, above all on issues relating to safety, the environment and social aspects.
Our proposal will therefore allow for a high level of flexibility on a national, regional and, above all, local level, so that ports can manage their own affairs in an open and balanced fashion.
Focussing now on the amendments, I would like to say that, having examined them in detail, the Commission can accept most of them.
Many amendments improve our proposal substantially with regard to the clarification of the definitions of port services and self-handling and they include compensation rules which are not only implicit, but also explicit, as is the case with Amendments Nos 18, 20, 32 and, in part, Amendment No 46, which we fully accept.
I would also like to mention Amendment No 15, which allows Member States to extend the scope of the directive to inland waterways close to ports.
Furthermore, we accept part of Amendments Nos 25 and 44 which limit, for reasons of maritime safety, the number of service providers rather than that of just providers of technical-nautical services.
It is a reasonable measure and it is in accordance with the Commission' s general interests in the field of maritime safety.
We also agree with the idea that the time period finally approved in relation to the maximum periods of authorisation should facilitate normal repayment and performance of investments, and we therefore accept an extension of the time limit and also, possibly, compensation where total repayment has not taken place, as certain other amendments suggest.
There are other amendments that, although they do not introduce changes, provide useful clarifications, particularly in relation to the continued application of the rules currently in force with regard to safety, the environment and social issues.
All of these amendments can be accepted, though with modifications to their wording.
However, there are issues that we cannot accept, for various different reasons, and you must understand this, ladies and gentlemen.
In the case of certain amendments to the recitals of the directive, they do not really correspond to the legislative text itself, for example: Amendments Nos 2, 3 and 12.
Neither can the Commission accept amendments that substantially change or reduce the scope of the directive.
Having reached this point, please allow me to point out two problems which have been at the centre of the debates in Parliament' s Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism: should ground services be included in the scope of the directive?
The enormous majority of parties accept that this inclusion is necessary, and we could not accept any amendment, such as No 52, which leads to the exclusion of this sector.
If we want modern, high-quality ports, that which is possible and necessary for ground services in airports must also be possible and necessary in ports.
Furthermore, this position received majority support in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.
The same is true with the amendments aimed at excluding self-handling and the right of service providers to employ the personnel of their choice, such as Amendments Nos 69, 70, 71, 72 and 73, which are also rejected.
The latter is already included in the legislation.
However, if you read our proposal correctly, you will see that service providers cannot employ so-called 'pirate workers' . It is not possible.
If these misunderstandings can be overcome by clarifying our text, the Commission is prepared to seek an appropriate wording.
Another problem is the issue of pilotage.
The question is once again whether pilotage can be included in the directive or not.
Many people believe that certain safety considerations make it difficult to include this particular sector, but there are ways to ensure safety which are different from those which are currently applied.
The same is true for other technical-nautical services, which is why the Commission cannot accept those amendments which exclude pilotage from the scope of the directive.
In this regard also, Parliament' s relevant committee supported our proposal.
Certain other amendments are also unacceptable for various reasons: specifically, economic considerations concerning the service provider should not be a criterion, as is mentioned in the second part of Amendment No 25.
Service providers must accept commercial risks and public authorities must not carry out economic assessments.
Having said this, our proposal leaves a door open: when exceptional circumstances arise relating to the volume of cargo, the number of service providers may be restricted.
Furthermore, without going into detail, we cannot accept various amendments for technical reasons and the list is available to you.
Lastly, I would like to refer to Amendment No 26.
Our proposal indicates that normally, and I repeat, normally, at least two service providers will have to be authorised for each category of cargo.
If we were to remove this article, we would have to apply the rule established in another paragraph, which would authorise the greatest possible number of service providers, a consequence which I do not believe was intended on presenting this amendment.
Certain amendments express the desire to put more stress on competition between ports than the Commission' s package on ports does.
Please allow me to deal with this issue by saying that I agree with the need to consider competition between ports as well, but I think that we need to find a more appropriate way of doing so.
For example, the increase in transparency: Amendments Nos 9 and 48.
The Commission accepts this principle and I am counting on your support so that we can jointly find the best way to apply this principle.
Another example is the State aid mentioned in Amendment No 49.
We all agree that this State aid should not exist, but we must first provide a clear definition of the dividing line between what is State aid and what is not.
The Treaty lays down that the Commission and only the Commission applies the Treaty' s rules in the field of State aid.
The current legislative process will focus on this issue and I hope that we can sit down together to find a viable solution, within the framework of the Treaty, which clarifies such a thorny issue.
And if it is necessary to go further - and I have the impression from what you have said, and I share many of your concerns, that this is the case - I must say that I am prepared to go further than the provisions of the current proposal in the fields of State aid to ports and competition between ports.
Lastly, a few words on Amendment No 79, which proposes excluding private ports, many of which do not apply access restrictions.
During the legislative process, we will have to study ways of suitably dealing with this issue.
Of course, this is only the beginning of the legislative process. During this long process, the Commission will be open to finding constructive solutions with the European Parliament which will allow us to be able to count upon the broadest possible support for this proposal, which is aimed at ensuring that a mature industry, an industry which has much to gain from the restructuring of the European transport industry, can meet the challenges before us and make a crucial contribution to our creating a sustainable transport system at the service of economic development, the creation of jobs, respect for the environment and the quality of life of our citizens.
Enlargement
The next item is the Commission communication on enlargement.
The President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, now has the floor.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, enlargement has been a top priority for this Commission from the very beginning of its mandate.
From the point of view of Europe' s powers and responsibilities, its potential and goals, enlargement is the real acid test. It is also Europe' s historic duty.
Enlargement - the unification of this continent - brings to a close a chapter in Europe' s history and lays the foundations for the future.
Through this process, the Union is preparing to shoulder responsibilities as a continent and we therefore need to take a closer look at our resources, policies and goals, at global level.
Our commitment and courage must match the commitment and courage which the candidate countries are showing as they prepare to join the Union.
Since the beginning of my mandate as President of the Commission, nothing has made a deeper impression on me than my trips to the candidate countries, my meetings with their citizens and the representatives of their governments, or my contact with their parliaments, bravely working day and night on the arduous task of bringing their societies safely through the transition consisting mainly of preparations for enlargement.
In recognition of their efforts, I would like to send them a message of thanks and good wishes from the European Parliament here in Strasbourg.
There you are: these are countries which, barely ten years ago, were literally cut off from the Europe in which we live. Since then, they have been restoring contact with our shared values.
Even before being formally admitted as new Member States, the candidate countries are starting to reap the benefits of their integration. In practice, they are already part of our area of stability and development, as is shown by the ever-increasing presence in the candidate countries of companies from the Member States.
We have already seen extraordinary progress along the road to accession.
The reports we are presenting to you today analyse as precisely as possible the countries' preparation efforts.
Here, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to Commissioner Verheugen and his colleagues for their huge, unprecedented efforts, in terms of both quality and quantity, in instigating and experimenting with a truly remarkable methodology, and if we should prove to have failed at any time, it is because we really were stepping out in the dark.
In short, our reports show that this historic moment really is possible and just around the corner, but only if we are able to keep up this sustained pace.
Without going into the details of the reports, which Commissioner Verheugen will be describing in a few moments, I can tell you that progress has been made in virtually all the chapters making up the accession process.
I think I can safely say that this remarkable progress has been greatly inspired by Nice, where, a year ago, we set out the practical stages and the 'roadmap' , as we termed it, for the final stage of this path to enlargement.
One year from now, we will evaluate, together with Parliament, the ability of each of the candidate countries to assume the rights and responsibilities which are part and parcel of its integration into the Union.
We realise that, when that time comes, we will have to have concluded, or, at least, very nearly concluded the negotiations with the countries which have met the criteria laid down.
Once the conditions set by Parliament and the European Council have been complied with, and once the necessary ratification procedures are complete, these countries will be in a position to join the European Union before the June 2004 elections and thus elect representatives to this House for the next Parliamentary term.
Therefore, next year will be decisive for the enlargement process and for the future of Europe.
Negotiations will be tackling sensitive issues like agriculture, the Structural Funds and the budget and, in these negotiations, we will show the same determination to find constructive answers that we have shown in the past.
From the beginning of the year onwards, the Commission will be putting forward proposals based on the current acquis and on the principles adopted at the Berlin European Council.
Much will depend on the continued efforts of the candidate countries to adopt and implement the acquis.
As the Commission stresses in its Regular Reports this year, the candidate countries will also need to develop the necessary administrative capacity to be able to apply the Union' s rules and policies properly.
However, sustained efforts on behalf of the candidate countries are only one side of the coin.
In order for enlargement to be a success, it will be important to strengthen the Community method and sustain the necessary cooperation between the Council, Parliament and the Commission.
2002 will be a year of intense reviewing and monitoring and I know I can count on Parliament to scrutinise this work closely.
I would also urge the Member States to continue to respect their existing commitments regarding enlargement, particularly those contained in Agenda 2000 and the Financial Perspective for up to 2006, as agreed by the Berlin European Council in 1999.
We cannot make further reforms a pre-condition for enlargement, although the responsibilities which we are taking on with enlargement must prompt us to begin preparing, with considerable momentum and political vision, the new institutional process due to be launched at the Laeken European Council.
Similarly, the current negotiations should not be linked to the issue of the Union' s finances after 2006, these are separate issues.
Any attempt to relate them would mean changing the rules and would inevitably ultimately disrupt our carefully balanced negotiation process.
The reports we are presenting to you also look at the implications of enlargement for the candidate countries' neighbours, that is other European countries, and for the Mediterranean.
The terrorist attacks of 11 September against the US have completely changed the international situation. It is now less stable, less predictable and more frightening.
Now, more than ever, the world needs a strong Europe which is sure of its values, which sows stability, predictability, security and prosperity around it, and which is, at last, a leading power on the international stage.
With enlargement, Europe' s position as the world' s leading economy and trading power, with an internal market of 500 million consumers, will be confirmed.
With this situation established, we will be in a position to extend the area of stability and prosperity which we so need beyond the Union and the candidate countries.
If we are to achieve this, we will need a new 'neighbourhood policy' , and this is one of this Commission' s strategic goals.
As I have long maintained, and as I confirmed yesterday at the College of Europe in Bruges, we need to move beyond and expand the range of instruments available to the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership, the partnerships with Russia and Ukraine, and our stability efforts in the Balkans.
The fundamental intention is to extend liberalisation of trade, the technical standards and the laws governing our internal market to all our neighbours.
The form that the appropriate agreements should take - free-trade agreements or agreements modelled on the European Economic Area agreement - will have to be determined through negotiations, but the essential objective will be to consolidate mutual economic presence.
Our central aim is to build a partnership with our neighbours that is as close as possible and which can become an anchor for stability and security.
Basically, what we need to do is 'export' stability, and lay the foundations for balanced development in all areas bordering on the Union, drawing on the main strengths of European integration.
This will make integration of our closest neighbours, the countries of the Western Balkans, easier when the time comes.
In our efforts, we must not, of course, neglect the importance of the cultural dimension of our partnership.
This is why we are working on a new initiative to encourage dialogue and mutual understanding between the northern and southern shores of the Mediterranean.
I am grateful for Parliament' s past and present support and constructive attitude towards the enlargement process. I am counting on Parliament' s continued support during this sensitive, final phase of the negotiations.
The work of the Members of this House will be crucial, not just in terms of ratification as such, but also, more generally, in terms of encouraging support for enlargement among Europe' s citizens.
Opinion polls indicate that, in many parts of the Union, many citizens still need to be convinced of the overall benefits of enlargement.
The Commission will, of course, continue and intensify its information strategy, but it is Parliament and its Members that can make the greatest, most effective contribution to building up the necessary democratic support for enlargement.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the continuous involvement of this House in the enlargement process remains crucial, and not least in terms of the debate on Europe' s future, a debate to which the candidate countries and future Member States are expected to make a substantial contribution.
The report presented by the Commission today shows that the beginning of a new European era is just a few steps away.
Let us take these steps together and continue and intensify our cooperation in the months to come, and thus lay the foundations for a larger, stronger, completely democratic Union.
(Loud applause)
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I will add to what President Prodi has already said by informing you of a number of things.
The Commission's essential political message for today is that the desire of Parliament and of the Council to achieve the first accessions before the 2004 European elections may well be ambitious, but it is realistic and feasible.
Why is this so?
Firstly, because the candidate countries continue to meet the political criteria, with the exception of Turkey with which we cannot, for this reason, begin negotiations this year.
Among the political criteria there are areas which still require our attention: good governance in the broadest sense of the word, international criminality, the functioning of the constitutional state - but I must repeat that the criteria have been met.
The progress made in fulfilling the economic criteria means that ten of the candidate countries are functioning market economies and are also either now, or will be in the near future, in a position to cope with the competitive pressure in the internal market.
These are all countries with which we have opened negotiations, with the exception of Bulgaria and Romania, where though, I must openly say, there has also been significant progress.
Particularly in Romania's case, the Commission considers it important to note that, for the first time, there is real progress in terms of political, economic and social reform, something which will be shown clearly only in the next progress report.
As regards the adoption of the acquis, this is reflected, above all, in the progress made in the negotiations, of which you are all well aware.
So far, we have achieved all that was envisaged in the framework of the negotiating timetable, and therefore the negotiating timetable fixed at Nice will continue to be the keynote of our actions.
What is actually new about this year's report is that we are now concentrating very intently on the last remaining, and very substantial, problem, namely how to ensure that the future Member countries, at the time of accession, will have the administrative capacity to meet all the obligations of a Member of the European Union.
For the avoidance of doubt, let me say that as yet they do not.
Not one of the candidate countries at present fully meets all three criteria.
The Commission therefore proposes the realisation of a special action plan to improve the candidate countries' implementation capacity.
We are therefore also making extensive additional resources available.
We will inform Parliament and the Council of the outcome as early as the middle of next year.
I do not want there to be any misapprehensions here.
If the progress reports focus heavily on the shortfalls that we still have today, this is simply because we cannot repeat every year what has already been done, but the nearer we come to the objective of the negotiations, all the more clearly do we see the problems that still remain.
In order to have the full picture, though, we must see the remaining problems against the background of the enormous progress that has been made over the past few years.
Only then do we get things in the right perspective.
We believe that it is possible to reduce the existing administrative and legal shortcomings in due time for the candidate countries to have adequate implementation capacity when they accede.
To put it very plainly: the Commission will no doubt have to give final opinions next year, and by that point there must be no more deficits.
Let me say in addition, that the accession negotiations with Cyprus are well advanced.
It is our strategic goal to take in a united Cyprus as a new member.
This requires constructive and substantial progress towards a lasting peace solution.
I therefore reiterate my appeal to all concerned to make use of the 'window of opportunity' to achieve this goal.
The pre-accession strategy for Turkey is showing the first positive results.
The constitutional reform recently adopted by the Turkish Parliament is a step in the right direction, but further reforms are necessary, especially in regard to effective protection of human rights and the implementation of economic reforms.
The Commission considers that it is now time to intensify the pre-accession strategy.
A more detailed scrutiny of Turkish legislation and its approximation to the acquis will be in the forefront.
We have, though, not yet progressed to the point where we can propose starting on Turkey's screening.
Next year we will be embarking on the most politically sensitive stage of the accession negotiations.
We will lay down a general framework for the negotiation of the financial chapter which ensures that it can be dealt with in a common framework, and we will be doing this very early in 2002, so that the Spanish Presidency will have the chance to keep to the timetable.
We are confident that the enlargement negotiations can be successfully completely on the basis of the current acquis.
In our proposal, we will strictly observe the expenditure limits of Agenda 2000.
We will thus make no proposals going beyond them, nor will we make proposals binding the European Union beyond 2006, so that it is perfectly clear that the Commission's strategy involves no financial risks.
Finally, let me add that negotiations are currently concerned with issues, the resolution of which will have direct impact on the living conditions of citizens in the accession countries.
The decisions made now will influence either positively or negatively the acceptance of the accessions in the candidate countries.
We must therefore make every effort to give the citizens in today's and tomorrow's Member States all the information about enlargement.
No partner should be subjected to excessive demands in the accession process.
It is therefore essential that negotiations be both flexible and result-oriented.
The Commission will, then, on the basis of next year's progress reports, submit recommendations on the readiness for accession of those countries that are adequately prepared.
It will make every effort to ensure that negotiations with these countries can be concluded successfully.
It will also produce a revised pre-accession strategy for those countries which are unable or unwilling to conclude negotiations by the end of 2002.
These countries must not be made to feel that they are being left behind.
They therefore require special attention and special instruments, which we will be proposing in the 2002 Strategy Paper.
Thank you, Commissioner Verheugen.
I would remind the House that this debate consists of an exchange of short questions and answers.
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioner, I have, of course, some questions, but a few statements are in order.
Let me say first, Mr President of the Commission, that we are glad to see you here.
We were, though, somewhat astonished to see your name appear on the monitor during our bureau meeting.
It took us by surprise, which may have been a mistake by our group.
We do, of course, make mistakes, but in general, according to what I hear around the place, it was not known that the President of the Commission was going to be here this afternoon.
We are glad that you are here, even though we would have liked prior notice.
A second point, to which I would also like an answer, is that I was told this morning while the Group Chairmen were holding press conferences, that Mr Verheugen had also held a press conference.
I would be very interested to know, Commissioner, whether it was on the subject to which you have just been speaking.
If you can shed some light on that, then so much the better.
Now for my questions. First, let me inform you that our group's leaders had a meeting in Hungary last week.
There was grave concern in Hungary that the enlargement could, for them, be delayed if in another country, namely Poland, developments were not proceeding as quickly as might be wished.
Of course, we all want Poland to be in the first round of enlargement, but a consequence of that must not be that, if a Member country is not yet ready, the others have to wait and we cannot keep to the 2004 deadline.
Each country must be assessed on its own merits if enlargement is to be able to take place at all.
I would be obliged if you could say something about this.
I then have a very specific question. There was also disquiet in Hungary about the critical judgment passed on the 'status law' on Hungarians in other countries.
This law was adopted by 95% of the Hungarian Parliament, and a commission of the European Council, the so-called Venice Commission, explicitly stated that this law was acceptable.
One last question: How do you see the overcoming of the past with reference to some EU countries today?
I am thinking of the Benes decrees and of the acquisition of land in Poland, for example.
Can you say something more about that?
Can we take as our starting point statements which, if these countries join the European Union, will make it possible for them to have a future with a clear record, which we of course very much want?
We want the 2004 deadline to be adhered to, so that these peoples can take part in the next European elections.
Mr President, I would like to clarify the issue of Poland, at last, because the situation is incredible: in Poland they are saying that we favour the smaller States while the smaller States say we favour Poland.
Well then, we need to make it clear once and for all that good progress is being made, and by 'good progress' we mean good progress for Poland as well.
This country has made excellent progress, and so there is no need to put Poland in a different category from the others.
I feel, or rather I must express my utmost satisfaction at the fact that, looking back at the rate of progress, it is apparent that Poland has displayed remarkable energy and ability in this race, on this journey towards enlargement, towards accession.
I can therefore find no reason to differentiate between Poland and Hungary or between Hungary and Poland.
Sir, neither the President of the Commission nor I myself have held any press conference.
We abide fully by what we agreed.
It is for that reason that the press conference is to take place at 6 p.m., after Parliament has been informed.
I regularly talk to journalists, as you well know.
There was, though, no press conference, and that is an important distinction.
As far as the Hungarian law on status is concerned, we notified the Hungarian government of problems with this law from the point of view of the acquis communautaire even before the law was enacted.
These problems were then taken into legislative account, so that we have no problems with Community law.
My estimation of the Venice Commission differs from your own.
The Venice Commission ruled that whether the Hungarian Status Law is contrary to international law or not is dependent on the way it is implemented.
We have therefore had discussions for some time with the Hungarian government and with the governments of neighbouring countries in order to ensure that Hungary's neighbours are involved in finding a way of implementing it on which they can all agree.
The Hungarian government is thankfully endeavouring to bring this about, and the Romanian and Slovak governments are also ready to play their part.
The Benes decrees have not to date been the subject of negotiations, since property issues, as you well know, are not covered by Community law.
As regards the acquisition of land, I expect something to happen very quickly in the relevant negotiations with Poland.
During my visit to Warsaw last week, the Polish government announced that it would be taking a flexible approach to this issue.
Mr Verheugen, no press conference has been held but the press already has your text.
I think that is the cause of this confusion.
Madam President, I would like to put three short questions.
The first is to Mr Verheugen: You have announced that there will be additional resources or an additional programme for modernising and adapting administration.
I would be interested to know whether these are financial resources deducted from other programmes for these countries on an anticipatory basis.
Perhaps you could define that a bit more exactly.
My second is this: Commissioner, the Court of Auditors' report that we discussed today criticises the Commission for the absence of definite criteria in its programmes to reinforce atomic power stations, that is, to increase the safety of their reactors.
Are you prepared to consider the possibility that the Commission is not drawing up any criteria, that is to say, any general criteria, but only criteria for checking reactor safety improvement measures, carried out with the support of Commission resources?
My third question, concerning Cyprus and Turkey, has already been briefly alluded to.
The Turkish Prime Minister has just made statements in what may be a new form, to the effect that, if it came to it, the northern part of Cyprus might be annexed.
Does the Commission have a clear, official and unambiguous answer to this?
Madam President, I will answer the honourable gentleman's questions as follows.
Firstly, resources for the additional measures to improve implementation are being taken from the Phare budget, so additional resources are not being drawn on, nor are resources being transferred.
This is, rather, a change of priorities in Phare's programming, something of which, by the way, I informed Parliament some time ago.
We had also said that we were ready to adjust priorities in view of the fallout from 11 September, if it were a question of meeting stricter conditions in internal and legal policy, police cooperation and the securing of our external frontiers.
As you know, the Commission has no authority in matters of reactor safety.
I do not know what the Court of Auditors is referring to in this instance; it may be to the work of the Council working party on nuclear energy issues, which, however, is not a Commission office.
The Commission is in no way responsible and is not involved in any steps to improve nuclear safety in candidate countries.
All the Commission does is to negotiate the required decommissioning of the reactors, regarded by the Member States as incapable of being retrofitted, with the relevant countries such as Lithuania, Bulgaria and Slovakia and then go on to implement such decommissioning.
This has to a large degree been completed, as you know.
We still await a final closure date for Ignalina II in Lithuania and an offer of finance for this, still outstanding, is expected in the near future.
Apart from that, we in the Commission have nothing to do with the construction of further nuclear power stations in Central and Eastern European countries.
I must say quite frankly that this is the first time I have heard of this criticism by the Court of Auditors.
I would myself be very grateful, and I imagine the President would be too, if the Commission were to have responsibility for nuclear safety standards.
I must, though, tell you that the Member States, and you as an Austrian Member will know how watchful the Member States are in the Melk process in which the Commission is mediating between Austria and the Czech Republic, determinedly refuse to let the Commission create conditions that would lead to the rise of European Community law on reactor safety standards.
I am, though, quite happy to come back to this subject when I have been informed about this report by the Court of Auditors.
As regards the Turkish Prime Minister's statement, what Mr Ecevit has said is nothing new to me; I have heard it in many conversations with him and read it in articles by him for over a year.
Our response is quite clear.
If, first condition, no political reunification of Cyprus is achieved; if, second presupposition, the Member States decide, and Parliament agrees, that Cyprus should be admitted in any case; and if, thirdly, Turkey were then to react in that way - all hypothetical questions at present - if, though, that were to happen, it would result in probably the worst crisis ever in relations between Turkey and the European Union.
I do not at present see how we could quickly extricate ourselves from such a crisis.
Madam President, I should like to return to the question of what used to be called the Madrid criterion, the question of implementation capacity.
How will the institutions in general, in particular the Member States, judge, and by what criteria will they judge, whether the applicants have arrived at the happy state of having an implementation capacity?
I share and salute the headline goal, but I wonder what is its measurable content?
The problem is that in Parliament we have not had the opportunity yet to read all these contrary reports which have been adopted.
But given the comments that the Commissioner has just made about Turkey, could he characterise - because we have not yet had the chance to study it - the political mood of the Turkey report?
I hope it is a report which gives sufficient and due recognition to serious attempts at change.
There are serious deficiencies which remain, but engagement with Turkey in the light of the earlier comments is an even more profound necessity in the near future than it has been in the recent past.
I am obliged to the honourable Member.
The monitoring of progress in the capacity to implement is a standard procedure that we have developed over a considerable time.
We simply observe what legislation was taken over, and whether adequate material and human resources were available to make this legislation a reality.
It goes without saying that we also observe whether it actually works in practice.
This monitoring is going on constantly.
The information required for it comes to us from the most diverse sources, not only from our own, but also, for example, information is used which comes to us from Parliament.
We have a system that puts us in a position to say at any time to any given country how far we have got with their capacity to implement.
This procedure has been well established and has proved its worth.
As regards Turkey, I can tell the honourable gentleman that the current picture presents varied aspects.
There are positive things in it.
One is no doubt that the Accession Partnership is now working in all its aspects.
All its elements are present and are being kept to.
In this respect, relations between us and Turkey were never before as close as they are now.
Another positive element is no doubt the remarkable progress being made in constitutional reform and also in legislative matters, towards democratisation and respect for human rights.
This is surely still dependent on the extent to which these constitutional changes and legislation are actually experienced in the country's day-to-day reality.
There has been no progress in the economic sphere.
So much is well known.
There has been remarkable progress in conforming to the acquis.
That is the good I have to report.
On the negative side, I have to say that, as already stated, the human rights situation is still unsatisfactory.
I must say that I had expected more from Turkey by way of cooperation in resolving the Cyprus issue.
We have already discussed this in another context.
I am also disappointed by Turkey's conduct as regards the issue of European security and defence policy.
I do not find it appropriate for a country desirous of being a member of the European Union to hinder the European Union from making progress with a significant aspect of integration.
This is, in my view, not the sort of behaviour that we should expect of a candidate country.
Commissioner, there are agreements between some of the candidate countries, such as the customs union agreement between the Czech Republic and Slovakia, rather than the Visegrad agreement, which could render the situation rather more complex should only one of the two countries join the Union, for example, if the Czech Republic were to join but not Slovakia or vice versa.
Now, as has rightly been said, all the countries have to respect all the necessary parameters and criteria.
Should this situation arise, what line should we take?
Secondly, with regard to countries such as Croatia, countries which are not yet candidates, that is, although they have made considerable progress towards applying for and achieving the status of candidate countries, what is the current situation?
Lastly, we have touched on the issue of Cyprus, with regard to which you said that were we to be faced with a reaction such as that threatened by the Turkish Prime Minister, there would be a very serious crisis.
My feeling is that, in this regard, we are proceeding almost without any safety net at all, for such a reaction would involve the annexing of part of the territory of the European Union.
It may be that we should safeguard ourselves against such an eventuality and allow ourselves a moment' s reflection before coming up against this situation, which I feel is so very sensitive.
Madam President, I would like to say, in response to the honourable gentleman's first question, that free trade agreements between candidate countries and third countries should of course cease before accession, but it goes without saying that they cannot continue to be valid after it.
Free trade agreements between two candidate countries would in fact create problems if these countries were then to accede at different times.
I must say, though, that the problem is a very limited one, as the countries you have mentioned are covered by the Europe Agreements, which already provide for quite wide-ranging liberalisation of trade in goods, and also of the traffic in services and other economic relations, so that a European solution can be found for this problem should it eventually arise.
I do not, though, think it likely that it will.
The question about Croatia is outside my remit; I would have to ask the President to say something about it.
I would add, speaking of Cyprus, that I clearly stated that you were putting hypothetical questions.
I do not as a rule like answering hypothetical questions, but you were entitled to an assessment of the situation.
I did also say, though, that the Commission has not changed the clear line it has taken, that we must do everything, yes everything, to achieve a political solution to the conflict before accession negotiations are completed.
I have repeatedly appealed to all parties and must again say clearly that it is in the particular interest of the Turkish Cypriot community that a political solution be found before the accessions take place, as nobody will profit as much as the Turkish Cypriot community from Cyprus' membership of the European Union.
For that reason, any policy that bars access to the European Union to the Turkish Cypriot community in Cyprus is a policy which directly, clearly and unambiguously works against the interests of the people there.
As you will remember, Mr PodestÃ , the very week after the political changeover and the establishment of a situation of recognised democracy in the country, I lost no time in going to Croatia to instigate relations of cooperation, which are currently progressing very well.
In recent weeks, we have had an official meeting with the Croatian Prime Minister and we have continued along that path: we are genuinely encouraging Croatia in all its efforts to establish a closer relationship with the European Union.
Clearly, the tragedy of war and its repercussions on the country' s economy are still very deeply felt and mean that things will take time, but we are actively doing everything we can to speed up the process.
Madam President, I have three questions.
I would first like to say that I find it a very good thing that the Commission is at last turning its mind to supporting the strengthening of administration.
But my question is whether it is also going to look at the need for administration to really involve the citizens, so that things that go without saying, here in the European Union, are also put into practice there?
My second question concerns the action plan and finance.
If you are allocating more resources from the Phare programme for the support of the institutions, does that then mean that resources are being removed from the other important area of social and economic cohesion, in other words that we are no longer supporting the halting of increasing social decay, which is a core problem in these countries, even though it is urgently necessary?
My last question concerns a point which the report does not mention at all. Does the Commission intend to encourage the Council to publish a European programme for the Roma people, something which is in my view urgently required?
In almost all countries at present, the Roma minority's human and democratic rights are being violated as much as they have been in the past.
This can clearly not be resolved by these accession candidates on an individual basis; it is a European issue that must be dealt with by a European programme.
Madam, it goes without saying that the degree of citizen participation that is normative in the European Union is also required of the candidate countries, and is a component factor both in the monitoring they receive and in the support they are given.
Secondly, the resources about which Mr Swoboda has already asked are not taken from the country-specific programmes, but are multi-country programmes, which relate to all countries and which, if you want to put it that way, are kept in the central reserve.
No one country therefore receives one single euro less from the projects which have been discussed up to now.
The burden is not therefore borne by other projects.
On the subject of a European Roma project: this has not yet in fact been included in the Commission's proposals.
Discussion of the subject is already in progress in some of the candidate countries, which are saying that this is a European problem and must therefore be dealt with by a European Community programme.
As far as I am aware, this approach is not shared by most of the Member countries.
In any case, a specific European Roma programme would require significant material resources.
I have to answer your question by saying that the Commission has not as yet made such a proposal, but is concentrating on helping the candidate countries with the implementation of their national strategies to integrate the Roma.
Perhaps I should point out that we have very strict requirements on this point and demand of all the candidate countries with a Roma population that they present and implement a medium-term strategy towards the social integration of the Roma and the removal of social discrimination.
As you know, we are giving these programmes very substantial support by means of pre-accession instruments.
Madam President, Commissioner, you said that you had not held a press conference.
That appears to be the case, but can you confirm that you held a press briefing this morning, while the groups' press conferences were going on?
Secondly, should this question be answered in the affirmative, I would very much like to ask the President of the Commission whether he thinks that press briefings of this sort are conducive to cooperation between Parliament and the Commission, when we should be the first to be informed.
Madam President, I can tell the honourable gentleman that there was no briefing either; on the contrary, I have conversations with the press every day, background discussions with many different journalists.
Such a conversation took place today, but it was not a briefing.
It was a background discussion, which was not intended for publication.
I think you will agree that it is a fairly subtle distinction, Mr Verheugen.
Madam President, Mr Swoboda's question on reactor safety raised the question in my mind of whether the Commission can make it clear not only to its own bureaux, but also to the Member States and their governments, and certainly also to the European Parliament, that we cannot, in negotiations, demand more from the candidates for accession that we ourselves comply with as Member States of the European Union.
I believe that this is not quite clear to all areas of all our institutions.
Perhaps it should again be highlighted in the coming year.
The second question I would like to put is this.
In your report, you are very optimistic that ten countries will have the chance to sign the Accession Treaty at the end of next year.
As you have expressed it, but I believe it needs to be expressed even more clearly: that is the assessment of today.
This means that, if countries fall behind next year because of poor performance on the political front, the list could well comprise fewer than ten, so that great individual efforts will be necessary and today's judgment will offer no security.
To this will, of course, be added the issues of implementation and of administrative capacity.
Your paper points out that work will be being done on implementation even after the Treaty is signed.
What certainty will there be, though, on the day the Treaty is signed, that administrative capacity will actually be in place when accession becomes effective?
Madam President, the honourable gentleman's first question can be answered only with great difficulty.
I sometimes feel that at one point or another we are demanding of the candidate countries something that the Member States are not doing themselves.
This, though, has to do with the criteria we have and our obligation to report very precisely on the extent to which they are complied with - or not, as the case may be.
Today, I said to the Commission, and on the same subject, that we must always imagine what progress reports would look like if the same criteria were applied to the Member States.
The Member States would never allow us to do any such thing, but so much of what we criticise in candidate countries or describe as incompatible with the Copenhagen criteria, could, perhaps, also be found in one Member State or another.
So, at this point, I recommend modesty to our Member States.
Nothing more can, of course, be demanded in the negotiations themselves than is required of the Member States.
The negotiations are very precisely attuned to the acquis and to nothing else.
They touch on nothing else.
The problem you have described can therefore only arise when considering the question of whether candidate countries comply with the indeed very vaguely formulated political or economic accession criteria.
My answer is that it may be that we are sometimes asking for more.
As regards the other question of the ten countries, the Commission said today in fact, that we must prepare for the accession of all those which have complied with the conditions and completed negotiations by the end of 2002.
This represents rejection of the idea of forming what might be termed political groups, and is, in the Commission's judgment, the correct interpretation of the Helsinki and Gothenburg Decisions.
It was stated in Helsinki that all countries that had been invited to negotiate should have a chance to conclude, which can only mean that it was considered that their accessions could be simultaneous with those of the countries which had been negotiating since Luxembourg, and Gothenburg envisaged the first accessions taking place before 2004.
It necessarily follows from this that we must prepare for the accession of up to ten countries, I will not say ten, but up to ten, because ten countries have set themselves the goal of completing negotiations by 2002.
Whether it will actually come to that, I do not know.
The Commission will produce its concluding opinion next year, and will do so in strict accordance with the principles and rules that it itself has proposed.
As I said here in Parliament during the most recent discussion on enlargement, it is a subject on which we cannot let ourselves make political decisions as it were in the worst or narrowest sense of the word, that is, saying on the basis of purely political considerations that one country is coming in and another is not.
Such a decision must much rather be founded on compliance with the criteria and on the outcome of the negotiations.
The Commission's proposal will be couched in those terms.
None of the ten countries that currently believe they will manage it can evade the possibility of us saying at the end of the day: this country is not ready.
Let me say it clearly: none of them.
Madam President, Commissioner, I have just been listening to what you have been saying about the enlargement of the EU.
I have heard a lot about the shortcomings of Turkey, about constitutional changes, the democratisation process and human rights.
My question is, what is there in the accession partnership document about the rights of the Kurds?
What is the situation with regard to the rights of 25 million people who have not been mentioned in this discussion?
I ask you, Commissioner, to tell us how the rights of the Kurds are affected and how you assess the political situation in Turkey as regards constitutional changes and the Kurdish question.
Madam, I regret to have to tell you that the accession partnership with Turkey was not the subject of today's discussions.
Today we in fact discussed and adopted twelve accession partnerships, but not the accession partnership with Turkey, and that because it entered into force only in the early part of this year, and updating it after only a few months would make no sense.
We will therefore be proposing the updating of the accession partnership with Turkey only next year and will produce the assessment you have asked for in that context.
Madam President, I actually have one question for Commissioner Verheugen.
Not so long ago, he announced, with our blessing, the launch of a large information campaign both within the European Union and in the candidate countries, highlighting the advantages of the EU' s enlargement.
How does he explain in that light and in the context of the activities carried out, that the support for enlargement, both in the EU and in the candidate countries, is declining despite this effort?
What does the Commission intend to do about this?
Sir, for a start I cannot see that support for enlargement is decreasing either in candidate countries or in Member States.
The figures with which I am acquainted indicate the precise opposite.
Quite apart from that, public opinion on the subject is, if I may say so, extraordinarily fickle.
It evidently very much depends on who is asking, what is being asked, and when.
In this way, you can obtain quite different results in the same country at the same time.
I know all the surveys that are being done, and my analysis is that we must not work on the assumption that we are dealing with dwindling support.
Secondly, as regards communications strategy, the European Parliament, and you as a Member of it will be aware of this, has considered it right, for reasons it has made known to us, to make the funds available relatively late in the day, only, in fact, in the course of this year.
The truth is that all the measures could be put in motion only after the summer recess.
You cannot expect that I should be able to supply you with some sort of report on the results of a campaign that started only eight weeks ago.
I must make it clear that this is outside the Commission's remit.
The Commission made its proposal on the implementation of a communication strategy in April 2000, therefore only a few months after we took office.
That it took so long for this strategy to become reality in the European institutions is in this instance regrettable.
I do not believe, though, that it is too late, because only now that the results of negotiations are becoming evident is it right and necessary to fully apply this strategy.
This strategy is in no way about indoctrinating people or, as you have suggested, convincing them of advantages, but about giving them an objective basis on which to form their own opinions and judgments.
The Commission would indeed not be permitted to do more.
That concludes this item of the agenda. I would like to thank Commissioner Verheugen and President Prodi.
Madam President, on a point of order.
This was advertised as a "catch the eye of the President" session, open to all Members of Parliament.
In fact it has been nothing more than a private meeting of Parliament's Bureau.
Group leaders have been invited to speak, Mr Poettering was invited to speak twice and the groups have been asked to put forward speakers.
It has not been an open debate and I really do not know why the rest of us turn up if you are going to conduct business this way.
This is not in the interests of Parliament.
I must protest at the way in which you have conducted this matter.
Mr Titley, I quite understand that Members whose names have not been called feel somewhat frustrated.
Having said this, I would remind you that this was a question and answer session.
It is true that some Members far exceeded their allotted speaking time.
Should I have cut them off because of that?
You are well aware that that is not my way of doing things.
I am sure you will also understand that I naturally had to give precedence to the rapporteurs, to those who have worked as rapporteurs on this subject.
I would also point out, for your information, that a number of rapporteurs were unfortunately unable to take the floor, including three from the European People' s Party: Mrs Carlsson, Mrs Stenzel and Mr Van Orden, not to mention Mr Haarder and Mr Beazley.
So you see, Mr Titley, how difficult this was to manage.
I think that Parliament should make a decision, but it should be aware that if the question and answer session overruns, and I would gladly have extended it by a good half-hour, as I think the subject deserved it, the time devoted to questions to the Commission may have to be reduced.
You can imagine the reaction of your fellow Members who, as you know, are extremely anxious that the time allocated to questions to the Commission be scrupulously observed.
You know that, when this is not the case, those Members call us to task and they are quite right to do so.
I have tried to act for the best.
If I was wrong, I apologise.
Mr President, on a point of order.
Following Mr Titley's observation, I would simply say that this is a most important question.
I am sure those who were not able to speak were very pleased to hear the Commissioner's comments.
I will submit my questions to him in writing.
I should like to point out that four of our colleagues here today asked three questions.
If the President, and indeed colleagues, would limit themselves to one question, by my mathematics nine further speakers might have been called.
We take note of these comments, which are inevitable, furthermore, given the lack of time.
Question Time (Commission)
The next item is Questions to the Commission (B5-0338/2001).
Part I
Question No 28 by (H-0857/01):
Subject: Afghanistan and drugs According to the latest annual report of the United Nations International Drug Control Programme, opium production in Afghanistan has fallen strikingly as a result of the Taliban's prohibition policy.
From being the world's leading exporter, the country now accounts for only 10% of world trade in opium.
The events of 11 September have also contributed to the disruption of farming, including the cultivation of opium.
In the light of this situation and the desperate plight of the population, what practical initiatives can the Commission take, particularly through its participation in the UN anti-drug programme, to provide relief and aid to the communities affected, and to dissuade producers from reverting to opium growing or selling the stocks that they still have?
Mr President, the Commission shares the honourable Member' s desire to provide adequate support for the Afghan people, of whose difficult situation we are all well aware.
The significant assistance which the Community had been giving to the Afghan population has increased recently.
The Community finances actions in the following areas: emergency aid, aid to displaced persons, aid for food safety, human rights and landmines.
The assistance is implemented speedily through a wide network of non-governmental organisations.
In this way, we contribute to reducing the dependence on poppy cultivation of the people who receive this aid.
The food safety programme is of particular importance, since it provides seeds, tools and all the necessary elements for alternative crops.
Obviously, no donor has been able to offer assistance in the field of compliance with the law in order to combat drug trafficking in Afghanistan, owing to the government of that country.
However, the Commission has supported programmes in this sector, in countries which play an essential role in the heroin trafficking routes towards the European Union, such as the States of Central Asia: Iran, Armenia, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Russia, the Ukraine, Moldavia, Belarus, Bulgaria and Rumania.
It is still unknown whether, given the current changing situation, the significant reduction in poppy cultivation observed by the UNIDCP 2000/2001 will continue and, furthermore, according to the United Nations, the trafficking in refined heroin from Afghanistan does not appear to be diminishing.
According to the estimates of this United Nations body, the stocks accumulated before the crisis would keep the European market supplied for the next three to four years.
Thank you, Commissioner, for the information which you have given us.
However, I should like to ask if the immediate intention is for the European Commission programme to deal with this problem, on its own or through UN programmes, within the framework of the reconstruction of Afghanistan and assistance to neighbouring countries.
As you know, Commissioner, the European Commission is spending a great deal of money on public awareness campaigns and the European Drugs Monitoring Centre.
If we want to be sincere and efficient, we need to take more direct and effective action at the root of the evil, such as in Afghanistan.
I share the honourable Member' s concern but, as I have said, the reality is that the United Nations' Cooperation and Development Plan for Afghanistan has not been able to deal with ensuring compliance with the law, owing to the Taliban government which is still in Afghanistan.
I hope that, once things have changed in Afghanistan, as we all wish, and a government is in place which fulfils the minimum requirements in terms of respect for human rights, combating drug trafficking and other similar issues, we will be able to deal with issues such as the real application and the real effectiveness of this aid, which, I insist, currently has to be channelled through non-governmental organisations such as the UNHCR or the Red Cross, which are the usual channels of aid in these cases.
Because it is clear that the aid, which has been interrupted since 11 September for obvious reasons, is going to be renewed as soon as possible.
And I hope that on this occasion it is not restricted solely to funding and supported activity in the rural field, in the alternative crop sector, but that it also allows us to cooperate and maintain greater supervision of the real effectiveness of the authorities in their fight against this type of crop.
Question No 29 by (H-0849/01):
Subject: Threat to nuclear facilities in the aftermath of 11 September Will the Commission establish the appropriate institutional instruments to prepare, within six months, a thorough analysis of a range of options for reducing the threat posed by deliberately crashing aircraft and other acts of malice at nuclear facilities, including the prospective benefits of transferring spent fuel to dry storage facilities that are robust against acts of malice, and suspending reprocessing until stocks of liquid high-level radioactive waste have been vitrified or otherwise used as part of an immobilisation programme for surplus plutonium?
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the physical and operative security of nuclear installations falls within national competence, provided that compliance with the provisions of the Euratom Treaty is guaranteed.
Each State of the Union is carrying out its own analysis of the situation in the light of the terrorist attacks of 11 September and, in this regard, they will adopt the necessary additional measures to increase the physical protection of nuclear installations and the materials which are used or stored in them.
We hope that all the existing options are analysed in detail.
For obvious security reasons, many of the details relating to these additional measures cannot be made public.
On the other hand, it is clear that the best way to reduce the threat posed to nuclear installations, or any other installation, by the possibility of terrorists deliberately crashing an aircraft into them, is to make it impossible, or extremely improbable, that they may hijack a large commercial aircraft in the first place.
In this regard, the Commission would like to remind you of the measures it proposed on 10 October for the adoption and application of common European Union rules in the field of civil aviation security, and which was first presented at the last Council of Transport Ministers.
These measures are intended to deal with this point.
Commissioner, I find that answer extraordinarily complacent.
We all know that nuclear power plants were not designed to withstand collisions with large aircraft, particularly jumbo jets.
You say that it is not that easy to hi-jack an airplane.
Only yesterday there was another terrible accident in New York.
I hope it was an accident and not an act of terror: at this point in time it is not entirely clear.
Let us all pray that it was merely an accident and not something that was designed to kill all the people on board.
I am sure we all sympathise with the families.
This is a very serious matter.
All I am asking is, will the Commission prepare an analysis?
Surely you can say "yes" to that and not just pass it off as the responsibility of the Member States.
You have powers under Articles 34 and 35 of the Euratom Treaty.
According to a recent European Parliament study you are not exercising your powers under those articles.
Could you please comment on that aspect of my question.
Have you looked at that study?
Have you looked at your powers, and can you at least prepare some kind of an analysis?
I am not asking you to disclose the discussions you are having with the Member States.
Clearly, that may be inappropriate.
But can you not do something?
Mr President, Commissioner, the safety of nuclear installations is a problem for the whole of Europe and primarily an environmental issue.
Safety is, in the final analysis, a European added value.
Could you consider encouraging the preparation of a Green Paper on the safety of reactors or nuclear installations, so that in future a relatively objective assessment of the subject may be guaranteed?
Mr President, according to the Euratom Treaty, security is the national competence of each Member State.
However, at the moment the WENRA, where all the regulators of the different Member States of the European Union meet, is working to find equivalent security standards which, in my opinion (which is shared by the services, although it is not an official position of the Commission, and I am therefore speaking personally), are necessary and beneficial for all: for the States which have chosen the non-nuclear option, but also for everyone else, since I believe, like you, that if there is an accident in a nuclear power station, the repercussions will transcend administrative borders and the problem is pan-European or even global.
We must therefore support the Vienna Commission, which depends on the United Nations.
These equivalent security standards should therefore be established, with a degree of obligation which is similar to that demanded in the Community, which would offer greater safeguards for the whole world.
Our analyses are based on the situation and, if it is necessary to propose a modification to the Treaty, we would have to consider doing so.
I have a supplementary question to Mrs Ahern's question.
Is the recent decision giving the go-ahead to the MOX plant at Sellafield not unacceptable?
Is this not a violation of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea?
We have been raising the Sellafield issue here for many years.
I would like to ask what your position is with regard to the UN conventions?
Do you believe in upholding them?
Do you consider that the authorities responsible for Sellafield have a duty to consult Ireland in this decision?
Do you consider that even at this stage a full European-backed environmental impact assessment should be carried out?
Mr Fitzsimons, I feel obliged to tell you that you have taken it upon yourself to bring forward Question No 62.
I frankly do not believe that this obeys the Rules of Procedure.
We had said goodbye to the Vice-President for today.
Thank you for your attention.
Question No 30 by (H-0839/01):
Subject: Serious unwanted side effects following the consumption of energy drinks in the European Union In several Member States of the European Union (including Ireland and Sweden) a number of serious cases have been recorded in which the consumption of energy drinks such as Red Bull has led to unwanted side effects and, in a number of cases, proved fatal.
These drinks, when consumed in combination with alcohol or coffee or after vigorous physical exercise, cause complications chiefly manifested in the central nervous system.
Moreover, such beverages are freely available in places such as schools, gymnasiums and discotheques.
What steps will be taken following the deliberations of the 84th meeting of the Standing Committee on Food at which the Member State representatives expressed deep concern?
Is it acceptable to treat as a normal beverage a product whose consumption is restricted in respect of so many sectors of the population (including children, pregnant women, mothers who are breast feeding, the elderly and those suffering from high blood pressure) and which is subject to general restrictions to the effect that it should not be mixed with alcohol or coffee or taken after intense physical exercise?
What procedures are followed for the approval of such products?
Does the Commission not consider that the above factors are sufficient to justify withdrawal of this product from the market as a precautionary measure until it has been proven that it is not harmful to health?
Part II
Energy drinks were discussed at the 84th meeting of the Standing Committee on Foodstuffs on 19 September 2001.
As noted, two Member States have reported deaths in their countries associated with the consumption of those products.
In neither case, however, was there any evidence that the consumption of energy drinks was the cause of death.
Both Member States have commissioned their own research, investigating the available data on the effect of these drinks on health.
Recently another Member State produced a list of incidents linked to the consumption of such products, but without any substantiating evidence.
None of the Member States concerned took any steps to restrict or prohibit energy drinks in their own territory.
The Standing Committee noted a need for further information on the potential effects on health of ingredients in the products and the Scientific Committee for Food is examining data submitted by a manufacturer of such products regarding the safety of one of the products in question.
According to information, further studies are nearing completion.
At the above mentioned meeting of the Standing Committee on Foodstuffs, the Commission repeated its request to Member States to submit information on the safety of products on their markets.
The Commission understands the concerns that have been expressed and it therefore intends to work with Member States to look at the issue in depth and identify the appropriate course of action to ensure a high level of protection for consumers.
So-called energy drinks are not covered by any specific legislation and are not subject to an approval procedure at Community level.
In the absence of Community legislation, Member States may apply national rules without prejudice, of course, to the provisions of the Treaty.
Overall, Member States should ensure that products placed on their markets are safe.
Thank you for your reply, Commissioner.
However, you must allow me to couple my thanks with my disappointment at the tenet of your reply.
Commissioner, as you know full well, we are talking about a public health issue here and I should like to remind you that, in cases such as these, we do not need proof, we just need an indication, especially when we are talking about the public health of young people, and it is young people who are consuming these energy drinks.
To give you a specific example, in Greece there have been five cases in which people presented symptoms which related directly to the three active ingredients in these drinks.
I should like to ask you to repeat, because this has happened in the past and Community legislation subsequently prohibited Greece from banning this substance, if these drinks could in fact be banned at national level, because the committee responsible in my country has objected to my initiative on the basis of the principles of internal trade.
It is the responsibility of Member States to initiate action if they have evidence of harm due to the consumption of a particular foodstuff.
The Commission can take temporary safeguard measures if it becomes aware of a serious risk from a product to the health and safety of consumers.
Once the Commission is informed of action by a Member State, then the need for action on a Community-wide basis can be assessed.
However, the Commission is not aware of action being initiated by any Member State.
In fact the two Member States that have reported deaths associated with consumption of energy drinks have stated that there is no evidence of the association and they have instigated their own investigations into the effect of such products on health.
The Commission has sought the cooperation of Member States in looking at this issue in depth and identifying the appropriate course of action.
I should like to thank Mrs Malliori for raising this issue and add to what she has said.
May I ask the Commissioner specifically about how these energy drinks are marketed in combination with alcoholic products.
For example, a growing trend, certainly in Scotland, has been the combination of the product Red Bull with vodka, which is exceedingly dangerous.
This is of great concern to me, since Scotland has one of the highest rates of under-age drinking, that is to say drinking by 15 year olds and under, in the European Union.
Could the Commissioner tell me whether the Standing Committee on Foodstuffs discussed the combination of energy drinks with alcoholic products and, if so, what research did it propose and what information did it think was needed?
I understand the concerns of the honourable Member.
I also have three children.
I know what is being consumed, mostly by young boys, so I understand her concern.
The Scientific Committee is also concerned.
It has noted that the possible interaction of the constituents of energy drinks has not been well studied, and considers that the possible interactions between caffeine, taurine and alcohol in humans may warrant investigation, particularly under conditions of exercise and consequent dehydration through sweating.
In the light of the advice from the Scientific Committee the Commission is holding discussions with Member States, with a view to ensuring that a draft Commission directive that includes specific labelling rules on caffeine in ready-to-eat foods is put into place.
Questions to Commissioner Reding
Question No 31 by (H-0772/01):
Subject: Ban on advertising directed at children In my question H-0663/01to the Council, I asked whether the Belgian Presidency intended to make the rules protecting children from television advertising more stringent and to support the position of the Swedish Presidency for a full ban.
The Council, however, replied that, in the absence of any proposal from the Commission, whether in the form of a specific proposal or of a point for inclusion in the revision of the 'Television without frontiers' directive scheduled for 2002, it was unable to consider the matter.
Will the Commission say what stage has been reached in its deliberations on this subject?
Mr President, as you are aware, the 'Television without frontiers' directive lays down the legal framework for television broadcasting in the European Union.
This directive contains provisions on the protection of minors, in particular Article 16, which lays down a number of rules with regard to advertising and minors.
The Commission undertook to carry out a study on the impact of television advertising and teleshopping on minors; this study was conducted by an independent advisor and has been published on the Commission website.
Moreover, the Commission will supplement its assessment of the chapter on advertising within the framework of its re-examination of the 2002 directive.
As Mr Papayannakis is doubtless aware, the consultation of professionals with regard to the revision of this directive began in 2001.
Their conclusions will be published at the beginning of 2002, after which the political discussion will commence.
We have also begun three studies, one of which will specifically examine the development of new advertising techniques.
If we intend to revise the directive, we should look to the future, and not restrict ourselves to analysing the past or the present.
Therefore, as you can see, Mr President, the Commission is approaching this issue with a completely open mind, taking extensive advice, and only after listening, analysing and discussing the issue with Parliament, of course, as well as others, will the Commission submit any proposals with a view to revising the directive.
My question was slightly more coercive, he said jokingly.
I asked you to tell me what your current thinking is in the Commission.
Whenever I ask the Council of Ministers, they tell me they are waiting to see what the Commission has to say.
Someone needs to tell us exactly what stage we have reached so that we can prepare our response to your future plans.
I would remind the Commissioner that the Swedish Presidency, and perhaps you can confirm this, was in favour of a complete ban on advertising directed at children.
This provoked me, if you like, into tabling a supplementary question and it is on this that I should like you to comment, as the Commissioner at the present stage.
Unfortunately, I cannot say any more for the moment about the state of progress.
I am currently organising consultations with professionals, which will come to an end this year.
I shall then consult the politicians, and at the end of this series of consultations I shall make specific proposals.
I refuse to put the cart before the horse by making proposals first and only then taking advice.
No. First of all, I want to take advice, listen, and then make proposals.
I can tell you my own personal opinion: I have made it quite clear that I do not think a total ban on certain types of advertising would be effective unless the experience of other countries, in particular, shows that such a ban is indispensable for the achievement of an objective of legitimate general interest.
I asked the Swedish Presidency very clearly not to attempt to adopt this approach, as I knew that, at this stage, I would have to say no.
I have said no, I am taking advice, listening. I know that the Swedish government, which, for its own reasons, has banned advertising on its territory, is moving in that direction.
I also know that the majority of Member States are not moving in that direction.
I would like to ask the Commissioner whether she shares with me a concern that, in Sweden, because television advertising aimed at children is not allowed, there is a noticeable lack of programmes being produced specifically for children in Sweden.
Can she assure me that, in the study which she talked about - and I am delighted that she said it was going to be an open-minded study - this aspect will be fully considered and that, as there will be an explosion of television channels and television choice in future, she will look thoroughly at the possible impact of advertising on the generation of funds to produce high-quality programmes for children?
Mr President, my work has always had a dual nature.
My first task concerns the application of the decisions made by the 'Television without frontiers' directive.
For example, Article 16 restricts advertising aimed at children, as minors must be protected.
Obviously, we cannot do just anything in programmes intended for children.
However, I would like Parliament to help me out a bit, for example with regard to this point.
Can we make just any old film for children?
What sometimes shocks me just as much as certain adverts is the violence in films specifically intended for children.
We are analysing all that in order to find, together, the most effective way of making progress in this matter.
From the point of view of digital television, which will enable hundreds of programmes, including children' s programmes, to be broadcast, I would like us, in Europe, to have a high enough budget, sufficient investments to produce good children' s programmes.
This is my second task: ensuring that, in future, we have enough children' s films suitable for that age, films that are positive and are both educational and imaginative.
This question interests me very much and is quite appropriate in the middle of November, in the run-up to Christmas.
Many parents would be very supportive of Mr Papayannakis' question.
I would like to ask the Commissioner what comparisons have been made of the different advertising used in different countries at this time of year?
I would like to hear her opinion on the fact that, certainly in my own country, this advertising begins just after August, well before the immediate run-up to Christmas and can be very aggressive.
What kind of measures can you suggest be put in place to protect minors from this aggressive advertising?
It should be pointed out that the regulations applicable to television are completely different from those concerning the other media.
Television, therefore, is often subject to far more stringent regulations than those applicable to the other media, which are not always subject to specific rules concerning minors.
Thus, if you go into a supermarket with a child, for example, the child is swamped by unchannelled, uncontrolled advertising that is very different from televised advertising, which is actually regulated.
Many differences may be noted at Member State level as well, ranging from the age limits set, which differ significantly from one country to another, to the specific provisions governing certain sectors, such as financial activities and drinks advertising.
This proves that the approach adopted by the directive is the most appropriate as it provides a flexible framework within which the Member States have legislated according to their respective culture and traditions.
If Parliament considers that this framework should be changed, it will have the opportunity to say so loud and clear next year, as it will be given the opportunity to voice its opinion during the revision of the directive.
Whatever the case, if we amend the current measures, the amendments must be made within the limits of this directive.
Question No 32 by (H-0776/01):
Subject: World Anti-Doping Agency On 21 August 2001, the EU was represented by Commissioner Reding at the meeting held in Tallinn, to decide on the location of the headquarters of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
Does the Commission think that it might have been possible to avoid what happened in Tallinn?
Was the choice of Montreal the result of the failure of the European candidates to present a united front?
In 1999 the Commission submitted its support plan to combat doping.
Why not transform this plan into a full-blown programme and provide it with the appropriate funding?
As the honourable Member will be aware, the World Anti-Doping Agency decided, on 21 August 2001, to establish its future headquarters in Montreal.
This is a perfectly worthy city, which also offers many advantages.
It must be said that, amongst the candidate cities, there were also perfectly worthy European cities that also offered numerous advantages for hosting the headquarters of this agency.
What happened was that the European countries did not show sufficient coordination and the fact that so many European cities were put forward certainly favoured the choice of Montreal.
I wish to make it quite clear that the Belgian presidency cannot be held responsible for this failure.
It did make considerable efforts to overcome the problems, unfortunately, however, without success.
Europe put forward several candidates, whereas other countries put forward only one, and it was this approach that won the day over the plethora of European candidates.
I must repeat the fact that this issue does not fall within the competence of the Community, but rather within that of the Member States.
We must now apply to the future the lessons we have learned from the Tallinn meeting.
The first lesson should be that of the European Union' s cohesion.
Furthermore, yesterday, the Fifteen' s Ministers for Sport met in Brussels for an informal Council, and cohesion was one of the main items discussed there.
The ministers agreed to join forces and adopt the same approach to combat the scourge that is doping, firstly at world level, in other words, to step up their action within the World Anti-Doping Agency and, secondly, at European level, where there are good grounds for putting a concerted anti-doping programme into action.
There are good grounds because Europe is the most advanced continent in the fight against doping, the greatest number of world-class sporting events takes place here and because Europe has the greatest number of competitions between clubs of different sporting disciplines.
Furthermore, we have the greatest number of accredited laboratories and we must continue to bring our knowledge to bear in the fight against doping at world level.
Yesterday, I informed the ministers that a Community plan is being drafted and they gave me the green light to put this into action.
I shall now begin consultations on the aspects to be included in this action plan and in 2002, we shall have the opportunity to discuss it properly.
I should also like to say that, in order to improve this European cohesion, which must apply not only to the fifteen governments, but must also exist between governments and sports federations, at the beginning of the Spanish presidency, a meeting will be held between the fifteen Ministers for Sports and the European sports federations to decide on the best approach to adopt in order to combat doping.
I would like to thank you, Commissioner, for your reply and your efforts with regard to the funding of the World Anti-Doping Agency.
In recent days, the sports press in our country has reported that there were problems with the funding from the European Commission.
I would like you to clarify whether these problems have been resolved after the meeting of Sports Ministers yesterday in Brussels and whether, if this is not the case, the Commission intends to channel this money towards other means of fighting doping or to stay with the World Anti-Doping Agency.
Mr President, the World Anti-Doping Agency is currently 100% funded, for the duration of a transitional period, by the International Olympic Committee and it has been decided that following this transitional period, 50% of the funds will be provided by the international sports federations and 50% by the governments of the various countries involved.
We have accepted this division.
It appears that of the part falling to national governments, 47.5% will be covered by the European Union.
This is a considerable proportion, but it is also proof of our sporting prowess on this continent.
Having said that, I am sure you are fully aware, Mrs Zabell, that we have interinstitutional rules governing payments made from the budget.
These interinstitutional rules force us to adhere to certain procedures, in order to ensure that taxpayers' money is used scrupulously.
The rules of the World Anti-Doping Agency do not currently match the very strict rules that apply in the European Union.
This is why Europe has asked the WADA to change its internal rules so that there is, first of all, a serious budget, a budget that is forecast over several years.
Secondly, there would need to be an internal rule ensuring that the other continents cannot impose a budget on the European Union but instead that we have a right of veto, and a right to examine proposals.
Thirdly, this 47.5% funding must also be matched by appropriate representation on the WADA' s board of management.
Once these three conditions are met, they will enable us to launch the process of the Council and the European Parliament taking a decision on funding the WADA.
For the moment, and until 3 December, when the World Anti-Doping Agency meets, the ball is in the Agency' s court.
Once the Agency has met the basic conditions enabling us to set the budgetary process in motion, however, the Commission will submit a proposal and the ball will then be in the court of the Member States and Parliament to implement this decision.
In the meantime, with regard to the year 2002 which is rapidly approaching, I would ask governments to shoulder their responsibilities.
They stated very clearly yesterday, in Brussels, that they are willing to do so.
It is therefore, up to the Council of Ministers to arrange these payments for 2002.
We are running a little late.
I would like to remind Members that the more supplementary questions there are, the fewer questions on the list will naturally be asked.
I would like you to bear this in mind.
Mrs Malliori has the floor for a supplementary question.
As you perhaps know, doping substances are traded on the free market so quickly that often, when one substance is detected and banned, a new one has already appeared. The reasons for this are purely bureaucratic, for the simple reason that there are not enough laboratories.
Does the Commission intend to help so that substances can be recognised and banned immediately, thereby reducing the time available for new substances to reach the free market?
The World Anti-doping Agency was created precisely to answer such questions.
This is the body that has the task of drawing up the list of substances that should be banned and the body which governments and sporting bodies must then deal with.
Another point is research.
The Commissioner responsible, Philippe Busquin, and I have decided to open up European research and to put it at the service of the fight against doping, because we know that the inventors of new chemical formulae are often steps ahead of us.
We will, therefore, be making Europe' s research capabilities available to this fight.
Although we are right at the end of Mrs Reding' s time, we are going to ask the following question by Mr Collins.
