The desire to eliminate the languages of nations which are smaller and thereby weaker within the European Union from the list of official languages and from legal communication, including business communication, is extremely detrimental to cultural dialogue.
A particular aversion to the Slavonic languages and cultures can be observed.
Evidence of this can be seen for example in the voting in the European Parliament on the report on the promotion of multilingualism and language learning.
It is often forgotten that languages and traditional culture are the mainstay on which national cultures survive and develop.
There is a chronic lack of funding for protection of this wealth in the European Union.
Funds are however available for large projects and for professional cultural events, whose scope sometimes even extends beyond Europe.
In order to initiate a lasting cultural dialogue, equal opportunities and cultural partnership need to be maintained.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Year of Intercultural Dialogue is intended to help to foster harmony in the multicultural societies of the EU Member States.
I would therefore have expected the proposal to place a major emphasis on involving the citizens in such dialogue.
The way in which the project budget has been structured, however, does not suggest that that is the case.
A total of EURÂ 10Â million has been allocated, and structured on the basis of three types of action, according to level: points A) and B) at Community level together account for around EURÂ 7.5Â million, or 75% of the budget, whereas point C) for actions at national level, provided they offer added European value, will only receive EURÂ 2.5 million.
The sums awarded per State amount to EURÂ 100Â 000, that is to say, only 1% of the project budget will be earmarked for each State.
The way in which the budget of this project has been structured would strongly indicate that the oft-proclaimed and highly ambitious âmain aim of the project, to promote dialogue among all cultures and among everyone living in the European Union,â will be difficult, if not impossible to fulfil.
The reason for this is simple â a lack of financial resources to establish wide-ranging dialogue between people at national and at bilateral and multilateral international levels.
Such contact could contribute most to the development of mutual respect, understanding and admiration on the basis of cultural understanding.
Â Â  . Mr President, first of all I would like to thank you for this debate.
It is rather late, but it is a very important debate.
I think we all agree on the importance of the intercultural dialogue.
I would agree, as usual, that the Commissionâs proposals have been improved by the work of rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs in Parliament and we can be proud of this.
Regarding the budget, even if we were to invest the entire budget that the Community has for this purpose, it would not be enough.
The issue is not about money, it is more about the idea, and we should push for financing for this to come from other sources as well.
It should not be seen that such action is financed only by the Community budget.
We are putting forward as much money as we can afford.
I agree that the amount could be larger, but this is the amount of money set aside for this purpose.
At the same time, once again I would like to defend the budget that we have allocated for communication and information purposes.
This is a crucial element.
What is most important is not so much co-financing, despite that being an important issue, but rather providing information and guiding the process with the Member States involved.
I would therefore ask for your understanding with regard to the amount we attribute.
It is not because we do not value this, but because the budget is limited and the Community should not finance 100% of all the actions that the Union is proposing.
Other sources should also be used.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 11.00 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the report by Mr Vidal-Quadras on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy on energy efficiency (Green Paper) [2005/2210(INI)] (A6-0160/2006).
Â Â  . â Mr President, tomorrow this House will vote on the report on energy efficiency for which I have been rapporteur.
This report comes at an extremely appropriate time.
Following last Januaryâs energy crisis, the constant rise in the price of a barrel of crude, amongst other factors, has reopened an in-depth debate on the lack of a common energy policy within the Union, the vulnerability of our supply system, the worrying increase in protectionist attitudes and the need to substantially improve our habits, as well as the efficiency of our consumption.
We have had to face extreme situations in order for the citizens and the governments to become aware once again of the seriousness of the situation we are in.
Let us hope that the measures required to resolve these problems are taken once and for all.
I believe that the great majority of Members of this Parliament agree with me that, in terms of reducing our dependence on external sources and combating climate change, energy efficiency is the quickest and least expensive approach and has the greatest potential for creating employment and economic growth.
Furthermore, promoting energy efficiency fits perfectly well within the Lisbon Agenda, which is so in need of revitalisation.
This report is also intended to remind the Member States that, if the different directives in force are complied with, the Union could achieve 50% of its energy saving objectives, as well as the majority of its commitments under the Kyoto Protocol, without the need to take any new measures.
I believe that it is important to emphasise this message because the great majority of the agreements amongst the Member States from the last Spring Council relate to compliance with existing obligations.
We are often accused of producing endless legislative texts that are difficult to transpose, but that view is usually a poor excuse from national governments that have not been diligent in their compliance with the Community legislation.
The report that we will approve tomorrow also includes recommendations that are worth highlighting here: the need for massive investment in improvements to infrastructures â given that we suffer an average 12% loss in transmission networks, with losses of up to 20% in certain Member States; the completion of the internal energy market; greater investment in research, development and innovation in the field of more efficient technologies; the introduction of stricter requirements for domestic appliances and tighter controls of products available on the European market that do not conform to minimum standards; efficiency criteria in relations with developing countries; and strengthened dialogue with the main energy-producing countries.
Last but not least, several parts of the document stress the importance of the public sector, including the European institutions, setting a positive example in the incorporation of energy efficiency measures, through the design of public buildings, the renewal of vehicle fleets and the inclusion of energy efficiency criteria for public contracts.
I believe that this document makes many useful suggestions for the Commission in drawing up the action plan.
We are counting on CommissionerÂ Piebalgs, who always listens so carefully to Parliamentâs views, to incorporate them into his final version.
I would like to end, Mr President, by thanking the shadow rapporteurs for their excellent cooperation during the drawing up of this report, which I hope will receive as large a majority tomorrow as it did in the vote in committee.
This is the ideal time to take some courageous steps in the right direction, since we have on our side both the good will of the Member States and the will and interest of the citizens.
We must not miss this great opportunity.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mr Vidal-Quadras on his excellent report.
This report demonstrates why high energy efficiency needs to be on the agenda of the European Union.
Constantly increasing energy efficiency levels is the most important viable long-term policy in order to achieve a sustainable, competitive and secure energy policy for Europe.
I am pleased to say that the Commission is already in line with most of the calls from Parliament.
Indeed, we will integrate your considerations into our forthcoming Action Plan on Energy Efficiency, together with the results of the public hearing.
I expect the action plan to be adopted just after the summer break.
In addition, these considerations will be part of the Commissionâs work in the broader context.
I note the call on the Commission to be consistent with existing legislation.
I agree.
The action plan will build on existing legislation, and will focus on practical measures.
I also agree with your request for regular updates on the state of implementation of the directives dealing with energy efficiency.
Proper implementation and enforcement will determine the success of any EU policy.
This will, therefore, be the first priority in our action plan.
You rightly point out that in these times of high energy prices, the 9% consumption reduction target over nine years in the directive on end-use efficiency and energy services may well be on the low side.
On this issue, I would like to mention the following: the Commission is launching a comprehensive study on the energy efficiency potential in the different Member States.
This study will give a clear overview of national potentials and the Commission will compare this with the ambition levels in the Member States.
In this way, we hope to increase the ambition levels of the Member States.
In relation to financial issues, we work with international financing institutions to integrate energy efficiency into their lending strategy.
The refurbishment of existing buildings, with an emphasis on social housing, is already part of the European Regional Development Fund in the new programming period.
However, it is up to the Member States to ensure that they use this possibility.
I agree that fiscal measures can be a very effective instrument to further energy efficiency.
Regarding financial incentives to speed up market transformation, the Commission is considering a number of options in the impact assessment report on the action plan.
I agree that public authorities should lead by example, in particular through their public procurement policy.
They can make a substantial difference towards market transformation.
We will closely follow how Member States integrate energy efficiency requirements into public procurement guidelines, as they are required to do under the Energy Services Directives.
In this respect, I also agree with your call for more public information and education, and this will make up the third part of our action plan â behavioural changes.
I will comment briefly on minimum efficiency standards for energy-using products, as well as labelling.
The dynamic setting of minimum efficiency standards is embedded in the Eco-design Directive.
At the same time, we need to ensure predictability for investment planning by the industry.
As regards labelling, this will also be looked at in the action plan in connection with awareness-raising.
I am encouraged by your call on the Commission and the Member States to deploy more initiatives to increase energy efficiency in transport.
All options should be seriously considered.
The Commission will soon be coming forward with a mid-term review of the transport policy, and transport will also be one of the areas for action in the Energy Efficiency Action Plan.
On external relations, I agree that energy efficiency should be â in fact, it already is â a part of our relations with both energy suppliers and with the consuming regions.
Dialogues on this issue are being held with Russia, OPEC, the United States, China, Japan and India.
However, there is room for more action, both to make full use of the competitive advantage that we already have through existing technologies, but also because it is important in fighting climate change and ensuring security of supply.
I think there is complete agreement between your report and our work, and I would ask you to continue your strong support for our work in the energy efficiency field.
I should like to thank the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs once again for this excellent report.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, energy savings help reduce Europeâs dependence on an essential resource, contribute towards sustainable development and, by preventing waste, increase competitiveness.
These are hugely important, topical objectives, as the rapporteur and the Commissioner both pointed out.
Given that there appears to be convergence on objectives, the biggest problem that we face is how to convert those objectives into practice and how to change wasteful practices and habits.
The text that we are about to adopt is an important step in this direction.
As draftsman, I wish to thank the rapporteur for the quality of his work and for his cooperation in accepting a large number of amendments, three of which I should like to highlight: Firstly, the liberalisation of the energy markets must be matched by the quality of the regulation.
Secondly, the harmonisation of standards must be carried out at international level.
Thirdly, fiscal differences are specified that will lead to more efficient practices.
Lastly, I feel that to ensure consistency of policy, there should be a way of guaranteeing that the Structural and Cohesion Funds lead to recovery and energy saving, especially in cities, which should go hand in hand with the recovery and streamlining of transport systems.
I wish to bring these four suggestions to the fore.
Â Â  Mr President, as a result of the Brussels Summit in March this year, the European Union now has its own energy policy.
The adoption of the joint strategy is a milestone, because we can only control our overwhelming energy problems with joint efforts.
However, rather than ensuring a larger and even more wasteful usage, the focal point of the new strategy should be a more economical, more efficient and more intensive energy utilisation.
This is the foundation of our competitiveness, and it is also supported by ecological considerations and even by the interest of consumers.
Therefore, I am also pleased that following my proposal, the document tabled before us also includes, among other things, assistance for the modernisation of energy utilisation in prefabricated housing, which is a significant problem throughout Europe, including Hungary.
I believe that the encouragement given to companies providing services related to energy efficiency is a very significant step, because this is a market-conforming and innovative solution.
I congratulate the rapporteur for the excellent work.
I also thank the rapporteur for having supported almost all the proposals I had made as the competent draftsman of the Committee on Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.
Â Â  MrÂ President, in one minute I should just like to emphasise two points.
We have tried to state that we must be more determined in regarding transport efficiency as the nucleus of a strategy to integrate our policies on competitiveness, sustainability and energy security.
I therefore hope, Commissioner, that you will actually do what you have said, and we shall watch that you do so.
Secondly, we have to acknowledge that the average efficiency of road transport conversion chains is surprisingly low, and a step change is needed.
This represents an enormous potential saving if we take it as the main criterion for defining product quality and as a prerequisite for introducing hydrogen converters in the future.
Of course, research and development are our hope, but we have to start straight away by doing what is possible, based on proven technologies that already exist and on the possibilities for systems-wide integration.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to thank my colleague the rapporteur Mr Vidal-Quadras for all his hard work in producing this report.
However, I would also like to commiserate with him because some of our colleagues have displayed a lack of efficiency in their rather profligate use of words in pursuit of the worthy aims of this report.
In having too many words, there is a risk of losing focus on what we wish to achieve.
However, I would like to congratulate Mr Vidal-Quadras very much on the splendid set of amendments which he has produced with the other shadow rapporteurs in compromise.
It is wonderful to see so much text being cut out of a report, and I support him strongly.
We need realism in pursuit of our aims for efficiency.
Efficiency is essential; the issue is how we achieve it and how soon we can achieve it.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my thanks first of all to the rapporteur, MrÂ Vidal-Quadras, both for the report itself and for our close cooperation.
From this very comprehensive committee report I would like to pick up only a few points of particular importance to my group.
Firstly, the recognition that the prescribed target of a 20% improvement in energy efficiency by 2020 must be amended upwards.
The Commissionâs target is based on an oil price of 25-30 dollars per barrel.
I need hardly stress that this assumption is far removed from any current and future reality.
This means that we can expect energy-efficiency measures to be far more cost-effective.
In this context, the report also establishes how cost-efficiency is to be assessed.
Its assessment should take into account such factors as rising energy prices, reduced dependence on energy imports, the protection of the climate and of the environment, the security of energy supplies, innovation and the effects of energy saving in the medium and long term.
Alongside ambitious targets we need ambitious energy-efficiency action plans.
I am referring not only to the Commissionâs European action plan but also to national action plans.
We really must make these action plans the heart of a much-needed energy-efficiency offensive, meaning that we need good, intensive PR, practicable and effective proposals and differentiated energy-efficiency scenarios.
Â Â  . Mr President, this is a report brimming with recommendations, but I want to make just one point.
We must not be under-ambitious on energy efficiency.
We are dealing with an evolving set of circumstances, and the technology is developing so fast that last yearsâ top energy-efficient appliance becomes next yearâs rather mediocre model.
But even more significantly, the economic calculation is changing almost daily.
As MrsÂ Rothe said, when the Commission published its Green Paper it based its target of 20% energy saving by 2020 on an oil price of USDÂ 30 a barrel, but by the time the report passed through the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE), oil prices stood at USDÂ 70 a barrel.
It will not be very long before Member States bring forward their national energy efficiency action plans.
As you said Commissioner, 1% a year now seems far too low a target to be aiming for.
I welcome very much the comments you made to that effect.
I hope that the Commission will take a strong line and ensure that those national action plans are ambitious both in scope and in implementation, given what is now realistically and viably achievable.
Â Â  . Mr President, that is enough talk: let us act.
Let us have mandatory targets above 20% and strengthen legislation, above all as regards transport, but also electricity.
Let us take the opportunity to relaunch combined heat and power â that should be our answer to energy security.
However, all this can only happen if there is institutional capacity-building.
As long as there are more people in the Commission working for Euratom and on nuclear power then on energy efficiency, then there will be more talk than action.
Commissioner, we will judge you on this.
You promised us more staff to work on energy efficiency.
You have not delivered on your promises and will not be able to do so without more staff.
We need these staff because we need Commission officials to go outside Brussels and build a new partnership.
Energy efficiency is about a new culture, and we must therefore get national, regional and local governments on board, as well as industry, NGOs and the citizens.
How can you achieve this with just a handful of officials in the Commission?
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, our group obviously takes a positive view of improved energy efficiency.
On the Committee we voted in favour of the numerous amendments made to MrÂ Vidal-Quadrasâs report.
The end result is acceptable to us, working on the principle that the forest is more important than the trees.
The Union lacks a transport energy efficiency policy.
I welcomed the Commissionerâs promise to produce a document on energy efficiency in transport in the near future.
Possible areas where savings can be made mostly relate to different buildings and their heating and air-conditioning needs.
Improved energy efficiency in buildings will call for new investment and new technology, but there are no alternatives to it.
When Finland was part of Russia, the tsarist authorities taught the Finns discipline by sending our fellow countrymen to Siberia.
This worked on the principle that Siberia teaches you a lesson.
From the point of view of energy efficiency, rising energy prices are the EUâs Siberia.
Expensive energy teaches you a lesson.
What does it teach you?
It teaches you to save energy.
In this report we aspire to big savings, and the message to the Commission is a long one, but it is crystal clear.
Â Â  Mr President, the matter under discussion relates to the efficient use of energy which, once obtained from primary sources, may be converted into useful work or into another form of energy, or used inefficiently in open-ended systems.
Examples of these include the large industrial steam power plants, whose end efficiency is at best 30-40%, less 10% for power transmission costs.
How, then, can energy be more efficiently used to save these 20-30%?
In the first place, we need to invest in upgrading heat insulation in buildings and in modernising the way heat is produced and supplied to them, as well as in waste heat recovery systems.
Secondly, we need to invest in the decommissioning of old, small-scale, outmoded local heating plants and to connect housing estates, particularly in the new Member States where such estates exist in large cities, to heating networks powered by modern, co-generating heat-and-power stations of optimum capacity.
This will enable the simultaneous generation of electricity for local consumers without transmission losses.
In order for these technologies to bear rapid fruit, however, financial priority will need to be accorded to access to EU funding for these projects, particularly in Central and Eastern Europe.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at this late hour, I shall begin with a story about a driver who asks the price of a drop of petrol at a petrol station.
On hearing that a drop of petrol costs nothing, he asks for a full tank.
It is indeed the case that one can save a great deal drop by drop, perhaps even in financial terms.
We certainly have before us an array of measures and proposals that could help bring about greater energy efficiency.
My analogy was an attempt to illustrate that the potential solutions are all relative and clearly not simple.
In my opinion, the most important is to boost science and research.
I therefore believe that unless we back up our good intentions and rhetoric with adequate financial resources for research and development â and at the moment this is clearly not the case â our goal of raising energy efficiency may be no more than wishful thinking.
A case in point is the Galileo project.
Unless we provide this project with adequate funding, we will not achieve higher energy efficiency in future in an area such as transport, which is unquestionably one of the highest consumers of energy.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to begin by congratulating MrÂ Vidal-Quadras on the broad consensus achieved and the skill he has shown during the process of drawing up this report.
We all agree that Europe is faced with the effects of climate change, the rising crude prices and the tension with Russia over the supply of gas.
Nevertheless, Europeâs political response to our energy vulnerability is perhaps not yet up to the challenges we are facing.
Over recent years we have been prioritising the creation of the European energy market.
Nevertheless, reality shows that it is essential to move towards a common energy policy and that it is essential that the Member States are committed to moving decisively towards that objective.
Furthermore, greater financial commitment to research and development in the field of energy is essential, specifically with a view to increasing efficiency, particularly in buildings and transport.
In any event, one of the crucial approaches is to improve energy efficiency, which could lead to the saving of an enormous amount of energy in Europe.
Furthermore, the citizens can play an important role in this in their daily lives, but we will need a global approach, because this objective will affect all of the European policies as a whole.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteur again for an excellent report.
We touched upon the very important issue of the Commissionâs role and whether the Commission is delivering.
I do not believe that it is the role of the Commission to have millions of inspectors checking that everyone has switched off their lights!
The role of the Commission is to give the political imperative, to provide the instruments for Member States and to raise public awareness, and we are delivering on that.
We are coping excellently in this respect, because energy efficiency is definitely the first priority in the whole energy society in the European Union and each year we are improving, but we should like to improve even more.
The perception that was mentioned is wrong, because the Commission is delivering strongly on this.
Let me turn to the issue of staff and the relocation of staff.
The Commission must fulfil Treaty obligations.
The Commission is the guardian of the Treaties.
The Treaties should be fulfilled and to do this the Commission must have enough staff for all areas.
Therefore, it is not possible to move civil servants from one area to another as if by some miracle.
As far as energy efficiency is concerned, there have been changes to the structure of DG-TREN.
We have a unit for energy efficiency and another for renewable energies.
The number of staff has been increased and will be increased in accordance with the provisions in the annual budget.
That is part of the budget-making procedure.
I cannot accept this argument.
The Commission is doing what it can and is delivering on it.
The report is excellent and will provide us with better opportunities to use the potential of the European Union.
Perhaps we could be more ambitious than 20%, but we must now concentrate on seeing that is fulfilled.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 11.30 a.m.
Â Â  Energy savings imply a reduction of energy; energy efficiency means doing more with less.
After the world was awakened by the enormous rise in the cost of oil which ultimately translated into rises in our petrol and diesel costs and unbearable surcharges in our electricity bills â as happened in my own country Malta â we have all started to focus on the energy savings â alternative energies such as wind farms at sea, as is being proposed in Malta â and energy efficiency.
Energy efficiency can be addressed to numerous aspects of our everyday life.
For instance: buildings â the potential in efficiency in the building sector is of utmost importance; appliances â electric appliances such as ovens, air conditioners, kettles, toasters, etc. are becoming more efficient; transport â research and development have made cars more efficient in energy consumption.
But unfortunately, the more energy-efficient cars are, the more expensive they usually become.
Consequently, the main problem lies in the implementation of this report if adopted.
How are you going to encourage consumers to make capital investments, to change or purchase more energy-efficient building materials, cars or appliances?
The only way is motivation of a fiscal nature such as tax credits, reduced VAT, reduced licence payments, etc.
Â Â  â The recent crisis in the distribution of Russian natural gas supplies has revealed just how dependent Europe is on imported energy sources, and the problem is expected to become appreciably worse in the coming years.
Containing the European Unionâs energy demand could prove to be an important factor in solving the problem.
Such a step could lead to greater economic efficiency, generate a trend towards more jobs and help make European industry more competitive, all of which are in line with the aims of the Lisbon Strategy.
In addition to setting new targets, we must look at the legislation that already exists: if the Member States had adopted it in full, we would by now already be halfway towards the Unionâs target of a 20% energy saving by 2010.
The report proposes that the energy efficiency goals be incorporated into other sectoral policies, such as tax, transport or cohesion policy.
I believe that the funds intended for the European Unionâs regional policy should also be used to finance interregional and cross-border projects, to allow for the transfer of expertise to Member States and regions that do not have enough of a technological background to implement greater energy efficiency.
Â Â  The next item is the report by MrÂ Sonik on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs on prohibitions on certain sexual offenders [14207/2004 C6-0244/2004 2004/0818(CNS)] (A6-0068/2006).
Â Â  . Mr President, Belgiumâs initiative from 2004 is a response to the series of sex offences committed by Michel Fourniret.
The Fourniret case showed that there is nothing to stop a person who is convicted in one Member State for such crimes subsequently moving to another Member State and getting a job there where they have continuous contact with children.
The present framework decision on the recognition and enforcement in the European Union of prohibitions arising from convictions for sexual offences committed against children, as provided for in the framework decision of 2003, aims to close this loophole.
The aim of the proposal is to ensure that prohibitions on working with children ordered by a court in connection with convictions for sexual offences or child pornography offences are applicable not only in the country where they are imposed, but in any other EU Member State to which the person covered by the prohibition moves.
The proposed framework decision will implement the following solutions:
- it requires Member States where the convicted person is resident to recognise a prohibition issued in another Member State and to enforce that prohibition within their own territory;
- it introduces an obligation to enter all prohibitions imposed on convicted child sex offenders on a register of convicted persons, including prohibitions issued in other Member States;
- it provides for an obligation whereby another Member State must be informed of a prohibition when other information from the register of convicted persons is forwarded in accordance with international and EU regulations on legal assistance in criminal matters;
- it imposes an obligation on a Member State whose register of convicted persons is consulted for the criminal record of a particular person to apply in all such cases for information from the register of convicted persons of the Member State of which the person is a national.
The proposed amendments to the draft framework decision will, in particular, contribute firstly to broadening the definition of a prohibition to include prohibitions on any activity of any nature in public or private institutions engaged in supervising or working with children.
The aim here is to ensure that such prohibitions apply not only to teachers or supervisors working with children, but also to ancillary staff working in the same institutions.
In the second place, it is to extend the protection of EU citizens by obliging Member States to enter prohibitions imposed in non-EU Member States on the register of convicted persons, and to regulate dual citizenship cases.
Finally, I must underline that the proposed framework decision is an example of the practical implementation of the conclusions of the 1999 Tampere European Council, where it was established that the mutual exchange of information about sentencing in criminal matters should become a cornerstone of judicial collaboration within the European Union.
We should bear in mind that there are no ideal solutions, but I am convinced that the effective implementation of this decision will greatly contribute to the safety of our children.
This document, however, must not represent an end to the fight against paedophilia.
The Member States need to go further in implementing and enforcing legislation on occupational prohibitions.
Every employing institution should therefore introduce requirements for screening every person for child sex offences.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I am particularly grateful to the rapporteur for his work.
I can say in advance that generally the Commission agrees with all initiatives that aim at strengthening our firm, no-tolerance fight against paedophile activities at a European level.
These are horrible crimes which, unfortunately, are increasing on a weekly basis in Europe.
Members of this Parliament are probably aware that Europol carries out major investigations every week to smash paedophile rings operating inside the European Union.
The Internet has been a boon to those who commit such crimes against children.
As you may know, there are about 200Â 000 â I repeat, 200Â 000 â paedophilia sites available on the web.
The extent of the problem means that information has to be shared.
As you know, last December the Commission put forward a general initiative to promote the sharing of information on criminal convictions.
It is a general provision that does not specifically deal with prohibition measures precisely for those found guilty of sex acts involving children.
Thus the measure proposed by Belgium, to which the rapporteur referred, is a measure that supplements the general provision regarding information on criminal convictions; it is a measure that we can endorse concerning a very specific sector.
I believe that the main thrust of the European Unionâs action to cut down on and then eliminate sex crimes against children for good should be based on strong preventive action and operational cooperation.
Knowing what prohibition measures will result from a criminal conviction and being able to apply them in all Member States will ensure that cases like the Fourniret affair, for instance, can never happen again.
It will also ensure that those who still think that such crimes can be committed will not only be severely punished but also prevented from travelling and committing such crimes more easily in another European Union country.
The rapporteur deserves the Commissionâs congratulations and support for this initiative.
Â Â  . To begin with, I would like to thank MrÂ Sonik for his well prepared report.
The Committee on Legal Affairs analysed the legal side of this report and, after submitting a few amendments, approved the report.
It was truly abnormal that a citizen convicted of abuse in one EU state, including sexual abuse against children, could again find work in childrenâs education institutions in another EU state, despite the fact that in its judgment the court had forbidden the citizen from doing so.
The report makes provision that information on such individuals will, in accordance with compulsory procedures, be passed to all EU states, which will add it to the appropriate register.
Therefore, such a child rapist will no longer be able to work in childrenâs education institutions and harm children again.
I would urge my colleagues to approve the report and trust that all EU states will ensure that this new rule is introduced as a matter of urgency.
After all, child welfare is the most important thing.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to say âgood morningâ to all those who have stayed here for so long.
It goes without saying that I am in full agreement with all previous speakers as regards the regrettably dire necessity of excluding from certain professions those convicted of crimes of indecency.
That being so, whilst the circumstances that triggered this motion are sad, Belgium deserves credit for having tabled it for a framework decision.
As the convict in question was able to return to paid employment in Belgium and took advantage of the situation, we must do everything we can to avoid this sort of thing happening again.
There are, however, major differences between national laws in the area of removal from employment, which can be accomplished by means of criminal law, civil law or administrative arrangements.
The motion does not provide fresh funds for exchanging information.
Are the existing funds to exchange data from the criminal records sufficient to allow bans from employment that are brought about via a different legal form to be notified?
Mutual notification of disbarments from employment also means that the Member States will enforce a ban when that has been issued in a different Member State.
Is this a first step towards obtaining mutual recognition in the area of professional bans?
What I should like to be told is whether this motion can be implemented without the need for additional funds.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, given the late hour I will make just a few short remarks on the subject.
Banning sex offenders from relevant jobs on a Europe-wide basis in order to prevent them reoffending in child-care or youth work, for example, is undoubtedly important.
To date, however, therapeutic methods have perhaps been geared almost exclusively towards convicted sex offenders, neglecting the possibilities of preventive therapy.
Improvements in police methods of prevention with regard to known sex offenders are surely also needed, as is more restricted recourse to early release from prison.
Police cooperation and the sharing of information in this area also need to be improved, in my opinion, and we might even consider following the American example of making information on these offenders generally accessible.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 11.00 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the recommendation (A6-0165/2006) by Mrs Angelika Niebler on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality for second reading of the Council common position for adopting a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the implementation of the principle of equal opportunities and equal treatment of men and women in matters of employment and occupation (new version) (15623/7/2005 â C6 0089/2006 â 2004/0084(COD))
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, today sees us voting on the Common Position on what is being called a recast directive, one that has been the subject of very prolonged negotiation between the Council and this House, and thus it is that an important legislative process is drawing to its close.
Before I embark on discussing the directive, I would like to extend warm thanks to the shadow rapporteur for her friendly and constructive cooperation, and also to thank the Luxembourg, UK and Austrian presidencies for having worked together with this House to make a solution possible at all.
My thanks also go to the Commission, whose officials dealing with these matters have always been supportive and professional, so thank you, everyone!
What is this directive all about?
It has to do with Europeâs rules on the equal treatment of women and men in the workplace.
There are seven directives dealing with this issue, with forty yearsâ worth of legal rulings relating to them.
By means of this recast directive, on which we will be voting at midday today, we are for once actually doing some better lawmaking, in that we have, in it, summarised the law, condensed it and simplified it, and streamlined it.
This recast directive, for the first time, provides standard definitions of such concepts as âdiscriminationâ or âsexual harassmentâ.
It standardises and improves legal protection for the victims of discrimination in the workplace.
We have also, working together with the Council, succeeded in making improvements to certain points with the intention of establishing equal treatment, with references to such things as cooperation with the â as yet to be established â Gender Institute or the continuation of public information campaigns in the Member States â and that, if I may say so, will have to be that as far as the legislative draft is concerned.
How does this work out in everyday life?
Despite the euphoria about the simplification of the law and this new directive, we must not forget that considerable deficits still, in practice, remain in the equal treatment of women and men, particularly in the workplace.
There is up-to-date statistical evidence from all twenty-five of the Member States that there is still a need for further action where equality is concerned, for there has been no reduction, but rather an increase, in gender-specific differences in the labour market.
There is, for example, a difference in pay.
It is quite astonishing that, even after many years of case law and legislation, the wage difference amounts to over 15% in all Member States, in other words, that women, for doing the same kind of work, earn on average 15% less than men.
That is intolerable.
There is a similar state of affairs as regards gender segregation.
Certain jobs, particularly and unfortunately the less well-paid, are even today done to a disproportionate degree by women, and there are still far more women than men doing part-time work.
As I see it, the situation continues to be intolerable, and it is one that we need to do something about.
Do we need new rules and regulations to deal with this?
I do not believe that we do.
We now have this piece of legislation, along with the case law on the subject.
What matters is, not that we should adopt new and tighter rules, but that the rules we have already enacted should be applied effectively in practice, and the recast directive can make an important contribution towards that.
As I have said, we have incorporated the existing legislation and the ECJâs case law into the recast directive, and in so doing we have taken a practical step towards greater clarity, transparency and hence towards more legal certainty.
We also have to consider new ways ahead, though.
For example, we need to examine even more closely the causes of the pronounced segregation in the labour market and must also make the public out there, where it happens, more aware of it.
There is also work for the two sides of industry to do, in the shape of even more decisive action to counteract discrimination â particularly against women â in the labour market.
Ensuring equality of opportunity is also a challenge to social policy in general, for this concerns more than just one group.
The issue is made even more important when one considers the demographic developments, for we are â thank God â living to an ever more advanced age.
There is a low birth rate in every European country, and the certain result is that even more women will be going out to work over the coming years and decades.
It is particularly against this backdrop that it is important that we should ensure equal opportunities and conditions in this area, particularly for women.
I have one minute left, which I would like to use to briefly address another point, that being parental leave, which has also given rise to vigorous debate among us.
This recast directive does not, for systemic reasons, include rules on parental leave, but that is something that we want to see at the top of the political agenda, since it is crucial to the balance between work and family life.
This is where European impetus can make it clear that even more needs to be done where the balance between work and family life is concerned.
I am glad that we can, today, look forward to the Commission having a few things to say about this and that the European Council, too, at the Spring Summit, made balance between work and family life a priority and adopted a European Pact on Gender Equality.
We are on the right track, but have not yet reached the end of the road; if we make a joint effort towards getting further action taken to bring about equality of opportunity in the workplace, we may hope to arrive soon at our destination.
Â Â  .
Mr President, MrsÂ Niebler, ladies and gentlemen, I shall be saying a couple of things in German, and from then on I shall be speaking from a English text, as I am standing in for my fellow-Commissioner MrÂ Å pidla.
Being, however, a woman who has been politically active for a long time and has always worked, I have to say that this issue of equality of opportunity is one of which I have, of course, always had personal experience, and real equality of opportunity is something I have always been committed to, so I can tell MrsÂ Niebler that I am very glad to be doing this today.
I now propose to continue in English.
Mr President, the proposal for a revised directive indeed seeks to simplify, modernise and improve Community legislation on equal treatment of men and women at work.
It incorporates within one document the relevant passages of the directives on this subject, so that the provisions are clearer and more practical for European citizens.
It thus forms part of our efforts to have better lawmaking.
The proposal is not simply an exercise in codification; it combines simplification with something I would call âprudent modernisationâ.
In substantive terms, the most important aspects of the improvements are: the standardisation of terminology and, in particular, of definitions in order to ensure that the legislation is really consistent; the explicit application of a number of horizontal provisions to occupational and social security schemes, and the incorporation of the established case law of the Court of Justice in order to enhance legal certainty and clarity.
Modernising the directive in this way will help to bring about a considerable improvement in the legal framework of equal opportunities.
Given the complexity of the current legal situation and the diffusion of legislation on equal treatment at work, the aim of this proposal â namely, to simplify Community law in order to make it more accessible to European citizens â is very important.
The text proposed today is the result of interinstitutional negotiations, through which a reasonable and very satisfactory compromise â which is acceptable to both co-legislators â has been reached.
The Commission also approves this text.
Parliament has played a very active and ambitious role in handling this matter.
It has done much to improve and clarify the text of the directive.
For example, a reference has been added to the importance of comparative statistics broken down by sex.
Another provision requires organisations which promote equal treatment to exchange information with certain European bodies such as, for instance â as you mentioned Madam Rapporteur â the proposed European Institute for Gender Equality.
The overall compromise also includes two statements by the Commission and the Council which underline the great importance of reconciling work and private life as well as the importance of parental leave.
Reconciling work and family life is a challenge for each and every woman in our society.
In its statement, the Commission said that it is committed to promoting parental leave as an instrument of paramount importance in order to achieve full equality between men and women in working life.
We will make every effort to ensure that the conditions necessary to reconcile work and private life are improved by ensuring that this directive on parental leave is implemented appropriately, and particularly by monitoring its suitability and effectiveness.
In conclusion, the Commission therefore plans to make the reconciliation of work and private life one of its priority objectives and part of the roadmap on gender equality which was adopted very recently on 1Â March 2006.
In this context, there are plans to examine all the factors involved in reconciling work and private life, including parental leave, flexible working arrangements and support and care facilities with a view to finding solutions which are needed.
This, we know, will involve launching a dialogue with the social partners.
I am very pleased that the institutions have worked together so well on this matter, producing an acceptable and modern text, which will hopefully look to a better future for gender equality.
Â Â  MrÂ President, first of all I congratulate my colleague MrsÂ Niebler on the extraordinary work that has been performed both in committee and in negotiating with the Presidency, the Commission and the shadow rapporteurs in Parliament.
I am truly proud of that, in my capacity as group coordinator in the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality.
I am also pleased that this directive is coming to a conclusion, because it contains a number of things that should now make Parliament happy to adopt it.
I shall focus on three points.
The first is that it provides us all with an argument to use in reply to anyone who asks us what Europe is doing about Lisbon, after all the publicity over the Lisbon Agendaâs contents.
A few months ago I was finding it difficult, because people were mostly talking to me about the budget and asking me what resources we allocate for the objectives mentioned in the Lisbon documents.
Today, however, I can answer by citing this directive, for instance; in other words, I can say that because we â under Lisbon â call for women to join the world of work , we regard this as an essential factor for us to be able to maintain the welfare state in Europe that we all want to protect, while at the same time we are aware that, once we ask that of women, we also need to give them further assurances.
That is the first reason why I am proud and pleased.
The second point is that with this directive we are continuing along the path of sound administration, by reducing the number of directives dealing with this matter from seven to one, and thus through this directive we are also demonstrating better regulation.
My third point concerns the content â obviously the most important aspect â which has already been summarised and presented by MrsÂ Niebler and the Commission.
I would just add a couple of comments: in recent months, problems associated above all with discrimination in the areas of pay, access and training and also indirect discrimination have been highlighted in all the countries of the Union, including those that have historically been considered the most advanced in terms of womenâs policies.
I believe that this directive addresses those problems that have been pointed out to us: equal pay, equal treatment in occupational social security schemes, and equal treatment in access to work, to training and to career promotion.
Thus I am pleased and, once again, I would like to express my thanks for the work that has been done.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to pay tribute to the excellent work of our rapporteur, MrsÂ Niebler, who has at all times been careful to take account of the differing points of view of her fellow Members in order to improve this recast directive as much as possible.
I therefore hope that the result obtained will not go unheeded, and will not just be a declaration of intent from the Member States, as is often the case when it comes to matters of equality of treatment for men and women.
Need I remind you that a better work-life balance is a vital condition for meeting the objectives that the EU has set itself in the Lisbon strategy and regarding jobs and growth?
I am therefore grateful to the Commission and the Council for agreeing to make a statement on parental leave as the European Parliament requested.
I am also delighted at this agreement between our institutions, because the recasting of these seven directives on equal treatment of men and women in matters of employment and working conditions will enable us to increase transparency and to clarify what rights our fellow citizens have, particularly with regard to direct or indirect discrimination, harassment, and equality in terms of pay and occupational pension schemes.
With particular regard to the latter point, I would take the liberty, Commissioner, of urging the Commission to require France to meet the commitments it made when it ratified the Treaty of Rome, which was the first to condemn all gender-based discrimination, particularly with regard to pension rights.
The deadline for transposing Council Directive 96/97/EC of 20Â DecemberÂ 1996 on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women in occupational social security schemes was 1Â JulyÂ 1997.
To date, France is still in contravention of Community law, because the directive has still not been transposed.
What are we waiting for?
I am also pleased that the deadlines set by this recast directive regarding transposition and sanctions for failure to implement the text have been reduced in comparison with the initial proposal.
The gathering of statistics will also give us an impression of the overall situation and allow us to assess the changes and adjustments made at European level.
It is our responsibility to establish a real European policy on equal treatment for men and women, which must be effective and must be able to change mentalities quickly, since this is absolutely vital for a true transformation of society.
Â Â  . â Gender equality in the European Union is viewed as a democratic value, freedom of self-expression and the basis of fully fledged interpersonal relations.
By emphasising the reconciliation of work and private life as one of the priority aspects of the EU's gender equality policy, the European Commission is promoting a uniform approach to men and women in all areas, including employment, pay and the individual right of every parent across the entire European Union to appropriate childcare leave.
Although there are different implementation models for the integration of gender equality strategy in the European Union (the dual family breadwinner model, the male breadwinner and female part-time worker and housewife model, the male breadwinner and female housewife model), gender equality is an important issue everywhere in the realm of employment â professional and vertical sex segregation in the labour market, linked to women culturally being allocated most responsibility for house work.
While agreeing with the Commission, I urge Member States to be more active in organising information campaigns for the public and employers on questions related to equal opportunities in the area of work and employment.
Employers must regularly provide employees or their representatives with appropriate information on the uniform approach to men and women within the company.
To gain a better understanding of the causes for different attitudes to men and women in the area of employment and professional activity, it is necessary to gather and analyse comparable gender specific data and statistics.
By cooperating with social partners we must improve women's position in the workplace and solve the problem of gender pay differences which is still relevant, as well as the question of clear gender differentiation in the labour market.
We must review regulations on flexible working hours to allow men and women to coordinate work and family commitments more successfully, and guarantee equal opportunities for employment and for vocational education which determines employment.
Â Â  Mr President, I completely support the agreement and genuinely wish to thank the rapporteur, MrsÂ Niebler, for both her constructive cooperation and her considerable readiness to listen while the work was under way.
In spite of the progress with this directive, I wish to sound a note of warning.
However good the directive we may be able to produce through the EU system, it is still practical actions that make for changes.
For example, we have had the Equal Pay Directive for a very long time indeed.
In spite of that, we are still forced to live with wage discrimination on grounds of sex.
I regret the fact that we did not make more progress on parental leave.
I should have liked to have seen a much more pressing call go out to the Member States to take this issue seriously.
We have now had certain wordings introduced, which is constructive, even though I believe them to be inadequate and should have liked us to have made more progress.
It means, however, that we must continue with the work at all levels if we are to achieve our aim.
Â Â  . Mr President, the principle of equal pay for equal work regardless of gender should be an underlying principle in the civilised world.
However, we regard the equal treatment of men and women as discrimination and as being unfair to women, who in the vast majority of cases are mothers and bring up the younger generation.
For this reason they should enjoy special protection, not only in respect of employment, but also as regards working conditions.
Even under the totalitarian system under which the people of Poland lived, women were, at least on paper, protected by law, and in particular they were able to return to their previous jobs after taking maternity and childcare leave, and also to develop vocationally.
For this reason we require specific legal solutions that will not only ensure equal treatment of men and women, but which will also protect women, particularly those of reproductive age and those taking maternity and childcare leave.
In national legislations there should be provisions which are more favourable to mothers, including counting time taken off for childcare towards their years of service and for pension purposes, and even the introduction of some kind of financial support for childcare leave, which would reduce unemployment.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I greatly welcome the willingness shown by our institutions to address a problem that is constantly and seriously undermining the soundness of our social model.
Equality between men and women is in fact a basic principle of Community law and is enshrined in Articles 2 and 3 of the Treaty.
Although the European Union is in the forefront as regards the protection of citizensâ and workersâ rights, gender discrimination, both direct and indirect, is unfortunately still the order of the day in many Member States.
The very procedures for gaining access to the world of work, the terms and conditions of contracts, and the availability of family support services to parents and relatives of those requiring care, to give just a few examples, seriously interfere in practice with many womenâs personal freedom of choice to develop a career to the same level as their male colleagues.
The call for the Member States to implement a deterrent system of sanctions for any possible cases of discrimination is therefore a necessary and urgent measure that needs to be promptly adopted by all the competent national authorities.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, it is 20 centuries since it was proclaimed 'there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female'.
Safeguarding equal treatment of men and women, under the law at least, is a cultural necessity; however, we still need, even today in the 21st century, to insist not only that this should apply where the common sense of the European considers it to be self-evident, but also so that we can update and simplify the common legislation of the European Union, so that new and future Member States can easily take up the and the Lisbon Strategy can be achieved.
We also need to compare and analyse the negative aspects of the careers of men and women in a bid to identify the 'opportunities' created by inequalities.
As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I shall always remember the reaction of the Commission representative when he realised that, apart from the general view of Community legislation and the case law of the Court of Justice on equal pay, equal treatment by social insurance systems, equal treatment in vocational training, recruitment and deployment at work and the burden of proof of inequalities, we added equal treatment and equal opportunities within the framework of parental leave.
It needed the exemplary method or insistence of MrsÂ Niebler, of the rapporteur of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, who improved the Commission text by combining the opinions of the other committees and achieving a compromise in unofficial tripartite negotiations, in order for the wish of the European Parliament to be satisfied and attention to be given to reconciling work and family.
Of course it does not say family; it says that private life needs to be reconciled with work, as if we meant that men and women excluded the possibility of creating and maintaining a family from their private life.
Of course, the compromise amendment on the review of parental leave within the framework of the new possibilities offered by the roadmap for women's rights offers a great deal of hope together with a new agreement on equality and I trust that MrsÂ Niebler's children and all our children will live in a society of equality.
Â Â  â I wish to begin by congratulating MrsÂ Niebler on her report and MrsÂ Vergnaud, shadow rapporteur for my group.
I welcome this Commission initiative aimed at modernising and simplifying Community law in the area of equal treatment of men and women in the labour market.
Women still suffer from discrimination at work, which takes a number of different forms, such as unequal pay and difficulty of access to the labour market, and in particular to well paid, prestigious jobs.
Yet the Lisbon Strategy provides for greater female participation in the labour market and more and better jobs for women.
Thirdly, I should like to reiterate the proposals that I put forward in my reports on the Lisbon Strategy from a gender perspective and on demographic change.
The Member States must, as a matter of urgency, adopt measures to enable women to achieve a better reconciliation between work and private life.
The review of the directive on parental leave should help to combat the economic, social and cultural prejudices associated with the right to paternal leave.
Member States should set up paid maternity and paternity leave when a child is born or adopted and should, of course, observe best practice as regards the duration of maternal leave, which varies between 14 and 28 weeks, the mandatory period and the amount of money provided during the leave period.
Such measures will undoubtedly help to stop discrimination against women and will help women to have the children they want to have.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Niebler for her excellent work.
The recast directive to simplify and modernise the issue incorporates the relevant points in this area.
Standardisation and definitions are clearly important but, most importantly, what we need now are sanctions.
To reconcile work and family life is one of the most urgent issues of the Europe of today and the Europe of the future.
There is today no country in the Union that reaches the reproductive levels necessary to avoid extinction.
Women want to work.
If forced to choose between working and having a family, an increasing number of women choose to work.
One of the most obvious forms of discrimination against women is the gender pay gap.
For more than 30 years we have had a directive dealing with this, but how much has the situation changed during that time?
Not at all.
There has been no improvement in this area whatsoever.
Will the recast directive change this?
It remains to be seen.
To put the issue of reconciling work and family life as a top priority, as Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner stated, is very good, but we desperately need sanctions.
Nothing less than the future of Europe is at stake.
Â Â  â Mr President, the principle of equal opportunities and equal treatment for men and women in terms of access to work and work-related activities must be implemented across a wide range of areas.
This is provided for in the directive on which we shall be voting today, which brings together a number of existing Community provisions including the case-law of the European Court of Justice.
All Member States must show the political will needed to implement the legislative proposals before us, in order to combat the discrimination that still goes on as regards salaries, access to employment, vocational training, promotion, the kind of harassment and sexual harassment that often comes with such discrimination, and any unfavourable treatment of women in relation to pregnancy or maternity.
I also welcome the important recognition that equal treatment in matters of employment and occupation must not be limited to adopting legislative measures and effective legal protection.
Awareness-raising campaigns should be set in motion and infrastructure and equipment set up to support infancy, maternity and paternity.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, it is a proven fact that, when it comes to employment, men and women are not treated in the same way.
The European Parliament has been concerned by this for years, and regularly publishes reports piously wishing for blessed egalitarian resolutions: incredibly labyrinthine systems and hot-air factories, as you will all appreciate.
To be more serious, though, should our institution not concentrate more on reconciling the people with the political elite?
One year on from the resounding 'no' votes from the French and the Dutch, it has to be said that nobody wants to be a part of this Europe run by the European Commissioners, of this globalised Europe, and that the chasm between what the eurocrats want and what the nations of Europe want is widening all the time.
Instead of obstinately trying to cobble something together to get round the rejection of the European Constitution, should Brussels' plans and those of Parliament not finally take their inspiration from listening to and respecting the people?
Â Â  Mr President, the directive on the implementation of the principle of equal opportunities and equal treatment of men and women in matters of employment and occupation is an extremely important and long-awaited document for the citizens of the European Union.
The new directive streamlines previous EU regulations by consolidating provisions from a number of other directives implementing the principles of equal pay and equal treatment for men and women as regards access to employment, vocational training and promotion, and working conditions.
For the principle of equal opportunities to be really effective, flexible regulation of working time is needed that would enable women as well as men to combine family with working life.
The Member States need to allocate funds to help with childcare, including special regulations on parental leave to which either parent would be entitled, as this would largely ensure equal access to employment, vocational training and promotion.
Furthermore, close cooperation is required with the social partners in order to counteract effectively the problem of the persisting and unfair difference in pay between men and women and that of the marked gender segregation on the employment market.
I join the others in congratulating MrsÂ Niebler on her fine report.
Â Â  Mr President, the Treaty of Amsterdam states that one of the missions of the European Community is to support equal rights for men and women through the implementation of common policies and funding as defined in Articles 3 and 4.
The Treaty attaches fundamental significance to gender equality, stating that the spread of this principle is as important as developing a competitive economy.
We now have the opportunity to move forward and to regulate a range of existing legislation, such as the Equal Pay Directive, the Directive on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women in occupational security schemes and the Directive on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women as regards access to employment, vocational training and promotion, and working conditions.
It has also finally been possible to reach a compromise on a regulation that would allow men as well as women to be able to exercise their parental duties more effectively.
For this reason I support the adoption of this compromise solution, particularly as it is the Day of the Child in Poland today, and this is the present that our children most deserve.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you â and MrsÂ Niebler in particular â most warmly for this debate, and also say how appreciative I am of the participation in it of so many men, that is to say, of your Houseâs male Members.
The debate has highlighted the fact that there is still, in practice, much to be done as we progress towards full equality; this is where there is work for all of us to do, and to do together, for equality of opportunity for women and men is not merely an important fundamental right, but it also makes our businesses and our economy more competitive.
Todayâs society is dependent on the talents of all workers and must therefore seek to integrate women more into the labour market and keep them there in the long term.
In this â as everyone here has pointed out â compatibility between work and family life is of enormous importance and is much to be valued.
We must, however â particularly when considering society as a whole, and the changes in its population most of all â bear in mind the fact that we, as a society, are getting older, and must, in future, try not only to produce more children, but also, and at the same time, to enable people to combine working life and a family.
That is why I believe that this recast directive is a vitally important step, in that it simplifies and modernises a substantial amount of existing law on the equal treatment of women and men.
With it, we really are making it possible for the public to have better â and, it is to be hoped, easier â access to an important area of the law.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 11.00 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0148/2006) by Mrs LÃ­via JÃ¡rÃ³ka on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality on the situation of Roma women in the European Union [2005/2164(INI)]
Â Â  Mr President, this is the second time that we are conducting a debate in a plenary session of the European Parliament specifically focused on the situation of the Roma.
On the first occasion, one year ago, the House voted with a large majority in favour of the five-party agreement concerning the situation of the Roma, the first EP document addressing exclusively the problems of the Roma people.
At that time, we also formulated certain proposals.
This had been preceded by the much earlier comprehensive report of the Commission on the situation of European Roma.
Their situation has not changed much, and has, in fact, deteriorated in many cases since the publication of these important documents, just like before, over the past decades.
The efforts of governments in this area are mainly exhausted in the formulation of impressive action plans, but the governments neither implement real structural changes nor do they create the funds required for reforms.
Also, they do not enforce penalties for the violation of the law to the required extent, and do not supervise the so-called Roma projects appropriately.
The European Union does not undertake any of these tasks, either.
Over the past seventeen years, the European Union has spent EUR 750Â million on the Roma.
More than one third of these funds have been drawn as earmarked resources, specifically for Roma programmes.
More than half of the Roma children can still only study in segregated gipsy classes.
In Hungary, which is probably the only EU Member State advocating a progressive Roma education policy, the number of segregated children has continued to grow in the past years, in spite of desegregation efforts.
More than two thirds of the active Roma population are unemployed in the long term.
We still have the isolated gipsy settlements, the ghettos, the hopelessness, the dependence on benefit and the increasing anti-Roma attitude, leading to the social exclusion of further generations.
However, an important development in the past years may be that the Roma civil society has become stronger, and I am glad that the Commission finds it important to support it.
Following in the footsteps of the civil organisations who have worked on this for two decades, it has taken us almost two years of hard work to ensure that more and more issues affecting the Roma are brought to the attention of the European Parliament in the course of our work.
The report concerning Roma women, which I have drafted, and which we are debating today, could not have become a strong professional document without the contribution of civil organisations, such as the Open Society Institute, the European Roma Rights Centre and other organisations and specialists with whom we liaise in the course of our day-to-day work.
It is important that the number of organisations dealing with the Roma increases each year, and that they become the driving force of the enforcement of the rights of Roma throughout Europe.
However, experience has shown that this is nowhere near sufficient to bring any significant changes in the life of the Roma.
A few weeks ago a kindergarten teacher said that the reason why Roma children were not allowed to attend the kindergarten was that they were muddy.
The streets of the Roma settlement from where the parents would like to take their children to kindergarten have never been gravelled, and road paving is not even included in the medium-term plans of the town.
The floods have washed away the settlement three times, depositing several hundred kilograms of waste between the houses, because, like thousands of other gipsy settlements, this settlement, too, is adjacent to the waste disposal site of the town.
The day before my visit, an elderly Roma woman became brain dead because it took the Roma twenty minutes to push the ambulance out of their settlement.
At the same settlement, a mud hut collapsed on a family with six children one night in January, and they have been living with their neighbours since then.
Twelve people live in one room.
I often see similar situations in old Member States, too, not only in Eastern Europe.
The authorities always give the same answer: neither the local government, nor the Roma leaders are able to help.
This is the reality that a Roma woman must face every day in the Europe of the twenty-five.
Racial discrimination exacerbates the existing disadvantaged situation, and makes our everyday life difficult through the increasing, open and implied anti-Roma attitude throughout Europe.
The Roma are facing significant difficulties in the area of employment, because the unemployment rate in some European regions with a high Roma population reaches 100%.
Instead of facing the problem of reconciling family and work, the average Roma woman must fight every day to put food on the table without having a job, waiting for benefit and at the mercy of loan sharks.
It is true that in many cases unemployment is a consequence of low level, segregated education, but most often it is a result of the fact that when the Roma go to a job interview, they are automatically turned down because of the colour of their skin.
It is particularly important to emphasise this, because we are in the process of making sure that Europe becomes even more competitive at a time when the population of the continent is aging rapidly.
It seems logical to take into account the youngest and largest ethnic minority of Europe, especially in view of the reports stating that by 2050, in some Member States the proportion of the active Roma population will be higher than that of the active non-Roma.
The countless documents, studies and publications describing the situation of the Roma, including my report, were not meant to end up on shelves or filing cabinets, and they are not advertising material intended to propagate the issue.
These documents, including the public hearing and expert report associated with my report, present a shocking picture.
Politicians have a huge responsibility, because a logical question arises: how can a unified Europe deal with the challenges posed by the integration and globalisation of immigrants arriving in Europe, if it sweeps under the carpet the Roma â who have been living in Europe since the 14th century â and their problems?
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs JÃ¡rÃ³ka for having prepared this report, which I think is highly important.
We share her wish to further the social integration of ethnic minorities such as, for instance, the Roma â and the Roma women in particular â while taking account of the gender dimension.
Equality and the fight against discrimination are indeed the two fundamental values of the European Union.
These values therefore inspire the implementation of our policy and we take actions in different forms.
For instance, earlier this year, we created a high-level group on the social integration of ethnic minorities and their full participation in the labour market.
We asked this group to submit recommendations to us by the end of 2007 on examples of good practice, which you also mentioned.
Second, on the law, Roma women are covered by Community legislation prohibiting any form of direct or indirect discrimination based on gender or ethnic origin.
The legal protection covers access to employment, education, healthcare, goods and services.
There is also an awareness-raising programme and different campaigns.
The European Union provides financial support for specific projects through the structural funds and various Community programmes.
Almost EURÂ 300Â million have been allocated to projects to assist the Roma population over the past five years.
We will also have a special year: the year 2007 will be the European Year of Equal Opportunities.
I think this will be an excellent opportunity to raise awareness of multiple discrimination, in particular the question of Roma women.
The Roma community itself has a very important role to play in encouraging the full participation of women in social, economic and political life.
We are indeed very conscious that the problem of multiple discrimination, which is highlighted in your report, Mrs JÃ¡rÃ³ka, is widespread.
The Commission intends to launch a study this year in order to refine the analysis and also reinforce our policies on this issue.
What have we been doing about analysis and data collection?
The establishment of the European Institute for Gender Equality will, in my view, undoubtedly bring progress in this field.
The collection and analysis of reliable comparable data at Community level will hopefully improve that.
The instituteâs work programme will be in line with the priorities of the Commission, but it is up to the management board to also decide on how best to integrate the issues relating to the situation of Roma women.
Â Â  It is very difficult to write aÂ balanced, unbiased report on the issue of the Roma and Roma women.
The author of this report has succeeded in doing so, for which IÂ give her my sincere congratulations.
The report mentions resolving aÂ major problem, which is the situation of Roma women.
We should remember that the total number of Roma in the EU is estimated at 7 to 9 million, and according to UNDP figures, their number will go up by 2 to 3.2 million after the accession of Romania and Bulgaria.
This is the equivalent of aÂ medium-sized EU country.
The discrimination that the Roma obviously suffer is aÂ highly complex social and cultural phenomenon, where cause and effect are difficult to identify, if they can be distinguished at all.
It appears that this problem, which Europe finds increasingly complicated, can only be resolved through education, employability and employment, and aÂ change in living conditions.
As finding aÂ satisfactory solution is beyond the capabilities of an individual country, given also the free movement of persons within the EU, the European Commission should in my view proceed to provide targeted, properly accounted-for financial support, and aÂ more effective programme for resolving the situation of the Roma and particularly of Roma women, which should include the Open Method of Coordination to spread best practice.
On the other hand, what Mrs Ferrero-Waldner says is also true.
The EU does have anti-discriminatory legislation, but in my view the European Commission should demand much closer observance of these directives, as in the case of the Roma there is clear infringement of these directives, whether in the form of direct or indirect discrimination.
Â Â  Mr President, I find it extremely useful that a report has been prepared on the situation of the Roma in the European Union.
The cooperation in the preparation of the final version of the document has been exemplary.
The resolution of the disadvantaged situation of the Roma deserves assistance for several reasons, and it must supersede party interests.
Firstly, because I represent a Member State with a particularly high Roma population, and I am personally interested in finding solutions.
Secondly, because the Roma are facing cumulative discrimination in almost all areas of life, for their race, ethnic group and gender, which is often further exacerbated by social exclusion and the threat of poverty.
Thirdly, because the situation of Roma women is particularly difficult and almost hopeless.
Although the report affects the Europe of the twenty-five, it is worth addressing separately the situation of Roma women living in new Member States.
Let us not be ashamed to admit that the problem is far worse in Central and Eastern European states, because the proportion of the Roma population within the total population is much higher than the EU average.
The Roma issue is much more than a mere social issue, and it requires the employment of a comprehensive set of political instruments.
The priority goal is to fight against social exclusion and marginalisation, and to ensure genuine equal opportunities and social integration for the Roma.
The Roma, too, must be winners and not losers in the process of European integration, and must benefit from the advantages of integration.
We must keep the situation of Roma women on the agenda continuously, if we want to achieve a substantial change.
Member States must collect and publish accurate and extensive statistical data regarding the Roma, and must ensure regular data collection in order to provide us with an objective picture of the situation of the Roma.
The report of my colleague, Mrs LÃ­via JÃ¡rÃ³ka, is the result of well-thought-out and conscientious work.
I propose the adoption of the report.
Â Â  Mr President, I am pleased that, as my colleagues have already stated, the European Parliament is addressing the situation of the Roma in the European Union for the second time.
The report that had been prepared more than a year ago, as well as the decision, addressed the situation, employment, education and health issues of women.
However, it is imperative to address this issue as a separate topic â like this report has done â in the form of a report or a separate decision, or even by creating new directives.
It is imperative that we attempt to deal efficiently and very successfully with the issues mentioned by my colleagues who have spoken before me.
As we have heard before, the EUR 750 million mentioned earlier, spent by the European Union on the situation of the Roma or on attempting to resolve their problem, did not manage to resolve their situation, but has, in fact, exacerbated it.
Unemployment has risen in every state, and in particular, the number of discrimination cases has increased both in European Union Member States and candidate states.
I am grateful to the author of the report, who has succeeded in presenting this matter in a comprehensive manner, and all members of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Group, including myself, are fully supporting it.
However, Member State governments are often trying to address the problem of Roma women with a paternalistic approach.
They fail to ask for the opinion of the Roma women, or indeed of any women on the fight against the discrimination affecting women, or about the instruments and manner of starting and conducting the fight against discrimination.
It would be good if we could address these issues, and it would be good if we did not include Roma traditions in the fight against discrimination, because it would be very dangerous both for EU Member States and other legislators to intervene in such cases and to interfere with private family matters.
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I endorse this report.
The situation of Europeâs Roma population is not a good one.
Roma women are disadvantaged at every level.
There is a vicious circle in operation here, and too little is being done by those who make and implement policy to break it.
It is often the case that girls are pressured by their parents into leaving school in order to help keep house and look after their siblings, resulting in a lack of education, poor working conditions â that is, if they actually manage to get onto the labour market at all â and low pay.
Their living conditions and family circumstances are often wretched, and the health care available to them insufficient.
To that one must add the intolerable and inhumane crime of women being forced, without their knowledge, into being sterilised, something that formed part of a birth control programme in Eastern Europe in Communist times, and what is particularly outrageous is that this sort of thing was still going on in recent years.
We must do our utmost to make at least some restitution by getting these damaged women every kind of psychological and material aid.
We must, as a matter of urgency, see to it that targeted education and information makes it impossible for such inhumane things to happen in Europe again.
We voted last year that the pig farm on the land once occupied by the Roma concentration camp at Lety in the Czech Republic should be removed, and it is regrettable that this has not yet been done.
Â Â  . Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my appreciation for MrsÂ JÃ¡rÃ³kaâs excellent report.
The more the European Union expands, the more complicated some of its problems become.
One of the most challenging tasks is what I would describe as the changing relations between, on the one hand, the majority group and, on the other hand, the Roma and the Chinese community.
Few European minorities are faced with such prejudice and lack of understanding as the Roma, and few national minorities present so many problems in terms of integration into the majority environment.
I firmly believe that the obstacles confronting the Roma, particularly Roma women and children, are the legacy of a long-running clash between two differing principles of civilisation.
For centuries mistrust has built up between the two principles, and, instead of cooperating, people have acquired the habit of living alongside one another rather than living together.
This is a bad thing.
The outcome of this lack of understanding is the distorted image of Roma life presented in the media, exclusion from education and employment and the many problems of the Roma population.
On the other hand, however, it should be pointed out that thanks to the daily efforts of dozens of institutions, Roma and non-Roma voluntary organisations and increasing numbers of people, the situation in many European countries is improving somewhat.
Society is gradually maturing to a point where people realise the need for coexistence and for doing away with cultural, religious and other prejudices.
I have had experience of this in the Czech Republic too, and this fills me with optimism for the future.
Â Â  â Mr President, a researcher told me that if all the gypsies were brought together in one state, it would have about the same sized population as Germany, in other words they would have over 90 MEPs.
However, today they are not represented.
If you like, this is also a specific sort of racism.
We do them an injustice both socially and historically.
Hitler exterminated millions of gypsies and they were not vindicated by history, like the Jews with the recognition of the holocaust.
We also have them on the margins of history.
We need to examine the matter very carefully and with a great deal of sensitivity.
The sun shines on everyone.
The air is for everyone.
Water is for everyone.
We need to give them a place, a place in education, especially for women, because if the women are educated, they will educate their children.
We need to give them a place in society.
We shall all gain if gypsies mix with us on equal terms and not under the sort of racist disposition which, unfortunately, exists less in some states and more in others.
Â Â  Mr President, the Roma question varies in scale from one EU country to another.
However, throughout Europe, the Roma are a very poor community and suffer all the consequences of poverty.
Culturally they are a very tight-knit community with their own laws that discriminate against women.
The changes that have come about in the countries of the former socialist bloc have resulted in unemployment, which affects Roma women in particular.
Hunger, disease and a lack of work and housing have pushed this community into extreme poverty, which I have witnessed in Ukraine, in Romania and in other EU countries where the Roma community constitutes a sizeable ethnic group.
One place of hope was the orphanage in LiptovskÃœ JÃ¡n, where a group of Roma children were clothed, smiling and playing, rather than begging.
I would add the words âand childrenâ to the title of Parliamentâs resolution on the situation of Roma women, as children are defenceless in this tragedy.
The resolution and the proposals it contains are sound, and I would like to thank the rapporteur for her work on it.
Â Â  Mr President, some ethnic groups, such as the Roma, have their own rules for marriage and procreation.
Fourteen-year-old girls are treated as reproductive machines with no say in the matter.
Instead of enjoying intimate relations, they are passive beings, often plagued by psychological traumas.
They themselves, as well as their husbands and their fathers, are frequently unaware of these psychological consequences.
As a psychologist I can say that our studies show that a premature sex life, and in particular sterilisation, as a result of the problems of an early pregnancy for example, have long-term consequences on mental health, which may be less visible, but which are highly detrimental to well-being.
National legislations have an age limit for official marriage, but these are often ignored in minority groups such as the Mormons in the United States, or among the Roma.
There is a great need to raise the awareness of all parties to the problem, including governments, institutions, parents and the girls themselves, of the consequences of this phenomenon, which blights their lives, rather than bringing happiness.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I should like to thank MrsÂ JÃ¡rÃ³ka for the quality of her report and for the fact that she considered the proposed amendments so seriously.
I am also very pleased with the results of the vote within the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality.
In my amendments, I emphasised certain points that I feel are vital when it comes to the position of Roma women in particular: the need for Roma children to learn to read and write, and also the importance of social mixing with regard to housing and the need to provide accommodation sites for travelling Roma.
Access to education still seems to present a problem for MrsÂ JÃ¡rÃ³ka, but a majority of my colleagues in the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality chose to support my proposals, for which I am grateful to them.
I hope that the same will be true in plenary and, more generally, that this excellent report will receive broad support, because it is initiatives such as this that will help to provide more information to the citizens of Europe and to improve the everyday life and integration of the Roma.
Â Â  Mr President, as we have heard, many Member States still discriminate systematically against Roma, and Romani women suffer this even more than Romani men.
Reproductive rights is a key issue.
As stated in the JÃ¡rÃ³ka report, there are recent reported cases of sterilisation in two Member States.
This is beyond what should be possible in the EU of today.
The only reason that this has not been more widely condemned is precisely because it affects Romani women.
In this area, too, we need sanctions.
I should also like to underline that it is necessary to collect data on the basis of gender and ethnicity.
Only through this will we be able to prove beyond doubt the true scope of the problem of discrimination and marginalisation.
Finally, Mrs JÃ¡rÃ³ka has proven to us all how important the contribution of Romani women can be.
Â Â  Mr President, the report of MrsÂ LÃ­via JÃ¡rÃ³ka is a historical act, for several reasons.
This is the first time that the European Parliament is debating a comprehensive analysis of the situation of Roma women, and is committed to specifying the steps to be taken.
It is to be feared that we are less outspoken and firm in acting against discrimination than we were earlier.
In respect of the Roma, taking a firm stand for human rights has become particularly urgent following the accession of the ten new Member States, and 2007 will make this excellent report even more relevant.
It is the self-identity of the European Union that will determine whether we will be able to move forward in the direction mapped by the report.
Do we want to support the education and social integration of Roma children with Community instruments?
Are we mobilising financial, legal and political instruments to enable Roma women to find their place in a society in which they have become marginalised?
The report takes us forward in this direction with important and clear tasks.
Let us not forget them when we debate assistance policy and structural funds.
And let us not forget that without an attitude that accepts, accommodates and respects other cultures, even the best-intended assistance offered by the majority society can have damaging effects.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to thank my colleague, Mrs JÃ¡rÃ³ka, for her excellent own-initiative report.
I should like to stress a couple of points.
Firstly, on the issue of education, Romani women are, in effect, in a situation of double discrimination: first, as a member of the Roma minority and, second, as members of the weaker sex.
The gap in education levels between boys and girls is unacceptably wide, with many girls failing to receive even primary education.
This puts them in a permanent position of disadvantage, both within and outside the realms of their own community.
Secondly, access to healthcare: here again, Romani women are in a position of unacceptable weakness, especially on issues relating to reproductive and sexual health.
Efforts need to be stepped up to provide basic reproductive education and to prevent coercive sterilisation.
At present, many Romani women are in effect denied their right to their own body and their own health â a sovereign right of any individual.
The many necessary steps identified in the report are all fundamental to lifting many Romani women out of the spiral of disadvantage they are born into and are prevented from leaving.
Most of these steps can be accomplished as part of the mainstreaming programmes in ensuring equality of opportunity and would thus not impose new burdensome regulatory effects on Member States.
Racial segregation and biased attitudes in a wider society are to blame, but responsibility must also lie with the Romani communities themselves.
I look forward to continuing the dialogue with MrsÂ JÃ¡rÃ³ka and others at European level.
I am sure that Finland, my Member State, is very committed to this.
We have created a Romani forum in the Council of Europe.
We believe that this is an important issue, which will also be important in the future, especially when we look at enlargement with Bulgaria and Romania, where the minority is quite large.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think it is most important that we should remind ourselves that the Commission really is, in this respect, the guardian of Community law and that it regards the two European anti-discrimination directives as the fundamental instrument in the fight against inequality.
It is most stringent in checking to see that they are exactly and fully transposed by the Member States.
Thinking back to the situation that prevailed in some places before enlargement, I do believe that some improvements have been made in this respect since then.
I do agree with you, though, that there is still a very, very great deal left to be done.
There are still more things left for us to do in order to end the vicious circle, and I agree with what was said in this debate to the effect that this is very much a matter in which the Roma themselves bear greater responsibility for doing something for their own women.
We must give most particular attention to the multiple discrimination, and one issue that has struck me too as fundamental and to which there has been frequent reference in this debate, is that of education and training; the possibility has been opened up of Roma women breaking out of a tradition that is problematic in some respects and does not always afford them every opportunity, and in future enjoying equality of opportunity under normal conditions.
The European Social Fund is an essential tool in this respect, and we will make use of it.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 11 a.m.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, I propose the adoption of the report drafted by MrsÂ JÃ¡rÃ³ka, addressing the situation of Roma women living in Europe.
Although the report paints a very dark picture of the situation of Roma women and of the Roma in general â of their multiple social disadvantages, poverty, defencelessness, and the discrimination they are faced with, especially in the new Member States and candidate states â every word of the report is true.
The Roma are indeed the most disadvantaged group of society: their life expectancy is shorter than average, they are often excluded from health services, Roma women fall prey to white slavery more easily, and the gap between the education level of Roma and non-Roma women is unacceptably wide.
This state of affairs was also supported during two sessions of the Roma Forum of the European Parliament, held on 28Â June 2005 and 22Â March 2006, by debating country reports and presenting personal experiences.
Based on the values and policy of the EU, European Union legislators have already created several laws against racial discrimination and in support of equal rights for women.
However, I am convinced that we need to do much more, both at Member State and EU level, in the area of legislation, of raising awareness of human rights and sanctioning discrimination.
Even where we do have appropriate laws, their enforcement at Member State level falls behind the legal requirements of the European Union.
Therefore we need integrated Community assistance and policies that create opportunities.
We need solidarity in combating poverty.
We need resources that are actually able to change the situation of the Roma and of Roma women.
We need education and employment.
We need small region development.
I also believe that the positive role of mass media is very important in combating prejudices, in strengthening the identity of the Roma and in propagating their culture.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0159/2006) by MrsÂ DeÂ Keyser, on behalf of the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality, on the situation of women in armed conflicts and their role in reconstruction and the democratic process in post-conflict countries [2005/2215(INI)].
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, Commissioner, this report on women in armed conflicts and reconstruction is based on three vital documents: United Nations resolution 1325 from 2000, MrsÂ Theorin's report to the European Parliament on the same issue in 2000 and, finally, the shocking report by MrsÂ Rehn and MrsÂ Sirleaf, now President of Liberia, also on the same subject.
What has happened since those reports were published?
Well, now in 2006 everything still remains to be done, and in my report I wanted to shed light on three aspects of this.
The first is that of women as victims of conflict.
I must say that, in this field, which has already been widely discussed, the situation is absolutely unacceptable.
Today, women are still being raped, because rape is an instrument of warfare.
Today, women are still having their vaginas torn apart with bayonets.
Today, ladies and gentlemen, living babies are still being torn from their mothers' wombs.
Today in the displaced persons' camps, the sexual exploitation of women and children is still, whilst not permitted, common practice, including by the peace-keeping forces and members of the diplomatic corps.
It is unbearable!
The second aspect I wanted to raise is that of women as vehicles of peace.
Indeed, in situations of chaos throughout the world, there are brave women demanding justice, holding out their hand to the aggressors and saying 'we women want peace'.
We must protect these associations, we must promote them, and we must allow these women of peace, once they reach the negotiating table, to have an equal part and to play a decisive role in the construction of democracy.
We at least owe them that.
The third aspect is even more sensitive, because women are not only vehicles of peace, but also â alas â vehicles of war; the American servicewoman in the Abu Ghraib prison is a terrible example of that.
So, women can be cruel, and I wanted to focus on the very sensitive subject of female suicide bombers.
It is not a new phenomenon, but it is a growing one.
In Chechnya, 50% of women are suicide bombers, and in Palestine we have witnessed the appearance of a wave of female suicide bombers.
What is causing this?
We must analyse it in Parliament, we must undertake a study, and we must hold a conference, but we already know that there are three intermingled factors.
Firstly, it is true that there is a warped reading of the great religion of Islam: it is in fundamentalist countries that this happens.
The second aspect is resistance, in situations of conflict that violate international law every day: a resistance which we must understand, whilst still rejecting it and condemning the fact that it kills innocent victims.
The third factor is related to societies in which women are culturally isolated, or sometimes are even exiled from their villages because they have been raped.
That is where we will find female suicide bombers â among women who are already the victims of society.
I therefore call on the Commission and Parliament to look into this problem.
What can we do now about all this?
Everything still remains to be done.
Everything has been said and all the measures have been laid down, but what we now need to do is apply them.
We do need to set up better reproductive health services, but that is not the main focus of this report.
In all of our financial instruments, in all of our programmes â the stability instrument, the neighbourhood policy â and through our action plans, we must implement measures in which the issue of gender and the dignity of women is taken into account.
We must also train our peace-keeping forces, now that we have them, to ensure that they, too, respect the rights of women, that they are sensitive and that they also include women in their midst.
In this enormous shambles, there is both cause for hope â in the form of the women of peace â and cause for concern.
We have a lot on our plate, and I am grateful to all my colleagues in the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality for the way they have risen above ideological debates to say 'we agree with this report'.
For my part, I will respect everything adopted in the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality and I should also like to thank the chairman of that committee, MrsÂ ZÃ¡borskÃ¡, who is not here today but who sent me a brief note this morning.
It has to be said: we women will rise above partisan politics in this field.
Thank you in advance for your support.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, MrsÂ De Keyser, ladies and gentlemen,
first of all, I should like to thank the House very much for this important debate and the important report.
The report mentions women as victims, women as instruments of war and women as instruments of peace.
Indeed, we also see the three trends that are there, and I agree with you that all the legal instruments are already there, but very often what is necessary is much better implementation.
We will all have to work towards that goal and I will promise to try to make a difference at least in the regions where I am responsible.
We are fully committed to implementing UN Security Council ResolutionÂ 1325 of October 2000, on women, peace and security, where indeed all these issues mentioned.
Your report also addresses the question of women in conflicts and as peace-builders from many different angles.
I very much support this approach because women cannot only be seen as victims.
Very often they are key players in promoting peace.
For instance, in Palestine and Israel we see that women are coming together and they are those in the society that would like to go forward with peacemaking.
The female suicide bomber is a striking example of the complexity of this issues, and a phenomenon that deserves further study.
And as you said, very often it involves women who are somewhat isolated by their own societies and then, of course, who do not have any other chance, do not care for their lives anymore and then become suicide bombers.
The Commissionâs two-pronged approach to promoting gender equality abroad is also well reflected in the report.
First, we take on board gender concerns in all policies and programmes â so, there is a sort of mainstreaming.
Secondly, we also fund specific projects to promote women.
I am convinced this approach will remain valid in the future.
Both mainstreaming and specific actions will continue to be necessary, but it is also about changing the societies there.
It is about changing the mentality of the societies, as you very rightly said.
Mainstreaming is important because peace-building comprises this broad range of areas.
These include peace negotiations, peacekeeping operations, demobilisation, disarmament, reintegration and rehabilitation.
There, women always have their role â whether they are mothers, sisters, etc., women are there in the society and they see what is going on.
Also very important are election observation missions, security sector reform, institution-building and, particularly, strengthening of civil society.
We have also training programmes that can perhaps be enhanced in the future, where more than 800 Commission officials and other staff are involved in channelling the implementation of those programmes.
Another example related to capacity-building, which is highly important here, is that we are supporting training in the area of crisis management, intended for Member State experts deployed in that field.
Promoting gender equality in crisis management and conflict resolution is an integral part of this whole training.
Gender aspects are there.
When I say that supporting civil society organisations plays a key role, I think this is very true for instance for women in Bosnia and Kosovo, but also for training women in conflict resolution in Rwanda or Burundi and strengthening womenâs active participation in peace processes around the world, such as for instance in Georgia and Colombia.
Through ECHO, our humanitarian programme, we are also supporting several projects focusing on women in affected areas like Afghanistan, Burundi and the Democratic Republic of Congo.
This year, within our European Initiative on Democracy and Human Rights, we are also focusing on issues such as equal treatment, women who are victims of gender-based violence in conflict zones, and the trafficking of women and children.
So, there is quite an impressive amount of project proposals that are there.
In total EURÂ 9.7 million are available for this campaign from the 2005 budget and this yearâs budget.
In addition, this year we will also be putting increased emphasis on gender in conflict prevention network funding.
Here we have to encourage civil society, think-thanks and academia to provide external analytical experience.
Then we have to see how we can implement that.
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank MrsÂ DeÂ Keyser for her report, which contains much that is important and that I can unreservedly endorse, particularly the demands she makes in the field of reproductive health.
If United Nations Resolution 1325 were to be consistently implemented, it would amount to a gigantic step forward in terms of womenâs participation at every level of the institutions engaged in preventing, overcoming and resolving conflicts, yet it is a disgrace that there is still, apparently, a need for quotas in order to guarantee six and a half billion people around the world equal rights.
Women suicide bombers are a relatively new phenomenon and one that calls for expert analysis and special aid programmes.
The religious context must not be allowed to conceal the fact that religion is here being perverted for political ends.
I do not believe that a more substantial military presence â not even one consisting of women soldiers and police officers â would make for greater security.
Speaking as draftsman of the Committee on Developmentâs opinion, I have to say that I, instead, see the best possibility of long-term stability and security being established through reinforcement of the civil society actors.
It is absolutely vital that political dialogue should take precedence; in time of conflict, women must be offered more protection and better access to food and health care, and security in refugee camps also plays a major part in this, for the conditions in the regions of under-developed countries hit by conflict are catastrophic.
More soldiers â and I want to emphasise again that whether they are male or female, hostile or members of the so-called peacekeeping forces, is irrelevant â do nothing to bring more security; on the contrary, they make it more likely that women will become the victims of sexual violence.
Â Â  Mr President, firstly I would like to thank MrsÂ DeÂ Keyser for her excellent cooperation.
The report drafted by MrsÂ DeÂ Keyser on the role of women in armed conflicts goes beyond the prevailing public opinion stereotypes.
It is a fact that in armed conflicts, the majority of women are passive sufferers and often victims.
They are more vulnerable; they are those who save the children, as well as those who often become victims of violence.
However, the situation is changing rapidly and substantially, because women today are part of the armed forces and are present in the peacekeeping forces; they are also present on the side of those who commit violence, as stated in the report.
The rapporteur can clearly see that women are no better and no worse than men, and they do not necessarily take a greater part in creating peace and democracy than men.
Obviously, they usually have fewer opportunities to do this.
A definite positive point of the report is that it avoids the simplification that comes to mind straight away, because it is indisputable that due to their biological characteristics, women view the value of life differently.
The report is trying to find out, bearing in mind European values, what women could do to prevent conflict and restore peace.
It does not only call attention to the fact that the role of women has changed, but also to the fact that â and I would like to place special emphasis on this â mass rape has become an instrument of war, and I can only support the proposal that mass rape should be treated as a war crime and punished efficiently.
This may help reduce this horrendously inhuman and humiliating type of violence, the seriousness of which can only be compared to genocide.
Experience has shown that when armed conflicts are over, the high level of violence persists, directed against the weak, women, children and elderly.
Therefore, we cannot underestimate the need for women to be present in larger numbers in peacemaking, diplomacy and the police force, to ensure that victims are given appropriate attention and help, and perhaps, ultimately, to reduce the number of victims.
Once more, I thank the rapporteur for this extremely good report.
Â Â  . â Mr President, actions speak louder than words, and I want to thank MrsÂ DeÂ Keyser most warmly for her very compact report, which considers every angle, not least the imbalance of power between women and men as the cause of many conflicts.
While we see women as both perpetrators and victims, we also see solutions, and it is most important that we should recognise that women are often among the first victims of conflicts between states or within them, since they are among the weakest members of society, yet, paradoxically, they find themselves playing the role of the strongest in coping with conflict situations.
It was women searching through the rubble of a Germany devastated after the Second World War who were the driving force behind that countryâs reconstruction, and yet they were, true to form, again excluded from political responsibility.
Wherever in the world there is war, the norm is that women become the victims of sexual violence.
In countries such as Iraq and Palestine, they are excluded from assuming political responsibility; in the conflict in Sudan, sexual violence is getting out of hand.
For social democrats such as ourselves, then, it is for this reason that the participation of women, through gender mainstreaming, in all missions, as described in UN Resolution 1325, is so enormously important.
We want them to have an equal say in all areas of diplomatic policy even before conflicts set in.
It is an unfortunate fact, Commissioner, that only three EU missions around the world are headed up by women.
Our group is continuing to work on this issue, and we will be using the Gomes report to pursue at greater depth in the diplomatic field, an issue that is of enormous importance for us as a group.
We have been addressing the issues of reproductive health, of suicide bombings, and of anti-personnel mines, from the after-effects of which women and children continue to suffer.
What we can be sure of is that this report shows us not only that women are better people, but we want to get actively involved in playing our part, we want to play it ourselves, and this is where Europe must lead the way.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I agree that this report is of two-fold importance: on the one hand, it stresses the huge and serious situation suffered by women as victims in armed conflicts, while, on the other, it indicates very positively the fundamental â and often exclusive â role that women can play in peace processes and in post-war reconstruction.
In fact, this report â on which I congratulate the rapporteur, and I would also like to congratulate her on the sensitivity she has shown in accepting many of our amendments â goes even further than what is laid down in United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 and the Bulletin of the Secretary-General of the United Nations on special measures for protection from exploitation and sexual violence.


For example, it points to the importance of access to reproductive health services, particularly in war and post-war situations and, especially, in refugee camps; it stresses the need to tackle violence against women; it demands that acts of sexual violence, such as rape, sexual slavery, forced pregnancy, forced prostitution and forced sterilisation, amongst other practices, be treated as war crimes and crimes against humanity; and it calls for the women who are victims of these practices to be able to take their cases directly to international judicial bodies.

It is also necessary to stress the fundamental role played by women in peace-building processes and we are therefore calling upon the Commission and the Council, as well as the Member States involved in the management of conflicts, for greater sensitivity to the issue of guaranteeing the technical and financial assistance necessary to promote programmes to enable women to be actors with their own voices in those processes, as requested by groups of Kosovan women, for example, who are asking to be included in the negotiating delegation, whose current seven members are all men.
Furthermore, we are also asking for international missions, both civil and military, to take very good account of the gender approach in their actions on the ground and to impose harsh penalties on any participants in those missions who abuse their status and impunity to commit degrading acts and rapes on women and girls â something that we have unfortunately seen on several occasions.
Â Â  Mr President, in peace movements around the world, women often take the initiative and are in the majority.
They have realised that bombs do not create peace.
On the contrary, military violence gives rise to hatred and to demands for revenge, as well as producing suicide bombers.
An escalation in military violence also involves untold acts of horrific cruelty against women and children, as is also shown by this report.
Through the peace movement, women have shown another and better way â one of conflict resolution and measures to bring about peace.
I think that large parts of the report point to this other and better way, something for which I particularly thank the rapporteur.
However, paragraphs 14 to 20 indicate a risk of further militarisation.
I therefore think that these paragraphs should be removed so that we obtain a report that goes down the route of peace shown by women, rather than the route of militarisation.
Â Â  .
Mr President, as I have one minute to take the floor about the report on the situation of women in armed conflicts and their role in reconstruction and the democratisation process in post-conflict countries, I would like to point out that one of the conditions for the playing of a positive role in conflict resolution, and not only by women, is a high level of personal development, which makes it possible to work in the family and to promote the development of the family as well as bringing up children, but which also makes it possible to strive to achieve justice, security and respect for human dignity in other communities, all of which are of the utmost importance to the younger generation, which is particularly exposed to the trauma of armed conflicts.
Furthermore, the role of women is especially justified because women, who protect life with their maternal instinct, are particularly predisposed to caring and to preventing conflict through their characteristics of kindness, selflessness, empathy and compassion with other people and their willingness to help them.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I too am going to speak about this extremely sensitive issue, which has been addressed very intelligently and very thoroughly by MrsÂ DeÂ Keyser.
I too will focus on three fundamental points that were highlighted in the report and which I would like to emphasise here.
The first point concerns the age-old evil of sexual violence at times of war.
I believe there can only be one modern response to this age-old evil (we are all familiar with it and I shall not mention it again now): in a word, zero tolerance on the part of any society that considers itself a democracy, like our own.
The second point: zero tolerance means many things, including clamping down by punishing these crimes and not accepting excuses of any kind.
The second point, in contrast, is more recent, and is the fact that women themselves are committing acts of violence.
They may be doing that, again, partly as victims, as in the case of women suicide bombers, who once again are often being used, but it has to be recognised that there are cases where women, in the name of equality, have used violence just like anyone else.
Here too, in such cases there should be no gender tolerance, so to speak.
There is a third fact that concerns me even more and which I should like to highlight more emphatically: their role is so important that there is even talk of quotas for women in all political and administrative spheres connected with matters of war.
I should like to see them sitting at all tables where peace and reconstruction are discussed.
I think that the presence of women in this area is what our world can offer in terms of modernity and democracy: a really new, contemporary contribution.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I too congratulate the rapporteur on producing a really good report.
I shall just deal with two points.
I should like to emphasise that the nature of conflicts has changed in recent years, and one of the most tragic changes that has occurred is the rise in sexual violence against women.
This has happened because women are considered the bearers of cultural identity and, since sexual violence carries both a symbolic and a political message, it has been turned into a strategy of war.
Because of this new style of conflict, there are very few mechanisms to protect girls and women, and it is therefore vital to reinforce preventive measures, but preventive measures cannot be created from nothing.
Practical steps need to be taken and thought out and implemented through an early warning and early response system.
Sexual violence, rape and prostitution associated with the armed forces are indicators that warn of possible conflicts, as is a reduction in the participation of women in civil society and in political parties, as was seen in the case of Afghanistan.
First, then, I want to highlight the importance of this early warning system; secondly, it is essential for women to be included in all stages of the peace process, because they are not caught up in the traditional models of combative behaviour, or not to the same extent as men.
That is what needs to be done, but it is not yet happening, and so we are calling for quotas to ensure that women take part in all peace negotiation processes.
Â Â  â Mr President, sexual violence and torture meted out to women and girls are inseparable from any armed conflict, yet women and girls are far from being no more than victims.
There are very many womenâs initiatives working for dialogue, peace and reconciliation, and so women are taking an active role with great social potential, and one that the international community must do everything possible to support them in.
As I see it, the most important demand in Resolution 1325 is the one that reads: âthere must be increased representation of women at all decision-making levels in national, regional and international institutions and mechanisms for the prevention, management, and resolution of conflictâ.
This demand must be actively realised through concrete targets, in the shape, for example, of quotas.
Time and time again, doing without quotas is an invitation to opt for the âtake it or leave itâ approach, and strengthens the hand of those forces who, for whatever reasons, want to keep women out of the political process.
I would have liked to see the Commission drawing up quite concrete requirements for how this resolution should be implemented in the short and long terms.
It is also quite essential that gender budgeting should be given an important part to play in humanitarian aid.
My expectation, then, is that the Commission will come up with some really concrete measures as means of implementing this resolution in practical terms.
Â Â  Mr President, I am very worried indeed about this report: it introduces the concept of positive discrimination.
I have to say, as usual, that I have never heard so much nonsense talked in my life as I have today.
Clearly, nobody here has any experience of the armed forces.
I spent a lot of time in the British Army and I am a member of the United Kingdomâs Armed Forces Committee.
I can tell you that I have been at sea recently on board Her Majestyâs ships with women who are navigation officers, aviators, filling all sorts of complex and senior roles within the British armed forces.
How would you feel if you were the captain of a ship and you have a navigating officer joining you who is a lieutenant commander and a female?
Could you trust her or not?
Is she there because she is good at her job, or is she there because she is part of a quota?
Let us stop this silly nonsense from people with no experience of the armed forces at all!
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I congratulate MrsÂ De Keyser in all sincerity on the commitment she has shown in the own-initiative report presented to Parliament.
She has undertaken a methodical analysis both of the situation of women in armed conflicts and of their role in peace processes.
The courage shown by many women in the face of adversity gives the lie to the clichÃ© that depicts women as the most vulnerable members of society in situations of armed conflict.
Nonetheless, when war breaks out, women may be in great danger.
Whilst some of these risks are common to the whole of their community, it is true that others are specifically related to the fact that they are women.
Millions of women are suffering under the effects of the vicious cycle of poverty, discrimination and fanaticism, and they are often the ones who suffer the most from armed conflicts, particularly due to pre-existing inequalities between the sexes in terms of literacy, health and income.
Discrimination against women is both the cause and the consequence of the hardships they suffer in times of war.
It is absolutely vital for humanitarian workers to bear that in mind and to work to ensure that women are directly consulted and closely involved in all the activities undertaken for their benefit, so that they and their children can fully exercise their right to human dignity and integrity.
The voice of women is still not being heard at the peace negotiating tables, and their needs and interests are not being taken into consideration in peace treaties.
The report demonstrates that, 10 years on, the actions mandated by the Beijing Platform have still had no effect.
It is clear that the fate of women affected by war can only be improved if there is the political will to do so.
Commissioner, you have demonstrated this.
The government and the international and regional institutions need to increase the participation of women in all the forums and activities related to peace at all levels, and we must not forget that training for prosecutors, judges and other people with responsibility must take account of the differences between the sexes.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is an important report that we are adopting today, and I am glad that the subject in question is now being focused on.
I am particularly pleased about the emphasis now being placed on women as peacemakers.
It is the weakest people who are the first victims of wars and other conflicts, namely women, children and the elderly.
Women are exposed to horrifying acts of cruelty such as violence, rape and even worse things.
Women must not be regarded only as victims, however.
Women can make an important contribution to bringing about peace, reintegrating child soldiers and creating political dialogue between the warring parties.
It is important that we secure adequate resources for projects in which women can play an active role in resolving conflicts.
It is important that we bring about greater cooperation with local womenâs organisations and that we insist on the need to integrate the gender aspect into peace research, conflict prevention and conflict resolution.
I should like to thank MrsÂ DeÂ Keyser for this important report and for the splendid work she has done, and I hope that the Commission will be receptive to the report and will straight away get some practical work under way that will improve the situation of women in armed conflicts.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her work on an issue that is particularly sensitive, because armed conflicts affect women especially.
The majority of refugees and displaced persons are women and children.
It is women who are burdened with the needs of their families, facing more dangers than men, including the danger of being raped.
This drama faced by women is common to all conflicts.
I would like to stress, however, that the decisions leading to such a situation were probably not taken by women, because there are practically no women in the places where decisions are taken on security policy or at negotiation tables.
Despite the recommendations of the Beijing Action Platform, despite ResolutionÂ 1325 of the United Nations Security Council, which recommends including women in all peace processes, and despite the fact that we women know a lot about giving, preserving and caring for life, about fighting courageously for subsistence, about negotiating and reaching agreements, it is a paradox that the majority of NGOs that play an active role in peace negotiations and in post-conflict reconstruction processes are made up of women, and we in the institutions must support them and help them, and we must take measures to increase the presence of women wherever decisions are made that affect our collective destiny, because furthermore, ladies and gentlemen, the absence of women indicates a democratic deficit.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, first of all I should like to thank you, MrsÂ DeÂ Keyser, once again for this very comprehensive and very balanced report.
The Commission's approach, which I have explained in detail, is also reflected in full in this report.
One key aspect that was widely acknowledged during the debate was education and training.
It is a main focus of our approach and of the action plans in the Neighbourhood Policy.
We need to train women: we need to train them so that they can play their role in society â a more political role, and a role within those forums that will ultimately result in peace negotiations.
We are in the process of doing so, not only as part of the Neighbourhood Policy, but also, for example, in Latin America â as was discussed at the summit â and, in general, in the context of mainstreaming.
In this context, I would also point out that we are in the process of organising a Euro-Mediterranean ministerial conference which will deal specifically with the following question: how can we improve the role of women in the societies in the region?
In this regard, women themselves must be able to take on much more political roles.
A preparatory meeting will be held in two weeks in Rabat.
With regard to prevention, I absolutely agree that women must benefit more from it.
A realistic approach could consist in encouraging the parties negotiating peace to get many more women involved.
It is a much more realistic approach than laying down quotas: it is not up to us to impose quotas, but we need to say to the parties involved that they also need to think of the other half of society, namely women.
I absolutely agree that we need to examine this point in more detail and more depth.
Finally, in our new development strategy, we are going to put a greater emphasis on the issue of gender equality in development cooperation.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 11 a.m.
Â Â  â The minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I beg leave to speak on the basis of RuleÂ 145 of the Rules of Procedure, which has to do with comments of a personal nature in debates.
I would like to raise a point of order concerning something that has been said about me.
I am referring to a comment made by MrÂ Rogalski during the sitting last night, and the reason why I am making use of my right to respond is that MrÂ Rogalski, who has not hitherto made much of a mark on this House â which is why I had no idea who he was â described me as the fruit of the union of Karl Marx and Rosa Luxemburg, which is, of course, a pretty extraordinary thing to say.

I am sure that you, Mr President, will understand that I â although this is a biological impossibility â nevertheless take pride in this particular honour, and in the fact that the extreme Right applauded this form of words.
That, however, is not the point I want to make.
I want to quote a remark that MrÂ Rogalski made; it had to do with homosexuals, and it was to the effect that homosexuals are useless, since they cannot reproduce themselves.
That is the sort of language of which we were critical yesterday, inhuman talk for which there is no place in this House!
Since your fellow-President who was in charge of the sitting did not see fit to intervene, I ask that the record be reviewed and that it be ascertained what sanctions this House might impose in response to such an extraordinary statement.
Â Â  â We have noted your comment, MrÂ Schulz.
Â Â  â Mr President, MrÂ Schulz, I did indeed compare your actions to the actions of Marx and Rosa Luxemburg, and unfortunately what you claim I said about homosexuals is untrue.
What I actually said is that the Polish Government â which I support on this â is opposed to pornographic homosexual parades, which is something very different, MrÂ Schulz.
I would ask you to refrain from twisting the truth in this House, because you have frequently misused your position as head of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament to slander the speeches of Members.
I ask you to stop doing this.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to take the floor pursuant to Rule 145(1).
The minutes of yesterdayâs sitting contain a statement by the Chairman of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, MrÂ Schulz, who said he was also speaking on behalf of the Chairmen of the other groups, MrÂ Wurtz, MrÂ Frassoni, MrÂ Watson and MrÂ Poettering.
His statement contained false assertions which he also ascribed to me as a member of the League of Polish Families.
It is untrue that the League of Polish Families, its Chairman and its Deputy Chairman, my son Roman Giertych, or indeed any other member of the party, expressed racist views or called for acts of violence against homosexuals and persons wanting to take part in the equality parade in Warsaw.
MrÂ Schulz and his colleagues have been misinformed.
His entire speech is offensive to myself personally, to my party and to Poland.
In particular, it is scandalous to compare the League of Polish Families with the German Nazis.
It was a democratically elected German Government which had a programme to exterminate homosexuals and other groups of people that it did not like.
Such views have never been, are not and will never be held in Poland.
Â Â  â The next item is Voting Time.
Â Â  â Mr President, I have a request to make of you.
Item 9 is meant to be the vote on the Hughes report.
Mr Hughes is on his way back here from Luxembourg, where he has been performing his duties, and I would like to put to you the request â which the Chairman of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs endorses â that we might take this vote at the end of voting time today.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, SMEs in developing countries are generally micro-businesses, and one of the problems they have to face is that many of them work on an informal basis, that is to say, in the black economy.
That is why it is important that there should be legal recognition for the property of these entrepreneurs, not least â and this is no empty phrase â for that belonging to those of them who are women.
Land registry entries and legal property rights are the key to the success of SMEs in the developing countries as much as they are anywhere else.
I wish to thank all those who worked on this report, which has been adopted unanimously by the Committee on Development, and ask the House to give it the greatest possible support.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I do not know which rule I need to refer to, but there is a problem with the French interpreting.
There have been several votes where the 'no' votes have been mixed up with the abstentions: the abstentions and the negative votes have been swapped around.
I just wanted to draw your attention to it before the end of voting time.
Â Â  Mr President, this amendment refers to the complementarity between this programme and the work being done by the United Nations High-Level Group for the Alliance of Civilisations.
What it says exactly is: âThe Commission shall ensure complementarity with the work of the United Nations High-Level Group for the Alliance of Civilisations and any other initiative for cooperation with third continues, in particular developing countries, which is relevant to the intercultural dialogue objectives of this European Yearâ.
Â Â  Mr President, under Rule 132 in connection with Rule 170 I rise to propose, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, that the votes on the GuantÃ¡namo motions be postponed for two weeks until the next part-session in Strasbourg.
The reason is that a delegation of four MEPs from different political parties has just returned from a visit to GuantÃ¡namo.
Unfortunately, they have not had an opportunity to contribute to the resolution before the House today.
My group believes that by proposing this short postponement, the Members concerned will have time to brief their groups on their visit and help produce an improved text calling for the closure of GuantÃ¡namo Bay that, hopefully, all groups can support.
This text will thus receive maximum support and will give credibility to Parliament in the build-up to the EU-US Summit at the end of June.
Â Â  â Mr President, I wish to endorse this motion.
Much as I agree with this resolutionâs conclusion that what we are dealing with here is a violation of the rule of law and that this facility must be closed, there are a number of areas in which the arguments and justifications are no longer up to date.
I believe that, if we want to maximise our influence on the way this matter is resolved, we do need to be up to date and rally as broad as possible a majority in this House before the summit, in order to be able to bring the necessary influence to bear on it, and so I would ask the House to give MrÂ Coveneyâs proposal its backing.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not think we should give an ambiguous signal on such a vital question.
We know what the situation is in Guantanamo.
We have been informed of it by the United Nations and by international organisations.
Any postponement, therefore, however reluctant, would be interpreted as a sign of hesitation on a subject on which we have to be extremely clear.
Consequently, I believe that we must vote today.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I have a suggestion to put to the House and to the Member who put that motion to it.
I could well, as rapporteur, recommend a âyesâ vote if they were agreeable to the motion comprising only those words up to and including âConventionâ and that the last sentence would be dropped.
If that is your message, MrÂ Brie, then I could recommend a âyesâ.
MrÂ Brie says âyesâ, so I will indeed recommend that we vote on the words up to and including âConventionâ; the second part can therefore be regarded as withdrawn, and so we can all vote âyesâ to that.
Â Â  . â Mr President, at this point, the voting order suggests that we should vote on AmendmentÂ 18 first and then on paragraphÂ 7, and do it in four parts.
What we need to do here is, first to vote on AmendmentÂ 18, which is compatible with the proposal for split votes, while keeping things in the right order.
I would, however, propose that we ignore the vote on PartÂ 1, which is identical with 2, 3 and 4, apart from the difference that split votes have been proposed for 2, 3 and 4 and that PartÂ 1 proposes that 2, 3 and 4 be voted on together.
I would also make so bold as to add something.
The proposal for a split vote on Parts 2, 3 and 4 refers only to the amendments to the English version and not to the versions in other languages.
I hope that makes sense.
Â Â  Mr President, this is very simple.
I would like to add âand biodieselâ after the word âbioethanolâ in Amendment 15.
Â Â  Mr President, I shall read the text of my amendment:
âPoints out that the Commission shall publish its findings on countries that are considered not to be ready yet to join the euro area each time an evaluation is carried out, and present this to the European Parliament in order to ensure a high level of transparency and accountability in the decision-making process at EU level.â
Â Â  . â Mr President, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs decided, by a very large majority, that we should not, by means of this report, pass judgment on individual countries, but only express a view on the conditions for membership of the euro zone.
On the basis of that decision, I have recommended that we should reject the three amendments tabled by the Liberals.
I learned yesterday evening at five past eleven that the Social Democrats had abandoned this position, and would therefore recommend to the whole House that it vote a different way.
What I would like is for the plenary to vote in favour of Slovenia, that is, to say âyesâ to it, and do the same with Amendments 1 and 3 on Estonia, but firmly reject the Liberalsâ AmendmentÂ 2, which implies that the Commission and the European Central Bank have made gross errors in assessing the situation in Lithuania and that the Commission should therefore submit a revised version of its convergence report.
Although almost everyone in this Chamber is in favour of the speedy enlargement of the euro zone, if this House wants to maintain its own credibility, if we want to be taken seriously, then we cannot express ourselves contrary to the rules of the Treaty and the Maastricht criteria.
I therefore ask that we, in a roll-call vote, should vote against AmendmentÂ 2 and in favour of Amendments 1 and 3.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to clarify the content of AmendmentÂ 2.
It is not, as Mr Langen said, a criticism of the Commission.
We in our group have always said that we support the Commission in dealing with the Treaty and the protocols to the Treaty.
This amendment â which was tabled by the ALDE Group and which we are supporting â it is stated that we regret the negative recommendation issued to Lithuania.
This is not a criticism of the Commission.
We regret that it has been like it is and we have some critical remarks on the criteria in the text, which are supported by everyone.
Â Â  Mr President, my oral amendment is only a technical amendment to delete the word âallâ.
We cannot say that âallâ Member States are responsible for enlargement of the eurozone since two of them â the UK and Denmark â have an opt-out.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to move an oral amendment.
I should like paragraph 1 of my report to read: âWelcomes the proposal to establish an EU institute for gender equality and urges the institute to focus intensively on the situation of women suffering multiple discrimination, including Roma womenâ.
Â Â  Mr President, I propose that we delete sectionÂ B entirely â and the Alliance and Liberal Democrat for Europe Group actually voted in favour of this yesterday, â because there is no evidence that it is the patriarchal tradition that prevents Roma women from giving birth whenever they want.
Â Â  . Mr President, this paragraph is not intended to mean anything like that.
It has already been discussed with all the other shadow rapporteurs and we are objecting to this amendment.
Â Â  . Mr President, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has informed me that it will withdraw its amendments, with the exception of AmendmentÂ 10.
Consequently, I am asking my group and all my colleagues to support this amendment that concerns Kosovan women.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to place on record that, when we started voting less than an hour ago, there were 621 Members voting in the Chamber; at the last roll call vote there were 405 â 216 Members have left the Chamber during voting time.
We have no confidence in this ridiculous voting system.
Â Â  Mr President, I simply wanted to know why this report, for which a qualified majority is required, has been postponed to the end of the sitting when we know very well that there are some Members who will be leaving.
Â Â  It is very simple.
A request was made, if I remember correctly, at the beginning of Voting Time by MrÂ Swoboda and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, to which MrÂ Hughes also belongs.
That request was accepted, given that there was no objection on the part of the House and, consequently it was moved, because MrÂ Hughes was supposed to be coming later.
I am very sorry; the matter could have been raised at the end and the vote could have been deferred.
However, it was not raised and as such we are keeping to the agenda.
Â Â  . Mr President, you are quite right, I was at a meeting in Luxembourg this morning and had to dash back for this vote.
I am therefore grateful, in one sense, that the vote was deferred.
On the other hand, however, no one could perhaps have foreseen such a catastrophic reduction in the numbers present.
I will be guided by your services, but if memory serves me correctly, there is a rule by which I can request deferral of the final vote until the next voting time.
If that is the case, I would like to so request.
Â Â  â Mr President, if I understand the rapporteur rightly, he would like us, by reason of the unsatisfactory state of our proceedings, for which we all share responsibility, to adjourn the vote to the next part-session and call it a day for now.
The result of the whole thing â not just the final vote, but also the vote on the individual motions â means that this can be described as a procedural mistake.
It is the rule that those things that are subject to codecision should be dealt with at the beginning of a vote.
We have not observed our own rule, and that has been shown to be a mistake.
â That concludes Voting Time.
Â Â  . In view of the importance of the report, I voted it, but I do subscribe to the reference to tax harmonisation contained in an otherwise excellent report.
As there was only a single vote available to us, I could not register my concern on the âharmonisationâ proposal separate to the final vote.
Â Â  . I wish to congratulate MrÂ Chatzimarkakis on his important and timely report on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP) (2007-2013), to which I lend my full support.
I particularly welcome the idea of gearing the CIP towards potential applicants, in other words its direct beneficiaries.
The potential applicant must have the opportunity, prior to making an application, to obtain sufficient information about the types of support offered under the CIP.
I also agree with the rapporteur that there needs to be a one-stop shop for the CIP to facilitate contact with the stakeholders.
The rapporteur is also right when he says that the application procedure needs to be simplified.
Lastly, I should like to highlight the importance of this Framework Programme for the SMEs of various regions of the EU and in particular those of the EU's outermost regions.
They stand to benefit from this important Framework Programme, which is aimed at helping them to overcome the serious obstacles that hinder them, under Article 299(2) of the EC Treaty.
Â Â  .
I support the content of this report, however I do not feel that Amendment 21 proposed by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, which calls on the European Commission to identify measures to coordinate Member States' fiscal policy and taxation, has any place in a report which purports to encourage innovation and competitiveness; on the contrary it is only by fostering a greater sense of competitiveness between SMEs and other businesses across the EU in terms of their differing fiscal obligations and other variable market conditions that a truly competitive and innovative market will become a reality for all European businesses.
Â Â  .Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are at the economic heart of our countries, the real creators of jobs and of wealth.
That is why we can only commend the rapporteurâs concern to place the emphasis on them in this Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme.
In the face of todayâs fierce global economic competition, very often what enables SMEs to survive is technological progress, small as it may be, which is always costly and continuously needing to be worked towards.
That is why we should like access to this programme for small organisations to become more than just a pious hope.
Information on the support they can claim must target small enterprises effectively, and not only those that have the resources to finance specialised services in the quest for grants.
The rules for participation in these programmes must be really simple and transparent, and must not give rise to the prohibitive costs of compiling reports for SMEs.
Consistency and complementarity with other European programmes and, in particular, with the Seventh Framework Programme for research and development, must be guaranteed.
The demand for better Community regulation that is simpler and more in accordance with the subsidiarity principle must cease to be, as it has been for the last 20 years, the slogan repeated over and over again but never applied.
We shall see how it is when we use it.
Â Â  . I fully support all initiatives to foster the development and growth of the SME sector in developing countries.
However, this report could not be supported because the implementation of EU practices and policies has in many cases resulted in the impoverishment of developing countries.
UKIP strongly believes developing countries would be better served by agreements with individual nation states.
Â Â  There is no doubt that small and medium-sized enterprises play a very large role in countriesâ economies.
In developing countries in which there are no large companies, it is of course more important to ensure that there is an institutional framework that makes it possible for small and medium-sized enterprises to operate.
It is not, however, the task of the European Parliament to dictate what conditions should apply in the developing countries.
Every state, both in the EU and in the rest of the world, has the right to own and shape its own development.
I have therefore voted against this report today.
