I was pleased to see the announcement of a new approach to implementation of the principle of subsidiarity and independent assessment of the consequences of proposed legislation to avoid mistakes in future.
The proposals for new legislation to improve the situation of women, especially in reconciling the demands of family and working life - which is an important step towards combating the decline in Europe's natural increase rate - are also very welcome.
in writing. - (PT) Among the many aspects that warrant criticism on this subject, I would like to focus on one of the priorities for 2008, described by the President of the Commission as one of the most significant: the ratification of the proposal for a Treaty on European Union.
The majority of the EP 'welcomes the Commission's commitment to supporting the ratification of the Reform Treaty', 'urges the Commission ... to intensify its efforts to develop a more effective communication policy in order to achieve a better understanding by citizens of EU action ... with a view to preparing the way for ratification of the Reform Treaty and the European elections in 2009' and 'calls on the Commission to set out clearly how it intends to put into practice the content of its ... priorities, particularly the priority relating to the Reform Treaty'.
In view of the inadmissible role played by the Commission during the referendums on the so-called 'European constitution' conducted in 2005, such intentions, long proclaimed and now reaffirmed, will, if they are carried out, represent a genuine interference in the process of ratification which is a matter for each Member State.
What a contradiction on the part of the President of the Commission who, when asked about the process of ratification, replied that it was for each Member State to decide, but who specifically makes it one of his priorities to meddle with that decision!
in writing. - (PT) Since it was impossible to secure private funding, as originally planned, to supplement the financing of the 'Galileo' project, the European Union 'decided' that it should be financed entirely with public capital, notably from the Community budget.
This is the reason for the amendment to the Interinstitutional Agreement (IIA) - which established the Financial Framework for 2007-2013 - increasing the ceiling for authorisations granted under subheading 1a (competitiveness for growth) for the years 2008 to 2013 to a total of EUR 1 600 million at current prices, at the cost of under-budgeting and under-implementing the items under heading 2 ('preservation and management of natural resources', namely agriculture, fisheries and the environment) in 2007.
With this revision of the IIA and the mobilisation of the Flexibility Instrument, the EU is securing the future of its great 'priority' by guaranteeing its funding.
It still remains to be seen whether, once the 'Galileo' project is completed - completed, it should be noted, with public funding - it will not be 'offered' at some later date to private capital, on the basis of some public-private partnership for example, with the public party bearing the costs and private capital making the profits.
in writing. - Do not support the creation of a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base.
in writing. - (RO) I am in favour of adopting the European Commission's legislative programme for next year and I believe it reflects the political priorities of the European Union very well.
Nevertheless, the legislative proposals the Commission is preparing regarding the legislation of private companies and small and medium-sized companies should not affect the Member States policies that have significantly contributed to the economic growth over the last years, such as the single tax rate.
Also, the recent communication of the European Commission regarding the "Health Check" of the Common Agricultural Policy is a good basis for interinstitutional negotiation.
For this purpose, the European Commission must suspend legislative proposals fundamentally amending provisions of the European Commission until the conclusion of debates between the European institutions and Member States.
Last but not least, I regret the absence of legislative initiatives in the field of common visa policy, as regards the reciprocity of granting free movement of persons between the European Union and third countries.
I remind the European Commission that 12 Member States, representing over 100 million citizens of the European Union, are still excluded from the Visa Waiver Program for the United States of America.
in writing. - (PL) As a member of the ACP-EU Parliamentary Assembly, I wish to support the results of last week's EU-Africa summit meeting in Lisbon.
At the Parliamentary Assembly's last session in Kigali we called for prudence and the avoidance of hasty further regulation of relations between the EU and Africa.
Clearly, the Joint EU-Africa Strategy must take account of the interests of both partners, and cooperation should not take place at the expense of either of them.
The fact that the European Union is the African countries' most serious economic partner - and that most aid to Africa comes from Europe - also imposes a special responsibility on the Union.
That was made clear in the Joint Statement of the European and Pan-African Parliaments, which rightly called for greater involvement of both bodies in shaping future relations between the two continents.
The European Parliament has clearly stated its support for the Kigali Declaration of 22 November 2007, calling for extension of the deadline for concluding negotiations on a new EU-ACP trade agreement, for the agreement to be a prudent one, and suggesting that the rigorous demands of the WTO need to be relaxed.
It is good that the priorities set until the next summit in 2009 refer not only to peace, security, human rights, energy, climate change and migration, but also to combating poverty through employment, investment in health care, and education.
in writing. - (PT) If there were any doubts about the EU's real intentions with regard to the free trade agreements it proposes to establish with the ACP (African, Caribbean and Pacific) Group of States, agreements which are described as 'economic partnership agreements' (EPAs) and which were much in evidence at the recent EU-Africa summit because some African countries refused to sign them, a reading of the resolution that has now been approved would suffice to explain them.
However, JoÃ£o Cravinho, Portugal's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation, as President of the Council, had already made things quite clear at the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly at Kigali on 21 November.
Although obliged to retreat (for the moment), the EU sought to counter the resistance by coming up with a 'proposal to negotiate' the EPAs 'in two phases, starting with trade in goods' and proceeding later 'to include other areas, such as services and investment', at the same time promising millions and millions of euros as a pledge of the ACP countries' sovereignty and independence (economic and, soon, political).
That is the object of the 'General Affairs and External Relations' Council decision of 17 November 2007.
The majority of the EP applauds and supports the decision.
As for us, we denounce and oppose such intentions and policies, by which the EU seeks to recolonise the ACP countries economically.
in writing. - (DE) I welcome the fact that a large percentage of the European Parliament supports the substance of the Kigali Declaration on Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) which was jointly formulated in Rwanda by Members of Parliament from European, African, Caribbean and Pacific countries.
I am disappointed, however, that a jointly negotiated text which was approved by the Members of the European Parliament and the parliamentarians from the ACP countries at the ACP-EU meeting in Kigali has suddenly been rejected by the EPP-ED and Liberal Groups in Strasbourg.
I firmly believe this sends entirely the wrong signal in the context of negotiations on an issue which is of vital importance to the ACP countries.
in writing. - (FR) EPAs must not be seen merely as free-trade agreements in the WTO sense and, above all, they must not undermine the already vulnerable economies of communities overseas.
These agreements must constitute proper partnerships that will make for the establishment of a new economic and trading environment to promote development in all the territories concerned.
I am grateful to the Members of the House for adopting my amendment, which points out that the interests of overseas communities lie at the heart of these preferential, reciprocal agreements with the ACP countries.
It is essential that we take more consistent account of the particular circumstances of the outermost regions in the negotiations, on the basis of Article 299(2) of the Treaty.
Overseas Countries and Territories adjoining the ACP also merit special attention, in accordance with the association agreements that already link them to the Union under Article 299(3) of the Treaty.
Even if the current discussions are problematic, especially on the issues of local markets and the list of sensitive products, I would urge the Commission to seek compromises that respect the particular interests of the outermost regions and the Overseas Countries and Territories in question.

EU/China summit - EU/China human rights dialogue (debate)
The next item is the Commission statement on the EU-China summit.
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I welcome today's debate about the EU-China human rights dialogue.
As you know, the human rights issue was raised and discussed at the very recent summit meeting in Beijing and the joint statement also explicitly refers to it.
I think it is fair to recognise that, although serious concerns remain and need to be addressed, China has also made remarkable progress in the human rights field over the last year.
This is particularly true in the field of social and economic rights but also in some other areas.
There are moves afoot to reform the 're-education through labour' system.
In this respect we welcome the new legislative initiative that is under consideration and we also hope that concrete reforms will be put in place soon.
It is a fundamental principle of human rights not to deprive an individual of his or her liberty without due justice and a fair trial.
China is also working to implement the recommendations of the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture.
For example, the Ministry of Justice has recently directed courts not to rely on confessions on their own as sufficient evidence of guilt, as such confessions can sometimes be made as a result of torture by police or detention personnel.
Similarly, China is initiating specific training measures targeted at these groups of public order personnel.
We are also pleased to note the progress made with respect to the Supreme People's Court now exercising full review power over death penalty sentences issued by lower courts.
And we understand that the result is a reduction in the number of effective death sentences and executions.
This is gratifying for the European Union.
As you know, it has long been a priority area of intervention.
Nevertheless - and now of course I also have to say a few negative things - the Commission remains concerned by the situation of human rights in China in general and more specifically in the field of civil and political rights.
We particularly have in mind here freedom of expression, religion and association and the protection of the rights of minorities, for instance in Tibet and in the province of Xinjiang.
In this context, the repression of human rights defenders remains a key concern.
Exercising the right to speak freely often leads to beatings, to house arrest or even to terms of imprisonment.
Access to the internet - the right to information - is closely monitored and restricted and those, for instance, who speak up in favour of greater autonomy for Tibet receive disproportionately long terms of imprisonment.
The use of state secrecy legislation as well as other loosely defined criminal provisions facilitates the prosecution of those who speak or publish freely.
The Commission therefore urges the Chinese Government to permit expressions of all forms of opinion.
This is also, we think, a very important factor for how the international public views China, particularly next year in the run-up to the Olympics, when all eyes will be on China.
History shows that allowing freedom of expression leads, in the long term, to a far more stable society.
We all know that.
All these issues are regularly addressed in the EU-China human rights dialogue.
Therefore, we welcome the fact that the most recent dialogue which was held in October in Beijing allowed a sincere and an in-depth exchange of views on all topics of our concern, with several of the discussions leading to follow-up activity.
It is important to recognise that this dialogue provides an important forum where both parties can openly speak about their genuine concerns while contributing to a better understanding of our differences - and our differences remain notable.
In this context we regret the Chinese decision to withdraw from the Human Rights Seminar in Berlin over the participation of two NGOs and that, for similar reasons, the Seminar could not be held in Beijing recently.
We consider that civil society has a very important role to play and the Seminar provides the appropriate forum for NGOs to make their valuable contributions.
I trust we are able to find a mutually agreed solution so that this important exercise will continue its successful path in the future, as underlined by the EU-China Summit.
Let me close by saying that there are two more important human rights issues which we regularly raise with the Chinese side as a matter of high priority.
One is the ratification by China of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the other one is the release of those who were imprisoned at the time of the Tiananmen Square demonstrations or who later commemorated the 1989 events.
Decisive action on both sides would send a clear positive signal and would be highly welcome.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Madam President, I should like to thank Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner for that statement.
I think it is very important, following the EU-China summit - and particularly the EU-China human rights dialogue - that there should be an opportunity for Members of this House to examine the outcome.
I do not want to spend time on the EU-China summit.
I want to talk about the human rights dialogue, because that was what took me to Beijing last May when, jointly with Ms Flautre, I was preparing a report on the reform of the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights.
I want this afternoon to speak for those who cannot speak for themselves.
That, of course, is the vast majority of people in China, who want change and reform.
But that movement is led by, among others, Gao Zhisheng, a Christian lawyer who has disappeared from his home in Beijing, where he was being held under house arrest following his conviction for 'subversion' this time last year.
While I know that his name was among those raised in the dialogue, I think that one of the problems that we find in this House is in relation to the dialogue.
While I note that the Commissioner says that it was a sincere and in-depth exchange of views - and I am sure that was true on the side of the Europeans - I am not convinced that would be the case on the side of the Chinese.
In my experience - since the time when I was EU-China rapporteur back in 1997, 10 years ago when this process began - there has been absolutely no product in human rights terms from China in the sense that people's lives have been improved or prisoners have been released or torture has stopped or the massive imprisonment reported by Harry Wu from the Laogai Foundation has ended.
He estimates that there are 6.8 million people in one form of detention or other in China today, many of them there for religious convictions - and we think especially here of the Falun Gong practitioners, who are blameless but who are tortured for their beliefs and, in many cases, are dying.
I would like also to reflect on the imminence of the Olympic Games.
One should not forget that Article 1 of the Olympic Charter states that countries should enjoin 'universal fundamental ethical principles'.
That means only one thing: that China cannot be held to be an appropriate host for these Games, especially since nothing has fundamentally changed since 2001.
I hope all Groups will support the joint motion, which calls for an assessment by the IOC of China's compliance with the terms which were agreed back in 2001.
I fear they will be found wanting.
My view is that the Olympics should be transferred forthwith to Athens and remain there forever.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Madam President, to come straight to the point, I believe the Olympic Games should go ahead in China, because we have a good opportunity to use these very games to step up our dialogue with China.
That is in the joint statement too, Mr McMillan-Scott, and if you hold the opinion you have been expressing, you are against the joint statement.
Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, one of your former opposite numbers, Madeleine Albright, observed when she was US Secretary of State that it was naturally far more difficult to raise human rights issues in China than in Burma, because in China geopolitical factors were part of the equation.
It is a fact that we need China as a partner in the quest for a solution to many global problems.
That, however, must not prevent us from raising the question of human rights and discussing it in great depth, though not necessarily in the tone of schoolmasters or schoolmistresses who know it all.
I am very pleased that the Charter of Fundamental Rights has been signed today, because many speakers have made the point that we have no right to speak about human rights issues unless we ourselves have a very good record of respecting human rights.
We, indeed, are firmly convinced that it is in China's interests not to trample human rights underfoot but to respect them properly.
China wants stability.
How is China to remain stable if the question of human rights is not raised more emphatically?
We do not want China to crumble.
It makes no sense to build up Europe while seeking to destroy China, but failure to respect human rights puts China's stability at risk.
We want China to be governed in accordance with the principles of social justice.
In the context of a monumental growth process, to which Mr Barroso also referred, the only way to safeguard stability is to take full account of social factors.
It is impossible, however, to strive for social justice if human rights are not respected, if people cannot form trade unions or launch popular initiatives.
We want China to focus more sharply on environmental matters, because the environment is a major common global asset.
We know that many initiatives are taking shape in China for the purpose of mass protest against the violation of minimum environmental standards.
It would be a good thing for China if the nation listened to those voices.
It would be a step forward for China.
For these reasons I believe it is not a matter of European arrogance but of protecting our common interests.
In the interests of China we shall raise the question of human rights, and enlightened representatives of the Chinese political system would do well to listen to us and to this resolution, which is in China's interests and which would help China to advance, something it cannot do unless it respects human rights.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, I much admire the contribution of China to the development of world civilisation.
In terms of technology, in terms of society and in terms of culture, China has probably contributed more than any other country to the development of humankind.
I regret that China's growing economic maturity is not accompanied by a growing political maturity.
But I regret, too, that the European Union is not doing more to push China in the right direction.
Two days ago, on the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Union proclaimed its commitment to the 'promotion and protection of human rights throughout the world as a cornerstone of our external action policy'.
And yet, two weeks ago, Messrs Barroso and Socrates left the summit early, having secured Europe's economic interests, leaving officials to negotiate the conclusions - conclusions which, unsurprisingly, made little mention of human rights, supported the lifting of the arms embargo and opposed Taiwan's bid to join the United Nations.
They did much to undermine Mr Solana's carefully crafted words the previous month.
I wonder what the world is coming to when the European Union, the self-styled protector of universal, interdependent and indivisible human rights, fails to speak out clearly against one of the world's worst human rights abusers.
I suspect that both the Chinese and others may come to regret the decision to host the Olympic Games in Beijing.
The Chinese authorities themselves promised that they would bring a greater climate of freedom and openness.
And yet figures from Human Rights Watch suggest that abuses have increased in the last seven years.
Not only does China continue to execute more people than the rest of the world combined but it has clamped down dramatically on internal dissent and media freedom in advance of the Games.
These developments violate the spirit of the Olympic Charter.
They are in direct contravention of commitments made by the Beijing authorities themselves in the Host City Contract which they signed with the International Olympic Committee.
That contract has not been made public.
Why?
Because, if the world saw the complete and total disjunction between Chinese promises and Chinese practices, we would have no choice but to boycott Beijing in the same way that we boycotted apartheid South Africa.
I do not believe in boycotts.
I have also maintained that engaging with a China committed to reform and opening would bring greater fruits than empty threats.
But President Hu Jintao has to accept that a deal is a deal.
The Host City Contract, the human rights clause in the Chinese Constitution, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights - these are promises made to China's citizens.
If China wants the Olympics to prove its legitimacy and credibility to the world, then in return it must prove that it is willing to honour its human rights commitments: by improving media freedom in line with the Olympic pledges, by suspending the death penalty in line with United Nations demands, by ceasing its support for military dictators from Burma to Darfur and by allowing elections by universal suffrage in Hong Kong.
That is how China can win its place at the heart of the international community.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Madam President, the People's Republic of China is a country to be found on every list of infringements of human rights, whether it is a matter of freedom of speech and association, compulsory abortion, disappearances, torture, religious freedom or threats of aggression against Taiwan.
China continues to persecute followers of the Catholic Church.
A report by David Kilgour, the Canadian Government's former secretary of state for Asia, shows that one of the most persecuted groups since 1999 is Falun Gong, whose members have organs forcibly removed in Chinese work camps.
People whose only crime was to meet with a vice-president of this Parliament, Mr McMillan-Scott, have recently disappeared without trace.
Meanwhile, our trade relations are blooming.
China is extending its influence in Africa and will soon be inviting millions of guests to the Olympic Games.
I cannot understand the absence so far of the most obvious response: the free world must boycott the 2008 Olympics.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FR) Madam President, we are talking today to Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, and that is welcome.
However, at the 10th EU-China summit in Beijing on 28 November, the European Union was represented by its President, by the Trade Commissioner and by the Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner.
It is true that, since 2000, trade between the European Union and China has increased by 150%; it is also true that it has become much harder to produce statistics on the deteriorating human rights situation in China.
There is nothing taboo about discussing human rights issues at the same time as trade issues.
There is an obvious link between them, for example in relation to the freedom to join a trade union, and the ability of workers in China to mobilise and demand better working conditions.
The general attitude we encounter is deplorable, all the more so because its effect is to make us waste time: the decision taken in 2001 promised a new openness in China and progress on human rights and democracy; the Chinese people are waiting for that promise to be kept and they are looking to us.
They have been disappointed in their hope that openness would result from China's staging the Olympic Games, and the sense of disappointment is bitter.
Not only has the run-up to the Games so far brought harsher repression but - even more regrettably - the organisation of the Games has itself had unforeseen effects and has been used as a pretext for serious human rights violations.
I am thinking here of the cases of forced expropriation and of the exploitation of migrant labour.
All this may not be surprising, for the dissident Hu Jia informs us that the head of security in Beijing is also the person in charge of organising the Olympic Games there.
Perhaps we shall get round to expressing surprise or even dismay about that state of affairs when the intimidation and repression of foreign journalists - which has already begun - becomes even more drastic, for they are already being prevented from working.
The arrest of two Agence France-Presse journalists on 12 September, for example, shows that the rules introduced in January 2007 are being applied only patchily and only insofar as the persons concerned cause no embarrassment to the regime.
The undertakings given by China are a dead letter; indeed, it is falling so far short of its commitments that it has resorted to compiling blacklists.
There is currently a blacklist of 42 categories of people regarded as persona non grata during the Olympic Games, ranging from the DalaÃ¯ Lama to followers of Falun Gong and including dissidents.
In January this year, negotiations began on a new EU-China framework agreement.
That is welcome because a new agreement also means a new 'human rights and democracy' clause.
It creates fresh scope for discussing human rights concerns with the Chinese authorities.
However, 2007 was also the year that saw the cancellation of a legal seminar to prepare for the human rights dialogue because the Chinese authorities refused to allow two particular NGOs to participate - one of them the well-known organisation represented by human rights campaigner Sharon Hom.
It was certainly salutary to find the Union taking a firm stand on that occasion.
At the same time, of course, we have to ask whether seminars like this can continue.
Our position is that the two things must not be mutually exclusive.
It is very important to go on holding legal seminars.
Equally, however, we cannot permit the Chinese authorities to dictate who may take part in them.
(NL) Ladies and gentlemen, in past decades this Chamber has been the scene of many ringing declarations on human rights.
The proclamation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights has once again made us focus on what the essence of Europe really is.
We are a community of values, based on solidarity, tolerance and respect for human rights.
At least, that is the theory, but the reality is rather different.
And the European Union's watchword on human rights should really be rather different.
In the last few weeks it has been abundantly clear that those who are sick of hearing about human rights are often the same people who apply that other principle of Realpolitik, namely erst das Fressen, dann die Moral, or 'food first, then morality', as Bertolt Brecht put it.
In Paris Nicolas Sarkozy, in exchange for lucrative contracts, is rolling out the red carpet for a mass murderer who just a few days ago sought to legitimise terrorism, boasting that he did not waste words talking about human rights in his country.
In Lisbon a bloodthirsty tyrant like Mugabe is received with full honours, because in Africa too we have to look after our commercial interests.
In China we are pursuing the same course.
Last year Amnesty International reported that Beijing was lagging behind on crucial issues such as the death penalty, judicial procedures, press freedom and freedom of movement for human rights activists.
In the meantime the Chinese capital is undergoing a slick clean-up, says Amnesty International.
Re-education by forced labour and imprisonment without charge are now being used to punish offences like the unauthorised posting of bills, driving an unlicensed taxi and begging, to name just a few.
The human rights activists will be silenced, but the stadia will gleam and sparkle next year, ladies and gentlemen.
A lot of European worthies will be jockeying for front seats at the opening of the Games.
And when they get home they will doubtless continue the fight against extremism in Europe.
It is enough to make you sick.
(LT) It is impossible to deny that since 1998, when we saw the start of the summit meetings between China and Europe, relations between the EU and China - at political, economic, trade and scientific research level - have been developing intensely and have grown into a strategic partnership.
However, strategic partnerships, as we understand them, are based on common values, respect for democracy and human rights.
Respect for human rights has always been and continues to be the foundation on which the EU is built.
It is not a short-lived declaration, as the EU's history over more than half a century has undoubtedly proved.
It is time that all the countries, the EU partners, understood that there are some things that the EU would never give up and would never abandon.
I would therefore like to point out that several hours ago in this very room a historic document - the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights - was signed.
At this point I would like to mention the fact that certain issues have a negative impact on the development of EU-China relations and the key to resolving these problems is in most cases in the hands of the Chinese authorities.
During our talks with the Chinese representatives, even during negotiations on trade and economic cooperation agreements, we have always remembered and will never forget the fact that people in China are continuing to suffer in prison for their political views, for their religion or for belonging to ethnic minority groups, and for economic crimes, such as tax evasion, they receive the death penalty.
In recent years, with the approaching Olympic Games in Beijing, we have learned of other 'developments' such as the fact that people's accommodation is being demolished without compensation being awarded, in order to make way for the construction of Olympic structures, and the existence of a list of 42 categories of people not to be allowed to attend the Olympic games, including the Dalai Lama, his followers and human rights defenders.
I can say only one thing: this is absolutely out of line with the traditions and spirit of the Olympic Games.
My suggestion would therefore be to cancel these lists, which do China no credit at all, and ensure that in honour of the Olympic Games all political prisoners and prisoners of conscience are released and a death penalty moratorium is declared.
I regret the fact that the EU-China summit meeting in Beijing has failed to become a historical event and that the participants were not the sort of politicians capable of taking EU-China relations to a new level.
Just one thing was missing: greater consideration and respect for people and their rights.
Madam President, I speak in this debate on the EU-China summit and the EU-China human rights dialogue, although from some of the resolutions tabled by political groups in this House you would not have known that the first half of this debate existed.
It is quite right that we raise with the Chinese the issue of human rights.
The human rights situation in China is far from adequate.
China continues to use the death penalty, as Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner stated in her opening statement.
They repress campaigning organisations for Tibetan autonomy, religious groups outside a very narrow range of officially permitted groups, as well as others who promote their regions, promote press freedom and try and organise trade unions.
We also have the insurmountable barrier with respect to the hundreds of millions of migrant workers in China who try to organise themselves to end exploitation and to promote decent labour standards.
Yet there is a complete refusal on the part of many in this House to acknowledge any of the progress that China has made over the past two decades.
The human rights situation in China in my view, although far from adequate, is far better than it was back in the days of Tiananmen Square.
As the Commissioner stated, the death penalty, for example, now requires confirmation by the Chinese Supreme Court.
My own experience is that in China now there is a large degree of freedom of thought but not freedom to organise, because that still is the sine qua non in terms of what China and the Chinese authorities actually forbid.
We must continue to press China on these issues, but a refusal to recognise any progress positively discourages those progressive and liberal forces within the regime who are trying to push further, because they get no recognition for what they have done already.
China is now a global economic, industrial and political power.
The EU needs to have a critical engagement that rightly criticises China where it has gone wrong, where it must go further, at the same time as we engage in a dialogue on tackling global warming, the negative impacts of globalisation, African development and the fight against terrorism.
(NL) Madam President, I very much welcome a strategic partnership with China.
I am very glad that we now have more than just economic ties alone and that cultural exchanges between us, for example, have grown enormously in recent years.
I am very happy to see so much attention being given to the political dimension, and I will cite one example.
Africa: we must keep up our liaison with China on its Africa policy and we now have a forum in which to do so.
I am pleased that Mr Michel is shortly going to Beijing to discuss that and other matters.
And I find it a very good thing that we are increasingly working together on economic issues.
But I am very concerned by imbalances in our economic relationship.
For example I find no hint of the fact that we should do more to pass on our experience of our Single Market to the Chinese who, in this regard, might improve their own market considerably.
The same goes for regional policy, for the elimination of regional differences.
We have experience in these areas.
We have learnt a few lessons.
But I do not think the Chinese are so keen to play ball here.
Mr Mandelson has said that there is a fair bit of uncertainty about investing in China, and that this damages our exports to China, and Chinese economic growth too.
He is right, I think.
You need the rule of law, certainty, in order for the economy to prosper.
On matters of intellectual property, product safety or capital management.
But you also need the rule of law when it comes to individual human rights, of course.
That is just as important, if not far more so.
I am glad we are to have a report on the human rights dialogue.
I think we should have one every time.
Like you, Commissioner, I see a number of hopeful signs, but the European Parliament must maintain the focus on one or two things which have not yet been resolved: freedom of expression, policy on minorities, forced labour which regrettably still continues, abuse of power of which regrettably there is too much, and the death penalty which still exists.
We as the European Parliament must continue to emphasise these things, and it is something we must do day in, day out.
(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe we are faced time and again with the question of the right way to proceed in our political dealings with China.
Mr Sterckx has just spoken again of strategic partnership, and rightly so.
I find that an absolutely desirable aim.
But we must be realistic, and we are clearly not yet on that level at the present time, because we do not have a foundation of shared values - human rights, fair treatment of minorities, rejection of the death penalty - on which a genuine strategic partnership could be built.
I believe it was absolutely right - and I say this advisedly as a Green German MEP - for Angela Merkel to meet the Dalai Lama, because it shows that we mean what we say about respect for human rights.
On the other hand, there is something I do not find at all right.
President Sarkozy, when he recently spoke here, told us that human rights must be the hallmark of the European Union, only to travel to China three weeks later and not make an issue of human rights there.
These are European double standards, and they are something we must not tolerate.
I fervently believe that our dialogue with China, which I support and which we must have the political will to pursue, cannot be all fawning sweet talk but must also include confrontation.
If we combine these and negotiate with China in a self-assured manner, we must also express unveiled criticism.
In the context of the Olympic Games too, the Chinese have to achieve the goals they set for themselves, and we Europeans should be bold and frank and confront the Chinese with our criticism when the need arises.
Madam President, a few hours ago the President of the European Parliament signed the Charter of Fundamental Rights and declared that 'we have a moral and political obligation to defend human dignity.
This applies to each human being in this world.'
And the Portuguese Prime Minister stated that 'the Charter is part of the EU foreign policy'.
Let me turn to China.
We understand that, by becoming the host of the Beijing Olympics, the Chinese Government committed itself to fully respect both the Olympic ideal of human dignity and internationally guaranteed human rights.
The European Parliament now has to conclude that there has been a recent increase in political persecutions related directly to the Olympics.
In addition, more people are being executed in China than in the rest of the world combined - up to 10 000 a year.
Defenders of human dignity are being arrested, and up to seven million people are being tortured in the notorious Laogai camps.
What should we do?
I think the answer was provided here yesterday by the Sakharov Prize Winner Osman, who told us to put more pressure on the respective governments: to do something concrete.
There is an understanding of the sin of omission - responsibility for what we could and might have done but failed to do.
It is not enough to voice our concerns; it is time to apply the principle of conditionality and to declare, as our colleague, Mr Watson, told us: a deal is a deal.
The only way to make the Communist dictators in China respect their citizens more is to send a signal that we take our own values of solidarity and human dignity seriously enough to make dictators feel real pain for their abuses and arrogance.
(PL) Madam President, the European Parliament has stressed the infringement of human rights in China, and the lack of democracy in that country, on many occasions.
These are obvious matters.
Only yesterday, in discussing the European Union's human rights report for the past year, we spoke of the lack of human rights, democracy and the rule of law in China.
On the other hand, it does not seem right to me to ignore the changes for the better that are taking place in China.
In particular, the coming year of the Olympic Games should be used by the European Union to pressurise the Chinese authorities towards liberalisation, democratisation, the rule of law and the release of all political prisoners.
On 20 November a delegation of the European Parliament's Subcommittee on Human Rights to the United Nations Organisation in New York met with Liu Zhenmin, China's representative to the UN.
I consider it to have been a constructive meeting.
The Chinese side showed signs of openness and sensitivity to pressure on human rights and democracy - a fact that was also emphasised by representatives of Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International in talks with the Subcommittee's delegation.
(HU) Madam President, Commissioner, billions of people are awaiting 8 August 2008, the opening of the Olympic Games, with great interest.
Not only sports lovers will be watching, but also those who are expecting progress from China in the area of human rights.
Unfortunately, we cannot be satisfied with the results to date.
The Chinese Communist Party can rejoice, since it must have achieved a lot of success for the legitimisation of power.
But we also have the opportunity to make the most of the period running up to the Olympics and sternly to demand an explanation for the unlawfulness appearing in the area of human rights.
The European Union-China dialogue on human rights has been going on for 24 years.
Unfortunately, its balance is not at all favourable.
There is some progress, for example in the area of application of the death penalty, but in many areas there is a strong sense of backing out, such as freedom of expression, freedom of the press and freedom of the Internet.
In order for us to be able to bring about change, we must also bring about change in the dialogue on human rights.
Firstly, we must say that the dialogue on human rights is not the only forum for raising such problems.
Every Member State is also obliged to act strictly and firmly on these matters in bilateral relations.
Secondly, the presence of civil organisations and transparency of negotiations must be ensured.
Transparency is very important for us to monitor what is happening there.
Since dialogue is not a goal in itself, it is only meaningful if it makes a good contribution to improving the human rights situation in China.
Finally, I would like to speak about the situation of the Uyghur minority.
Little is said about them and they are a forgotten minority.
They are not only afflicted by the general oppression in China, but they are also the victims of ethnic, religious and linguistic discrimination.
I urge you to act in their interests too.
Thank you.
(ES) Madam President, I would like to take this opportunity to issue a couple of reminders to European governments.
The first has to do with the lifting of the arms embargo on China, to which reference has been made on several occasions.
I would like to point out that this House has frequently insisted that the lifting of that ban could only occur when there was genuine and meaningful progress in relation to those apprehended following the Tiananmen Square events of 1989, not progress in general terms, but specifically in relation to that matter, because that is what we are waiting for from the Chinese authorities at this point in time: some meaningful progress which would enable such action to be taken.
Until that time I believe that it would not only be premature, but would convey entirely the wrong message and give Europe a very bad image to lift an embargo which, I repeat, was imposed at the time for very specific reasons which have certainly not been clarified.
The second message, endorsing the opinion of my colleague Mrs TrÃŒpel, is that it is unacceptable for certain European countries to submit, and sometimes succumb, to pressure from the Chinese authorities aimed at preventing them from holding official meetings with important Chinese personalities, in some cases dissidents, or representatives such as the Dalai Lama, in return for assured trade relations with China.
Especially today, when we have signed the Charter of Fundamental Rights, this is something which is completely at odds with the basic ethos which we seek to impose on the European Union.
(PT) At the Summit, Europe spoke clearly about how China is perverting WTO rules, failing to respect workers' rights, exporting products that are harmful to health, pirating technology and impeding European access to the Chinese market.
The Chinese leaders were not used to hearing the EU speak so frankly and they retaliated by holding up the joint declaration for a few days, but the European leadership regrettably failed to keep up the pressure: not only did it make unacceptable concessions on the referendum in Taiwan, it did not contradict the 'One China Policy' and it did not confront Peking on the subject of serious human rights problems.
Because there was not time, President JosÃ© SÃ³crates told Portuguese journalists, sometimes these things are discussed over dinner.
The death penalty and the release of prisoners held since the Tiananmen Square massacre: these are among the reasons why this Parliament is in favour of maintaining the embargo on arms to China.
Arbitrary detention and trial, corruption and forced evictions, persecution and repression of journalists and Internet users, repression of Tibetans and minorities, responsibility for the tragedies in Darfur and Burma: none of these fundamental issues was on the Summit's agenda.
Clearly the EU is not alone in having a duty to call Beijing to account before it holds the 2008 Olympic Games.
If the International Olympic Committee mediates about the quality of the air, why not judge Beijing on respect for the Olympic ideal in its relations with its own citizens and those of other countries?
No one, least of all the EU Council and Commission, can continue to neglect the fight for freedoms and human rights in China.
This is a marathon that will only gain impetus in the context of the 2008 Olympics.
Not only does it affect millions and millions of Chinese, it will have consequences for the whole of humanity.
(DE) Madam President, the human rights dialogue between the EU and China has been taking place twice a year behind closed doors for the last eleven years, and yet it has done nothing to improve the human rights situation in China.
Reports of executions, torture in prisons and labour camps and the oppression of the Tibetans plainly show that we Europeans are not shouldering our responsibility.
The Olympic Games are coming up, and they give China good reason to furnish proof of genuine reforming zeal.
At the same time, we must not practise double standards either.
It is very gratifying that Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel received the Dalai Lama in spite of heavy criticism.
It would only be logical if leaders in Belgium, France and other countries were to do likewise.
The EU is accepted worldwide as the voice of human rights, and it is high time we acted consistently in every context, including that of our dialogue with China.
Madam President, today we are having a debate on the EU-China summit, which took place 10 days ago, and on the 24th Round of the EU-China Human Rights Dialogue, which took place two months ago.
Especially today, let me start with the second one.
Respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms is a core principle of the EU and its policies and it is something that we all strongly care about and support.
But I am one of those who believe that the EU should follow a result-oriented approach in promotion of respect for human rights rather than a purely principled one and, most importantly, we have to accept that the improvements will only come step-by-step.
That does not mean that the EU should hesitate in voicing its criticism and using its power to insist upon democratic reforms.
I am also one of those who care about the high-level product safety that affects 550 million European citizens; who care about trade imbalance, effective market access, intellectual property rights and international competition policies that affect thousands of European companies and millions of European employees; and who care about cooperation on environment protection, international environment governance and climate change that affects the whole population of the Earth.
Because we care about all the above, we strongly support the Commission and Council and its Presidency for addressing, negotiating and stressing continuously each one of the issues in regular dialogue with the Chinese side.
A simple reading of the 18-page joint statement of the last EU-China summit is enough to understand that the complexity, sensitivity and importance in the EU-China cooperation...
(The President cut off the speaker)
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, this debate again shows that societal change takes time, and I think we always have to remember where China has come from.
I think we also have to acknowledge a certain progress, as I said at the beginning.
But, at the same time, it is true that we are not yet where we would like to see China.
Therefore, I think the Human Rights Dialogue - also accompanied by the NGO seminar - remains the cornerstone for addressing our human rights concerns with China.
However, I think we need to be determined but also realistic.
Determined to convince China that it is in its own best interest to establish full respect for human rights across the board.
Realistic, because we need to recognise that only through engagement and long-term effort can we really hope to achieve genuine reforms in China.
In this context, I would also like to say that the continued holding of the NGO seminar is in the mutual interest of both China and the European Union.
This has also just been confirmed by the summit.
I think, therefore, there is a good chance that, back-to-back with the next human rights dialogue under the Slovenian Presidency, we will be able to resume this civil society seminar.
On a few other questions, let me just say that human rights were also mentioned in the joint statement that is there, and I will just read out the first few lines.
'The two sides emphasised their commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights and continued to place a high value on the EU-China human rights dialogue, including the accompanying legal seminar.'
You see: there it is.
They underline the importance of concrete steps in the fields of human rights and affirm their commitment to further strengthening dialogue and so on.
I would also like to say that there are a few concrete points that were highlighted in this discussion on which we want to see progress, such as the Falun Gong.
The situation of Falun Gong followers who have been subject to repression because of their beliefs remains a matter of concern for us.
We raised this issue several times, and more particularly on the occasion of the sessions of the Human Rights Dialogue.
We asked, and will continue to ask, the Chinese authorities to put an end to the harsh treatment imposed on Falun Gong followers.
Concerning the death penalty, I have said before that this issue is high on our agenda, and in this framework we have been urging China - and will continue along these lines - to reduce the scope of capital crimes, with a view to ultimately abolishing the death penalty.
A first step would be to impose a moratorium on implementation.
Then, as I said in my introductory remarks, would come a review of death penalty sentences by the Supreme Court as a first step which would be continuously monitored.
I think the debate has shown very clearly that there is a mixed picture: there is progress, but there is still a lot to be done, and I can only say we will further engage with China in order to encourage China to make progress.
I think the Olympic Games will be a good opportunity for China to show that more progress has been made by then.
I have received six motions for resolutions, tabled in accordance with Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday, 13 December 2007.
Combating the rise of extremism in Europe (debate)
The next item is the Commission statement on combating the rise of extremism in Europe.
Member of the Commission. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all let me express my strong personal concerns about the rise in activities in Europe which have to be attributed to violent and extremist groups and organisations.
In my view, therefore, today's debate is extremely important, because it is not just extremism which leads to terrorist acts - extremism about which we have talked on many occasions in this House - but also those activities and developments which are more properly to be seen as racism, anti-Semitism, xenophobia, nationalist extremism, Islamophobia, all those forms of intolerance which, as I said, are worryingly common in Europe, and which, in my view, are absolutely incompatible with and run entirely counter to the values of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights which we proclaimed this morning.
There can be no doubt that extremism, by its very nature, is divisive and leads to violence.
That is why the first goal, in my view, is a political goal.
That will obviously lead me to mention measures which have more to do with security and policing; however, faced with the problem of extremism and its origins, we need once again to promote a European Union which is ever closer to citizens and therefore more able to pass on messages of tolerance, solidarity and respect for the Charter which, as of today, is one of the cornerstones binding on Member States and on citizens.
I believe that there can never be any justification for extremism; while we have said that many times about terrorism, we also need to say it about racism, for instance, and about xenophobia.
However, we also have to explore the deep-seated origins of extremism and violence.
We have a duty to do so, because we have a duty to introduce European policy measures that can help not just to counter but also to prevent and eradicate extremist developments and activities.
I should like to cite a few examples which, in my opinion, show that a European policy may be genuinely useful and more useful, if I may say so, than a policy which is solely national.
From the point of view of citizens' participation in the political life of Europe, it is very important for that programme - and it is not by chance that the European Commission is financing such a programme on fundamental rights and citizenship - to contain policies and measures encouraging citizens to play more of a role in political life, in the life of the institutions, and therefore, for instance, in events such as the European elections.
2009 offers us a golden opportunity to foster a debate that leads to a large turnout to vote reflecting positive participation in the life of the institutions.
It is nevertheless clear that the other policy measure that we are expecting from Europe and that Europe is keen to promote involves education, especially for the younger generations.
In my view, that - a policy to keep the memories of past tragedies alive in people's minds and to do so among today's younger generations, among students and among young people, even the very young - is also extremely important.
For instance, all the programmes which we support and which I believe should be further encouraged, programmes which keep alive the memory of the victims of all the dictatorships, of all the totalitarian regimes that have devastated Europe in the past, are, in my view, tools that can be put to good use in eradicating extremism and racism; from the history of the concentration camps, for instance, we can draw a lesson for today's young people so that tragedies of that kind never happen again, not just in Europe but in any part of the world.
Then there is another policy measure that I believe we can and must bear in mind: those measures that more generally promote tolerance and dialogue between different cultures and obviously between different religions.
We have two major opportunities, one this year, which is the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All - and we plan to review the initiatives that have taken place during the year - and one next year in 2008, which is the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue, of dialogue between different cultures and between civilisations.
In my view, the 2007 review and the 2008 programme offer a golden opportunity to make people and, I would stress again, younger people, more aware of a spirit of dialogue which enriches, a dialogue through which everyone can grow together.
It is undoubtedly important to keep the public aware of the importance of promoting rights and eradicating extremism, violence and intolerance.
Here, the European Agency for Fundamental Rights has a role to play, which is what we wanted and what this House strongly supported; just as the Vienna monitoring centre on racism, xenophobia and anti-Semitism has in the past been an instrument for a very important sector, the fight against anti-Semitism, the Agency for Fundamental Rights will also be an instrument.
The Agency, as the main protagonist in this field, will have a very important role to play.
There, as you know, we are preparing the multi-annual framework which we are discussing in close cooperation with Mr Cashman, and we take the view that the Agency's multi-annual planning framework will provide us with useful instruments for our common action to prevent extremism.
Over and above that, we obviously have to react: while those are all important prevention policies, we also need to react.
I fought personally, in the Council of Ministers as well, for a European law - and we reached agreement on this last April - for a European law under which acts motivated by racism and xenophobia can be punished and those committing such acts are punished in the same way in any country of the European Union.
It is not just the physical act, but also concrete incitement, the dissemination of hatred, those messages that frankly cannot be confused with freedom of expression which is a sacred right for all of us.
Here, we are speaking of concrete incitement to act, to commit violence.
That framework decision was agreed by the Member States last April.
Think of those awful manifestations of racism: at sports events, during football matches where people take the opportunity to shout neo-Nazi slogans, those are the kinds of act that the framework decision - which we genuinely wanted and which we agreed with the German Presidency - will punish.
I say will punish, using the future, as unfortunately, and this is an appeal to your sensibility, between April and now the reservations of the national parliaments of some Member States have not been withdrawn with the result that the procedure leading to the entry into force of this European law to punish racism and xenophobia has been blocked.
I say this with absolute respect for the national parliaments; however, as the government holding the presidency of the Council of Ministers has given its agreement, I believe that it must take steps with its own parliament, so that its reservation is withdrawn as soon as possible, and we can finally ensure that the framework decision comes into force after three and a half years of lengthy discussion.
In conclusion, ladies and gentlemen, we already have legislation in other sectors which punishes discrimination based on race and ethnicity, and that legislation will undoubtedly be respected with the supervision, if I may put it that way, of the European Commission which is responsible for ensuring compliance with European law.
I would point out, for instance, the recent directive on 'borderless' audiovisual services which very clearly establishes, from its entry into force, that audiovisual services must not contain any incitement to hatred on grounds of sexual orientation, race, religion or nationality.
It is precisely to achieve all that that policing measures are not enough, criminal law is not enough, prosecutions are not enough: what is needed is a deep-seated culture of individual rights, of value for the human person!
What we said this morning when we were celebrating the European Charter of Fundamental Rights!
I believe that this is one of the policies, at a time when we are preparing to ratify the Treaty of Lisbon, through which Europe can offer the world a lesson on the ways in which these hateful crimes against the human person can be eradicated.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is scarcely believable.
Four or five weeks ago I was invited to attend a counter-demonstration to a demonstration organised by parties of the far Right in my region.
There were only 30 extremists demonstrating, whereas a large gathering of more than a thousand had assembled to demonstrate against them.
In those circumstances, when you stand in front of those right-wing extremists, you say to yourself, 'This is scarcely believable'.
After that century in Europe, how can anyone revert to extremism, go back to strutting about full of hatred and arrogance and agitating against others?
The debate we are holding today is welcome and important.
Extremism is a cancer in our society.
Time and again we politicians appeal to people's moral courage, expecting them to rise up and protest against this extremism.
I believe it is also time to give thanks that such moral courage exists in abundance, that so many people do rise up in protest.
What is extremism?
Let me stress that, when we speak of banning political parties, of banning the public expression of opinions and positions, it goes without saying that such measures must not be based on political judgements.
They must be based on an objective criterion.
We have defined that objective criterion today in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which sets out the essence of our basic values.
If parties or politicians attack those values, the courts must decide whether their actions are illegal and, if so, impose a ban.
What should be done if candidates of extremist parties are elected, if such parties win seats?
Firstly, there must be no cooperation with these parties, and I am grateful to the Socialist Members, who have expelled their Slovakian member party from their ranks for cooperating with extremists.
Secondly, we must not overlook the fact that such electoral successes stem from public dissatisfaction, and we must not respond to them by maligning voters but rather by addressing underlying issues.
Thirdly, I wish to emphasise that extremism often begins with small steps in the party landscape too, and we must be aware of this.
My message is therefore 'Do not let it take root!'
Political extremism exists on the Left and Right, and both are equally bad. That needs to be emphasised.
Europe has experienced extremism, and Europe has suffered from extremism.
Progress has been made in the fight against extremism.
It is a fight that is worth waging.
And it is a fight that we shall ultimately win.
Mr. Chairman, Commissioner Fratini, Thank you for the understanding and the presentation on the intentions of the Commission.
I find it symbolic that precisely today, when the Charter of Fundamental Rights was signed, we are discussing a topic directly related to it.
For the growing extremism, the growing influence of extreme right-wing parties and organisations is a direct threat to the existence of the European Union.
It might sound too strong but our Union is based on clear principles and its existence is possible thanks to the fact that peace, solidarity, tolerance, mutual respect among ethnic and religious communities, and the peaceful co-existence of nations prevailed in Europe 50 years ago.
Today, the extreme right-wing attacks exactly these principles; it attacks the very heart of the European Union, without which it could not possibly exist.
But our Union is not an abstract construct; it is not just another administrative level of governance.
It is a union whose mission is to defend and protect the values underlying the whole world.
Willing or unwilling, prepared or unprepared, we have to understand that there are people deprived of fundamental rights, suffering from political reprisals, oppressed by non-democratic regimes or discriminated against on the basis of race, ethnic origin and religion in all parts of the world.
And, in all parts of the world, there is the hope that the European Union will support them and that the spirit of tolerance, guaranteed civil rights and social security can reach their country, too.
Can we be powerful and convincing in the outside world if we fail to cope with the problems in our own backyard?
How can we explain to the people who pin their last hopes on us that immigrants die just because of their origin, that ethnic minorities are subjected to systematic discrimination, that partisan ideologies challenge the equality of women or define homosexualism as a disease?
How can we explain that we are on the way of forgetting the gloomiest pages of our history and that young people praise Hitler and anti-Semitism is turning into the vogue of the day?
I cannot accept this and neither can my collegues Socialists.
I believe that there is no political group in this Parliament to remain indifferent to the fact that right-wing extremism, racism, xenophobia are gaining new grounds.
Didn't we become witness today how a historic landmark in the development of the European Union was disgraced in a vulgar manner by a noisy minority that could come back stronger, more aggressive and better organised in 2009?
Under the hypocritical demand for a referendum, it challenged not merely the Charter of Fundamental Rights but fundamental rights themselves.
It is this behaviour that we see also in many national parliaments encourages extremists who would resort to yet another punitive action tomorrow, inspired by this political circus.
We must name problems very clearly and seek solutions together.
Therefore we shall put this issue on the agenda of the Parliament over and over again.
Because extremism is an all-European challenge which necessitates the cocerted efforts at the European, national, regional and local level.
If the European Commission is the custodian of the EU Treaties, then the European Parliament is the custodian of the values and I believe that together we shall be able to withstand a rising wave familiar from the recent past.
And that we shall stop it, without violating fundamental rights like the right of free expression, the right of assocation, the freedom of the media.
For one can fight for democracy only according to the rules of democracy.
Breaking these rules will mean that extremism has prevailed.
Thank you.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (ES) Mr President, a few weeks ago a young man by the name of Carlos Palomino lay dying of stab wounds in the Madrid metro following a clash with right-wing extremists.
Shortly before, in the Barcelona metro, a madman had been caught by TV surveillance cameras striking a young girl because she was an immigrant, just because of the colour of her skin - so she said - without knowing that he was being filmed and without knowing that his actions were going to be broadcast around the world.
These and other similar cases have been repeated in various parts of Europe.
Often, with a sometimes exaggerated feeling of responsibility, we and all politicians who are concerned by this phenomenon, try to minimise the significance of such attacks: we must not be alarmed, we say; at the end of the day these are isolated incidents, there are not all that many madmen about, we must not exaggerate, it is not a serious problem.
We therefore label these attacks as minor because it frightens us to acknowledge that at best, in fact, this is not a minor matter.
Among other things, because, as the resolution on which we are going to vote tomorrow correctly suggests, many of these neo-Nazi and right-wing extremist organisations are playing on feelings of fear which already exist in our society, and which we cannot hide.
Therefore, it is not enough to condemn.
We need to open our eyes and act responsibly and face up to something which is not just an isolated phenomenon; without causing alarm, we must acknowledge its real scale and extent.
The day on which we signed the Charter of Fundamental Rights is a good day to remember that the European Union has a role to play and has its responsibility in this area.
There is no subsidiarity when it comes to defending the dignity of persons or denouncing racism, xenophobia and intolerance.
Action is needed at European level, firstly on the part of the Commission and the Agency for Fundamental Rights, in order to examine what kind of ramifications and networks there are behind all this - if any - what links there are between the various extreme right-wing movements, in order that we can apply legislation, contribute through education policies and support educators who teach about diversity, and, where necessary, forcibly denounce those politicians, social leaders, sportspeople etc. who, either passively or actively, lie behind these actions.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, growing extremism in Europe is a fact, and we need to talk about it.
The Commissioner said a great deal, but he spoke in general terms and about matters of secondary importance such as racism at football matches.
We need to talk about the facts, the political extremism we are witnessing at the present time in the European Union.
Yesterday, Mr President, the leader of the NPD, a neo-fascist party, appeared on Germany's public television channel, ARD, and demanded that Poland immediately return Pomerania and Silesia to Germany.
He declared that Kaliningrad, GdaÅsk and WrocÅaw are German cities and demanded German jurisdiction over them.
He also demanded that those cities and territories, which are part of Poland, should be returned to Germany immediately.
We are talking about events in Germany, a leading country in the European Union.
For some years now, the German fascists in the NPD have been calling for the revision of frontiers, repudiating the international treaties that ended the Second World War, and demanding that borders be pushed back.
Commissioner, we cannot permit this.
There has to be a strong reaction.
We cannot permit the public television service of any country, in this case Germany, to allow neo-fascists and Nazis to air their revisionist views and calls for another war.
This is not a marginal problem, ladies and gentlemen.
It is very real.
The party in question has representatives in seven regional parliaments.
This cannot be tolerated in Europe today, just as we cannot tolerate democratic principles, freedom to differ and freedom of speech to be undermined as they were today by Mr Cohn-Bendit and Mr Watson, who, referring to differences of opinion over the Charter of Fundamental Rights - or rather, not so much the Charter as the EU Reform Treaty - called the Members who were opposing him idiots.
That cannot be allowed.
That is not the approach to democracy and the present European Union that we should be teaching our young people.
Let us be united in diversity.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank Vice-President Frattini and all the fellow Members who have worked with me, and the proposers, to draw up this resolution.
Manifestations of racism and xenophobia have increased in recent years, as is borne out by the reports of the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia.
This increase is closely linked to the growth and proliferation of political forces which, in Europe, have interpreted the problems raised by immigration in an aberrant way, often to put forward slogans defending race and identity, and to stir up feelings of self-preservation against those entering Europe, describing them as terrorist threats or criminals, or even branding them with unacceptable anthropological names and xenophobic and racist slogans.
Parties and movements which in recent years have had strong anti-European nationalist leanings, and are highly racist, are on the increase.
Their political propaganda draws on social insecurity and tries to add pieces to the mosaic of the war of civilisations.
That propaganda is now a mainstream part of the political and institutional debate and in some cases, seems to be the message emerging from governments or as the result of the activities of governments.
Tomorrow, we shall vote on a resolution on extremism, a title which is perhaps a little vague.
Lenin said that extremism is the infantile disease of communism; we could paraphrase Lenin and say that extremism is perhaps an infantile disease of all political, religious, economic and ideological programmes.
Mr Weber is right: there is left-wing extremism and right-wing extremism, but there is not just left-wing and right-wing extremism, there is neo-liberal extremism, Catholic extremism, Muslim extremism, ecological extremism and anarchic-insurrectionist extremism.
The problem in Europe, however, is the growth of right-wing extremism and the problems which are causing right-wing extremism to proliferate.
Neo-nazi and neo-fascist political forces and movements have been set up in recent years in Europe and have made it their policy to work against European integration - we have seen them in Italy, in France, in Austria, in the Netherlands, in Belgium, in the United Kingdom, in Germany, in Denmark, and in Switzerland; they reflect the crisis that has led an intellectual such as Alfio Mastropaolo to describe the offensive of the new right as the mad cow of democracy.
The democratic legitimisation of certain political forces has helped dangerous ideas to spread into the body of European society, feeding reactionary leanings.
A dangerous, and in some cases underestimated, disease which feeds on ethnocentric proclivities, often concealed and hidden, in some cases masked by seemingly democratic and legitimate acts.
We therefore need to question our choices and our political initiatives.
There is a growing emphasis on the need to establish and consolidate a shared European culture and identity.
I believe that a European identity and culture must be built on the basis of dialogue and contact with cultures other than those that have in recent years promoted and paved the way for the dissemination and the growth of a European idea, a European culture.
A major cultural battle is needed, and that is my conclusion.
Police or public security activities are not enough; there needs to be a major cultural effort and only in that way will we manage to ensure that 2008 is actually the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue, because Europe must be founded on intercultural principles.
(ES) Mr President, I would be grateful if you would use your authority as President of this sitting to call to order a group of Members who seem to think they are at the circus and not Parliament and are spoiling the quality of this debate by their joking and cheering.
We are nearing the end of the year and it is normal to have meals at which you drink a little over the odds or at least more than usual.
The best idea in that situation is to have a siesta and not to disturb a debate where respect for the speaker should prevail at all times.
Thank you for your appeal but, as I said, anyone having a few drinks with his meal is best advised to have a siesta afterwards and not to interrupt our debates by his rudeness and lack of Parliamentary manners.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, I detest extremism as much as anyone.
British people do - we have been fighting it for centuries.
If you want to combat rising extremism in Europe, look at its causes before you rush into yet more legislation which only restricts; it breeds extremism.
Let us look at the high-water mark of European extremism, the Fascists of the 1930s.
In Britain, the marches of Sir Oswald Mosley were protected by law and arid hateful policies thus exposed to the light of day were rejected by the people.
Across Europe, Fascist leaders were vilified and obstructed.
Hitler himself was imprisoned - so he, like the others, gained power.
This morning, we saw the rise of extremism in this Chamber with the signing of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, part of the Constitution for Europe to be signed tomorrow and on which a national referendum was promised in seven countries.
Two said yes, two said no - but were ignored - while the others are waiting.
In the UK, our Government gave a written promise, now denied.
So much for the talk in this Chamber about listening to the people!
For the EU are today's extremists, seeking to impose their will by way of this distorted document.
It has been deliberately written so that no one beyond experienced lawyers can read it, with its numbered paragraphs taken from both the original and the existing Treaties, but which do not correspond between the documents.
The numbering will be changed for the signing and changed again afterwards to make quite sure that the people of Europe cannot understand it.
And this pseudo-democratic distortion is to be foisted on the people of Britain!
No thanks - we have got our rights already, embodied in the great and wonderful Magna Carta of 1215, supplemented by the Bill of Rights of 1689.
Just who do you think you are to overthrow these democratic measures laid down for us but open for all to follow?
History ignored becomes history repeated.
Over the centuries you ignored our lead and paid the price!
Ignore our example now, and you are on your way to perdition.
(Applause from his group)
(FR) Mr President, this must be the umpteenth report on the so-called rise of extremism in Europe.
The Council, the Commission and the political groups have all pitched in with their tuppence-worth and, as usual, the rhetoric is intellectually pitiful, politically disgraceful and morally perverse.
It is intellectually pitiful because every new idea that ever was - in religion, including the Christianity that some of you are bold enough to say you espouse; in politics whether liberalism or socialism; in science, including concepts now taken for granted, like the earth being round and rotating about the sun - has been considered extremist, heretical, subversive and unacceptable.
You cannot discredit an opinion simply by demonising it: you need to explain what makes it flawed.
The political disgrace is entirely of your making - you, the people in power who, instead of resolving problems, care only about fighting off the opposition.
All you are doing is highlighting your inability to solve the problem of immigration - of an invasion in which you, either deliberately or through cowardice, have colluded.
What you are admitting here is that you have failed - on the economic front, the social front, the cultural front and the moral and educational fronts - and that, instead of changing your disastrous policies, your only concern is to get rid of those who protest or who criticise you.
It is in moral terms, however, that your attitude is most repugnant.
You falsely equate violence and terrorism with the legitimate reaction of Europe's people against the destruction of their identity.
What hypocrites you are!
You want to muzzle these people and deprive them of political representation: you are the Pharisees of democracy!
You are what the Bible calls 'whited sepulchres'; in other words, your sincerity is less than skin deep!
You talk about human rights and freedom of expression, about Europe's values and about tolerance, but underneath the whitewash it is all rot.
You would deny to anyone who fails to think like you the very rights that you harp on about.
All of this would be odious, were it not so grotesque.
Tomorrow's generations will pass judgment on you as the Barbarians passed judgement on Rome. I hope, at least, that the Barbarians will give you what you deserve!
(ES) Mr President, I would like to take a few seconds over my allotted time merely to direct at those in the back seats, on the right over there, a traditional Castilian saying: 'A palabras necias, oÃ­dos sordos - silly words will be met with a deaf ear'.
I will now continue my speech in English.
Today, as we have very proudly signed the Charter of the Fundamental Rights of the European Union, it is more than half a century since Europe assisted in the most outrageous crime of xenophobia and racism - the Holocaust.
Millions of people were killed because of their religion, their ethnic background and their political beliefs.
Therefore, it is more necessary than ever to bear history in mind by living our present and preparing for the future.
We have to be alert and watchful; beware of the eggs of the snake, as Ingmar Bergman taught us.
As Commissioner Frattini has confirmed today, there is a resurgence of violent acts with racist and xenophobic origin in our Member States.
But, to me, what is even more preoccupying is that more and more young people get involved.
Therefore, it is absolutely essential that we teach them citizenship and to be aware of what racism is about.
More and more extremist right-wing parties which base their ideology and political practices on intolerance and exclusion are voted into national parliaments.
There, they have an excellent platform for their political message of hate.
We should be aware of this and try to do things to counteract that as well.
Racism and xenophobia are the most direct violations of the principles of freedom and democracy and our fundamental rights.
So the European institutions and we, the Members of Parliament, are obliged to reaffirm our determination to uphold fundamental freedoms and to condemn and combat any manifestation of racism and xenophobia by means of law.
More than ever, zero tolerance is requested to combat racism and xenophobia.
More than ever we have to be belligerent in defending our values, using and strengthening the instruments available to the European Union and its Member States.
No single citizen should ever suffer from persecution because of his or her race, religion, gender, social situation, language, nationality or sexual orientation.
The eradication of racism and xenophobia, the right to live in peace, is a moral challenge to all democrats, and to defend civil rights is the duty of every democrat.
(HU) Thank you very much, Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen.
Yesterday we spoke for nearly two hours about the fight against the rise of extremism and the final text of the resolution that is based on liberal initiatives, but of course we have throughout taken into account the ideas and requests of all the groups.
I am optimistic, and I trust that there will be a common position on this painfully important topic.
Personally, I am very sorry that in 2007, the year of equal opportunities, we are still obliged to fight the shadows of fallen dictatorships from the 20th century that creep out from time to time.
We know that there are no Member States that are exceptions to this.
Just to mention a couple by name: Pospolitos in Slovakia, the Young Nationalists in the Czech Republic, the New Right in Romania, the German National Democratic Party in Germany and the National Alliance in Italy, but we largely face the same extremism.
To speak of my own country, it is unacceptable for me that every day statements are issued by extremist parties and organisations like the Movement for a Better Hungary or the Hungarian Guard, in which they explain the conceptually absurd criminality of gipsies with genetic reasons, and instead of integrating the Roma into society they demand segregation and ghettos, whilst they march in black uniforms in TatÃ¡rszentgyÃ¶rgy, and on Friday in Kerepes.
In connection with this, I would again like to draw the attention of my fellow Members to the fact that so many of the gypsy settlements in Europe are still targets for extremist forces, even today.
And now some news for the end of my statement.
The Hungarian Ombudsmen, the President of the Republic and the Hungarian Government have officially condemned the Hungarian Guard and the Movement for a Better Hungary.
We would like all responsible European governments to do the same in the face of their own extremism.
In any case, in order to do this it is necessary that as many of my fellow Members as possible vote yes tomorrow on the Parliament's position on the fight against rising extremism.
Thank you.
Mr President, today we witnessed a proclamation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and we are now discussing the rise of extremism in Europe.
To my mind, there is very clear link between the two.
The EU Agency for Fundamental Rights was, until recently, known as the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia.
We cannot combat extremism without addressing the issues of racism and xenophobia, which are all too present in Europe today.
Extremism breeds extremism, and we in Europe are in danger of finding ourselves caught in a very vicious circle if we do not move swiftly to tackle and eliminate some of these root causes.
I listened to Mr Gollnisch earlier on, calling people in this House and others barbarians.
He did not put up one credible idea, not one positive idea, of how we can tackle this problem in Europe, except the usual diatribe that comes from him.
He and his leader, Mr Le Pen, want to come to Ireland in connection with the Treaty.
I can tell you something for certain: those sorts of extreme ideas would not and will not be tolerated in my country, thank you very much.
So please do come, and we can be sure that the Treaty will be passed when they hear the sort of continental Europe that you want to develop, and your kind of ideas.
It has been shown that attitudes that made workers receptive...
(Interruption from Mr Gollnisch)
We know what you stand for, Mr Gollnisch, and we have heard you so many times, you and your leader.
It has been shown that attitudes that made workers receptive to right-wing populism include prejudice against immigrants, nationalism, authoritarianism, social dominance and political weakness, with prejudice against immigrants emerging as the most important factor among these.
In countries where appropriate reporting facilities are in place, the most reported reason for discrimination is often region.
If we address the elimination of such prejudice and discrimination, we will have taken a significant step forward in combating extremism.
Therefore, I call on all Members to encourage debate and the exchange of views on issues of social inequality, origin, race, religion and the impact of social and economic changes locally, nationally and at all European levels, and not to use emotive language, calling people barbarians.
To this end, I welcome the fact that, as part of the work for the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue, the European Parliament has invited Pope Benedict, the President of the African Union, the Dalai Lama, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, the Chief Rabbi of the United Kingdom and the Grand Mufti of Damascus to address the European Parliament during the year 2008.
I welcome those sorts of initiatives.
(The President cut off the speaker)
(NL) With all due respect, Mr President, I should be glad to hear from you why it is that members of your own group and people who manifestly represent a line of thinking closer to your own are given much more extra speaking time and are not so readily cut off, whereas people you clearly do not agree with are cut short after only ten seconds.
You are applying a double standard here, and it is not acceptable.
First of all, it seems to me, Mr Dillen, that the President directs the debate according to his own criteria and not according to those of whoever is occupying seat 777.
I have no explanation to give you.
All speakers, including those who have been speaking among themselves, have been given more than their share of time.
At any rate, I would like to ask all Members to address the Chair and the House and not to direct their comments at other fellow Members, in order to prevent disorderly interjections and interruptions.
(SV) Mr President, we have all noticed that extremism is growing in the EU.
I think we should ask ourselves why.
Why are xenophobia and other extremist attitudes on the increase?
I am convinced that exclusion and lack of participation in society are a breeding ground for extremism and xenophobia.
The equal value of all human beings is a fundamental principle in a civilised society, so we must all help to combat xenophobic forces which discriminate against persons with a different ethnic background, sexual disposition or gender or with functional disabilities.
These groups use violence and they use threats.
In my home country we have even witnessed the murder of people who have defended human rights.
We see the murder of young people with a different ethnic background, merely because of their background.
These things should never be allowed to happen again.
We who promote the equal value of all human beings must never allow ourselves to be silenced.
But we know that is not enough.
Xenophobic and extremist groups use young people in economic and social exclusion to create more fear, unrest and hatred against other groups.
The fight against extremism must therefore be combined with building a just society based on solidarity.
Mr President, the motion before us is another example of ignorance and hypocrisy.
In it we read that, amongst other things, some political parties and movements, including those in power in a number of countries or represented at local, national or European level, have deliberately placed intolerance and violence based on race, ethnic origin or nationality at the heart of their agenda.
We also read that this Parliament strongly condemns all racist and hate attacks and calls on all authorities to do everything in their power to punish those responsible.
In the Chamber in which we adopt such resolutions, one of our colleagues used abusive and offensive language of mendacious propaganda - the very kind that is often used by extremists, the very kind that is based on slurs and qualifies as a hate attack.
He implied that I could repeat Dachau.
Well, let me enlighten him: one, Dachau was a German death camp; two, Dachau is in Germany, and I am not German.
He even claimed that, after a four-day visit to Poland, he knew my country better than I did, and that I am not a part of Poland - but that Dachau apparently is.
This kind of hate speech is too often cited, reoccurs too often and emanates from too many politicians.
The same politicians want to teach us all about democracy, while they themselves have little respect for it and little respect for equal treatment under the law.
It seems that in Europe today - just as George Orwell wrote years ago - some pigs are more equal than others.
Some can hide under the privilege of immunity, some can even avoid justice and even European arrest warrants.
Communist criminals are somehow better treated than ordinary citizens, and while we speak in here against extremist groups, some German politicians openly support historically revisionist political movements.
My dear colleagues, the Europe of our resolutions is very different from the Europe of our reality.
(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, we have been yet again essentially consoling ourselves with the fact that the rise of extremism reflects a deteriorating economic situation and unemployment.
I am afraid that such an assessment is no longer valid.
The economies of many EU Member States have been growing, unemployment has been falling, but extremism has not been waning.
On the contrary, the number of crimes based on race has been growing; national guards with an nationalistic ethos are being set up; SS veterans are marching across some EU Member States; and politicians who refer to the Jewish and Roma people as the 'ulcers' of society are being glorified.
Politics and the army are being infiltrated by neo-Nazis and racists.
The Prime Minister of the Czech Republic, my native country, has made neo-Nazi rhetoric part of his vocabulary.
Last but not least, the EU has become a destination of migration for poorer people and no one seems to know how to deal with it, which also plays a certain role.
Ladies and gentlemen, no resolution, no words can undo the swastika recently incised on the hip of a 17-year-old girl in Mittweida, Germany.
In the daylight, ignored by indifferent bystanders, neo-Nazis in German Saxony incised it on her body because she stood up for a little Russian girl.
I firmly believe that extremism can be prevented solely by citizens' everyday acts, publicly declared opposition by the political elite, open and comprehensive interpretation in particular of 20th century history, and most of all the police and courts, which must not close their eyes to racists, xenophobes and neo-Nazis, but act without delay to punish such behaviour.
(HU) Thank you, Mr President.
I speak now as one of the authors of written statement No 93.
The statement, which I tabled jointly with my fellow Members Mr Tabajdi, Mr Szent-IvÃ¡nyi, Mr Vigenin and Mr Amezaga, condemns the operations of paramilitary extremist groups within the Union, which are one of the most obvious forms of extremism.
In my experience, although many people feel a moral and political obligation to stop such extremist ideas from gaining ground, many stop short of specifically condemning it in a written statement or in another way.
There are many reasons for this.
One of them, for example, is that when we try to publicise these ideas, the list is never complete and never accurate. This deters many people from supporting it.
However, one thing we must know is that the list will never be complete, and the concepts and definitions will never be accurate.
For this very reason, we must instead grab extremism and extremist ideas by the roots.
Today in this House is a day of celebration, but the Charter of Fundamental Rights has not come to be signed in untroubled circumstances.
This Charter summarises in 50 paragraphs all the values and rights that we respect and want to protect in the Union.
This Charter is the charter of anti-discrimination, the charter of the freedoms of expression, religion and assembly, the charter of equality and the charter of protection for individuals, data, young people and the elderly.
We cannot pick and choose from it at will, put some people before others or use it for our short-term internal policy objectives.
Everyone must be respected and protected equally, because this guarantees human dignity, and we, as members of the Parliament, have sworn to do that.
Opponents to the sum total of the ideas and rights formulated here are what we call extremists, irrespective of the age, sex, religion, or nationality of the person concerned.
In this spirit, I would like to ask my fellow Members to support written statement number 93.
Thank you.
(FR) Mr President, racist activity and racist crimes are on the increase in Europe.
Roma, migrants and all those who are 'different' still face discrimination in many guises in employment, education and housing.
We cannot repeat often enough that what we want is a European Union rooted in the humanist values of tolerance and the protection of fundamental rights.
So the framework decision - adopted by a substantial majority in this House on 29 November - on combating certain forms of racism and xenophobia by means of criminal law is very necessary indeed.
It will enable us to take the same measures against racist ideas and hate speech throughout the European Union.
Extremist parties exploit people's fears of the other and of foreigners, so that they can propose an easy answer to globalisation.
But those who hail the imposition of national preferences as a panacea are irresponsible.
The real answer to the challenges of globalisation lies in grasping the full extent of today's human challenges.
And we should not fear to state, loud and clear, that to respond by turning inward on ourselves is to court disaster.
Mr President, we are seeing in Europe a constant increase in extremist, nationalist and populist movements that endanger our democratic system.
In an ideal world, democracy is government of the people by the people and for the people.
In fact, democracy is still the 'least bad' political system if it has proper checks and balances.
However, the paradox of democracy is that it contains the possibility of its own death, in allowing the expression of populist and extremist opinions which erode the democratic system itself.
In many European countries, there are parties that have succeeded in positioning themselves at the heart of political life with populist and demagogic discourses.
European history has shown how extremist parties, dressed in democratic clothes and using populist and nationalist propaganda, have often led democracy to dictatorships.
The best way to fight intolerance is to stand firm, to defend our democratic values and institutions, to defend individual rights, justice, equal opportunity and diversity, but also to sanction any discourse instigating hatred, segregation or discrimination.
As Robert Kennedy said, 'what is dangerous about extremists is not that they are extreme, but that they are intolerant.
The evil is not what they say about their cause, but what they say about their opponents.'
Healthy democracies need active citizens.
Democracy can only function if citizens are conscious and exert their civic rights and duties.
We need to reinvent citizenship.
We need new ways to learn democracy.
We need to ensure that our education systems promote the development of an active, critical and engaged citizenship.
In a global world, we imperatively need a citizenship that celebrates diversity and promotes understanding and tolerance.
(PL) Mr President, I do no know whether political extremism is on the increase or not.
I know that it must be opposed and condemned, both for its ideology and for its methods.
However, the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which we welcomed today with such great ceremony, is not the answer to the problem but can itself create new problems.
Article 21 of the Charter prohibits discrimination on the ground of political or any other opinion - I repeat, any other opinion - which thus includes extreme opinions such as those expressed recently on German public television by the leader of the NPD calling for changes to the border with Poland.
Platitudes tend to rebound painfully on those who mouth them.
I would therefore ask the supporters of the Charter of Fundamental Rights how they intend to fight political extremism when they are defending it at the same time.
(EL) Mr President, it would be an omission on my part if I did not begin by expressing my concern at the general use made of the term 'extremism' without any definition, and without specific condemnation of extremist acts, in other words any extreme form of unlawful use of violence.
It would also be a mistake not to mention the attempts to 'awaken' citizens to the dangers of radicalisation, and the simultaneous creation of flexible categories for possible criminals.
I would like to remind you that in modern history, during periods when freedoms and rights were curbed in the name of security, policing and strict control, and when persecution based on stereotypes was allowed to gain ground, ideological bigotry, racism and xenophobia intensified and unspeakable crimes were committed.
Similar lapses today could lead to the banning of political parties and trade unions, which will be a real blow to democracy, the rule of law and civil liberties.
We must therefore ensure that democracy does not become merely a smokescreen for the adoption of punitive measures; at the same time, we must concentrate our efforts on mitigating the real causes of violent extremist acts, which utterly debase human dignity, since by definition they overstep the limits of freedom of expression.
It is our duty to take up the battle against poverty, unemployment, deprivation, the exploitation of workers and social marginalisation, and to ensure that future generations, thanks to proper teaching and education, stay away from aggressively nationalist and fascist organisations which promote extremist acts as a means of expression.
(SK) Thank you, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen.
In my view, it is essential to adopt a joint resolution on combating extremism, which has become more and more evident recently.
There is a certain symbolism in the fact that this debate is taking place on the day when the Presidents of the European Parliament, the Commission and the European Council confirmed with their signatures the EU's legal commitment to the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
We cannot allow individuals or extremist organisations to attack citizens, whose rights must be guaranteed in a civilised society.
The history of Europe has shown the forms that extremism, militant nationalism and ideological radicalism can take.
It is our duty to consistently monitor European territory for any activities by these groups or individuals and take vigorous action against it.
I must add with regret that extremism seems to be on the rise primarily among young people in Europe.
This reflects a certain failure on the part of the politicians.
It is important to remember that many politicians, due to a lack of positive and professional assets, seek to promote their own political background and capital by provoking the least experienced and poorly informed sections of the public.
That is why adopting stricter legislation and more vigorous measures while there is still time is an issue and a responsibility we must all assume.
(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, at this stage of the debate most of what can be said on this subject has already been said.
However, I would like to refer to the Commissioner's exhortation about the need to think about the underlying roots of extremism.
It seems to me that the problem of extremism is not that there is a series of groups who carry out violent attacks.
It is a problem, but it has to be tackled through the law and individuals must be prosecuted, etc. The problem arises when the violence and the intentions behind it are repeated and have a chance to affect a broad sector of the population or certain sectors of the population.
From a social and political point of view, it is when violence causes concern that the problem arises.
As for how to prevent it, I think there are three essential factors.
First, the Commissioner mentioned a knowledge of history - I myself believe that it is very important to know about tragedies, about successes and ultimately about ourselves as humans.
However, I think we have to be careful not to use history as a weapon against others with a view to short-term political gain - something which is happening now in some countries, including my own country, Spain, I have to say.
Secondly, I think there are two other fundamental aspects which at the moment are much underrated.
Firstly, education.
We have lost, and are still losing, or at least eroding, values such as work, discipline, self-reliance, that is to say all those values which go towards creating a good citizen when these people reach adulthood.
Finally, in the context of the European Union, the important thing is not to break up that environment in which we Europeans can challenge together the networks created by globalisation.
What we have now, and what we have had at other times in the course of 20th century European history, is a great deal of uncertainty, a certain desperation, a certain aimlessness, and what we need to do is provide hope, a forward-looking spirit and strong leadership so that everyone feels a part of the European Union.
(PL) Mr President, the continent of Europe, the countries of the European Union, are now a territory in which we encounter cases of xenophobia, extreme nationalism, anti-Semitism, racism and islamophobia.
What is missing in Europe today is the liberal-democratic consensus of the period following the Second World War.
Europe's politicians lack the real political will to tackle these problems.
Dealing with the outbreaks of racism, Islamophobia, anti-Semitism and xenophobia is a common duty that falls upon European education, media, churches, sports activists and, above all, politicians.
We often find ourselves defenceless against such extreme forms of political activity.
Worse still, many politicians and political parties take advantage of extremist or populist movements for their own purposes.
I do not want to use this debate to score political points in the European Parliament, but I could mention many such examples.
What matters now is to achieve a common policy at the level of the European Union - in the field of education, above all, as well as in sport, culture and politics - to combat extremism.
Mr President, eight years ago JÃ¶rg Haider's immigrant-hating party entered into a coalition government in Austria.
EU governments did not have a clue what to do.
As a result of that disarray, Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union was inserted.
It has never been used and it is clear that Member States have a cultural problem in criticising each other.
But we have to have a more proactive policy of peer review when Member States call each other to account, because it is an EU concern if extremists and intolerant parties enter into government in one EU country.
The criminal law has a solid role in punishing incitement to hatred, alongside provisions outlawing discrimination.
The law can help change attitudes, as well as behaviour.
Society signals the limits of acceptability in part by what it criminalises or bans.
That is why I was so disappointed that the Commission apparently found the Italian Government deportation action against Romanians, largely Roma, and the accompanying rhetoric, compliant with EU free movement and anti-racism laws.
Personally, I did not.
But the law can and should only go so far.
For instance, the question of whether to criminalise Holocaust denial is a controversial one in Europe.
The recently agreed new EU law banning incitement to racial and religious hatred was right, in my view, to leave that option to individual countries.
My own country's tradition and preference is to leave people like David Irving to condemn themselves by the absurdity of their unhistorical views and to be contradicted by vigorous debate.
Those of us in the mainstream parties do not have to be intimidated by the thugs and bully boys of the extremist right, left or fundamentalists of any kind.
Liberal democrats - and I use that term with a small 'l' - of all democratic parties are just as confident and passionate about our commitment to a generous, inclusive, European vision as they are to their mean intolerance.
Let us constantly express that.
(PL) Mr President, extremism is a phenomenon supported by politicians who exploit racism, nationalism and xenophobia for their own ends.
Extremism often uses terrorism in pursuit of its aims.
Extremism does not unite people and social groups: it divides them.
It is the enemy of a democratic society.
It is opposed to the basic values of the European Union, a community of people who reject hatred and the war caused by fascists and nationalists that cost tens of millions of lives in Europe in the 20th century.
The largest terrorist organisation, al-Qaeda, founded on extremism and the use of terrorism for political ends, is now capable of destroying weak democracies and achieving political power.
I support the resolution, which seeks to mobilise the European institutions for further action against terrorism and extremism.
(EL) Mr President, the rise of far-right racist groups and organisations in Europe is no accident.
It is the result of the European Union's anti-popular, reactionary, imperialist policy.
This policy, whose only guiding principle is the maximisation of profitability for the European monopolies, through the accumulation of vast wealth on the basis of savage exploitation of the working class, is spreading poverty, inequality and marginalisation, and is drastically eroding the position of the working-class family and aggravating working-class problems.
Under these conditions - in marginalised sections of society or in social strata with a low level of political awareness and experience - far-right and fascist ideas, which are promoted under a populist, demagogic guise, are able to take root.
Today there is more fertile ground for the creation and growth of such groups because of anti-communist hysteria, the attempt to rewrite history, the shameless attempt to wipe out the huge contribution of the USSR to the victory over fascism, and to equate communism with Nazism and fascism.
We see this, for example, in the recognition and legitimacy granted by the governments of the Baltic countries to the local fascist groups, who were collaborators with the SS and the Nazis who were based in those countries during the Second World War.
Fascism, racism and xenophobia are faces of the same coin.
Born and bred of the capitalist system, which creates, maintains and nurtures these fascist groups.
For precisely this reason we regard as hypocritical the alleged concerns over the rise of far-right and paramilitary organisations in Europe, and we reject every attempt to equate the class struggle, the struggles of the workers' and popular movement and communist ideology with extremist ideologies, as an unacceptable attempt to instil fear in people.
(BG) Mr Chairman, Colleagues, This day is a testimony that the European Parliament guarantees the rights not only of the majority but also of those who have different opinion.
Because if the nationalists in this hall achieved their goals, none of us would have the right to a different opinion as they had the oppoprtunity to express it today.
We shall prevail over intolerance and extremism with arguments rather than emotions, with facts rather than noise.
Unfortunately, however when we talk about facts, there is nobody to hear them.
This is a regrettable fact.
Still, I hope that our supporters, our voters in the Member States will hear very carefully what was pointed out also by Commissioner Fratini.
In the first place, intolerance and extremism come from the oblivion of the past.
We must remember the past and the two severe dictatorships that Europe suffered.
Therefore I appeal to the Commission and to all of us: let us remember the history of Europe and let give more opportunities for the progammes of the European Commision to finance projects that preserve our memory.
Secondly, we must remember the involvement of citizens in the political process.
Colleagues, we are partly to blame for nationalism and xenophobia in Europe.
Many of us started speaking as bureaucrats rather than politicians.
They have forgotten the language that the voters can hear and speak the language of institutions instead.
Let this make us strong enough in this debate to overcome the problem which exists especially in the new Member States.
Let us name problems and tackle them directly, when they exist.
For more often than not political parties win in elections by promising one thing and doing other things afterwards and then they are surprised by the existence of extremism and discontented people.
It is our common responsibility of all of us in the European Parliament to also oppose the rising extremism and intolerance to the east of the European Union, which is dangerous to all of us.
Thank you.
(HU) Mr President, it is not generally enough to fight extremism.
Everyone must act against the nationalist and extremist tendencies emerging in their own country.
First of all, everyone should condemn extremist nationalists and distance themselves from them in their own country.
This is an extremely important requirement, and this current debate also demonstrates that extremism must be fought using direct and indirect instruments at the same time.
Direct instruments must be used to punish speech that incites to hatred.
There are some who refer to freedom of expression and say that this cannot be condemned using the instruments of criminal law, but I feel that we have not yet struck the right balance.
Democratic forces must give an example, especially to the right wing, and the democratic right wing has great responsibility for distancing itself from the extreme right-wing phenomena that are running riot in Europe.
At the same time, some of my fellow Members have spoken about the fact that we must also react using indirect instruments, as the reason for very many extremist incidents is social uncertainty or uncertainty of national identity.
This current debate is very important, and I feel that Commissioner Frattini, the Agency for Fundamental Rights and the European Parliament must monitor all extremist incidents closely.
Thank you for your attention.
(NL) Mr President, there are extremists on all sides, but in recent years they have been dictating the tone and content of the political agenda.
Democratic mainstream parties are far too slow to distance themselves from extremists because they fear losing votes, and the result is a creeping political acceptance of extremism and intolerance.
And there is something else.
On top of racism and nationalism there is also extremism against women and homosexuals, for example - we have not dealt with this yet today - and this is often based on religious beliefs.
I am horrified when I see parties in government, with power to rule, or parties represented in parliament - in my own country too - encouraging discrimination against women, gays and people of other faiths.
Lastly, a word or two that may be controversial, Mr President.
With all due respect to what Mr Ryan has said, I myself am not greatly in favour of inviting leaders of the major world faiths here to address our plenary unless they are prepared to abjure their discriminatory views on women and gays.
(PL) Mr President, one way to combat extremism and reduce the electorate of extremist parties is to listen more attentively to citizens on matters of importance to them and to analyse the underlying causes of extremism.
If the citizens of Europe vote for extremist parties, it means, among other things, that a large section of society does not feel that the people in power are listening.
I am not defending extremism, but it does not come from nowhere.
In France Nicholas Sarkozy has understood this.
By approaching issues such as immigration and the accession of Turkey honestly and courageously, he has succeeded in weakening the extremist parties.
I would encourage the European Commission to follow the French example.
Mr President, a mayor rails against immigrants claiming that immigration is a source of insecurity; another mayor declares his city free of foreigners; a head of state speaks about the Parliament as a gang of outlaws, instigates the people to mutiny against the legislators and glorifies a democracy without opposition and without parties.
A group of parliamentarians today, in a hooligan manner, called for direct so-called 'popular democracy' which would replace elections with referendums.
An outstanding public leader expresses support for the violent groups which stormed the parliament building of a democratic state and asked for the revision of the peace treaties.
A number of journalists express daily - even if sometimes in politically correct vocabulary - xenophobic, anti-parliamentarian, anti-pluralistic, anti-Roma, anti-Islamic, exclusivist, intolerant, discriminatory and chauvinistic views.
A minister asked the European Commission to make money available in order to concentrate a certain undesirable ethnic community in the poorest countries of the Union.
All these are facts, taking place in the European Union and committed by persons reputed to be democratic members of the mainstream democratic parties.
Here, today, we condemn the extremist parties and their organisation.
This is just because they are perpetrators of intolerance and intolerance should not be tolerated.
But what about the facilitators?
The populists disguised as democrats who, by weakening the democratic institutions and relativising the democratic principle, create the most favourable environment for extremists?
If we keep speaking only about symptoms and perpetrators, remaining silent or passive when it is about the causes and facilitators, we are going to jeopardise our values.
This must not happen.
(SV) Mr President, let me begin by thanking all parties for the resolution.
Today no EU country is free of right-wing extremism, not even my own country, Sweden.
In the last local elections in 2006 Sverigedemokraterna (the Sweden Democrats) won seats in two thirds of municipalities.
It might be suspected that their next targets are the elections to the European Parliament in 2009 and the Swedish parliamentary elections in 2010.
We Swedish parliamentarians need help in making that more difficult, precisely as others need help in their countries in stopping the spread of right-wing extremism, which is on the increase throughout Europe.
Europe needs democratic parties whose programmes reach out to all, not just a few.
In the 2006 elections the slogan of the Swedish Social Democrats was 'Everyone is included', and it becomes even more relevant in this debate, since the parties and groups we are discussing have programmes which do not respect the EU's fundamental values and the equal value of all human beings.
For me, as a member of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, the approach to questions of asylum and refugee policy is absolutely crucial.
The right-wing extremist parties oppose both a more open Europe and the development of the EU.
Instead they advocate nations with closed borders.
It is a threat which I observe in Sweden and, along with all of you, throughout the EU.
I would like to make one more comment on the resolution.
The propaganda which extremist groups spread among children and young people takes the form of white power music.
The media and communications are the tool used, and it circumvents school, the family, further education and our political values.
It is important that we, as elected representatives, now take charge of the debate.
We must do that as of now and continue up to the European Parliament elections in 2009.
Let us applaud the resolution.
(Applause)
(EL) Mr President, a threat hangs over democracy in Europe, and I doubt whether we have all understood its significance.
This threat is not the spread of far-right ideas, but the transition from the ideas to the methods of the far right.
To the acceptance, in other words, of brute force, as seen in the activity of the paramilitary far-right organisations.
A major distinction therefore needs to be made: on the one hand, we are combating ideas with which we do not agree.
The ideas that promote nationalism in Europe, and racism, xenophobia, oppression of women, oppression of minorities.
We are combating these ideas with our own ideas and with our effort to fight the causes, the political causes, which are to be found mainly in the problem of diversity - in the fact, that is, that European citizens do not accept diversity, do not accept the policy that supports it, and do not accept Europe itself.
On the other hand, however, we are fighting a different battle, even by criminal means, against the spread of those ideas, through action which leads to violence.
From this point of view, I think this very well-balanced joint resolution from all the democratic parties in Parliament is another great political moment for our Parliament - especially after what happened today - and I am very proud that this resolution originated from our own group, the Socialist Group.
(PT) On 6 September some twenty graves in the Jewish cemetery in Lisbon were desecrated and swastikas painted on the headstones.
The two perpetrators were arrested.
They are members of the Frente Nacional or National Front, an extreme right-wing Portuguese skinhead organisation which openly advocates racial war and violent action to secure white supremacy.
This case and others, notably the wave of anti-Muslim hysteria in various European countries and the racist violence recently unleashed against the Roma community in Italy, show that xenophobia and violent racism are with us and we cannot afford the luxury of minimising them.
In the Portuguese case, the authorities were initially tempted to play the case down and declare that anti-Semitism was contrary to the supposedly tolerant nature of Portuguese society.
But the presence of the Ministers for Justice and Internal Administration at the Jewish cemetery for the ceremonial purification of the graves and the publicity this demonstration of solidarity received in the Portuguese media are a lesson for other cases in Portugal and elsewhere.
Extremism in Europe can only be fought effectively if the political representatives and the media assume their responsibilities by giving visibility to crimes of this type and identifying them as direct and base attacks on the very essence of democracy, of Europe and of Humanity.
(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the rise of extremism in Europe is certainly very worrying and all the European institutions need to mobilise to stem the growth of these extreme right-wing movements that are becoming ever more threatening as they not only promote suspect values but increasingly attack human rights on the basis of their racist ideology.
This dangerous trend in the European Union is unacceptable!
As I see it, the Commission needs to respond on two fronts, reflecting the ideas expressed in the written statement and in the PSE resolution on the subject: it needs to act positively along with the Member States to identify appropriate political and legal means, on the one hand, of condemning human rights violations and, on the other, of preventing extremism, particularly among young people, by raising awareness of the Union's fundamental values.
It is also essential to ensure that no European fund can be used by an institution or organisation that promotes values, or makes statements, inciting people to xenophobic, racist violence.
I would remind you here of the case of Radio Maria in Poland, which, although notorious for promoting anti-human-rights views, applied for European grant aid.
I would therefore take this opportunity, in the presence of the Commission representative, to urge once again that no European funding should go to media which serve as a platform for racist ideas, with a widespread and potentially very dangerous impact on the public.
Member of the Commission. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I consider that today's debate has been of extraordinary interest - of extraordinary interest and also of a high political level - and I should therefore like to thank all those who have spoken, including those who have said things with which I do not and cannot agree.
Some speakers have questioned whether it is necessary or important to raise such an issue in this House; I believe, however, that it has been very important.
An issue which is certainly a highly political issue has been raised: striking a balance between the right freely to express our thought, which is one of the rights that the Charter of Fundamental Rights recognises, and other fundamental rights such as the dignity of the human person, equality and non-discrimination.
May I say that those who have raised this issue, taking the view that freedom of thought makes it possible to cause offence and to stir up values running counter to the fundamental rights of the person, have distorted what freedom of thought actually means.
I always speak as I find, even when my opinions run counter to those who spoke before me.
Someone said: 'if, in a referendum, citizens come out against the Charter of Fundamental Rights, that will be an expression of freedom'.
I do not agree, because calling for a referendum against the Charter of Fundamental Rights would be to call for a referendum against citizens, since those citizens are clearly the holders and protagonists of the fundamental rights that we must now safeguard.
It is not because that principle has to be refuted, but because those who defend fundamental rights are not extremists, while those who violate and refute them, those who wish to affirm the right to incite a mob or a group of violent people to destroy Jewish graves are extremists.
That is not freedom of expression, that is violence that has to be eradicated through policies and has to be punished by the instruments of the law.
These are, in my view, the two measures for which Europe must steadfastly press.
We must not play it down.
We must not think that a single event can be underestimated because it is a single event, if that single event is a symptom of racism and intolerance, of a profound scorn for human values, we must also be worried by a single event, by a single act of violence!
Many of you have raised another, very important, issue: can the propagation of a racist message by political forces be tolerated in the name of the free expression of political thought?
Because they are elected by citizens, I believe that those in politics have a special responsibility and must not incite the mob against other citizens or other people: a sense of personal accountability.
In my view, it is difficult, and I say this frankly, to use the instruments of the law, the police or the secret services to undertake a far-reaching investigation of this or that party.
However, when this or that party publicly says that its intention is to restore racial supremacy, that is not free expression of thought, but an attack on a deep-seated foundation of Europe.
It is for those reasons that repressive action is justified, and there can be no talk of censure or of violation of the freedom of expression.
I will defend the right of those who do not agree with me to say what they wish to say, but I cannot defend the right of those who do not agree with me to incite the mob or other people to attack and to wound and kill.
In no way is that free expression of thought!
That is why today's issue is a key issue and I shall put forward similar arguments when we debate the appalling form of extremism represented by terrorism, because we can surely not draw a line between the message of racial hatred and the message of those who consider that killing people in terrorist attacks is a possible answer to society's problems.
Both are issues which - in my view, through education and prevention, by fostering tolerance, and by using the instruments of law and the instruments of enforcement - must be tackled at European level.
We can only be satisfied when we are sure that there is no room for racists, bigots and terrorists in Europe.
I have received five motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday, 13 December 2007.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - I will vote for this resolution with a degree of reluctance.
It covers an important subject which I have worked on in this House since I was first elected in 1984, when I had the honour to chair Parliament's Committee of Inquiry into the Growth of Racism and Fascism in Europe.
My concern is that this resolution is so weak that individuals who back in the 1980s were members of neo-Fascist parties like the Movimento Sociale Italiano are able to sign and vote for the resolution today.
On that basis, it must inevitably be flawed.
in writing. - (HU) The extremist movements that are growing stronger throughout Europe give us cause for grave concern, since their political activities are based on inciting hatred against the most vulnerable groups in society, and they preach intolerance and social exclusion.
Such ideas are incompatible with European values, human dignity, equality of rights and the fundamental freedoms in the founding treaties of the Union, or the basic principles formulated in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, proclaimed this very day.
Such movements and the views they express are capable of generating fear among minorities and among the law-abiding, democratic majority of citizens.
Because of the increased media interest by extremist groups, the false generalisations and distorted half-truths that are expressed more widely than before are not only unacceptable but extremely dangerous, since they strengthen incidents of prejudice and negative discrimination and further impede the resolution of social problems.
I would like to remind you separately of anti-gypsy incidents, which are also becoming increasingly frequent.
There are more than ten million gypsies in Europe, and they are the largest and at the same time most vulnerable and most defenceless ethnic minority in Europe, and it is not that their situation has not improved in recent years, but in many areas it has definitely deteriorated.
It is the joint responsibility of the European Union and civil organisations to find a solution to the problems of unemployment and abject poverty, and to put an end to the residential and educational segregation of gypsies.
Resolving these problems is now the most urgent minority question for the European Union.
in writing. - (HU) The extremist parties gaining seats in many Member States of the Union and temporarily even in the EP cannot become acceptable in European politics.
Their suppression is a matter for all of society in the European Community, even if we know that everyday racism and xenophobia are concealed by citizens who otherwise demand democracy and human rights.
Young people, for whom not only the Holocaust but also the fall of the Berlin Wall are history, are particularly at risk.
Europe without borders overestimates the consciousness of belonging to a nation, and it is easy to instil even wild ideas.
So far, European legislation has followed national measures: it does not go beyond it and it does not point the way.
However, the problem requires not only political or legal responses, so action should not just appear in our objectives, but also in responses from civil organisations and churches that profess European values and play a role in public life.
For example, Pope John Paul II spoke out against racism and xenophobia many times, and he saw the task of religion as serving truth, peace among men, forgiveness, life and love: in other words, all the values that these radical groups do not represent, or only in an extreme sense.
I would like to ask the EP President and the Members of the Commission, during the dialogue to be held with the churches, to ask the churches to act against extremists and to withdraw any gestures of support.
in writing. - (HU) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, extremist ideas and organisations have become alarming phenomena in our everyday lives, and we can see this everywhere, almost without exception.
The basic concept for the fathers of European integration was freedom of thought and opinion.
Today, these are our fundamental values.
True democracy also guarantees freedom of expression, which cannot, however, lead to any disturbance or cast doubt on peace, life and existence; indeed, we have got there today.
Nor can we allow the ideas that previously incited the Holocaust and hatred among nations and peoples to have a forum and organisations.
In many places the extreme right wing looks for and finds one of the sources for its solutions to the social problems before us in segregation and in inciting hatred, rather than in social reconciliation and integration.
The European Union, as the true repository of human rights and humanitarian protection, must do everything to make these ideas and organisations withdraw, and even to make them disappear from our everyday lives if their aggression, which disturbs the healthy life of society, so demands.
I also recommend that the Union have more room for information in its communication activities.
Unfortunately, significant layers of the population, primarily though ignorance, are susceptible to extremist, populist manifestations.
It is primarily the young generation that is at risk, since they have not had the means to obtain the relevant historical experience of finding the right direction.
Our task is to help them with that.
If we give up, we will shake the foundations of our future.
in writing. - (RO) The European Union must fight against any type of extremism, since this activity is contrary to the principles of freedom, democracy and respect of human rights lying at the basis of the Union.
For this reason, at European level, anti-extremist and anti-terrorist actions should not affect the fundamental rights of citizens.
Extremist movements of paramilitary groups, ultra-nationalism, xenophobia, calls to violence and local ethnic and religious conflicts threaten the stability of the European Union, characterized by a rich cultural and traditional diversity of its Member States.
The latter must join efforts to fight extremist actions and identify the instigators and organizers of such actions.
The European Agency for Fundamental Rights will also play an important role in preventing racism and xenophobia, ensuring a climate of security on the territory of the Union.
Dialogue, education and public information on themes related to promoting tolerance and combating racism are important elements that contribute to the dissemination of the principles of freedom and democracy.
Member States should also cooperate and make efforts to integrate marginalized social and ethno-cultural categories, so that fight against discrimination and incitation to violence would ensure an ethnic and political harmony inside the European Union.
Montenegro - EC/Montenegro: Stabilisation and Association Agreement (debate)
The next item is the joint debate on
the statement by the Commission on Montenegro,
the recommendation, by Marcello Vernola, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on the proposal for a Council and Commission decision on the conclusion of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Montenegro, of the other part - C6 0463/2007 -.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I wish to thank Mr Vernola for this very solid report, which is due to be adopted at a very crucial stage of our relations with Montenegro.
Let me first make a point on the European perspective of the Western Balkans.
The Council meeting of EU Foreign Ministers on Monday reaffirmed that the future of the Western Balkans lies in the European Union.
As proof of that we have in the last two months signed a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Montenegro and initialled SAAs both with Serbia and with Bosnia-Herzegovina.
I want to thank the Portuguese Presidency for its major contribution to these encouraging steps.
I hope we can soon sign the two latter agreements, once the conditions have been met by these two countries.
Montenegro has made good progress since independence, including in the development of smoother, well functioning relations with Serbia.
Of course a decisive step on Montenegro's European journey was taken on 15 October this year when we signed the SAA with the country.
I welcome the unanimous ratification of the SAA by the Montenegrin Parliament soon thereafter.
The SAA provides a stable framework for economic, political and institutional development in Montenegro and it is a significant step forward in the country's European integration path, provided that the Agreement is properly implemented.
In another positive development, I also welcome the adoption of the Constitution of Montenegro only a few days after the SAA was signed.
The new Constitution, which is broadly in line with European standards, helps strengthen democratic institutions in the country.
Its full implementation will require further efforts and determination.
The Commission's regular progress report, adopted on 6 November, highlights these positive developments.
It commends Montenegro for establishing the necessary legal and institutional framework following independence.
It also underlines progress made by Montenegro in preparing for the implementation of the SAA and strengthening its administrative capacity.
Our progress report also points out certain key challenges that Montenegro will face in the coming years.
For instance, Montenegro's administrative capacity remains rather weak and therefore administrative reforms need to be continued at all levels.
In the fight against corruption, urgent action is needed to achieve concrete, tangible results.
Money laundering and organised crime remain areas of concern.
These are also highlighted, rightly so, in your report.
The new Constitution enhances the independence of the judiciary by setting up a new constitutional body, the Judicial Council, in charge of the appointment and dismissal of judges.
The Government also adopted a judicial reform strategy for the period 2007-2012.
Its implementation will certainly be a major challenge but it is clear that Montenegro needs to ensure the independence, accountability and professionalism of its judges and prosecutors.
Montenegro participates actively in regional cooperation.
It has good relations with its neighbours.
Most issues with Serbia following independence have been settled.
Montenegro has also taken a constructive approach to the Kosovo status issue, aligning itself with the EU's position.
Focus should now be on full implementation of the interim agreement on preparations for the whole SAA as well as on the recommendations of the European partnership.
Montenegro needs to build a solid track record of implementation and of reforms.
She has got off to a very good start in the stabilisation and association process and I hope that the country will build on this positive momentum.
We are very much looking forward to working even more closely with the Government of Montenegro, the Parliament, other institutions and the civil society of the country on its European reform agenda.
I am pleased to inform you that the new Commission delegation has been operational since 1 November and is preparing to take over the work carried on by the European Agency for Reconstruction, in due course as planned.
Montenegro is expected to receive close to EUR 100 million under the instrument for pre-accession in the coming three-year period until 2009.
These funds will assist Montenegro in such areas as the rule of law, the strengthening of administrative capacity and implementation of the SAA.
Economic and social development and civil society development certainly will be another priority.
So I trust we can count on the strong support of the European Parliament, which is crucial as always.
(DE) Mr President, this was announced as a debate or as statements from the Council and the Commission.
I only wanted to ask where the Council is and whether it will at least be represented again at Council Question Time or perhaps even in the course of this debate.
The services inform me that the debate is taking place in this way by decision of the Conference of Presidents, as the Council is engaged in preparations for the meeting of the Council in Lisbon tomorrow.
rapporteur. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is now accepted that the future of the Balkan countries lies in Europe; that was confirmed by the Thessaloniki European Council in 2003 and has been endorsed by ourselves in this House on a number of occasions, marking an end to any further discussion of the issue.
Montenegro is undoubtedly in pole position on the road towards accession to the European Union, as the facts show: following independence from the Union with Serbia in 2006, declared democratically after a proper referendum and duly agreed with the Serbian Government, the negotiations for the country's own Stabilisation and Association Agreement were re-opened and concluded in the space of slightly more than two months.
The agreements were initialled on 15 March 2007 but, unfortunately, some technical problems then arose which slowed down further progress, although the end is now in sight.
The Commissioner has just announced that an office has already been opened in Podgorica - which we commend - and that everything is now in place for ratification of the agreement.
Montenegro's progress in the last year, the commitments into which it has entered vis-Ã -vis the European Community and ongoing reform work, even in the last few days, all lead us unhesitatingly to endorse the favourable opinion on the conclusion of the agreement.
Clearly, however, that is not the final goal, but is no more than a starting point.
Montenegro must now focus on implementing all the measures needed to complete the reform process which is already under way in order to fulfil the commitments into which it has entered in the Stabilisation and Association Agreement.
From that point of view, we should note the good climate of cooperation between the European Parliament and the Parliament of Montenegro, which we have met on a number of occasions and by which we shall be welcomed next week in Podgorica.
Montenegro has everything that it needs to bring this process swiftly to a conclusion, starting from its status as a candidate for accession.
Montenegro's economy has continued to grow in recent years and that has helped to attract huge foreign investment, partly as a result of fiscal policies favourable to enterprises.
As a result, unemployment has dropped sharply from 33% to 12%.
Some months ago, the new Constitutional Charter was adopted, a clear sign of the extent to which the country is strengthening the democratic prerogatives which mark it out in the Balkan area.
The Montenegrin authorities are working speedily to bring themselves into line with European standards.
The most recent news has led us to table five amendments to take account of recent developments.
In the last few days, a cooperation agreement with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia has been signed in order to regulate technical assistance in respect of that Tribunal.
We should bear in mind that unconditional cooperation with the ad hoc tribunal in The Hague is of crucial importance for all the states emerging from the break-up of Yugoslavia.
We should also bear in mind that Montenegro has never shirked its international obligations, and indeed has always been praised for its efficient cooperation with the legal and foreign authorities.
Montenegro needs to make further efforts to combat and put an end to organised crime in the area of illegal cross-border trafficking.
The European Parliament also considers that corruption in the public administration and the judiciary needs to be combated: the country is responding positively to the European authorities and signs of this can be seen in the new Constitution which introduces mechanisms to protect the autonomy and independence of the judiciary.
The capacity of the ruling class will also be developed by participation in Community twinning programmes and exchanges with the Member States.
Some of these programmes will foster the development of younger people and researchers.
Promoting the free movement of people, in particular students and researchers, is a goal which is being pursued among other things by simplifying the procedure for the issue of short-stay visas in respect of which specific agreements were signed last September with the European Union; the final goal is fully to liberalise visas in order to make freedom of movement effective, another major point of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, and to open up channels fostering growth and education.
We consider that cultural bodies should be allowed to flourish, for instance by promoting the voluntary sector and protecting the representatives of civil society.
Freedom of thought must be ensured as must the right to information.
The environment deserves a special mention: the previous Constitution defined Montenegro as an ecological republic, the first in the world to give itself such a label.
Nature has been kind to the country, from the beautiful coastline to the natural Bay of Kotor and the Durmitor mountain massif which is on UNESCO's World Heritage List.
That heritage must be safeguarded by specific legislation which is in many cases already in the statute book but not strictly applied, often for lack of financial resources.
The country derives considerable income from tourism, but unfortunately tourism itself may have an adverse impact on the environment, as the facilities available do not have appropriate systems for managing the major influx of tourists from an ecological point of view.
For that reason, we asked Commissioner Rehn in another forum to focus the Commission's attention on promoting environmental policies, especially as regards renewable energy sources, waste and water management and coastal protection.
Montenegro is aware of the problem and is continuing to work towards proper management of natural resources.
The spatial plan regulating construction work so as not to spoil the coastal landscape has recently been approved.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, I naturally welcome the progress which Montenegro has made since declaring its independence and which has very quickly led to the conclusion of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement.
The Montenegrins, of course, should not sit back and relax now but should fully implement the agreement they have signed.
They should follow the guidelines they have set themselves and enable their administration to apply enacted legislation.
They should ensure that the judicial system is brought up to scratch and that action is taken to combat corruption, especially in the administration and the judiciary.
I am well aware that the particular situation which prevailed in the region in the 1990s allowed corruption to take hold and that it is very difficult to eradicate it today, but it does nothing for Montenegro's reputation among the countries of the European Union when its name keeps cropping up in connection with smuggling, corruption and money laundering.
Montenegrin politicians must do everything in their power to alter that image.
After all, at some stage the people of the European Union are supposed to welcome Montenegro into the fold.
For this reason it is imperative that the development of democracy and a market economy in Montenegro should take place in a truly transparent framework.
I do not intend to discuss every point that has been raised today or is still to be raised, nor will I refer to everything that is contained in our resolution.
I would like to stress, however, that the Montenegrin landscape is a jewel, and special measures are needed to conserve its unique characteristics.
This means, as Marcello Vernola said, that the clause in the new Constitution declaring Montenegro to be an environmental state must not amount to an empty promise.
The coastline and hinterland must be protected, and megalithic investment projects must be prevented.
Natural features and sites of cultural and historic interest must be conserved in order to ensure that Montenegro does not squander its unique tourist appeal.
There are enough cautionary examples of such desecration in western Europe.
A sell-out of the coastline and hinterland must be prevented, and judicious development of tourism and cautious land-use are the order of the day.
There is an urgent need to prevent overdevelopment of the coastline, and land and property speculation must be curbed.
I am pleased to note that there now seems to be a land-use plan for that area.
I welcome the cooperation with ICTY, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, and hope that it might result in the arrest of Mr KaradÅŸiÄ at some point.
It is also my earnest wish to see Montenegro finally create the national agency that will let the country enable its students and trainees to take part in the Erasmus and Leonardo education programmes.
We will be meeting a delegation of our counterparts from the Montenegrin Parliament next week, and we will encourage them to support their government in its efforts to pursue the path of convergence with the European Union and to combat all the abuses to which we have been referring.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, at the EU summit in Thessaloniki in June 2003, the Heads of State or Government reaffirmed their support for the development of a European perspective in the Western Balkans, where Montenegro is the newest successor state of the former Yugoslavia, having declared its independence from Serbia in 2006.
Since then, its relations with the European Union have become ever closer, and Montenegro has clearly chosen to steer a European course.
I particularly welcome the conclusion of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement on 18 October, which marks a milestone in relations between Montenegro and the EU.
It brings numerous benefits to that small Balkan country, particularly in business and trade, for it provides for a free-trade area as well as facilitating investment and business cooperation.
On 19 October 2007 little more than a year after the declaration of independence, another important aim was achieved when the Montenegrin Parliament adopted the country's first Constitution, which will play a particularly important role in forging the identity of this young nation.
It establishes Montenegro as a democratic, liberal and environmental state based on the rule of law.
That is a great success.
Montenegro still has a long way to go to attain membership of the EU, but remaining obstacles are being dismantled bit by bit.
There is still a particular need for progress in the struggle against the informal economy and corruption.
The functioning of a free and independent judicial system, cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and, above all, reform processes in the spheres of democratisation, human rights and the protection of minorities are indispensable for Montenegro and its future in the EU.
The initial priority must be the successful implementation of the reforms prescribed by the Stabilisation and Association Agreement.
On 1 January 2008 Slovenia, another of Yugoslavia's successor states, will take over the Presidency of the EU Council.
It is gratifying that one of the priorities of the Slovenian presidency will be the Western Balkans.
The security and stability of the Western Balkans are a paramount interest of the region itself and of the whole of Europe.
A democratic and stable Montenegro can and should play a major role in the pursuit of these goals.
Let me close by emphasising that the prospect of Montenegro acceding to the EU one day, albeit in the more distant future, is the main generator of further reform processes.
We in the European Parliament should support Montenegro on its way towards the EU.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (SL) Over a hundred years ago Montenegro was a kingdom on the political map of Europe.
It was recognised and valued both culturally and politically.
Part of the coast, the Bay of Kotor, was an integral part of Austro-Hungary and at that time also provided access to the sea along with present-day Herzegovina.
Montenegro was at one time part of modern Europe and is now preparing itself for full cooperation in and membership of the European Union.
Since May 2006, when it became a new European country, Montenegro has made encouraging progress as regards implementation of the European agenda.
It deserves heartfelt congratulations for its signing of the Stability and Association Agreement and the new laws adopted in October.
Podgorica also deserves recognition for its cooperation with the Hague Tribunal and its positive role and contribution to the long-term stability of the region.
