Since we can expect him soon to invent a new pretext for preventing the creation of a Palestinian State and the onset of peace, I believe that the famous Quartet should take precisely the opposite stance.
Mr President, I will try to respond to those Members who have asked questions and who are in the Chamber as well as those Members who have asked questions but, since they have greater interests elsewhere, have had to leave it.
I agree completely with what Mr Galeote has said and I believe it is absolutely essential to take advantage of a window of opportunity which is not large but rather small.
I believe that all the comments by Parliament's very worthy representatives have indicated this in one way or another.
There are some reasons to be hopeful, but there are still huge reasons to feel frustrated and hopeless.
What we have to do is to take advantage of this moment, this window of opportunity - and I believe that is what the international community is trying to do - to make progress.
Circumstances like the current ones, which have been pointed out by Mr Patten, many Members, and myself are not going to come about again.
Let us therefore get to work.
That is what we are trying to do.
We must do everything we can to prevent the peace process being hijacked.
We have spent too much time living with the consequences of the great political error of the famous seven days of total peace.
That decision of the seven days of total peace, with no doubt whatsoever, delayed the process and prevented decision making.
I believe that we should now do everything possible to prevent conduct which could stop us from making a rapid, and parallel, start on work in three directions: security, the new composition of the Palestinian Authority and the new legitimisation of the Palestinian Authority and of the peace process.
These three elements - in my judgement - should move forward in parallel and neither one of them should hijack another.
The third issue I wanted to mention - as I have said many times and I repeat today, since I am convinced of it, though I could be mistaken, but I know that even in the European Parliament people can make mistakes - is that I believe we have had a lot of experience of peace processes since the Madrid Conference, including the Oslo Conference until the present time; however, what we have not had, unfortunately, is actual peace.
I believe the time has come for a short process and a long peace.
We have had long peace processes but no peace.
The time has come for a short and quick process which brings us as quickly as possible to peace and, from then on, to rebuild the Middle East, a process in which the offers made by the countries of the region can be measured in real terms.
What we are offering today are commitments which, for the first time, are of a contractual nature.
I would like to say one thing which has not been said and which I would like to repeat.
President Arafat said something yesterday on television which he had never said or which, at least, I had never heard: he spoke of the State of Israel as a Jewish State.
I believe that President Arafat had never spoken in these terms before.
That short phrase of three words contains a very large part of the solution to one of the most difficult problems: the problem of the refugees.
We must therefore carefully weigh up every word uttered by anybody, and not only one person, because sometimes we find, in certain phrases which we do not analyse in depth, thoughts which may have significant consequences for the solution of the problem and there is no doubt that the problem of the refugees will continue to be a fundamental problem in terms of a solution.
If you ask me what the most realistic agenda for the Conference should be, I would reply in all honesty that at the moment I do not know.
I believe that the agenda must be based on basic principles, that is, peace for territories, the Security Council resolutions and that, as I said before, it should include an essential element which is new: the Beirut Initiative, which does not only also offer a framework for the traditional Madrid lines of negotiation, but also introduces a regional aspect which could be of fundamental use in terms of resolving the problem.
It has been said that the Palestinian State must be recognised as soon as possible.
I agree, but it must not be before the Palestinians want it to happen.
If you came with me to ask Mr Arafat, at this moment, if he would like, this very afternoon, the Palestinian State to be declared, he would certainly reply: "do not be in such a hurry and wait a bit".
This is not the moment therefore and we should do things in accordance with the rhythm that the Palestinians themselves want.
The Palestinians know that if the Palestinian State were established today, they would not be in a position to operate as effectively as we would like and therefore we must give them the opportunity to prepare themselves adequately and to have the guarantee that the Palestinian State is a State that functions, that is viable and that defends the values which we all, and above all they all, or the majority of them, wish to be respected.
With regard to terrorism, I believe that we must continue to say over and over again that it is not possible to achieve peace while there are suicide bombers who do not only kill themselves but who also kill others.
We must state and recognise this, both in this House and in any other.
The other day I said to President Arafat that he needs 'the best' - his young people - in order to build a future, and the future will not be built if 'the best' are killing and being killed.
The best he can do is to convince those young people to support and participate in the construction of a Palestinian State.
They will all be necessary.
And that teacher of mathematics or that teacher of literature who are killing or being killed would have been essential in order to teach literature in the university when the Palestinian State is functioning or to be a good mathematician.
That is what the leaders of Palestine must say clearly to their citizens: you are all necessary!
We need all of you in order to build a great country.
Mr Cohn-Bendit suggested that we allow a year for the creation of a Palestinian State and for the United Nations to declare its existence.
I do not want to argue about that timescale: I do not know whether one year is better than nine months or twenty-two months.
That is a decision which does not fall to us, but to the Palestinians, but it is true that the sooner it is and the sooner they are ready the better.
A resolution by the Security Council of the United Nations would be the most logical and appropriate way to recognise the existence of a State.
Mr Poos said some very sensible things and I completely agree with many of them, I would differ slightly in relation to certain others but in general I believe that we are on the same wavelength in terms of the solutions we are proposing.
I would like to say to my good friend, Jacques Poos, that I believe some people here may have been sitting back and doing nothing.
The honourable Members are well aware that this speaker has never sat back and done nothing, neither when he was a Minister representing his country - when I was a colleague of yours and we had many opportunities to speak; we must therefore be respectful in the words we use.
If you believe that I have been sitting back in relation to this conflict, I think you are wrong and, if you will allow me, I could look back and recall moments when the European Council has been sitting back.
As for Mr Emilio MenÃ©ndez del Valle, once again I respect what he says and I appreciate the passion with which he has defended the peace process for a long time, but I believe that we must not be naive - which he is not, but many other are, in general: I believe that the Likud Party will continue to say what it has always said and we cannot expect it to change its position at the moment.
We cannot expect the Likud Party to applaud the immediate creation of a Palestinian State.
It is not going to do so.
However, it is very possible that, very shortly, that party's position may not be the same as the one expressed by the Council the other day, as our experience over many years suggests.
Mr MenÃ©ndez del Valle, who knows the issue well, is well aware of the mark made by Mr Netanyahu when he was Prime Minister, which the previous President of the Government was unable to do.
We have therefore seen many changes of position - I will not mention opportunism - over the years and, in the Middle East, we have yet to see many more.
The important thing is that the ones we see should lead to a peaceful and just future.
I sincerely believe that the European Union is fulfilling its obligations.
We cannot solve the problem on our own, but nobody can solve it without us and that is where our strength, and the road we must take, lies.
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on Council reform.
Mr President, we are now dealing with a completely different issue and we will have to adapt our mental 'chips' to the new topic.
I would very briefly like to talk to you about two issues.
The first relates to a report which I had the honour of producing at the request of the Council with a view to studying whether, before the end of the whole process of reforming the European Union - in particular institutional reforms - the Council could operate more efficiently, naturally within the existing legal framework and in accordance with what the Convention and, later on, the Intergovernmental Conference, may decide.
The proposals which have been presented and which are being analysed at the moment, so that some of them can be approved at the Seville European Council, are very simple and easy.
The first would involve a change in the operation of the European Council.
The Council, as you know, does not operate as it should, at least in my opinion.
The European Council was conceived as the motor for the European Union's great political strategies and it should therefore have a speedier and simpler working mechanism which is more suited to that objective.
The European Council currently has far too packed an agenda, which the Heads of Government do not have time to prepare.
Those Heads of Government spend a very large amount of their time approving conclusions on a huge number of dossiers - sometimes more than 60 - which means a tremendous amount of writing, and the effort required to produce them does not correspond to the number of people who read them.
We therefore have to do everything we can to ensure that the European Council operates in a speedier and more rational way, just as the cabinets in the majority or all of the countries of the European Union operate, with well prepared agendas which focus on decision making in those Councils which require it.
This does not require great institutional changes: all it requires is the political will to achieve it.
We should also try - and this is my suggestion - to hold European Councils of at least three different types: a European Council intended to take well-prepared decisions, with a clear agenda in which decisions could be taken, in my opinion, also by a qualified majority in the future; a second Council which would be of a more monographic nature, that is to say that the Heads of Government would concentrate on one part or element of Europe's great political life and in which they do not only try to give instructions but also, if possible, offer practical solutions which could aid the functioning of the European Union; and thirdly, European Councils of a more informal nature, in which the European Union leaders could sit around the fireplace - although it would be a huge table rather than a fireplace - and discuss issues which are of importance in terms of the present, the near future and the long-term future of the European Union.
I feel there is a lack of in-depth consideration of very important issues which perhaps relate more to the future than to current times.
Having said this about the European Council, I would now like to discuss its preparation.
This includes deciding what Council to prepare and what form it should take.
Until now, as you know, the tradition has been for the General Affairs Council, which is made up of Foreign Ministers of the various European Union countries, to be responsible for preparing it.
However, these Ministers have an increasingly busy and packed agenda, on issues which strictly relate to the European Union's foreign and security policy.
If you see the agendas, you will realise that they are increasingly full and this raises the question of whether it is possible for the General Affairs Council, with its current structure and form, to devote sufficient time to horizontal issues which are ultimately issues dealt with by the European Council.
There are many formulae for solutions.
I am not going to point out any particular one: I suggested three or four which are now being discussed, but I do believe that in one way or another, we should opt either for separating the Councils or for dividing into separate sessions - which cannot be the same Council with different sessions - issues strictly relating to foreign and security policy, of which there are many, from those issues which relate to the preparation of the agenda of the European Council.
In the end, what happens is that those issues are not prepared thoroughly enough for the European Council to be the effective organ we all want to see.
Therefore, there may be two or three models for Councils: one in which there is a separation of the General Affairs Council with the essential role of preparing the European Council, which will imply an increasing amount of work; another possibility is that the General Affairs Council could consist of general affairs in a stricter sense, where each government could send somebody to contribute more effectively to the preparation of the European Council, in accordance with the issues, and another formula which would mean that it devotes itself strictly to foreign and security policy issues.
The third issue raised in the report is an issue whose solution will fall to the Convention and ultimately to the Intergovernmental Conference.
However, I believe, Mr President, that it is an issue which we will have to start thinking about.
It is undoubtedly a difficult issue which changes certain fundamental elements of our European Union tradition, and that is the notion of the rotating six-month Presidency.
During my long political life, which is becoming too long, within the European Union, I have been a Minister in the Presidency of the European Union twice and now I see that Presidency from a different point of view.
I honestly believe that, as the number of countries increases and international life becomes more and more complicated, it is going to be more difficult to maintain the six-month rotating Presidency.
In the early days of the European Union, when we essentially dealt with internal problems exclusively affecting the countries of the European Union, we were able to do so with the six-monthly rotating system.
As the Union takes on many more responsibilities, which do not relate to us - to our countries - but also to third countries, I believe that speed, the maintenance of certain common positions and the tenacious defence of certain elements of our policy, make it difficult, unless we adapt the model for the Presidency, to achieve all the results which the honourable Members frequently say in Parliament can be achieved.
I know this is a very difficult issue and that there are countries for whom it is essential or very important to their conception of being a Member of the Union that they hold the six-month Presidency on a regular basis.
I understand this, but all countries should consider that when the day comes that we are twenty-something countries, they will have to wait a long time for the Presidency to come round again.
So perhaps the value of holding the six-month Presidency on a regular basis will be reduced when the interval between one Presidency and another becomes many years.
However, my comments on this issue are of a purely personal nature, because it is clearly something which the Convention will have to deal with, just like the other issues, and which ultimately the Intergovernmental Conference will have to decide on.
The fourth issue which I believe we should devote some time to - and that is why I put it in writing, so that it might be discussed - is the issue of the transparency of the Council in general, but, in particular, when it is acting as legislator.
I believe we must think about a way to involve public opinion more closely at times when the Council is acting as legislator; this is another issue which must only be dealt with in the Convention and subsequently in the Intergovernmental Conference, but I do think it is important for us to start creating a certain environment or culture in which, sooner or later, and the sooner the better, this type of consideration takes place throughout the collective life of the European Union.
But to return to the two fundamental issues, which do not require either the Convention, in principle, nor the Intergovernmental Conference, but simply political will, the will to get things done, I believe that achieving a more effective preparation and management of the European Council, ensuring that it focuses more on the fundamental issues, that it carry out more rigorous analysis, with more solid, serious and effective preparation, is something which can be done without waiting for tomorrow.
If there were currently the political will, it could be implemented today, because there is nothing to prevent it - the Treaties do not prevent it - and it would in no way alter the fundamental operation of the European Union.
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, this is the kind of work we are immersed in at the moment.
As I have said, in Barcelona I presented an initial brief report indicating these kinds of issues almost in note form.
Today, the Presidency - together with the team of the Secretariat - is making contact with the different capitals to see whether there is any possibility, between now and the end of June, when the Seville European Council takes place, of reaching a consensus on some of these issues which strictly require the political will of the fifteen leaders, and the Commission, to sit around the table.
This is very briefly what we are working on at the moment, ladies and gentlemen.
There are many other things to do in relation to the reform of the Council, which will no doubt be on the agenda of the Convention and the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference.
We will have time to discuss them and, if possible, to reach agreements that favour a more efficient institution which can deal with issues in a more rational and effective manner in a Europe which, fortunately, is new, because the world is new; a better Europe because the world is better.
Mr President, Secretary-General of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, all the opinion polls on Europe which we have been analysing show that, in the eyes of our citizens, our institutions are very complex, in fact too complex, that they are not transparent, and that they are too far away.
I myself believe that this complexity, or at least part of it, should be assumed and explained by each of our institutions, because this complex aspect is the price we have to pay in order to have a Europe which is united without being, at the same time, uniform.
That does not mean, however, that as far as the remaining - not inconsiderable - amount of complexity is concerned there is no room for improvement, or no need for changes to be made, particularly at a time when we are getting ready to face numerous threats to the operation of the European Union, with 30 countries (initially 25) sitting around the table instead of 15.
We are well aware, as Javier Solana has said, that the essential reforms will require amendments to the Treaties.
There have already been some amendments, but they were, to say the very least, far from being enough.
This means that if we are to succeed this time we must first of all discuss the tasks of the Union, and that is what we are doing in the context of the Convention.
That is the Convention's work on the future of the Union.
However, other reforms can be carried out now within the present legal framework, simply, if there is a willingness to do so, by changing habits or practices.
As far as the European Commission is concerned, on whose behalf I am speaking, at President Prodi's instigation we have begun a series of internal reforms.
We have launched quite a broad programme of administrative reforms involving the working methods of all our departments.
As for the Council, it has been carrying out its own reflections, initially on the basis of a report whose recommendations, made in 1999, have not yet been followed up.
It seems to me that the great strength of Javier Solana's report is that it relaunches the debate in very specific terms, even in a somewhat pedagogical manner, and, as he himself has said, that it provides - already in Barcelona and shortly in Seville - a basis for creating political willingness among the Heads of State and Government.
These basic documents remind us of the need for more structured planning of the Union's initiatives at the level of the Presidency, and confirm the need for better horizontal coordination of the various formations of the Council.
They envisage a European Council which is centred on its role of providing political impetus and, finally, they recognise the need for greater transparency in the legislative process.
For the Commission, this debate is a very important one, and Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, is making an extremely constructive and substantial contribution to it, thanks to the work of your rapporteurs, Mrs Maij-Weggen and Mr Poos.
On behalf of the Commission, I should simply like to assure you of our support for the four aspects of the reflections being undertaken regarding the reform of the Council.
Regarding the first aspect, we say yes to the idea of introducing, as soon as possible and wherever possible, improvements to the way in which the Council works.
The Commission supports the Council's intention of implementing, in the near future, every possible initiative which does not require an amendment to the Treaties, while leaving it to the Convention to draw up more global and definitive proposals for the future institutional system of the European Union.
On the second aspect, we say yes to the principles of consistency, efficacy and transparency on which the Solana report wants the reform of the Council to be based.
As the Commission has already had occasion to emphasise in the White Paper on governance, each of our institutions must, of course, concentrate on its essential tasks.
However, the reform of the Council is not only necessary for the Council itself: it is also necessary for the other institutions and for the Union itself.
As for making sure that the Council goes back to concentrating on its essential functions, I would just note in passing that the conclusions of the European Council in Barcelona, the Commission's proposals and those expressed by Parliament in its various resolutions, including those that you will be adopting at the end of this debate, are all in line with one another.
For example, the Council should be organised differently when it is creating legislation, with open debates and public votes.
On the subject of a possible legislative Council, I have nothing to add to what I told you when we were examining the Poos report last October.
Thirdly, on behalf of the Commission I shall say yes to what I would call the rediscovery of the Community method, because this is the only method that gives us a chance of resolving certain difficulties immediately.
For example, one of the objectively important and delicate questions concerning the way the Council works is the question of the rotation of the presidency, a question which Javier Solana spoke about just now.
We have two options: one option which, in order to stabilise the presidency, assumes that the Treaties will have to be amended, and another option which would not require any such amendment.
In the case of the second option, I would point out that continuity in the Council's work and consistency in the planning of successive presidencies can be achieved by the traditional route: the Commission proposes, and the European Parliament and the Council deliberate.
The annual policy strategy submitted by the Commission will thus make it possible, this year, for the first time, for Council and Parliament to enter into a real and stable dialogue on the policy priorities and the working programme for next year.
We also support the idea, without amending the Treaties, of creating a Council responsible for horizontal questions.
We support this idea, which would lead to such a body having assigned to it the original mission of the General Affairs Council, in other words the coordination of the Council's specialised bodies and in particular the preparations for the European Council.
Let us rely on Coreper, which should once again become the traditional route by which the Council's meetings are prepared.
Finally, and following Mr Solana's example, I shall close by saying that we also say yes to more transparency.
This is now obligatory, following Regulation No 1049/2001 and the measures which Parliament, the Council and the Commission have already taken and will be taking shortly with regard to the question of access to preparatory texts.
This will make the Community legislative process easier to understand.
However, a number of documents are already accessible.
Above all it is a question of helping members of the public to find more easily the information that they are seeking.
There will soon be a joint brochure issued by the three institutions, which should help them to do just that.
Above all, we shall achieve even greater transparency by giving maximum publicity to the deliberations of the Council, particularly when it is engaged in the legislative process.
That is the spirit in which we welcome Mr Solana's report, together with the innovative and practical proposals that it contains and, of course, as Mr Solana has said on several occasions himself, knowing that a large part of the progress, the reforms and the improvements will depend on the existence of an immediate political willingness on the part of the European Council and, a little later, on the existence of a political willingness within the Convention, and then within the future Inter-Governmental Conference, when we shall have to discuss more fundamental and more substantial reforms.
Mr President, Mr Secretary-General, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first a warm word of thanks to Secretary-General Solana - and of course to the Commissioner - but especially to the Secretary-General, because we generally agree on most points with the Commissioner anyway; a word of thanks for having kick-started the reform process in the Council.
Secretary-General Solana, I should also like to offer you a heartfelt word of recognition for the almost superhuman work which you carry out around the world as our High Representative - with particular commitment in the Middle East - and as Secretary-General.
It is only because you are such an extraordinary person that you can do this.
I do not want to start an institutional debate on your office right now, but I cannot even begin to imagine that there is anyone else out there who could bear the double burden you have to bear and shoulder it so brilliantly.
I should like to offer you my warmest thanks for having tabled these proposals.
As Commissioner Barnier said, we have a joint duty to reform our institutions, in this case the Council.
The first thing we need to do here is to make a distinction between the General Affairs Council, the Council as legislator - which is, in fact, the most important Council - followed perhaps by the Council that prepares the meetings of the European Council and then of course the Foreign Affairs Council for foreign policy matters.
We know - by name - who arrives late at the Foreign Affairs Council, leaves early and, in between, sits looking rather bored while the Council legislates, which is why we feel we need a European Affairs Council for European legislation and a separate Council for foreign policy in general.
This European Affairs Council would always be present at legislative work and could also prepare the meetings of the European Council, the most important task of which is, of course, to legislate.
The European Affairs Council would, of course, be responsible for appointing the representative to the Council/European Parliament conciliation committee when legislation is on the agenda.
We know that at the moment officials - nothing against officials, it is just that they are not politicians - often attend as Council representatives and then consult with the European Parliament on the issues in question.
But we need politicians who have the courage to bring about results with Parliament and we expressly support radical reform in this direction.
We would also be doing the legislative process a service if the Council of Ministers or, perhaps, the Europe minister representing the presidency also attended Parliament when legislation is on the agenda or even that one or more representatives of the European Parliament - i.e. MEPs - attended the European Affairs Council when it is acting as legislator, so that the Council can ask the European Parliament for its views.
There is still a great deal that needs to be debated here. What I should like to ask you to do, Secretary-General, is to discuss the matter again with the relevant committee - its chairman is right here - while you are preparing your paper and before you send your final report to Seville.
If, understandably, you cannot do so personally, your representative could consult with the relevant committee.
You rightly addressed the question of transparency, which is a matter of particular concern to Mrs Hanja Maij-Weggen who, with Mr Poos, drafted the resolution to which our group still has a number of proposed amendments.
Mrs Maij-Weggen is not here today because she left for the Netherlands after today's vote in order to take part in the elections, the outcome of which we are all waiting for with bated breath.
We want maximum possible transparency, which is why the Council, when it holds legislative meetings, should meet in public once the reform process is completed.
The media - including the television - should report on the Council, so that we know exactly how each individual government voted at the end.
Please, Secretary-General, once it has finished with the regulation on transparency, let us instruct the interinstitutional working group to draw up guidelines for greater transparency which ensure that we get through to our citizens.
Your proposals, what the Commission has said and our contributions basically go in the right direction.
If we carry on working with commitment, we shall together achieve a good result for our institutions; and not just for our institutions, but for the European Union as a whole and for the citizens of Europe, and I wish both you and us success in our endeavour.
(Applause)
Mr President, Secretary-General, in its resolution of 22 October 2001 on the reform of the Council, the European Parliament expressed the opinion that the proper operation of the Council is essential in order to guarantee the democracy, efficacy and coherence of the decision-making process in the enlarged Union.
That resolution also condemned the present institutional drift away from the Community method, as well as numerous instances of the malfunctioning of working methods and of the way in which the Council operates.
The European Council in Barcelona last March finally tackled this recurring problem, though not without deciding, yet again, to postpone it to the European Council in Seville which is planned for June 2002.
Nevertheless, we should welcome the fact that, in the meantime, the Blair-SchrÃ¶der letter and the report by Mr Solana entitled 'Preparing the Council for Enlargement' have defined those questions which will require an answer before the next reform of the Treaty.
The proposal to lighten the agenda and to get the European Council to concentrate once more on its role of providing guidance and impetus, as laid down in the Treaty, is an initial step in the right direction, and I should like to thank the Secretary-General for having emphasised this important point in his speech.
The restoration of the importance of the General Affairs Council and a radical reform of the way in which it operates are obviously the essential corollaries to a reform of the European Council.
The Ministers for Foreign Affairs and/or European Affairs, of which it is composed, should work more and better. In other words they should meet more often and subject themselves to greater discipline.
Instead of being interested solely in the CFSP, they should pay more attention to horizontal issues and should once again become the principal decision-making body and the principal body preparing for the European Council.
If the General Affairs Council - and I am delighted that the President of the Council is with us today, so that he can pass on the message to his colleagues - as I was saying, if the General Affairs Council does not pull itself together, it will sink into oblivion.
It will be the Heads of State and Government who will take over everything, who will deal with everything, via their secretaries of state or other delegated ministers, and who will, in short, bypass the Community preparation process, including Coreper.
If this happens, make no mistake, the intergovernmental method will have triumphed and we can kiss the Community mechanism goodbye.
That Community mechanism requires the Commission to propose and the European Parliament and the Council to dispose, all in the greatest possible transparency.
In the draft resolution that we have in front of us, the two rapporteurs remind us of the principles which, according to the European Parliament, ought to inspire the reform of the Council, and they emphasise the fact that there is now an urgent need for action.
Mr President, I thank Mr Solana for his extremely interesting statement.
But reading between the lines, as one should, it is fairly clear that not much progress is being made to reform the Council.
Perhaps it is quite unrealistic to think that there could be progress before the problems are dramatised with the presence of 25 or so ministers at the table.
But, frankly, I find it extraordinary that Mr Solana and Mr Blair and several others can float the idea of creating an executive committee formed out of the Council presidency without referring to the role of the European Commission.
It would be best to be blunt here.
The imposition of a board of directors of the Council would steal the Commission's right of initiative and destroy its critical role in identifying and expressing the common interests of all the Member States.
It is only the Commission that can ensure the equality of all the states.
As to the question of the presidency, no debate could be complete without considering whether it would be the proper thing, in the end, to let the Commission chair the ordinary meetings of the Council, while letting Mr Solana chair the Foreign Affairs Council, preserving the routine six-month circus for the European Council itself.
That might be the most appropriate approach to ensuring tight coordination and continuity within the Council.
Finally, we should refer to the Byzantine tangle of comitology.
The efficiency of the Union will be greatly improved as soon as the Commission is granted sufficient executive authority to act without the constant interference of the Council.
So reform has much further to travel before the Convention will be satisfied that we have grappled satisfactorily with all the important questions.
Mr Solana, one of the European Union's strangest idiosyncrasies is demonstrated by the fact that, after discussing the Middle East crisis with us, you are still here with us, immediately afterwards, discussing an issue which could not be more peculiar or further removed from your role of High Representative for Foreign Policy: the Council reforms.
Moreover, I have to say, by way of introduction to this brief speech, that, in my opinion and the opinion of my group, your place is not on this side of the Chamber: it is on the other side.
From this point of view, we feel that the basic shortcoming of your proposals lies in the fact that you still believe, or appear to believe, that the role of the Council, be it the European Council or the ordinary Council of Ministers, is that of government.
In our view, this is not the case, for, in terms of both effectiveness and democracy, the Council's role should be that of co-legislator.
We therefore see quite considerable cause for concern in the direction the debates are taking on two issues in particular. The first is the rotating Presidency.
You say that it is not effective, that it is not working properly and that the term of office should be extended.
In that case, you must explain to me what sort of relationship will be created between this future Presidency, which will last for two or two and a half years, and the President of the Commission.
I am sure there will be a problem of inconsistency and the potential for conflict.
Therefore, let us leave the Presidency alone and rather endeavour to enhance the Council's role of legislator, for that must be the basis of the forthcoming reforms.
Moreover, the Council reforms can only be carried out as part of an exercise restoring the balance of powers of the different European Union institutions and strengthening the power of the European Parliament as co-legislator.
Now, I would just like to make one brief observation since you have mentioned transparency.
We would really be extremely pleased if the Council, as a sign of its commitment to transparency, were not to follow the opinion of its Legal Service, which has stipulated that the European Parliament is not to have access to common positions on external relations and accession negotiations.
I feel that this is in total conflict with your statements on the issue of transparency.
In this regard, we would like to know whether we can rely on you and the Council to remain independent of your highly esteemed Legal Service.
Mr President, Secretary-General of the Council, the Council is without doubt the institution most in need of reform.
There is much that is no longer acceptable, be it the complicated structures and sub-structures which have got completely out of hand or the lack of coordination of Council work by the General Affairs Council.
Blurred structures, overly complicated decision-making processes and, above all, a lack of transparency and openness are the reasons why much is beyond our citizens' comprehension, when they even know about it, that is.
Ask anyone you like to tell you the difference between the European Council and the Council of Europe.
We know that European regulations cannot be passed unless the governments agree in the Council of Ministers, but still one of their favourite games is to tell the public that "Brussels" is to blame or to attack the Commission simply because it goes down well with the voters at home.
Unfortunately, my government has gained a rather dubious reputation here recently, which is why we need really radical reforms, reforms which stop ministers from hiding from their responsibility for European decisions behind "Brussels".
So how should we proceed?
We need clear regulations so that national parliaments can exert a democratic influence on, and democratic control of, what their governments do in Europe.
Secondly, we need a Council that meets in public when it is legislating, with television cameras to relay debates and votes and allow the public to follow the decision-making process.
And thirdly - and I agree with Mr Poettering here - we need to create a European Affairs Council which takes account of the progressive drive towards European integration, because European policy is no longer foreign policy in the traditional sense, it is actually European domestic policy.
Mr President, I would also like to start by thanking Mr Javier Solana, the Secretary-General of the Council, for attending this debate and by congratulating him on the document he presented in March and which was the subject of a preliminary debate in Barcelona.
I find it difficult to understand the criticisms made by some Members given that this document is largely in line with this Parliament's own views.
Nor can I subscribe to the critical comments that I have seen in certain diplomatic circles to the effect that the document produced by the Secretary-General of the Council does not contain many new ideas, but is a collection of ideas that have already been discussed for a long time in the Council.
As I see it, this is not anything negative, it is in fact positive, especially if the decisions to be taken in Seville are to be effective and vigorous and cover ground that has been an issue for a long time. However, the Heads of State and Government have hesitated to take such decisions or have even resisted taking them.
There are sometimes areas in politics on which we all agree, and there are other areas on which we all differ. The issues of building Europe and institutional reform do not fall into either of those categories.
We neither agree on everything nor differ on everything.
These are issues on which we partly agree.
I would also like to make another point: sometimes we agree on objectives but not on the means of achieving them; at other times we agree on the means but not the objectives.
We wish to clearly distance ourselves from the motion for a resolution presented by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs in that it suggests that the proposed reform should favour the Community method or the intergovernmental method.
We do not believe this is the path we should be going down.
But we agree with the concrete steps proposed, especially regarding what must be achieved in the short term and as regards the so-called transparency of the functioning of the Council in its legislative capacity.
I even believe that it would be helpful for us to give this transparency another name, because the transparency we are talking about here is not the same thing as transparency in access to documents.
Publicising the workings of the Council in its legislative capacity or open meetings are in fact important ways of achieving reform in working in this area and a way of tackling the heart of the democratic deficit of the European Union.
I am associated with sectors that are calling for greater involvement of national parliaments in the building of Europe.
And I even believe that this can only happen when the Council opens its doors during legislative debates.
Our colleagues in the national parliaments will relate and react differently to EU legislative work done at Council level if they can directly follow what our governments, the governments of every Member State, are discussing and the positions that they are adopting within the Council.
So there is a serious contradiction in this secretive approach, a fundamental contradiction between the democratic basis of the Council and the undemocratic way in which the Council works.
We believe that this needs to be put right, and that is not because we want to weaken the intergovernmental axis of the European Union; just the opposite in fact. We want to protect that axis and strengthen it, but we want to give it more visibility and make it more democratic and participatory.
I would like to see reform heading in this direction and to leave other subjects until later, in particular the more sensitive issue of the presidency of the European Union.
We are not willing to contemplate any departure from the principle of the rotating presidency.
Mr President, the proposals named by Mr Solana today have scarcely all been prepared by him.
Dispensing with the rotation system resembles successive French Presidents' attempts to make their mark on the EU through what was termed a 'directorium'.
Is it the Deputy Secretary-General of the Council, Mr de Boissieu, who is behind this?
The rotation of the presidencies is the most democratic thing about the EU.
It means that everyone is equal.
Luxembourg can chair the meetings in the same way as France.
Lilliputian Luxembourg has in actual fact had some of the best presidencies.
President Chirac of France's Treaty of Nice does not do credit to France, and it would scarcely get past the French electorate in the event of a referendum.
The majority of Frenchmen are, in general, more intelligent than France.
Mr Aznar, the Spanish President-in-Office of the Council, has specifically used his presidency of the European Council to instruct the President of the Commission to postpone the reform of the common fisheries policy and sack the Commission's Director-General for Fisheries.
On Friday, Mr Smidt was Director-General and was not on the rotations list.
On Sunday, a trick was played in the course of a telephone conversation.
On Monday he was sacked, and the Commission lied directly about the reason.
The events are the biggest scandal I have experienced in my 23 years in this House.
It requires an independent inquiry, which the Chairman of the Committee on Fisheries has quite correctly requested.
For now, it must simply be concluded that coming from a large country is not in itself any guarantee of a good presidency.
Let us bear in mind the similarities between the countries and share the tasks.
We must not have group presidencies involving the large countries, in which the small countries are allocated the least interesting tasks.
It would be wiser to reduce the number of Councils of Ministers and working parties and focus on the transnational tasks we cannot carry out as effectively in our own countries.
It would be wiser to limit and consolidate EU legislation so that it becomes more manageable.
It would make more sense to introduce full transparency in the Council of Ministers when the Council acts as legislator. In that way, we should all be able to see when officials legislate instead of the elected representatives who have legislative power under the constitutions of all 15 EU countries.
In that way, we could have openness, democracy and proximity to the people instead of secrecy, a lobbying culture and government at a distance.
Mr President, the European federalists are not very happy with the report on the operation of the Council prepared by its Secretary-General, Mr Solana. That report says, and I quote, 'The European Council is the Union's supreme political authority.
It possesses a legitimate power of decision. It represents the unity between the Union, on the one hand, and its Member States, on the other, in its closest form?.
Yet this statement is perfectly true, and it could also apply to the various Councils, in particular as regards the essential, or even vital, link which it establishes with Member States.
I will go even further by saying that, with the prospect of an enlarged Europe, which will of necessity be a flexible Europe, the Council will naturally play a pivotal role, because it can be easily adapted to fit the variable geometry, whereas the Commission is a more rigid institution, as is the European Parliament, at least in its current form.
Therefore future reforms will have to take into account the Council's central position in order to improve its efficiency, its visibility and its transparency. The reforms proposed by Mr Solana seem to us to be along the right lines, subject to certain reservations, which I shall refer to in my explanation of vote.
Mr President, whatever the outcome of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference, one of the Union's main problems will be preserving its decision-making capacity, its governability and the coherence of its policies.
In the future institutional architecture, the Council will be defined, on the one hand, by its power of co-legislator, on the other, by its role of guaranteeing the governability of the Union as a whole, and, in addition, by the attempt to achieve coherence between the Union's policies at all levels.
We are firm believers in an effective, transparent Council exercising all the powers currently conferred on it by the Treaties, but we certainly cannot deny that the model we have been following in recent years, in which the Council has the role of laying down political guidelines - which is certainly essential for the Union's progress - has been struggling recently and may well need to be adapted and brought into line with growth and with the global changes which have taken place in our institutions themselves.
There are countless examples of this: just now, a Member mentioned the excessive expansion of our agendas, but we will not go into the details of specific cases.
What is quite clear is that the situation creates anomalies to the detriment of the Community method.
That is why we decided to call for urgent reform of the Council, precisely with a view to making the Union as efficient as possible.
These reforms are in the interests of the citizens and all the other institutions, they would not necessarily take long to implement and they can probably be carried out without amending the Treaty.
We must take note of the fact that, thus far, the chief victim of this uncomfortable situation has been the Community method, for it has meant that the Commission and the European Parliament are deprived of some of the roles conferred upon them by the Treaties.
Complete transparency must surround the reorganisation of the mechanisms, and the process must be completed before the enlargement of the European Union takes place.
I would like to thank the Members for their contributions to this resolution, which I trust will lay down the direction we must take to achieve a strong Europe which is close and, above all, open to the citizens.
Mr President, all the institutions face a major challenge with enlargement bringing in more members to each institution, but none more so than the Council.
The Commission and Parliament are better placed to deal with these difficulties, but meetings of ministers flying in for a short time to Brussels, when it takes half a morning just to have a tour de table - really provide the Council with a challenge.
Much of that will require treaty amendments.
That is a matter for the Convention.
In the immediate future, in Seville, the Council will be facing changes that can be made within the framework of the existing Treaties.
I too welcome the identification in Mr Solana's report and elsewhere of the changes that could be made.
It is right that we should try and get the European Council to focus on strategy and on the key strategic issues and no longer be a court of appeal when the ordinary Council is deadlocked.
That is of fundamental importance.
In addition, where subjects which, in the ordinary Council, would be taken by a qualified majority, go to the European Council, they should similarly be dealt with by a qualified majority in the European Council.
That is also well and good.
It would also be a good idea to split the General Affairs Council from the Foreign Affairs Council.
Some Member States will want to send the same minister to each for various internal reasons.
Others will not.
That is up to each Member State, but the functions should be separated so that they are both done well instead of badly.
Other changes can be made without amending the Treaties.
Meeting in public when the Council acts in its legislative capacity is one of them.
Yes, we have made progress in terms of access to documents and publishing the results of votes in the Council.
That was an important step forward, but we must go that step further and actually meet in public.
Finally, members of the Council should establish a better rapport with members of their national parliaments.
The protocol set a six-week period for them to do this for any item of legislation.
They should do this properly.
That is the way to involve national parliaments, not by creating some new institution which would duplicate the Council, some sort of third chamber.
Get the ministers to do their jobs properly and it will be done well without needing new structures.
Mr President, Secretary-General, Commissioner, well done to the Council for thinking about its own reform.
There is, in fact, a great deal we can do without treaty amendments and it is indeed important for us to think about efficiency and transparency as we do so.
I think that splitting the Foreign Affairs Council from the General Affairs Council is, as Mr Corbett has just said, the right starting point on the administrative side.
On the legislative side, we really do need public meetings.
Public meetings in the sense that the Council as a whole is publicly accountable, so that our citizens know who is responsible for what and so that the public interaction between the legislators, between Parliament and the Council, can take place in public, so that our citizens can understand who is responsible for what in Europe.
I think that this also has a positive side effect and will bring about a degree of improvement in that the individual specialist Councils would then become committees of the legislative Council rather than legislative bodies in their own right, with the negative, unbalanced results which that might bring.
But what is also of paramount importance, I think, is that we make sure in our declarations in the run up to Seville that these endeavours, which are right and proper, do not end up stealing the Convention's thunder and we make sure that the control functions tally and that Parliament's codecision function is not undermined.
What we want to avoid, when decision-making procedures are dealt out, is a situation in which the European Council becomes the supreme legislator in the European Union with no codecision ties to the European Parliament - a situation in which only the Council can legislate.
I warn you, if that is what is being attempted, we should write down anything and everything which might weaken Parliament and the Commission and reduce the potential for control before the Convention reaches any conclusions, because otherwise the good image of Seville may be in serious jeopardy.
Be careful not to entertain notions such as these, notions which I sometimes hear coming out of Berlin and London.
Mr President, openness will be one of the most important yardsticks for citizens in assessing the results of the EU's efforts concerning future reform.
The EU institutions must show citizens that they are prepared to live up to their expectations.
In European Parliament and Council Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 of 30 May 2001 regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents, we have a specific set of rules whose Article 4 addresses the need for secrecy.
This must not be sidelined through the institutions' internal rules and classification.
The Inter-institutional Committee has an important brief and it must push ahead and implement existing legislation in a spirit of greater openness.
Hopefully, the Spanish Presidency will manage to push through proposals in Seville that will comply with expectations.
Spain has a big responsibility in terms of openness.
Spain could take the initiative in helping to foster a more positive attitude in those who still harbour doubts about openness.
Particularly in view of Spain's earlier reticence, it is now important to demonstrate a more positive approach to openness.
The fact that the Council of Ministers is to meet openly when discussing legislation is a step in the right direction.
To this I would like to add a wish list for Seville.
All the documents - - including those from Council working groups - - that are subject to the co-decision procedure and the first pillar, must be available.
This would be the logical follow-up to your earlier comments.
Subsequently, we should also be provided with information on national positions.
Finally, we also need reasonable democratic control of documents covered by the second and third pillars.
The pillar structure is, at the end of the day, a totally useless construction for establishing openness.
Mr President, Mr Secretary-General, Commissioner, there are gestures which deserve our applause in their own right.
That applies to the plans for reform of the Council.
Some of the subjects that the Secretary-General referred to, which are highly complex politically speaking, need a revision of the Treaties.
For this reason it would be very helpful if the Council could present these proposals to the Convention on the future of Europe in time for them to be discussed and incorporated, if that is agreed, into the outcome its work, which is to be presented to the Intergovernmental Conference next year.
However, I think we all agree that many, indeed the majority perhaps, of the reforms needed for the Council to function well do not fall into this category.
There is essentially a consensus that the day-to-day working of one of the most important institutions of the European Union has drifted away from the model set out in the Treaties.
In practice, this "intergovernmental drift" has not only deprived the Commission and the European Parliament of some of their powers under the Treaties, but has also deprived our national parliaments of means of effectively scrutinising their own governments.
For this reason, I agree with Mr Poos, the co-rapporteur of the report presented to Parliament on the reform of the Council, when he says that people expect the European Council to have an open and forward-looking political vision, and strategic options and guidelines, rather than responsibility for coordination or taking decisions which should be made by the General Affairs Council.
It is also crucial to recognise that as a co-legislator the Council should not hold its discussions behind closed doors and that it should be open in exercising its political responsibilities.
It is important that it should be possible to identify who does or does not make decisions at European level.
For many of our citizens, Brussels is distant and needs to be given a human face.
The Council bears a great responsibility for this failure to bring the Community institutions closer to the public, making its mission very important.
I wish them good luck!
I will say very briefly that in the 16 speeches I have counted, issues of all types have been raised.
I can see that the Convention will have an enormous job to do in order to agree on all of them.
As for myself, what I wanted to present to you was a much smaller and more modest idea, which can be carried out immediately with just political will and which could have positive results in terms of the good functioning of the European Union.
The majority of suggestions made go much further than what I wanted to discuss with you and are not within my remit, but will fall to the Convention and subsequently the Intergovernmental Conference.
However, I would like to say that I have learnt a lot and if the 620 MEPs had been here I would have learnt a lot more.
I am sure we would and I hope we would.
The debate is closed.
Question No 1 by Bart Staes (H-0265/02):
Subject: More beneficial use of unspent budget appropriations
The Court of Auditors' annual report on the 2000 financial year revealed that more than EUR 11 billion in European budget appropriations had remained unspent.
Commissioner Schreyer confirmed at a recent meeting of the Committee on Budgetary Control of the European Parliament that the budget surplus for 2001 was approximately EUR 10 billion.
Under the existing financial rules, these unspent funds are returned to the Member States.
Yet the European Union is in need of large sums of money, inter alia to help cope with the impact of enlargement.
The Council and Parliament together comprise the budgetary authority.
What view does the Council take of the idea of amending the financial rules so that in future unspent funds would no longer be returned to the Member States but be paid into a fund which could be used to finance measures, for example, connected with enlargement or to fight poverty?
Mr President, since last time I was accused of filibustering by Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, who told me that I was wasting time with my answers, I am going to start to answer as quickly as possible, but I would like it to be recorded in the Minutes that I am beginning exactly seven minutes late.
I do not therefore want to be accused of that type of thing again.
In response to the question from Mr Staes, I would like to say that the Council is aware that the implementation balance of the last two budgetary years reached a very considerable volume.
I would point out to the honourable Member that, in the Council recommendation on the discharge of the 2000 budget, the Commission is asked, with the cooperation of the Member States, to be more accurate in its budgetary forecasts, both in relation to sources of funding and in terms of expenditure, with a view to preventing excessive surpluses in the future.
If necessary, and as suggested by the Court of Auditors in its annual report, the Commission should make modifications, in order to take account of the different developments, by applying the existing budgetary instruments.
The Council believes that, within the framework of the legislation in force, we should insist on the need to improve budgetary estimates so that this situation does not arise to this extent again in the future.
On the other hand, with regard to the suggestions of the honourable Member, the Council would like to point out that it cannot go ahead with such a revision without a previous proposal from the Commission.
In its latest proposal to reshape the Financial Regulation which is currently being debated in the Council, it has simply insisted on the principle in accordance with which the balance for each financial year will be allocated in the budget of the following year, as income or as expenditure, whether there is a surplus or a deficit (in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 7 of Article 32 of the Financial Regulation of 21 December 1977, which is now being reviewed) and this must be done by means of an amending budget.
Consequently, and in accordance with what I have just said, the Council is still seeking a way to maintain the payment appropriations allocated in the budget.
I am delighted with your response.
We had a minor dispute about Chechnya yesterday, but I am satisfied now. Things can change, as you can see.
Mr de Miguel, I completely share your view that a better description must be produced and that the budget must be planned more effectively.
All of this must be done.
However, if there happens to be a budget surplus, if there has been underspending, if you establish that this amount was 10 billion last year, and 11 billion the year before that, and maybe a few billion this year, then would it not be a good idea to put this money in a fund of some kind?
This fund should also be used, really used, for emergencies which we know are heading our way.
Enlargement is going to be far more expensive than currently envisaged.
Let us put the money in a fund so that it cannot return to the Member States, for in the final analysis, we agreed in the ping-pong game between the Council and Parliament, the two budgetary authorities, that a certain amount will be spent in a certain year, and that we actually spend this money on Europe and not let it make its way back to the Member States.
I could not agree with you more.
It is a shame that the budget is not spent and the money has to be returned at the end of the year.
Naturally, it does not fall to me to decide this; there would have to be a provision in the Financial Regulation which, as you know, would have to be approved unanimously by the Member States.
It would therefore be highly desirable for a provision of this type to be introduced and approved in the new Financial Regulation, which is about to be adopted.
With regard to Chechnya, I regret that there has been a misunderstanding.
I reacted like that simply because I believe we have been insisting on the issue of Chechnya with true dedication, in accordance with the views of the European Parliament.
I did not mention it in my speech, but not because I had forgotten it, since we always have it very much on our minds.
Question No 2 by Glyn Ford, which has been taken over by Andrew Nicholas Duff (H-0267/02):
Subject: North East Asian Development Bank
Does the Council support the establishment of such a bank in order to provide desperately-needed infrastructure investment in the region?
The Council has not received any requests to support the establishment of the North East Asian Development Bank and furthermore has no knowledge of such a proposal.
Question No 3 by Josu Ortuondo Larrea (H-0268/02):
Subject: Request from the Basque Parliament to the Council for measures to promote dialogue in the Basque country
On 1 March 2002, the Basque Parliament adopted a 'non-legislative proposal' drawing attention to the various positions adopted within the European institutions on internal political conflicts in the EU, such as the European Parliament's Reding report of November 1996 and Watson report of November 2001.
Finally, it called on all political forces, without prejudice to the need to take measures against all crimes committed by those who use violence for political ends, to support the following resolution:
'The Basque Parliament expresses its firm belief that political dialogue is necessary to resolve conflicts.
This Parliament also calls on the Council, the Commission and the Presidency of the European Parliament, on the bases outlined above and in line with the different positions expressed by various distinguished political representatives, to persuade the European Union to use its political resources to promote measures to encourage dialogue and dÃ©tente in the Basque country'.
In the light of the above, what measures will the Council take to encourage a dialogue process capable of resolving the long-standing conflict in the Basque country, bearing in mind in particular that, because the region is situated between France and Spain, this is an internal European question?
Mr President, the Council has never debated the question posed by Mr Ortuondo Larrea as it is not within the scope of the powers conferred on the Council by the Treaty.
I would like to remind Mr Ortuondo Larrea that our system is governed by a Treaty that confers powers on the various institutions and that the Council only handles matters specifically attributed to it by the Treaties, and that the subject of his question is not in the Treaties.
Mr President, I would like to quote a few words by Arturo CampiÃ³n to the President-in-Office of the Council. Arturo CampiÃ³n, a great Navarran thinker, used to say that there are French Basques who are not Spanish, but who are Basque, and Spanish Basques who are not French, but who are Basque: both are Basques and Europeans.
How can we say that a Basque problem is not a European problem?
Mr President, in view of Mr Ortuondo Larrea's question and what he has just said, I would like to begin my speech with a basic geography lesson.
The Basque Country is not between France and Spain. It is not Andorra.
The Autonomous Community of the Basque Country is in the Spanish state, and, naturally, the French Basque Country, as the name itself suggests, is in the French state, and is part of the French state.
Let us, however, move on to the supplementary question.
Does the President not think that if Basque President Ibarretxe, who is of course the main representative of the Spanish state in the Autonomous Community of the Basque Country, according to the Organic Law of the Statute of Autonomy, were to devote all his efforts and those of his government to going after and arresting terrorists, and isolating their accomplices, and had he come here, to Parliament and the Institutions, to ask us for help in putting a stop to ETA, the terrorists would already have lost hope?
Does the President not believe that the problem in Basque politics is not only lack of freedom due to terrorism, but also the existence of a democratic government that undermines the democratic institutions it democratically employs, and creates conflict, and I repeat, creates conflict between the Kingdom of Spain and the French Republic?
Mr President, I am not answering as President-in-Office of the Council, but as a representative of the Spanish Government: I can do nothing but agree entirely with the opinion expressed by Mrs DÃ­ez GonzÃ¡lez.
Mr President, I would like to know whether perhaps the question I put to the President-in-Office of the Council does not deserve a reply, as I have not heard his reply.
Mrs DÃ­ez GonzÃ¡lez, who appears to be the representative of the Spanish Government here, has replied to me.
I have a lot to say to her, but this speech is addressed to the President-in-Office of the Council, rather than to her.
Mrs DÃ­ez GonzÃ¡lez wishes to raise another point of order.
I would ask you not to raise any more, as there is a second supplementary question.
I must say at the outset that I yield to no one in my condemnation of terrorism and terrorist acts, and this issue affects not just Spain but all countries in the European Union.
Mr Aznar spoke recently about the need for dialogue between the Palestinians and the Israeli government in the Middle East peace process.
Could the President-in-Office - in either his capacity as representative of the presidency or as representative of the Spanish government - give an example of any previous situation in world history where a policy of non-dialogue with people who are carrying out terrorist attacks in a country such as Spain has ever resolved the situation.
There are many people in this Parliament and in Europe who believe that at some stage it will be essential for Spain - however regrettable, however much it dislikes the idea - to enter into a dialogue.
If that is not the case, could he give me an example of some situation where non-dialogue has worked?
I have already said that I am here as President-in-Office of the Council of Ministers of the European Union and I repeat that the Council of Ministers has never discussed the subject brought up by Mr Ortuondo Larrea and by the last speaker, and that this subject is outside the scope of the powers attributed to the Council by the Treaty.
As President-in-Office of the Council, therefore, I have nothing to say, and as representative of the Spanish Government, I answer to my own Parliament, not the European Parliament.
Naturally, as President for this sitting, I must not enter into the debate, but chair it.
For information purposes, however, I must tell you that Annex 2, which concerns the procedure for Question Time laid down in Rule 43, clearly states that questions shall be admissible provided that they do not contain assertions or opinions.
There are questions that contain very important assertions or opinions, which are not always in agreement with the Constitution of the Member States.
I must tell you that this question was considered admissible in the context of support for freedom of speech, according to the French translation. The Spanish translation was not taken into account.
A similar question submitted in future, however, would not be declared admissible.
I have already said, moreover, that as President for the sitting, I am simply clarifying the Rules of Procedure for you insofar as they are relevant to the nature of the question.
Mr President, I do believe that you are now giving a very one-sided interpretation of the Rules of Procedure.
I have not been an MEP for very long, but I have been around long enough to know that we definitely used to discuss past problems within Member States.
The Northern Irish issue springs to mind.
A whole series of reports have been written on that subject, and it is therefore not unknown for this House to discuss Member States' internal problems where the fight against terrorism is concerned.
I fully subscribe to the question from the English fellow MEP from the socialist group.
Only a dialogue - involving terrorists if necessary - can secure sustainable peace.
Mr Staes, I am not going to enter into a debate.
I was commenting on the Rules of Procedure and the assertions made in the question.
It is inadmissible to make important assertions that are contrary to the current state of affairs in Europe.
I was not entering into any debate.
I do not agree with you, the debate has taken place with the utmost respect for freedom of speech, and all I have done is comment on the Rules of Procedure.
Question No 4 by Mihail Papayannakis (H-0272/02):
Subject: Influx of immigrants from the Third World
Every time there is a mass influx of immigrants across the EU borders, we see a revival of the public debate on the need for joint action by the fifteen Member States.
Despite the fact that the need for a common European asylum and immigration policy is generally recognised, the issue is addressed in a fragmentary manner with long delays.
Given the inadequate means available for tackling this problem (the European Refugee Fund with a very small budget for 2001-2004 and the proposal for a Council directive laying down the minimum standards on the reception of applicants for asylum in the Member States (COM(2001)0181/final
The conclusions of the Tampere European Council of 15 and 16 October 1999, the objective of which was to apply the provisions of Title IV of the Treaty, aimed at the gradual creation of an area of freedom, security and justice, stated the need to establish a common policy on asylum and immigration.
The conclusions also indicated the four elements on which the said policy should be based: partnership with countries of origin; a common European asylum system; management of migration flows; and fair treatment of third-country nationals.
In November 2000, in line with the Tampere conclusions, the Commission adopted two communications, one on a common immigration policy and the other on a common asylum policy. These communications laid down guidelines which the Commission believes should be used as a basis for defining a common strategy in the medium and long term and creating a common framework.
The conclusions of the European Council Meeting in Laeken of 14 and 15 December 2001 highlighted the need, consistent with the establishment and application of a common policy on asylum and immigration, cited in the conclusions of the Tampere European Council, to push through the proposals debated in the Council and consider the adoption of other actions and measures as soon as possible.
In this respect, the bodies of the Council are currently examining various legislative proposals.
With regard to the area of legal immigration, the debates concern very important and sensitive matters, such as regrouping families of third-country nationals and the situation of third-country nationals who have been resident in a Member State for years and the requirements to be met by third-country nationals in order to be allowed to enter the Member States and be able to exercise an economic activity in these States.
In the case of asylum, even though debates on the subject are under way with regard to certain proposals for directives, the Council, on 25 and 26 April, was able to establish general guidelines on the highly important directive laying down the minimum standards on the reception of applicants for asylum in the Member States, pending the opinion of the European Parliament.
With regard to reinforcing border controls and combating illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings, it should be reported that the Council of 27 and 28 February 2002 approved an action plan establishing the actions and measures that the European Union must adopt and setting deadlines for their implementation.
Reference must also be made to the activity of the High Level Working Group on Asylum and Migration, charged by the Council on 25 and 26 January 1999 with drawing up action plans for the countries of origin and transit of asylum seekers and migrants, on the basis of an integrated approach.
The said action plans establish, amongst others, actions to encourage and promote development in the countries concerned, and practical measures to reduce clandestine migration flows.
The Council has adopted action plans for Afghanistan, Albania - a region bordering the EU - Morocco, Somalia, Sri Lanka and Iraq.
In this respect, it should also be noted that a budget heading, B7-667, has been established. This is intended to finance projects within the framework of cooperation with third countries in the area of immigration.
The difficulties experienced in the areas of immigration and asylum, to a great extent, relate to the significant differences between legislation in the Member States, which has changed substantially in recent years.
What is more, the need to anticipate and combat illegal immigration has sometimes led to the adoption of more restrictive national legislation.
Nevertheless, despite the difficulties and problems raised in the debates on instruments laid down and proposed to implement the provisions of the Treaty, in particular on the basis of the guidelines laid down in the conclusions of the Tampere European Council, the commitment and efforts made at Council level to speed up their examination and adoption, and thus create a basis for a body of binding legislation for the Community as a whole in this respect, should be highlighted.
I thank the President-in-Office for his presentation of the intentions of the Member States, even though we already know what they are.
I asked for plans and dates.
When shall we have this sort of policy?
My question did, of course, include a number of issues which appear to be of no concern to the Council, such as aid for refugees and efforts to integrate them.
Be that as it may, my question is as follows:
Mr President-in-Office, on 15 April, the Council decided on a number of measures which will apply to countries which do not cooperate with the European Union and which in fact facilitate, even if they do not exactly channel waves of illegal immigrants towards the Member States; however, it opted not to list these countries, while at the same time stating that it would be taking measures against these countries, which are clearly not doing their job and cooperating with the European Union.
Surely this is a contradiction, Mr President-in-Office?
Which countries are they?
Why do you refuse to name them?
And what measures do you intend to take to make them cooperate with the European Union?
I would like to remind Mr Papayannakis that just yesterday afternoon, the Spanish Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for the Interior appeared in Parliament solely for this subject.
All these matters were discussed for hours.
I think that, after the debate that took place, it would be superfluous to repeat everything Mr Rajoy said yesterday.
I believe I have given a long and comprehensive answer to Mr Papayannakis' comments, and it seems to me that it would be superfluous to enter into another debate on these matters, since one took place yesterday.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I believe we are all aware of the fact that the distribution of these tasks between the Member States is incredibly uneven.
We know, of course, that Greece will bear a heavy burden and that Spain and Italy bear heavy burdens that are completely unreasonable in relation to the average income in these countries, especially when comparison is made with a country like Denmark, which is a comfortably long way away from the influx of refugees.
We now see a number of countries which are, as I say, a comfortably long way away from the influx of refugees considerably tightening up on their refugee and asylum policy.
Britain is doing so, and so is Denmark.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, a joint resolution needs to be adopted as a matter of urgency.
Some joint projects in this area are also needed without delay, as is a sharing of the burden if we are not, in these circles, to end up very seriously at odds with one another over this problem.
I would like to say to Mrs Frahm that, naturally, it is true that there is tremendous pressure on the southern countries of the European Union.
With regard to the country I know best, however, my own country, I can tell you that Spain is well able to control its southern borders and that, currently, its problem is not border control, but the fact that there are no readmission agreements between the European Union and most Sub-Saharan African countries.
Therefore, as the Deputy Prime Minister said during the debate yesterday, the problem is not so much controlling immigration as saving the lives of immigrants who come over in dangerous vessels.
Our real problem, moreover, is not arresting them, which is very easy; our problem is saving their lives, and once we have saved their lives, the next problem is that there is no way of sending them home, as there are no readmission agreements, nor do their countries want them.
In this respect, the European Union could put great pressure on those countries that are signatories to the Cotonou Agreement.
That way, we could impose this obligation on them.
I would also, however, like to tell you for information purposes, Mrs Frahm, that the greatest flow of illegal immigrants received by Spain does not actually come from the south.
The majority of illegal immigrants coming to Spain arrive easily, unchallenged, across the border between France and Spain and come from the Eastern European countries.
These illegal immigrants cross the borders of Germany, Austria, Italy and all the other countries that have a border with the Eastern European countries perfectly easily. They cross the whole of Europe with ease and settle in Spain, and we have no means of controlling them.
That is what really concerns us, because in Spain as in Italy, which has common borders with the rest of the European Union, we are receiving more illegal immigrants across our borders with our fellow Member States than through crossings from the south by sea.
Question No 5 by Camilo Nogueira RomÃ¡n (H-0275/02):
Subject: Discrimination against Moroccan workers replaced by eastern Europeans
Five thousand Moroccan workers who in previous years were employed in the strawberry harvest in Huelva (Spain) have this year been left without employment or protection following their replacement by eastern European workers, thanks to a decision which has clearly received the encouragement or consent of the Spanish state, since the workers arrived with a contract signed in their country of origin.
What action does the Council intend to take, in the face of this seriously discriminatory attitude which runs contrary to the principles of the EU?
I would like Mr Nogueira RomÃ¡n to be aware that there are no provisions, either in Community legislation or in any agreement between the European Union and third countries, including Morocco or the candidate countries or other Eastern European countries, by virtue of which workers from a particular third country can have priority treatment to gain employment in a Member State of the European Union.
The replacement of workers from a third country with workers from another third country cannot, therefore, be considered discriminatory.
Many of the European agreements between the European Union and the candidate countries include references to conditions and methods in each Member State in the sections on the movement of workers and the provision of services.
It should therefore be pointed out that, although the situation you are referring to is very sad, it should be considered in the context of the bilateral relationships between Spain and Morocco or Spain and the Eastern European countries. The Council of the European Union is not familiar with and, I believe, does not need to be familiar with, the terms of these relationships.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, my question was about a human problem, and your reply was full of unacceptable generalities.
I suppose you are aware that the Spanish newspapers recently reported on immigrants working in a strawberry production company in Huelva who were, and I quote, "living like animals", with the company owing them more than three months' wages.
If these immigrants, who are hoping for something called "work", are living in these conditions, one can only guess at the miserable conditions being experienced by the five thousand Moroccans I referred to in my question, who are roaming around that region without work.
These people, after being used to working on the strawberry harvest for years, were this year replaced by temporary workers from eastern European states, who ironically benefit from labour contracts recognised by the Spanish Government but denied to our Moroccan neighbours.
This behaviour, apart from being inequitable and inhuman, will lead to a deterioration in relations with Moroccan immigrants, will worsen the position of the communities affected, will damage mutual respect and even lead to racist behaviour, while encouraging political extremism, which we condemn.
Mr President-in-Office, what are you actually planning to do to combat this type of behaviour?
Once again, I would remind you that we are in a world governed by a Treaty that confers powers on the various institutions and, as far as I recall, labour market regulation is not among the attributions of the Treaty.
The Council, as such, therefore has nothing to say in response to Mr Nogueira RomÃ¡n's question.
I am going to accept the point of order, Mr Nogueira RomÃ¡n, but I would remind you that the Council replies as it sees fit.
I would also remind all of you that this is Question Time, not Statement Time or General Debate Time.
You must ask specific questions.
I am going to give you a version of the Rules of Procedure as explained by me so that you remember.
Mr President, I am not happy with the reply by the President-in-Office of the Council, because I was asking him about the humanitarian situation of five thousand persons currently living in Spain in wretched conditions.
Question No 6 by Alexandros Alavanos (H-0276/02):
Subject: Representations by the Spanish Presidency to the authorities in Cairo concerning the fate of Kostas Kastanias
In his considered response to my oral question H-0950/01
Last March, pursuant to our debate and the pledge that I made here in Parliament, the Spanish Ambassador to Cairo made contact with the Egyptian authorities with regard to the case of Mr Kostas Kastanias and other people who are in the same situation.
The Ambassador asked the Egyptian authorities to authorise the repatriation of these people to their country of origin to serve their sentence.
As the Presidency indicated to Mr Alavanos in February, the protection of people who are arrested or imprisoned is one of the universal principles of human rights.
The Spanish Ambassador, the President-in-Office of the European Union, referred to this, as well as to the association agreement signed in June 2001, although I would like to point out that this agreement did not enter into force due to the lack of parliamentary ratification in the Member States.
In spite of everything, the response of the Egyptian authorities was negative: they insisted that this matter is one of national competence, in that the crimes committed by the prisoners to whom we are referring concern national security and that the current conventions do not allow for repatriation to the country of origin.
The Council is aware of the importance of the cases in question and, as it has done on many occasions in the past, it will continue to raise these cases within all our bilateral contacts, in every way possible, putting all the necessary political pressure on the representatives of the Egyptian Government.
I thank the President-in-Office for the sensitivity which he has demonstrated, both now and when we discussed the matter today, when referring to the intervention on the part of the Spanish embassy with the Egyptian authorities.
Of the three prisoners, two have died and the third has every illness you can imagine, he is a walking medical textbook. Recently he went blind in his left eye.
I repeat, this is the chronicle of a death foretold, and I beg the President-in-Office not to abandon his efforts.
In the final analysis, what counts in our political career, over and above the grand speeches we all make, is whether or not we are able to save or improve a few lives.
I would like to respond by saying that, as a representative of the Council, I am extremely open to Mr Alavanos' petition, which basically refers to a real humanitarian situation, that of a citizen of the European Union who, unjustly, is suffering an extremely cruel imprisonment.
I would like to reiterate before Parliament that the Spanish Government, which currently holds the Presidency of the European Union, will not only take another step, but will take all the necessary steps, while we have this responsibility and beyond, to achieve the release of this prisoner who, as we have been told, has suffered loss of health to an almost life-threatening degree.
Question No 7 by Andrew Nicholas Duff (H-0278/02):
Subject: EU Recruitment Office
The draft decision concerning the establishment, organisation and functioning of the European Recruitment Office would seem to breach the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
Article 21 of the Charter explicitly prohibits discrimination on the grounds of age.
Article 51 addresses the provisions of the Charter to the institutions.
Yet the draft decision enables the EU institutions to discriminate in their recruitment on the grounds of age. The Council, Commission and Parliament are solemn signatories to the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
How does the Council reconcile its proclamation of the Charter with its policy on recruitment?
I would like to remind Mr Duff that the Council has already replied in detail to this same question during Question Time in November 2001 in response to Question No 0795/01 submitted by Mrs Catherine Stihler.
I would like to inform you that, since then, the position on this matter has not changed, as the Rule of Law is still the same and, therefore, I invite you to refer to the response given by the Council on that occasion.
Mr President, I still have three concrete questions which puzzle me concerning this troublesome issue of the recruitment agency of the EU.
First: What was the point of solemnly proclaiming the Charter of Fundamental Rights, should the Council be unwilling to implement it?
Second: What sort of message does he think this sends to the citizen of the existing Union and also of the applicant countries?
Third: When does he expect the matter to be finally and satisfactorily resolved?
I can only take note of your comments, which, naturally, I will pass on to the authorities responsible for recruitment, but at this point I have nothing to add to everything I have already said.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the question of recruitment is important because it is a question of objectivity.
Whether we like it or not, we need criteria for recruitment.
We know that age, quotas for women and quotas for countries are often used as recruitment criteria.
My question - and this qualification needs to be set out - is: are there any plans to obtain professional advice here in the future, perhaps to instruct recruitment consultants to deal with this question, so that the best possible staff can be recruited in the future?
That is not really a question.
It is the speaker's opinion.

Mr President, perhaps something was lost in translation. My question was: are there any plans to use external professional support or recruitment advisors so as to ensure that the best possible staff are recruited?
The European institutions, Parliament, the Commission and the Council, have sufficient experience in staff recruitment.
Furthermore, they have a tradition of taking on staff which enables them to assess the qualities and the merits that they require in order to select their staff without needing to consult external sources.
This has not been the practice to date and I do not think it will become the practice in future.
I must inform you that Parliament's Presidency is looking into the working methods of this recruitment office, or rather interinstitutional staff selection office, and we hope that it will work, as Mr de Miguel said, competently and to the equal benefit of the three institutions.
We will have time, however, to discuss this at the appropriate moment.
As they deal with the same subject, the following Questions Nos 8 and 9 will be taken together.
Question No 8 by Jonas SjÃ¶stedt (H-0281/02):
Subject: Proposed new Danish immigration laws
The Danish government has presented several proposals designed to tighten up Denmark's immigration laws.
It is proposed amongst other things to raise the age limit for family unification to 24 in the case of marriage. This means that it will not be permitted for Danes under 24 years of age who choose a spouse from another country to live with that spouse in Denmark.
Citizens over the age of 24, too, face restrictions if they marry someone who is not a citizen of a Nordic country.
Does the Council consider that this draft Danish law restricts the freedom of movement for EU citizens and is thus incompatible with EU law?
Question No 9 by Pernille Frahm (H-0285/02):
Subject: Family unification and EU citizenship
How does the Council view the discriminatory treatment which would result from the Danish government's proposal concerning the right to family unification in Denmark for married couples where one spouse is a foreign citizen?
In the case of marriage to a Danish citizen, only citizens of Nordic countries would have an immediate right to settle in Denmark under this proposal.
Is such discrimination between EU citizens compatible with the rules on EU citizenship?
I should like to thank the Presidency for the somewhat brusque reply.
However, the Spanish Government must reasonably have an opinion if, for example, restrictions are placed upon Spanish citizens' right to live in another EU country.
Or does the Spanish Government have no opinion on this?
Europe's entire political architecture is based on every Member State respecting the national legislation of all the others but there is also the Community acquis, which we are all obliged to respect.
The appropriate body for determining whether a domestic law of a given country does not conform to the Community acquis is the Commission.
If every country or every Presidency were to judge the others, we would fall into a spiral of recriminations that would be extraordinarily damaging to peaceful co-existence within the Union.
This is why we have the European Commission, an institution with supranational powers that we have conferred on it, which has the obligation to ensure that Member States comply with the Community acquis and which must act as guardian of the Treaties.
It therefore falls to the European Union to point the finger and tell each Member State whether its national legislation conforms to the Community acquis.
Allow me then to express my hope that the Commission performs its duties and that the Spanish Presidency, as I expect of all the following Presidencies, acts with great caution and respect towards the other Member States of the Union.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, allow me to put a question to you in your capacity as legislator.
It is, of course, the Council which, in the last analysis, makes the rules governing this cooperation.
If it now appears that, with the help of this type of legislation, a Member State can prevent the free movement of labour and of citizens and create problems in terms of EU citizenship, would you be willing to alter the common regulations so that it is quite clear that individual countries cannot introduce restrictions of this kind?
As you know, ladies and gentlemen - and I am bound to presume that, as a Member of the European Parliament, you do know - the Council only acts and only approves regulations at the proposal of the European Commission.
It is the task of the European Commission to make the necessary proposals, which we then approve.
If, at a later stage, the regulations we have adopted run counter to the national laws of a given Member State, it then falls to the Commission to open infringement proceedings and to take that country to the Court of Justice if necessary.
The Court of Justice will then resolve the matter.
The Council does not resolve disputes between countries, as I am sure you are aware.
We are talking here about an extremely delicate institutional balance and about regulations that are laid down in the Treaties and which have underpinned our co-existence since 1956.
I shall, therefore, say that the Presidency is going to ensure that this institutional balance is maintained and that the prerogatives of each institution are respected.
Consequently, if a given Member State's legislation does not conform to the Community acquis or to the regulations laid down in the Treaty, let the European Commission start infringement proceedings against it and let the Court of Justice try the case.
Question No 10 by Rosa M. DÃ­ez GonzÃ¡lez (H-0286/02):
Subject: Creation of a Euro-Mediterranean development bank
The European summit in Laeken in December 2001 called on the Council and the Commission to consider the possibility of creating a Euro-Mediterranean development bank to remedy the poor economic results of the countries on the southern shore of the Mediterranean and the social and political consequences thereof.
The Spanish presidency set the creation of a Euro-Mediterranean development bank as a priority.
However, the conclusions of the Barcelona Council postponed the debate on the matter for a year.
What were the reasons for the unanimous rejection of the Spanish presidency's project to set up an independent Euro-Mediterranean development bank?
What strategy does the presidency intend to pursue in order to achieve this objective?
The Spanish Presidency succeeded in launching the idea of creating a Euro-Mediterranean bank, highlighting awareness of the need to increase investment flows throughout that region.
The Barcelona European Council of March 2002 consequently agreed to the creation within the EIB of a reinforced Euro-Mediterranean Investment Facility within the EIB, which would be set in motion as soon as possible, complemented by the Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement and an EIB representative office located in the area.
It should be added that on the basis of an evaluation of loans provided by the Facility and taking account of the outcome of the consultations held with our partners in the Barcelona process a decision on the incorporation of an EIB majority-owned subsidiary dedicated to our Mediterranean Partner Countries will be considered and taken one year after the launching of the Facility.
The Ministerial Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs on the Mediterranean dialogue, held on 22 and 23 of April in Valencia, warmly welcomed Ecofin and the Barcelona European Council's conclusions on this matter.
It also formalised, first the opening of this new structure within the EIB and, secondly, the fact that a year after the project's launch, the possibility of opening an independent subsidiary of this European Investment Bank especially dedicated to Euro-Mediterranean financing will be considered.
It does not really need to be pointed out, but it was at the Laeken European Council that the recommendation was made, once again, to create a Euro-Mediterranean development bank to remedy the poor economic results of the countries on the southern shore of the Mediterranean and the social and political consequences thereof.
Current growth in these countries, as the President-in-Office of the Council knows, falls considerably short of what is needed, not only to ensure sustainable development and to reduce poverty but to halt the massive exodus of hundreds and thousands of people who are looking desperately for an opportunity not to die in their own country.
Does the Presidency not consider that the instrument they have decided on, yielding to the position put forward by Ecofin - which was not the position of the Spanish Presidency nor of most Council members - and which appears to be inadequate, is the product - to our way of thinking - of an unambitious and unclear decision, which pulls up short and is even, I would go so far as to say, a real step backwards, which can only be explained by the lack of ambition or by the absence of a clear strategy for the development of the countries of the southern Mediterranean?
I share Mrs DÃ­ez's opinion about the disappointment created by the reality of the situation with regard to the ambition that we had set for ourselves.
As Mrs DÃ­ez knows very well, Spain, before holding the Presidency and then as holder of the Presidency, sought to achieve the creation of a Euro-Mediterranean bank and this aim consequently appeared in the conclusions of the Laeken European Council.
This was no chance happening, since we were preparing the ground for the next ministerial meeting and for the Spanish Presidency itself and this desire was asserted once again at the Barcelona European Council, but in a much more low-key way.
It is not that there was any less ambition, because the ambition remains the same and we are ensuring that it remains the same.
It is simply that the process will be more difficult and certainly lengthier than was envisaged.
The reality of the situation is that these matters must be approved with the agreement of the competent Council, which is the Economic and Finance Council and various countries felt, for reasons of their own, that opening a bank at this time would be too risky.
They opted first to create a facility, then to establish a subsidiary and then, with time, to see if the bank could be set up with contributions, not only from Europe, but also from our Mediterranean partner countries themselves, which are clearly very keen to contribute.
As I have said, I can only share Mrs DÃ­ez's disappointment.
I hope that we can continue to maintain our ambition and our objective.
This will be a more difficult, perhaps more tortuous and perhaps a longer process, but our aim is still to create a Mediterranean Development Bank which will benefit the countries of the Mediterranean basin and, most importantly, which will finance all of the enormous development needs that are so obvious to us at the present time. These needs, furthermore, have the tragic effect of forcing the citizens of these countries to leave for Europe and this causes all the misfortunes that immigration entails and with which we are all familiar.
We therefore feel that this is an instrument that can contribute to the development of these countries and, consequently, by adopting this new method, we hope to achieve our stated objective of creating this bank.
Mr President, as I see it, the problem is not so much that we provide too little money or that we would have no opportunity to do something from our side, the problem is the absorption capacity of these countries along the southern shore of the Mediterranean and the fact that, so far, we have been unable to make sure the projects are in place and the money is used for the required purpose.
Do you not rather think that, if we create some sort of Mediterranean Bank, the money will gather dust in it and as little will find its way to the region as has done in the past?
I really cannot see how some sort of Mediterranean Bank will help to get the money there.
Your opinion, which is, of course, entirely justified, is completely in line with that of the German Government, which was precisely one of those that objected most vehemently to the creation of the bank.
I must say that your arguments are well-founded, because we all know that even monies that are donated, such as the MEDA programme, very frequently go unused due to a lack of absorption capacity, or to an inability to produce projects.
A bank, however, is also an instrument, of course, with which to help countries to better understand how to make use of financial resources.
Furthermore, a bank has the merit that, because it provides loans and the loans cost money, when people pay for a service, they always have an interest in its operating better.
This is the merit of a development bank that, at the same time, is an advisory institution and which, when it charges a price for the money, ensures that those receiving the money gain more from the investment they make.
The argument you put forward is that your country was the only one to have argued for this in Ecofin.
For this reason, the Bank was not approached directly, and for this reason we opted for this phased process and we hope that, with this phased process, the conditions will gradually improve and a new mindset will come into play in the Mediterranean countries to make better use of the monies that, both in the form of donations and of loans, we make available.
Question No 11 by Esko Olavi SeppÃ€nen (H-0289/02):
Subject: The nature and funding of Galileo
It has been decided to launch the Galileo project.
What has been agreed within the Council concerning the use of the system for military purposes, and what view does the Presidency take of wishes expressed to use Galileo militarily?
I would like to reply to the question by pointing out that the Council has stated on various occasions that Galileo is a civilian programme, under civilian control.
This is the result in particular of the Council Resolution adopted on 5 April 2001 and published in the Official Journal of the European Communities No 157/1, of 30 May 2001; and also of the Council conclusions adopted on 26 March 2002 and published in press communiquÃ© No 7282/02.
Therefore, all these documents have made it clear that the Council wishes Galileo to remain a civilian programme, under civilian control.
No, definitely not.
We have clearly stated that this is a civilian programme under civilian control.
This is not a decision that has been taken lightly. It was taken after a thorough consideration of all the consequences and furthermore, placing it in the broader context of the European Union, which is the fact that most of the EU's Member States are also members of NATO.
We do not want to go into the issue of competence between satellite systems and nor do intelligence matters fall within the competence of the European Union.
I therefore feel that the decision that has been taken is that financing will be provided for this Galileo project, which will be for civilian use and under civilian control, and at no time will additional financing be called for to use Galileo for military purposes.
Question No 12 by Lennart SacrÃ©deus (H-0291/02):
Subject: Child slaves on cacao plantations in West Africa
The United Nations Children's Fund, UNICEF, has voiced its concern that child trafficking affects 200 000 children in West Africa, with the cacao industry accounting for a substantial number of them.
Child labour and trafficking in human beings is on the increase.
The cacao plantations mainly use boys, who often have to carry out the heavy work of harvesting the cacao beans.
The working day for these children is up to 15 hours long.
This is not only a question of child labour; these children are also sold as slaves among the various cacao producers.
What is the Council's response to these reports and what initiatives does it intend to take?
What action does the Council intend to take in relation to the West African countries concerned and the cacao industry?
, Council. (ES) The European Union has repeatedly expressed its deep concern at the incidence of forced labour and of child labour, and at the trafficking of children and cases of child slavery, in particular in West and Central Africa.
Last year, the European Union carried out surveys in various countries in the region and urged governments to fulfil their obligations, in accordance with the corresponding United Nations Conventions or Agreements and to adopt measures, in line with these agreements, and to foster and develop cooperation between governments in the region and international organisations, in particular, UNICEF and the ILO.
A number of West African governments have informed the European Union that they have ratified, or intend to ratify, the Convention prohibiting the worst forms of child labour and immediate action for its elimination and that they are totally committed to the fight against the trafficking of children.
Those countries that have not yet ratified this important Convention were urged to do so without delay.
The European Union will continue to stress, in bilateral contacts and in international fora, the importance of taking robust action against child labour and the trafficking of children.
I would thank Mr de Miguel for his reply.
Two hundred thousand children are affected, most of them boys.
This is a considerably widespread problem for these children in West Africa.
The answer I received has much to say about agreements.
Is there anything more we can do other than calling for appropriate conventions?
Can we bolster the education system and take steps to change attitudes towards people and, in particular, children in order to make it clear that children are not a commodity and that the civilised view of humanity we wish to build on holds that the value of children is sacrosanct and that they must be treated as people in their own right?
Is there any possibility of coordination with the US and Japan in order to help these children in West Africa?
It seems obvious to me that all the countries of West Africa are the Union's partners by means of the ACP Convention, and are signatories to the Cotonou Agreement and, therefore, do not only have a special relationship with the European Union, but also receive very considerable funds - we are talking about EUR 13 billion - for cooperation projects.
They all have, furthermore, what is known as the 'national indicative programme' agreed on with the European Commission to steer cooperation funds towards those sectors in greatest need, for their economic and social development.
I think that promoting education, integrating children into society and strengthening the family, as well as preventing the marginalisation of the weakest members of society, who are children, are some of the most important guidelines for the indicative programmes undertaken with these countries.
The Commission is extremely aware of this problem, which affects not all but certainly some countries in West Africa, and is endeavouring to use all means available to it, by funding the European Development Fund, to promote programmes of the type that you have suggested.
In any event, your comments will be conveyed to the competent Commissioner, Mr Nielson, in order to make him aware of Parliament's concern at the grave situation of these children, on whom we should focus particular attention in our development programmes.
Question No 13 by Alejandro Cercas (H-0296/02):
Subject: The Lisbon strategy and full employment
The conclusions of the recent European Council summit in Barcelona state that full employment in the European Union is the core of the Lisbon Strategy and the essential goal of economic and social policies, which requires the creation of more and better jobs.
They add that is therefore necessary to continue paying special attention to the reforms of employment and labour market policies.
The Council Presidency also stresses in its programme that creating and improving jobs must figure among the priorities of every Presidency.
Nevertheless, official estimates in the EU put unemployment at 7.8%, with Spain being the Member State with the highest rate of unemployment (12.9%, according to figures published by EUROSTAT in February 2002) and the least stable job situation, even though it has been experiencing a period of economic growth.
In the light of these figures, what initiatives will the Council Presidency take to ensure that national employment plans actually cut unemployment rates and promote quality jobs in all the Member States?
The Council considers that in order to achieve the objective of full employment in the European Union, set at the Lisbon European Council and reiterated in Barcelona at this year's Spring Council, we must continue to pay particular attention to employment policy reforms and labour market reforms.
This is why it is crucial that we eliminate obstacles to integration into the labour market and promote active employment policies, maintaining the preventive approach and individualised attention on the unemployed to prevent them falling into long-term unemployment and to help them to improve their ability to integrate into the labour market.
The Council similarly wishes to emphasise that, in order to achieve the objectives set out in Lisbon, the European employment strategy must focus in particular on the challenges that the European Union faces in the long term, especially those affecting the ageing of the population.
The European employment strategy must contribute to the creation of a dynamic and efficient labour market, in which motivated and well-trained employees are able to undertake high quality and highly productive tasks.
Consequently, the strategy must make proper use of policies that improve both the supply and the demand of work.
In the implementation of the employment strategy, the guidelines for Member States' employment policies, in 2002, which were formally adopted by the Council at the beginning of this year, broadly reflect the new political messages sent by the recent European Council, which examined the issue of full employment in Europe.
It is now up to the Member States to implement the employment policy, in accordance with the employment guidelines and in line with the principle of subsidiarity and with the Member States' own competences in the field of employment.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you are quite right to say that it is now - and always has been, since Luxembourg - the Member States that have to make the policy of the employment strategy a reality and adopt practical initiatives and not confine themselves to emphatically reiterating objectives and claims which are regrettably not translated into action and which remain as nothing more than the bureaucratic accumulation of projects or already existing administrative dynamics, without finding a new way of encouraging the nation as a whole, involving social operators, all types of administrative authorities, parliaments, etc.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, it is the Member States that are responsible and Parliament has just said, in November, and has been saying for five years, that national employment plans have major shortcomings in terms of programming, evaluating and following up; that there are no concrete objectives, that there are no indicators, that financial resources are not properly discussed.
You said, and rightly so, that individualised programmes must be created.
My reason for saying all of this, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, is to persuade you that in the 45 remaining days of this Presidency, the Spanish Presidency must really come up with a powerful initiative, because the problem is that the number of unemployed people in Europe is on the increase and we are not creating the jobs that we said we would in Lisbon and we cannot continue always saying the same thing, adopting a purely administrative approach, when faced with a problem of this scale.
I agree with you insofar as, very often, when national employment plans are put forward, they lack the necessary precision and, above all, quantified commitments, with clear objectives, in terms of how employment creation in less-favoured sectors is going to be tackled, how new opportunities are going to be created, and which measures and resources are going to be used.
However, as you know, there is no better way of obliging Member States to put forward truly substantial employment plans, than by applying the kind of pressure and political insistence that this debate represents.
We have to make States aware that the commitments made at the Councils are truly binding and also that the issue of employment is the main objective of the Lisbon strategy.
All the other elements of the Lisbon strategy are geared towards employment creation.
Naturally, I will pass on this concern to the Spanish Minister for Labour and Social Affairs to see whether, in a forthcoming sitting of the Social Affairs Council - which has still to meet before the Presidency draws to a close - we can deal with this issue once again.
However, the presentation of national employment plans takes place at the start of the year.
We made an effort at the start of this year, when everything was presented to the Barcelona Council, where there were new instructions, but I believe that it cannot be said too often, even when it is not time to submit the plans - but when we have to start drawing them up - that the European Council laid down some very clear guidelines with regard to the national employment plans, and it would be good if the States were already to make tangible forecasts and more detailed employment plans for the beginning of next year.
Question No 14 by Bernd Posselt (H-0297/02):
Subject: EU police academy and EU border police force
What is the current state of progress on two key issues which Parliament first raised in 1998, namely establishing a European police academy and a European border police force?
I would remind Mr Posselt that, on the basis of the Council Decision of 22 December 2000, which created the European Police College, a network of European police colleges was founded including all of the Member States.
The stages leading to the implementation of this Police College, or CEPOL, can be summarised as follows, in chronological order:
In 2001, the network was set up.
The members of the College committed themselves to organising ten training operations on the priority issues set out in the Council Decision.
In 2002, in the absence of a definitive decision on the location of the Agency's headquarters, Denmark temporarily hosted the secretariat of CEPOL, having previously obtained a budget of EUR 2.2 million for 2002 to be used to finance 17 training operations.
CEPOL's activities will increase throughout 2002.
21 training operations are planned, all having a clear relationship with the priorities set out by the Council.
With regard to cooperation between border control services in the Member States, the Council would refer to paragraphs 24 and 25 of the Tampere European Council Conclusions, in which Council calls for closer cooperation and mutual technical assistance between the Member States' border control services, such as exchange programmes and technology transfer, especially on maritime borders, and for the rapid inclusion of the applicant States in this cooperation.
Later, on 6 and 7 December 2001, the Council approved a document entitled 'European management of border control'.
This concept establishes, amongst other things, that those responsible for border control services should meet at least once every six months, within the Strategic Committee on Immigration, Frontiers and Asylum, and allow the candidate countries to participate in their work, at least once a year.
On 11 April 2002 the first meeting of the aforementioned committee took place in Brussels with the participation of representatives from border control services.
This cooperation represents an initial stage in the implementation of other possible forms of cooperation, specifically in the light of the deliberations taking place on the forthcoming Commission Communication on border management, as well as the result of the feasibility study carried out by the Italian authorities with regard to the creation of a European border police service.
This study, carried out within the framework of the Odysseus programme, was started in October 2001 and consists of four phases.
Its results will be presented at a ministerial conference on 30 May 2002, in Rome.
I would also like to draw Mr Posselt's attention to the content of the global plan for the fight against illegal immigration and human trafficking in the European Union, adopted by the Council on 28 February 2002.
The aim of this global plan is to define a common and integrated approach to all issues linked to illegal immigration and human trafficking.
There are seven areas for action defined in this plan, which include measures relating to border control.

Mr President, I had the honour of initiating both the police academy and the border police and the House adopted my report on them almost unanimously back in 1998, which is why I am delighted to see that things are now beginning to move four years later.
However, I have two specific supplementary questions.
First, the headquarters of the police academy: when do you think the location will finally be decided and which Member States have applied for it?
My second question concerns the border police.
Will the feasibility study be submitted to the European Parliament in June so that we too can debate it?
Mr Posselt, I would very much like to be able to tell you right now when the decision on the headquarters of the European Police College will be taken, but I am afraid that this is not an issue on which a quick decision can be made, because the headquarters of this college is included in a package relating to a whole range of European agencies that has been the cause of great controversy in the EU.
You will recall that in Gothenburg the Swedish Presidency tried to reach an agreement over headquarters; that in Laeken, the Belgian Presidency tried once again, and put forward a proposed agreement on headquarters, which was blocked by not only one, but by various countries at the same time.
And I would like to tell you, simply, in the intimacy of this hemicycle - which is certainly quite intimate today - that the Spanish Presidency is doing everything it can to put together a package that will allow all countries that aspire to host headquarters of European Agencies - given that to get a particular agency in one's country appears to be a matter of life of death to all concerned - to come to an agreement.
We are currently holding bilateral talks, and the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Aznar, when he visits the capitals of the Member States before the next European Council, will try to put together a package that can be presented to the Council.
However, I have to tell you that if this package is not sufficiently solid we are not prepared to go through the tiresome spectacle of watching the Council turn into some kind of souk in which everyone is squabbling over one headquarter or another.
With regard to the Police College, we already have temporary headquarters.
As you are probably aware, as is typically the case in the European Union, temporary headquarters normally end up being the permanent headquarters.
I do not mean to say that the Police College will remain permanently in Denmark, but, in truth, there are some temporary headquarters that have been temporary headquarters for forty years now, and, in any case, money has already been allocated for training and we hope that this will come into operation.
I shall not go into precise details right now about which countries are competing for the headquarters, other than to tell you that there are many, and often no-one knows if these countries really want these headquarters or whether they are choosing this option as some kind of decoy or bargaining tool to get something else.
Therefore, I believe that the less we deal with this issue, the better.
With regard to the second issue you asked me about, I believe that this falls within the competence of the Commission, which will come to Parliament before the end of June.
I hope it will be Mr Vitorino who comes, the Commissioner responsible, who would be the best person to answer your question in this regard.
I myself come from one of the EU's border areas, Dalecarlia, in central-west Sweden, on the Norwegian border.
Is it too early to get an opinion or could I already ask the Council whether it imagines that foreign soldiers might be responsible for some border protection duties?
Might British soldiers, for example, be expected to assist Spain with its external border protection or French soldiers help Sweden protect its borders with Norway or with Russia in the case of maritime borders?
Would German soldiers be able to assist Finland in guarding its external border with Russia?
Are these perhaps the lines of thinking?
What would be the language of command?
Should there be an international language of command or should the country's native language be used?
Mr SacrÃ©deus, I understand that proximity to an EU external border is naturally something that may cause concern, but believe me, the external border with Norway is the least of our worries, because Norway is a country with which we have an agreement, within the Schengen Convention, and is a country that for all intents and purposes is in practice a full member of the European family.
If it is not a Member of the European Union it is because the Norwegian people have chosen for it not to be, not because we do not want it to be.
Therefore, I do not see a problem and I do not think there has ever been an incident on the Norwegian border.
However, with regard to your statement about soldiers of various nationalities controlling borders, including sensitive borders between Finland and Russia, I would say that this kind of idea really belongs in the realm of science fiction.
Firstly, borders are not guarded by soldiers. Within the EU, borders are controlled by border police.
Secondly, it is hard to believe that there are soldiers of different EU nationalities controlling borders that are not their own.
A common border police team could possibly be put together, as has been suggested in the Justice and Home Affairs Councils, but this would be a common body of people recruited in the same way that, for example, we recruit a common body of interpreters or officials in this House, that is to say, they would be Community officials bound by their own rules, with their own uniform and language system - which I can see is something you are concerned about - and which will surely have its own distinguishing marks and, most importantly, a code of conduct that will be common to all.
All of this is no more than an idea, however, in the minds of our Justice and Interior Ministers and for the moment does not take any concrete form, and I believe it will take some time to come to fruition.
Question No 15 by Anne E.M. Van Lancker (H-0304/02):
Subject: Availability of Council meeting and committee documents
Since the start of the Lisbon procedure the Council, together with the Commission, has become the pivot of a number of coordination procedures.
In the committees on economic policy, employment and the labour market and social protection important work is done, which is then discussed and approved by the Council, with no input from Parliament: drafting of common reports by the Council and Commission on employment, exclusion and pensions, as well as on objectives and indicators in the fight against poverty, a subject which also involves pensions.
Sometimes, also, the European Council refers to these documents, without their being publicly available.
Is the Council prepared to forward these documents drafted by the Commission and the other committees to Parliament?
Is it possible to publish documents approved by the Council in the OJ and on the website?
Is the Council prepared to collaborate in seeking a procedure which would enable Parliament to be more involved in decision-making under these procedures?
Despite the current provisions on public access to documents published by the three institutions - Council, Parliament and Commission - there is currently no specific procedure regarding the official communication to Parliament of documents relating to the Lisbon objectives.
Having said this, within the framework of transparency, all the reports and other documents approved by the Council in this regard, particularly those which aim to coordinate economic policies, are normally published, once approved, on the Council website, and are therefore generally accessible to the public.
Thank you, Mr President. I would also thank the President-in-Office of the Council for this response, but you will appreciate, Mr President-in-Office, that this cannot, of course, give us MEPs any satisfaction.
We set great store by the employment strategy.
The open method of co-ordination can be very effective, provided that it is democratic and transparent.
As it happens, it is not democratic, for the national parliaments and the European Parliament are not sufficiently involved. Neither is it transparent, because even the evaluations that are made of national action plans, paid for with European money, and the studies carried out by the Committee on Social Policy and Employment Policy are not accessible to the players, who, in fact, are required to guarantee the democratic legitimacy of this employment strategy.
What does the Council Presidency intend to do about this?
Are you not of the opinion that the democracy and transparency of this employment strategy and the open method of co-ordination should be enhanced?
Funded with European money, no less!
Mrs Van Lancker, I have the utmost respect for all that you say, and it is clear that there remains much that can be done to improve transparency and the availability of Council documents.
It goes without saying that, as you say, Parliament is the body that represents the peoples of Europe.
It is also true that we work within a regulated system where Council is obliged to send documents to Parliament where this is a requirement of the legislative decision-making process.
There are some documents that do not relate to the legislative decision-making process, which fall within the competence of the Member States and, with regard to which, there is no requirement to communicate them.
The truth is that, in today's European Union, the sky is the limit, because virtually all documents from the Member States are published on the Internet. I would find it very hard to recall any Council, including Councils dealing with the most sensitive issues, such as the Foreign Affairs Councils, in which documents have been kept secret or not made available to the public.
I believe there are some documents that are sent to Parliament as a matter of course, and there are other documents that, if they are not sent to Parliament as a matter of course, MEPs simply have to ask for, because they are usually available.
They are not kept secret and they are available within the Member States.
I would say, in this regard, that the Internet makes life so much easier these days.
In any case, I have made note of this interest - and this is certainly not the first time I have heard it aired in Parliament - in Parliament being more involved in the whole of the Lisbon strategy; and, naturally, in order to be more involved, more information is required and, therefore, I shall pass this on so that we can improve the communication of documents to Parliament.
Question No 16 by Richard Howitt (H-0306/02):
Subject: 'Untying'of development assistance from commercial interests by EU Member States
Can the President-in-Office confirm that Member States at the Barcelona Summit rejected the Commission proposal to 'untie' development assistance from commercial interests, and can he describe the objections made to the proposal?
Given the commitments made at the Finance for Development Conference at Monterrey to further discuss this issue, what further steps does the Presidency plan in this respect?
I would like to draw Mr Howitt's attention to point 13 of the Barcelona European Council conclusions, which does not specifically mention the lifting of development assistance conditions.
The European Council, nonetheless, welcomed the agreement reached on official development assistance (ODA) by Foreign Affairs Ministers in view of the Monterrey Conference on Financing for Development, an agreement it supported.
In this agreement, the Council of the European Union affirms its willingness to apply, along with other commitments, the recommendation for the lifting of development assistance conditions for less developed countries and to continue the debates with the aim of continuing to lift bilateral assistance conditions.
The European Union will also study measures to continue the lifting of Community assistance conditions while maintaining the current price preference system within the framework of the ACP-EU agreement.
I think the President-in-Office neatly side-stepped my question.
Of course, paragraph 13 records what was agreed, not what was not agreed.
So I repeat my question to him: Was it discussed?
What were the arguments?
What was the balance of opinion on that occasion?
Surely he can share that with us this evening.
What is more, will he take back to the further discussions in the Council the advantages of untying aid?
According to the World Bank, this increases aid effectiveness by between 12 and 20 per cent.
Surely, he would agree that development is about helping developing countries to help themselves.
And if we rely on European consultants, European companies, European technical assistance, are we not just reinforcing the dependence which development is trying to replace?
Does he finally agree that untying aid increases the role of the private sector within developing countries?
It increases local skills and knowledge.
It brings about local ownership development projects.
If he does agree, will he do something about it?
You will understand that, given the discretion required of the President-in-Office of the Council, I am not going to publicly reveal the precise positions adopted by the various States and which countries did not agree with the idea of separating development assistance from commercial interests.
You will be aware that very often there is a series of special credits within the development assistance mechanisms dedicated to financing development assistance projects provided that they favour the implementation or realisation of contacts with companies located in the States.
Whilst I do not wish to make an assessment of whether this is a good or a bad thing, it has been an extremely powerful instrument in encouraging countries to allocate large amounts of money to development assistance, and has also been an extremely powerful instrument in encouraging many companies, boosted by these particular credits, to get involved in carrying out projects in countries where, if they had not been provided with these special credits, it would have been extremely risky to have started various projects.
Naturally, I would prefer it if this type of link did not exist, and this idea was defended by some countries, and naturally by the Commission, but the reality of a custom and practice that has been in force for many years now won through, and an agreement was not reached on the separation of development assistance from commercial interests.
This is all I can say in this regard.
Question No 17 by MarÃ­a RodrÃ­guez Ramos (H-0311/02):
Subject: United Biscuits' closure of the Fontaneda factory
On 4 April 2002 the multinational company United Biscuits, which owns the Fontaneda biscuit factory in Aguilar de Campo, announced its decision to close the factory without giving any advance notice to workers, who discovered the news in the press.
For more than a century, this factory has been producing a make of biscuit which is emblematic in Spain, and without the factory the district and its 8000 inhabitants have no real alternatives for development.
Mr Aznar, the current Council President, has said that there is nothing he can do, since multinationals have created many jobs and funded research, even though they create problems on other occasions.
Does the Council believe that, when multinationals act with complete disregard for the social rights of workers, there is really nothing the EU can do, and does it believe that these statements by its President tally with policy on the social Europe that we aim to build?
As Mrs RodrÃ­guez Ramos is well aware, in 1994 the Council adopted the Directive on the establishment of a European Works Council in order to consolidate the position of employees of multinational companies operating at European level by means of mechanisms for involving those employees in decision-making processes.
With regard to the more specific issue of alleviating the negative effects of massive job cuts, in 1975 the Council adopted the Directive on collective redundancies, amended in 1992 and consolidated in 1998, in which specific requirements with regard to information and consultation from company executives were laid down.
In any event, it does not fall to the Council, in its capacity as a legislative body, to judge whether the case of United Biscuits, a multinational company, and the Fontaneda biscuits factory would be covered by these Directives or corresponding national legislation, nor if they have failed to respect the social rights of workers in this case.
These issues should be resolved by national judicial systems, and I believe that this particular case is already the subject of a judicial inquiry.
For its part, the Council considers that the legal instruments it has adopted should be fully applied in letter and in spirit.
If these instruments prove to be insufficient for the purposes of protecting workers' rights, the Council is willing to study any proposal put forward by the Commission with the aim of improving the aforementioned instruments.
With regard to the part of your question that refers to statements made by the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Aznar, the truth is that it does not fall to the Council to give its opinion in this regard, but I would also like to tell you that Mr Aznar's government is actively encouraging dialogue with other investors, from Spain and abroad, to find a solution so that biscuit production at the Aguilar de Campoo factory can continue. In view of the latest results from these conversations, all indicators point to the fact that it seems possible that this business can be kept active and viable.
The latest stumbling block in the process of maintaining this business and getting it back on its feet, as I am sure you are aware, is the issue of the trademark, given that it belongs to United Biscuits, who still have reservations on handing it over to potential investors who may take over the factory.
In any case, with or without the trademark, there are various groups of investors that are clearly interested, who shall be given every facility to prevent this factory, in a town so small as Aguilar de Campoo, from having to close, which would have a very serious effect on the inhabitants of this town.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, as you know, the Fontaneda factory and trademark are emblematic in Spain and are historically and geographically linked to the Aguilar de Campoo area.
They are the driving force behind social and economic development in this whole area, which is located in a European Objective 1 region with serious depopulation problems, where, in 2001, 1 500 people have already lost their jobs.
The announcement of the closure - and it seems that today the company has put this right - was purely in business interests and would naturally mean that jobs would have to be relocated, which shows genuine contempt for workers' rights, and furthermore the fictitious transfer of the trademark in order to keep producing these biscuits in a location other than the one it has been historically linked to.
This situation is too serious for the President-in-Office of the Council to say that nothing can be done.
It would have been more reasonable had he been concerned about the social consequences of these business decisions and the need for the European Union to confront the challenge of establishing Community principles that respect the social rights of workers, and that offer effective responses to the social, economic and territorial consequences of these decisions.
Does he really not think that such a declaration from the person representing the Presidency would have been more worthy and more in line with the social Europe we want to construct?
I have always said that I would expect all MEPs to be fully aware of the institutional system in which we are working.
It is neither the Council nor the President-in-Office of the Council's duty to make any judgement on rules that have been adopted.
The Commission has power of initiative and the rules adopted by the Council have to be adopted by the judges.
Given that you are insisting on some kind of statement by the President-in-Office of the Council, I would tell you that this statement cannot be taken out of context.
To say that government should respect the business decisions of multinational companies is one thing, but to exempt these multinationals from their duty to conform to current legislation is quite another.
In any case, United Biscuits has not been exempted. Current legislation has to apply to this company or any other company for that matter.
Therefore, current legislation must be applied.
If the legislation is insufficient, the Commission will have to put forward a new proposal, and we will give it our total support, and, in the meantime, I believe that the attitude shown by the Spanish Government - to immediately seek investors to resolve the problem, which has already had a result - shows that the Government's will is precisely in tune with social concerns and that it wishes to prevent the closure of this factory.
I assure you, Mrs RodrÃ­guez , that this factory is not going to close.
It is not going to close, not only because of the will of the people and of the workers, but also because of the will of the Government, which is fully aware that this closure would be an enormous social injustice.
Mr President, instead of a written reply to this question, could it perhaps be answered verbally next time?
Then we can ask supplementary questions, which I for one would prefer.
Questions that were not answered during Question Time shall be answered in writing, Mr Gahler.
A question can only be repeated after a certain amount of time has elapsed - three months - if I am not mistaken.
I shall also reread the Rules of Procedure, but I cannot tell you right now if you will be able to ask this question orally next time.
According to the Rules of Procedure, this is not possible.
As the time allotted to Question Time has elapsed, Questions Nos 18 to 26 will be answered in writing.
The next item is the report (A5-0133/2002) by Alain Lamassoure, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the division of competences between the European Union and the Member States (2001/2024(INI)).
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this debate is a first.
Never, since the Treaty of Rome, have either the governments or the European institutions thought it useful to reconsider the division of roles within the Union.
The report which you are considering today is the result of a real joint effort which goes far beyond the rapporteur himself or the opinion of any political group.
It is the culmination of fifteen months of work.
The draft adopted by your Committee on Constitutional Affairs has taken on board the principal proposals of the Committee of the Regions and the four committees consulted, plus one hundred and seventy amendments originating from thirty different authors belonging to all groups.
We have not attempted to re-write the Treaties, but rather to lay down guidelines for such a re-write, which is necessary.
We have done this on the basis of several important policy options.
Firstly, we found that the text of the Treaties was drafted by diplomats for their own use, rather like a car being built by mechanics for mechanics only.
Our first objective is therefore to bring the text within everybody's reach, in other words to re-write the Treaties in the spirit of a clearer, shorter and more coherent constitution.
Those paragraphs of the Treaties not included in the Constitution would remain applicable but would no longer form part of primary legislation.
Secondly, a general framework of competences would be constructed around three categories. First, competence is in principle devolved to the Member States.
We are not proposing a list of competences exclusive to the Member States.
The fact that this principle of Member States' competence is not expressly mentioned in the Constitution seems to us to reinforce it.
Second, the Union has its own competences.
In those areas, it can act alone, as in the case of customs or currency, or it may have primary responsibility, as in the case of the internal market, competition or cohesion policies.
Third, and finally, there are shared competences. This will be by far the longest list.
The Constitution will have to specify, in each case, the objective and scope of the Union's action, by applying the principle of subsidiarity.
Essentially, we propose to use the existing division between these headings, but with two important political changes. First of all, a distinction is made between political competence and technical competence.
This is what is known as the hierarchy of standards.
Finally, and most important, primary responsibility for foreign and defence policy on the one hand and for freedom and security aspects on the other is transferred to the Union. As far as these two essential areas are concerned, ten years of applying the Maastricht Treaty have confirmed both the absolute need for joint action and, unfortunately, the inefficacy of the intergovernmental procedures.
Thirdly, it seems important to safeguard the possibility of adapting this framework without having to resort to the excessively complicated and exceptional procedure of constitutional review.
In order to do this, we propose that a mechanism should be retained, such as Article 308, but that it should be made to work in both directions: transferring competence to the Union or returning it to the Member States in the case of issues for which the national dimension has become predominant once more.
Fourthly, in order to arbitrate in cases of conflicting competences, we propose a solution involving the courts rather than the political bodies.
The Court of Justice would be transformed into a Constitutional Court, and an emergency procedure would be introduced, allowing a qualified majority of the Council, the European Parliament or the Commission to bring matters before the Court between the time when a European law is finally adopted and the time when it comes into force.
Fifthly, and finally, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs spent a long time discussing the problem of the regions and of the other territorial authorities.
The compromise text finally adopted invites Member States to make proposals to the Union so as to ensure that their territorial authorities are more involved in the activities of the Union.
Mr President, the timetable for Parliament's work has been particularly well-chosen, because next week the European Convention will be considering the subject.
Our resolution will therefore be the first working document of the Convention on this essential subject, and in fact, if truth be told, the only document.
If Parliament gives it a large majority, representing the main political groups and all the different countries, that will give our resolution considerable political authority, and for that I should like to thank you.
Mr President, this report is intended as a contribution to the revision of the Treaties and as a contribution to a European constitution.
Draft constitutions are always politically motivated and include strategic and tactical objectives and considerations as well as aspects of power politics.
The Spinelli draft back in 1984 accepted the competences of the EU and the division of labour between the EU and the Member States, just as the Lamassoure report quite rightly does today.
And the question of competences is even more important now, especially in the area of the economic constitution and economic legislation.
If European economic policy is to be a success and the European social model is to subsist, the competence of the Union in the important areas of the internal market in the broadest sense, the four freedoms - namely financial services, competition, customs and monetary policy - must be retained and the report rightly emphasises this.
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs considers that the division of competences in the report is lacking in democratic legitimacy as far as policy coordination is concerned.
We already know from experience with economic policy coordination that competence for coordination needs to rest with the Union if we are to avoid previous shortcomings.
It is not just a question of the democratic control which needs to be exercised by the European Parliament here; no, what we are trying to do as far as policy coordination is concerned - especially economic policy coordination - is to move from negative to positive policy coordination.
Positive policy coordination requires both clear democratic legitimacy and unified implementation.
The broad economic guidelines, for example, ought therefore to be set jointly by the Council and the European Parliament, based on a formal proposal from the Commission.
This would then serve as an example for other political areas in which coordination should and must be exercised.
The authority, indeed the moral obligation, to set up such a far-reaching framework in the interest of economic welfare is provided by the Principles chapter of the EC Treaty, which lists among Union activities the adoption of an economic policy based on the definition of common objectives which can and must achieve, in particular, harmonious, balanced and sustainable development of economic activities, a high level of employment and sustainable, non-inflationary growth, as well as social protection.
In keeping with the Lisbon process, I am calling in the strongest possible terms for the European Parliament to come down in favour of policy coordination which deserves to be described as such and which makes it quite clear that policies in the general interest can only succeed if the common interest factor is also visible.
Mr President, I am speaking today as the representative of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, which has had to deal with questions of competence from a very early stage, but has not, unfortunately, been sufficiently involved in the latest.

I see that the report proposes that a special report on this matter be drawn up, and I consider this a very good thing, as these questions are not actually adequately dealt with in the report itself.
I would like to take this opportunity to clarify again the position of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, and then perhaps a place might be found for it when this special report is prepared.
I consider it most important that we should not be waiting too long for it, as, if these questions are not resolved while we prepare for the new constitution, it will, I think, be very hard for those citizens who identify with the regions and local authorities to accept this constitution as being their own.
I would like to point out that most EU legislation does not only touch on national competences and national law, but has a direct effect on local rights.
We see this in the area of public services, we see it in the economy as a whole, we see it when it comes to tendering, and so on and so forth.
That is why we need to build in an early warning system.
We have put forward two basic suggestions about this.
One is that all laws should be developed in line with certain principles that would apply across the board, ranging from the principle of subsidiarity to that of partnership.
The other aims to involve regional and local authorities as early as the preparatory stage of legislative processes, that alone being the guarantee that their standpoints will be taken into account with all the others, something which even national representatives will often not have done at the end of the legislative process.
My request to the rapporteur is that, in future, we should carry on working on this issue with the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, and keep this in mind when we do so.
Mr President, this is not the best time to debate the Lamassoure report.
This is because it is very late and, secondly, because the final of the Champions League is being played and Real Madrid - I am sorry, Mrs Randzio-Plath, Mrs Schroedter - are beating Bayer Leverkusen. Oh, no!
Bayer have equalised.
No-one is perfect.
This is bad news, because I was so happy and now the score is one all.
Yet this is also a good time to debate this report, because it is extremely important.
I would firstly like to pay homage to Mr Lamassoure, who is not only a highly intelligent rapporteur, but also a rapporteur from the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, but who, although he has not said so himself, has seen every single article from his original proposal amended.
This, in itself, is great proof of his flexibility and political capacity.
Look at him, he even seems cheerful.
He could have been very angry at all the changes that have been made - but no - he is happy, because, at the end of the day, the Lamassoure report characterises a solid position adopted by Parliament on an enormously difficult and complicated issue, which causes a great deal of conflict.
I believe, Mr President, that in addition to Mr Lamassoure's valour in having drawn up this report, we have achieved something very important, which is to have a Parliament position on this issue, a position which, additionally, brings together what Parliament has been advocating for fifty years, which in my opinion, is very important.
In the Lamassoure report, we are defending the competences allocated to the EU.
The rapporteur states this very clearly. We have decided that the European Union must enjoy only the competences allocated to it by the Treaties and no others, which means that we are against this idea of a catalogue of competences, which would only serve to add rigidity to the Union's competences.
We are in favour of a flexible interpretation and of the idea that, at any moment, through the mechanisms he has upheld, from Article No 308 and other Articles from the Treaty, Article No 99 specifically, we can accommodate the needs of the Union and the aspirations of its citizens.
Secondly, I believe that the Lamassoure report also puts forward a very solid position on one of the great issues in the Convention, the control of subsidiarity.
I believe that one of the main issues in the debate on the Convention will be how to control subsidiarity, for, as the rapporteur has very clearly stated, the great majority of competences are competences shared between the Union and the Member States.
Therefore, to know at which moment we have to use one and at which the other will be the key to keeping Europe running at the rhythm its citizens require.
I believe that we also have a very solid position in this regard.
I am going to make a declaration, because I know that some fellow Members still have doubts, in favour of the position taken by Alain Lamassoure: I believe the control of subsidiarity should be exercised by the body within whose competence it falls to make proposals - in other words - the European Commission.
I believe that the European Commission must have the right of initiative and that it must take charge of subsidiarity.
However, I believe that, if there are any discrepancies, we need to find a way to resolve them, and the way to do this is not through a political body or some sort of subsidiarity chamber, but through a system similar to the one established by the French Constitution for the French Constitutional Council, in which a month is given for the issue to be resolved.
It seems to me that this is a solid, principled position: control by the Commission, with a Constitutional Council, and I believe that we should defend this position.
Finally, Mr President, I believe that the Lamassoure proposal is ambitious.
There is a William Faulkner character who I like very much and am very fond of, who says that we have to have very ambitious dreams, so that, as we go through life chasing these dreams, we know where we stand in relation to them.
I believe that the Lamassoure report allows this and that all our hopes and dreams are also permitted.
Mr President, I congratulate Mr Lamassoure on his work these last few months and on the remarkable result he has produced.
It means that the European Parliament will be there at the Convention with a set of proposals on the table.
We will have done our work in terms of contributing ideas and proposals to the Convention and that in itself is very important.
It is important especially if we look at the climate surrounding some of these discussions and debates.
There are those who are alleging that the European Union has become an over-centralised monstrosity; that we need to take powers back to the Member States; that we should define a catalogue of competences specifying in great detail what the EU is allowed and not allowed to do.
This report refutes those arguments.
It demonstrates quite clearly, in a very good response, that the competences of the European Union are not over-done: they are, in fact, finely tuned according to the subject.
There are some areas where the Union has what could be called an exclusive competence - though that term has been avoided in the resolution.
They are quite limited but important.
The bulk of the Union's responsibilities are what could be called shared competences, where the intensity of Union action varies greatly from one subject to another.
In some areas we lay down detailed legislation - which the Member States have to comply with.
In other areas the Union has a coordinating role and in still other areas it contributes with complementary actions.
This is flexible and it is adapted to the needs of different policy areas, and should remain so.
The true guarantee against over-centralisation is, and should be, a political guarantee as we consider proposals in the normal procedures of the institutions: from the Commission, as Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo has just said, when it makes its proposals to us as a Parliament, and also the Council.
Let us remind ourselves who sits on the Council: national ministers, members of national governments, accountable to national parliaments - not people who are predisposed towards centralising everything in the European Union.
Not at all.
You have to convince a very large majority of them to get a qualified majority.
These are the political guarantees, the procedural guarantees against over-centralisation, and the ministers in the Council can, and should, involve their national parliaments as well.
The Treaty of Amsterdam gave a protocol giving a six-week period for ministers to discuss with their national parliaments.
That is how national parliaments should be involved, not through some new chamber of subsidiarity or some new institution.
All this is well presented in the report.
Where we in the Socialist Group have a reservation is on the legal control of subsidiarity.
It exists already: the Court is a constitutional court in many ways.
We do not, however, think a new extra procedure - an emergency procedure - is needed, and the wording should be tightened up to show that on shared competences detailed legislation can sometimes be laid down and ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
Mr President, the Liberal Group strongly welcomes the report for not simply revisiting existing powers to improve clarity but for boldly seeking to adjust competences to face the challenges that the Union knows, especially in the foreign and security field.
The report will serve as the first contribution to the Convention on the question of competences.
I trust that the Convention will follow the wise approach in rejecting the rigid and misleading concept of exclusive competences and in focusing instead on developing a more sophisticated system of power sharing.
My group supports the idea of creating a new judicial procedure of constitutional complaint for breaches of competency, which implies the rapid evolution of the European Court.
The procedure would be rarely deployed, but it represents a significant insurance scheme to see that the Union authorities do not abuse their reinforced powers.
A further area deserving of greater focus concerns the regions, which can be, and should be, useful intermediaries between the citizen on the one hand and the supranational authorities on the other.
We are proposing amendments which will strengthen the report in this respect.
Mr President, like others I take it to be a great privilege to participate in this debate - late in the day, though it is.
My own group has two particular points that we would like to ask colleagues to build into the report before it finally sees the light of day.
Firstly, just an allusion to the significance of the democratic deficit and the need, finally, fully to democratise the institutions of the Union.
As long as we do not call it a "permanent" democratic deficit, I am sure that the PPE-DE Group will be with us on that, and I hope that will be written in.
Further, we suggest - and colleagues on the left are very much in agreement with this - that a little more emphasis on the social, as well as the economic and political element - should be written in.
Apart from that, we are really very happy with the way this is going forward and look forward to voting for it tomorrow.
The key point Mr Lamassoure makes - and has made throughout - is that the issue is not one of needing to rewrite a new list of competences for the institutions but a need to draw to citizens' attention to the fact that there is already a very adequate statement of the different kinds of competences - the Union's own competences and the shared ones - and the fact that the principle of residuarity governs the rest.
The states are responsible for what is not given to the Union.
All that is clear in principle, but it could do with being stated more clearly in practice so that citizens are better aware of it.
That is a very important point.
In that context, we raise the issue of subsidiarity.
Where competences are shared, it is important indeed that in all those areas where local knowledge ought to prevail, local knowledge does prevail.
That is to say, that decisions are taken at the most appropriate level for them.
Recital G makes a very important contribution to expanding and giving greater bite to the idea of subsidiarity, and that is also to be very greatly welcomed.
We in our group believe much in extended subsidiarity.
Subsidiarity does not stop at the front door of the Member States: it goes right down to the territorial entities within the Member States, to the local authorities within the Member States, and that is of critical importance to us all.
We, along with the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism and the Liberals, would like a little more strength to it, but we do not mind.
This report as it stands now represents a huge step forward in the thinking of Europeans and of this Parliament.
I repeat, it is a huge privilege to take part in this debate and in particular - and I say it in his presence - it is a privilege to have taken part in a debate led by Mr Lamassoure, who has done such an extraordinary job of setting up the architecture but being willing to adjust the sculpture, to borrow a metaphor of his own this morning.
He has done a fantastic job, we are all greatly in his debt, and I hope my group will vote unanimously with him tomorrow.
Mr President, the issue with which Mr Lamassoure's report deals is indeed a complex one.
This was apparent not only in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, but was also shown by the first debates in the Convention, to whose work this report will surely make a contribution.
For that the rapporteur deserves our gratitude.
I abstained in the vote on this report in the Committee and would like to adduce a number of examples of things which, to my mind, the report has not yet addressed in a convincing way.
It may well be helpful to define the three types of competence that already exist, but that falls short of a clear statement that the first priority must be to resolve Europe's problem with democracy.
When we come to the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality, things strike me as having been turned on their head.
Why?
The report gives the impression that Court rulings are needed in order for both principles to be adhered to and put into effect.
Nowhere, though, in the text as a whole, is there any mention of the fact that the real problem is to be found elsewhere, with the European political actors who actually initiate action.
There are clear provisions in the Treaties, for example the protocol on subsidiarity in the Treaty of Amsterdam, by which all the institutions are bound.
The point actually at issue is rather how they carry out the duties accruing to them on that basis, how seriously they really check whether the principles are being infringed before they take action.
At the end of the day, everyone has to do this sort of initial check.
If they did, nobody would have to go to the ECJ before the entry into force of a legal measure which in most cases has taken years of debate and associated procedures to come into being.
Point 33 states that the framework of competences is to be reviewed after ten years.
What this means, and what its point is, is a mystery to me.
Is it meant to mean that there is to be an amendment to the Treaties every ten years?
Is a rule of this sort really what is wanted, something that is rigidly fixed to a ten-year cycle and utterly divorced from potential political frameworks and requirements?
Above all, though, the report fails to make clear the need for a social Europe, and that its creation is one of the EU's most pressing tasks against the backdrop of economic and monetary union.
We set ourselves the objective of promoting economic and social progress, with a high level of employment as well.
We even want to achieve full employment by 2010.
The words to date have been splendid, but they need to be backed up by actions.
Employment and social security are not variables in competition, but every citizen's individual and fundamental right, and it is in that direction that the European Union must develop.
Mr President, I gave the wrong information. I shall correct that now: Real Madrid 2, Bayern Leverkusen 1!
I am sure all of us who are not participants will be very happy to hear that.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, although we are unable to support the Lamassoure report in the final vote, I too would like to compliment the rapporteur on the extraordinarily high quality of his work. I would like to welcome this report as one of the most significant documents in the debate in this House.
It is significant in terms of timetabling and the time chosen to present it, it is significant in that its subject matter is one of the most controversial and at the same time most critical for the future of the Union, and it is significant not only as regards the quality of the final report but also as regards the work and discussions that preceded the report.
It is also significant as regards the large number of amendments tabled, including many that fell by the wayside, and for its enormous theoretical richness. Lastly, it is significant because it demonstrates an understanding and organisation of the system emerging from this work on the European Union and also in the light of the parallel discussions taking place in the Convention.
We regret not being able to support this motion in the final vote because we are even in agreement with the first two paragraphs, and we agree that the time has come to update the division of competences between the Union and its Member States on the basis of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality, in order to take account of the lessons of the Community's history - particularly those lessons that unfortunately point to so many excesses and infringements of the principle of subsidiarity.
And we also agree that a better division of competences is needed and will result in a strengthening of democracy in Europe, which for us includes restoring greater importance to national democracies and the role of national parliaments and a new interparliamentary process for building the Europe of the future.
However, when we get to the third paragraph, we face an irreversible parting of the ways. We believe that at this point the report deviates from its original objective and joins the growing trend towards a European constitution, an EU constitution, which we cannot support.
Furthermore, we believe, because we are talking about competences here, that it is not within the competence of any European institution to draw up a European constitution.
It is within the competence of the Member States to draw up and revise treaties, and this is a contractual mechanism totally different from the mechanisms relating to constitutions, which are based on the existence of a sovereign people, a people governed by a sovereign body, and that is totally different from our mission in the European Union.
We accordingly differ on a matter of principle that we regard as being fundamental.
Furthermore, when Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo spoke just now about powers of assignment, he rather put his finger on the key point: powers of assignment, and the fact that we recognise their existence, does not just mean what Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo was referring to.
It also means that the Member States have competences under their own common law, and no one needs to assign them as long as the European Union only has such competences to the extent that the Member States delegate and assign them and may also withdraw them, as in the case of the new type of mechanism that would replace the existing Article 308 according to this report.
This is a very important point with consequences for the institutional framework and for how we see the competences of the European Union.
There are a few more observations that we would like to make.
For example, the criterion of synergy is mentioned amongst the criteria identified in Recital G, but this criterion can only be considered within a very limited framework.
The criterion of synergy and of effectiveness is, in itself, extremely dangerous, because that is how all the attacks on the principle of subsidiarity are made.
In isolation, it is easy to maintain that any given action would lead to greater effectiveness - and effectiveness is a dangerous word in itself because it can be used for anything - and to economies of scale, which would provide a platform for constant infringements of the principle of subsidiarity.
By way of conclusion, let me say that we welcome the report and would like to support it, but it is on the issue of this constitutional vision that we differ with the rapporteur, this vision of a European Union becoming ever more like a state, which we consider to be fundamentally at odds with the whole concept of Europe and with our vision of the future of the European Union - one which respects the individual nations.
Mr President, what the citizens want is not so much a division of competences between the European Union and the Member States, but rather the limitation of the competences of that Union, and that is also what the principle of subsidiarity requires.
Over the years, the Community structure has become a tangled undergrowth of texts and procedures in which even the most wary can become lost.
My group proposed several amendments which would help to reduce the inflated number of texts and competences.
Amendment No 34, for example, proposes that it should be made possible, at the request of one or more States, and thus of their respective national parliaments, to abrogate a text if no majority can be found to confirm it.
My group is very concerned to find that, every time it has been claimed that this clarification exercise is being carried out, the end result is always exactly the opposite.
Yet everyone recognises that it is time to respond to the resentment and lack of interest on the part of our citizens, towards a Europe which is involved in too many things at too detailed a level.
This report only makes things worse by proposing to give the European Union the only powers which it does not yet have.
Thus it lists all the areas which should fall within the Union's own competences, the list of shared competences, under the close control of the Commission, the guardian of the Treaties, and the Court of Justice, to which have now been added those concerned with the implementation of foreign policy.
As a final precaution a review clause is proposed, modelled on Article 308, so that more competences can be added if necessary.
After noting that very little is left, one can understand the prudence expressed in paragraph 17, which does not consider it necessary, unfortunately, to draw up a list of the competences exclusive to Member States.
I believe that, in the last analysis, this report is nothing more than yet another compilation of the claims which the European Parliament was unable to impose in Nice.
Europe is becoming a State above States, free to define its own priorities, while there are already too many meddlesome rules, imposed far away from the daily lives of our citizens and preventing the management of territories in accordance with local and national aspirations.
We shall continue to support the call for more diversity, proximity and transparency, even if these 'mores' seem difficult to reconcile with the 'More Europe' slogan of the current Spanish Presidency.
Mr President, Mr Lamassoure's report reminds me of the film on the TV channel Arte about the 'European bubble' and the 'Europe addicts'.
It is all there in full, because the stated aim is indeed to create a centralising European super-state with full ruling powers, while the Member States will retain only a few so-called federal competences on the pretext of a principle of subsidiarity which is actually rendered inapplicable by all sorts of exceptions.
Thus the principle of subsidiarity becomes itself subsidiary, because it cannot prevent the application of Article 308, or the Community acquis, or the self-proclaimed principle of the European Union.
I thought that the members of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs were capable of greater skilfulness or caution, because in the final analysis, whatever the fate of the Laeken Conference, the European structure is looking more and more fragile, artificial and determined to turn itself into a free-trade zone.
