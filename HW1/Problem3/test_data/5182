It will be important for the Commission to study that carefully and bring forward stronger proposals to us.
It is a matter of real concern to all our citizens that this should be done properly.
We call upon the Commission now to follow up the excellent report of my friend and colleague, Mr Medina Ortega.
Mr President, like Sir Neil MacCormick I welcome this report, particularly now it is amended to give it more teeth.
When we adopted our original timeshare legislation I hoped that the long queue of people coming to see me about problems would come to an end.
Indeed, they did for a while but they started again because as soon as one set of legislation is established, fraudsters will then move on to something else.
The latest scam is basically establishing so-called holiday clubs.
I welcome the fact that we are taking action on this.
It is important to remember that, in terms of the approach to the citizens of the European Union, it is our ability to take action on issues like this which is very important so that people recognise that they are part of a citizens' Europe and that if they have problems in one country, they can make representation through the legal system properly.
Fortunately, as Sir Neil said, we now have a number of organisations which are working very hard in this sector and the situation has improved.
However, we need to deal with the fraudsters who spread so much misery.
. (NL) First of all, the draft legislative resolution receives my unqualified support.
It is clear that Directive 94/47 has not had the desired effect.
A review is therefore necessary, because practice has shown that unfortunately, consumers are still often the victims of fraud within this market.
On the basis of current legislation, the regulations are too minimal to be able to easily distinguish fraudsters and cowboys from serious timeshare operators, to whom this situation is also detrimental.
In order to establish the difference between the 'good guys' and 'bad guys', I have tabled an amendment on the basis of which, in the event of a dispute, the court local to the consumer should always be declared competent.
Such a provision has a deterrent effect on unscrupulous timeshare operators and removes the victims' fears about having to take the matter to court in a foreign country.
My amendment, which is, in fact, backed by the Organisation for Timeshare in Europe, has, to my great regret, not received sufficient support from the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
The above is partly substantiated by Commissioner Byrne in his replies during the debate and is therefore worth considering when drafting the requested evaluation or new legislation.
. (NL) Hardly anyone knows what the subject of real estate timesharing is actually about.
This proposal provides for measures in order to prevent fraud and deception.
People are under the illusion that they can buy a holiday home cheaply for the exact period they want to take their holidays. Other holidaymakers own the home during other weeks of the year.
Since in many cases, this involves a residence in an area with a different language, other customs and legislation different from the country of origin, there is plenty of scope for misunderstandings.
Much worse is that it also leaves the field wide open for misleading the buying public.
Since, due to their long-term absence, they cannot manage the holiday home themselves; somebody has to do it for them.
This is the seller, who, in fact, remains the owner.
The buyers become disappointed because they have to pay a large sum of money for which they apparently receive few rights in return.
Ultimately, they end up with a property which is not suitable for their purposes and which they cannot sell on to anyone else.
It is precisely against this cross-border fraud that measures that are the same across different European countries are needed.
Even opponents of centralist and interfering EU legislation, such as myself, believe this to be a useful form of consumer protection.
. (NL) One of the hallmarks of capitalism is that companies are also commodities in their own right.
Large, profitable companies can buy up other companies.
In some cases, a purchase of this kind takes place in order to close down this other company and take over its share of the market.
It is also possible for a company to use its own profits to reduce its prices temporarily. It can subsequently elbow competitors out of the market and cause them to go bankrupt.
Concentration of wealth and power is part and parcel of capitalist logic.
We can therefore expect fewer and fewer large companies to survive, and those that do will become even bigger and more international.
It should, in itself, not always be problematic for a company to adopt a monopoly position.
Monopolies that provide for one region, and whose selling prices, environmental policy and social policy are democratically regulated by the relevant people's representatives and concerned citizens' organisations, can work very well.
Following the American example, such monopolies are now being condemned in the EU because they harm free competition, while large, powerful concerns, on which no democratic control is possible, simply continue to grow.
Twelve years of Regulation No 4064/89 have not managed to break this cycle, and neither will the forthcoming review and cooperation with national competition authorities.
Despite this, I do not reject this Green Paper, because doing nothing is even worse.
I welcome the issues highlighted by Mr Busk and Mrs Attwooll in their respective reports.
It is clear that there is a need to improve on aspects of monitoring the Common Fisheries Policy and proper sanctions for those in infringement.
The fundamental issue is that if we want to call this policy a "Common" policy then we need to ensure a level playing field.
This applies to all aspects of the CFP.
Foremost in the minds of Members who, like myself, represent coastal regions of the Union heavily dependent on fishing are the Commission's recent proposals on the reform of the CFP.
The proposals in their current shape simply cannot survive. There is far too little consideration given to the socio-economic impact in the regions to which I have referred.
We are not creating a level playing field when we undermine further the precarious position of families and communities for whom the fishing industry is the sole source of local employment, while at the same time leaving unchecked the excesses of industrial fishing, particularly when we claim to be developing a policy founded on sustainable development and sound environmental protection.
. (PT) As the report states, compliance with the common fisheries policy depends to a large extent on the participation of the fishermen and their associations in the decision-making process.
It is, therefore, crucial that progress is made on co-determination.
It is also significant that the report emphasises the fact that responsibility for monitoring the implementation of Community legislation lies primarily with the Member States and must continue to do so, albeit with greater cooperation and supervision and not involving total centralisation.
The report is, nevertheless, quite critical of Member States' failure to comply with the notification of catches, infringements and other information relating to the CFP.
Portugal seems to be the only Member State to have complied with all decisions, both with regard to infringements of the regulations and to the MAGPs.
It is, consequently, a matter of considerable regret that the Committee, with its revised proposal, appears to be attempting to treat all countries in the same way, which would mean penalising Portugal for having fully complied with the rules.
The Commission must step up its efforts to ensure a level playing field with greater cooperation between the stakeholders.
Fishermen must be involved in framing and enforcing the rules within a system of zonal management, a system that will make these rules more acceptable and enforcement more effective.
For effective monitoring and control, there must adequate budgetary and human resources.
A fundamental concern in relation to the Commission's proposals on the reform of the CFP is the proposal to open access to the North Sea and leave a sea area with severely depleted fish stocks managed purely by virtue of the TACs and quotas regime.
Without committed investment in control and monitoring, the North Sea will be a potential free-for-all, which could decimate stocks further and kill off fragile fisheries-dependent communities.
I therefore urge the Commission to take these concerns on board and ensure that there is a level playing field.
Under no circumstances open up the North Sea when clearly the existing enforcement system is neither perceived as, nor proven to be, fair or sufficiently funded to ensure illegal fisheries are stamped out.
Reducing the fisheries capacities of the Member States, mainly by reducing the fishing fleet and fisheries in general, is still one of the constituent components of the new common fisheries policy.
In other words, it follows on from the previous CFP, which has already had a serious impact on small and medium-sized fishing enterprises.
The proposed revision will result in more of the same, because more fishing vessels will be scrapped and there will be less or no potential for modernising the remaining fleet, especially in small and medium-sized undertakings.
The real purpose of the provisions allegedly being introduced to protect fish stocks and sustainability is to restrict the access of small-scale fishermen to fishing grounds, which will be handed over for big business and its fisheries operations to plunder.
In order to ensure that this endeavour is adopted without opposition, it is accompanied by so-called early retirement and retraining packages for fishermen, who will move into other professions.
The prospects and consequences of the new CFP will be disastrous for areas of the ?U historically and economically dependent on fisheries.
The new measures will speed up the rate at which fishermen abandon fisheries, they will lose a significant portion of their income, unemployment will rise and the exodus from remote and island areas will increase.
. (NL) Large-scale fishing at sea is organised in very different ways in different Member States.
In one country, small, traditional ships may be used, while other countries may use large, modern ships which, by way of compensation, have to remain idle for part of the time.
Fishermen from one country may catch fish for human consumption, while those from other countries may fish for the production of fishmeal.
Everywhere, fishermen from one country blame fishermen from other countries for exceeding their catch quotas, so that fish is in danger of extinction in an increasingly large maritime area.
It now also transpires that the Netherlands produces illegible annual reports, Belgium uses unintelligible codes, Spain's submission is incomplete and France does not submit any reports at all.
Since the control mechanism is applied differently in different Member States, fishermen are not treated in the same way.
It is starting to appear more and more as if we are deluding ourselves into thinking that we are drastically reducing fish catches, without this actually happening to an adequate degree.
And meanwhile, a full-scale rebellion is being mounted against the European Commission proposals to make effective and tighten up the policy to protect fish levels at sea.
No doubt, this will not come to anything either.
A policy is therefore being adopted in the spirit of 'aprÃšs nous le dÃ©luge'.
Do the advocates of a weak policy believe that such a flood will yield more fish?
. (NL) The extent to which traffic offences in Europe are monitored in different ways is striking.
Where one country has a surplus of speed controls, the other only monitors serious offences.
Enforcement is not carried out across the Community, but fishery policy is.
Unfortunately, the supervision of fishermen is as diverse as the traffic controls I have referred to.
What is worse, in the case of identical offences, national inspectorates appear to be imposing tougher sanctions on fishermen from neighbouring countries than on those from their own.
The difference in control and sanction, in terms of nature and frequency, within each Member State undermines the common fisheries policy.
The Dutch fishermen are right to call for a European inspection and control structure.
The control and sanction policy must be harmonised as a matter of urgency, as the credibility of the fisheries policy is in the balance.
Dutch producer organisations inspect each other to see if quotas have been exceeded.
This should serve as an example in the other Member States.
Surely it is too crazy for words that we do not know whether all European fishermen keep to the quota or not.
Mr President, I wholeheartedly support this report which focuses its attention on the importance of local employment markets.
When employment rates are considered, we all too often concentrate our minds on the macroeconomic environment whereas individual local employment markets contribute considerably to the overall well-functioning and dynamism of the economy.
As the EU increasingly focuses it attention on employment, largely under the auspices of the Lisbon Strategy, the call for a bottom-up approach is most welcome.
Indeed, local operators who have knowledge of local conditions are best placed to devise any necessary changes that local economies might need to make.
This report also comes highly recommended for its close attention to the all of the component parts of local economies: the promotion of female entrepreneurship, for example, is relatively innovative and could pave the way for new kinds of innovation and economic growth.
The European Union's preoccupation with "core labour standards" is no doubt the result of pressure from the grass-roots movement and the mass demonstrations held in Seattle, Genoa and elsewhere.
We would point out that its interest is hypocritical in the extreme, given that the bottom line is that so-called globalisation helps observe core labour standards.
In other words they are turning black into white in a bid to convince us that the global suzerainty of big business, which is sucking the planet dry and increasing its exploitation of the workers, is a good thing for the third world!
The EU's stand is even more hypocritical in that it is championing itself as a worker's paradise at a time when it has unleashed an unprecedented attack on the rights which workers have fought hard to acquire.
Without going into the root cause of the problem, it is only natural that the proposals made by the Commission and the Committee on Employment should appear to range from the inadequate to the absurd.
It is an historical fact that the rights of the working classes have been acquired with blood, sweat and tears and not as charity from the bourgeoisie, which is why the Communist Party of Greece believes that labour standards will be improved through the struggle of the working classes and international solidarity.
More importantly, a final solution will only be found by revolutionising society and abolishing exploitation.
That is why the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the report.
. (PT) This report deserves my vote, because it is major step forwards in raising awareness of the complex interconnection between globalisation and the promotion of core labour standards.
I would emphasise, in particular, the need to draw up a strategy that sees globalisation as a contribution to social development and respect for fundamental rights.
In fact, globalisation entails both challenges and opportunities and must lead to the improvement of living and working conditions and higher levels of development aid for the least-favoured communities.
Establishing a single European code of conduct to govern the international operations of European industry is a crucial instrument for ensuring that core labour standards are implemented.
For this reason, the European Union must work in cooperation with the governments of developing countries and include respect for core labour standards in its cooperation agreements with third countries.
It is worth emphasising once again the importance of the issue of gender equality.
Greater attention needs to be paid to women's organisations when addressing the issue of involving social partners in defining policies on sustainable development and social cohesion.
Mr President, I welcome this resolution which aims to promote core labour standards.
The trend towards greater economic interdependence and globalisation is a reality with which we must all contend.
This does not mean, however, that workers' rights and social governance should fall by the way side.
Indeed, the call for a more balanced order, whereby social issues are considered on a par with economic concerns, whilst long over due, is most welcome.
The call for ratification of the ILO conventions in applicant countries as well as third parties is a desirable concrete means by which to ensure that the ILO is taken seriously.
Lastly, I welcome the call for more dialogue and increased issue linkage between the ILO and other international organisations, such as the WTO and the World Bank.
These institutions may appear to be mutually exclusive, whereas in fact both "sides" could learn a lot from one another and work more effectively in unison.
That concludes voting time.
(The sitting was suspended at 1.10 p.m. and resumed at 3.05 p.m.)
The next item is the Commission statement on the situation in Somalia.
Mr President, the Commission is pleased to give a statement on the situation in Somalia, which has been worsening for several years now, creating unbearable living conditions for the people and, unfortunately, conditions in which terrorism thrives.
The Community has been sending aid for many years and is still giving maximum possible assistance, despite the collapse of the State in 1991.
The Commission has continued to work with the people of Somalia, who have received an average of EUR 30 million a year under programmes run by European non-governmental organisations and United Nations agencies.
The Commission's intervention is based on a policy of strict neutrality between the warring sides and focuses on working in partnership with the local authorities.
This strategy could, I think, be called a peace dividend method.
It aims to promote the advantages of establishing peace, with an eye on the second stage, which is more proactive and efficient. It is a peace-building method which encourages the emerging administration and closer collaboration with regional and local administrations.
The Commission, like the Member States, is encouraging a peaceful solution to the problems within a framework of national reconciliation and has repeatedly supported an end to the violence and called for the UN resolutions imposing an arms embargo on Somalia to be upheld.
For the moment, the international community is focusing its efforts on the regional reconciliation initiative in Somalia being promoted by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development in the Horn of Africa.
This process is being spearheaded by Kenya, with technical support from Ethiopia and Djibouti.
In response to calls for a representative council of the parties to be set up, I should point out that the Commission and Member States have already expressed their joint support for a council to be set up under the IGAD.
This issue has been furthered both through political statements and in the form of funding on the part of the Commission to the tune of EUR 500 000 in order to consolidate the first stage of the peace process.
Even though it is not directly involved in organising the reconciliation talks under the IGAD, the Commission feels that regional administrations representing sections of Somali society are included in the important agencies which need to work on settling the conflict in Somalia.
It shares the view that a bottom-up approach would complement efforts to set up a central administration.
The Commission therefore considers that a final institutional framework should be designed for the future of Somalia, mainly between the Somalis themselves, within the framework of detailed dialogue and democratic consultation.
Thanks to Commissioner Diamantopoulou, whose assessment of the situation I support, we are, at last, starting to talk about Somalia.
We were unable to tackle the issue for a long time, not least because the situation did not allow it.
Now, with this Transitional National Government in place, we can discuss Somalia, in the knowledge that we still have quite a long way to go along what is an extremely tortuous path.
I believe that Somalia is the only country in the region which is in this situation.
We must therefore call, using the intermediary of IGAD, for the Nairobi Conference to take place as soon as possible, with the participation of not just the representatives of the Transitional National Government but all the other representatives and all the leaders controlling the northern and southern regions of the country as well.
Indeed, if we do not manage to involve most of the representatives of these territories, we will fail in our purpose.
I feel that thanks are due to Djibouti and Kenya too, which have being acting as mediators for a long time. They have now been joined by Ethiopia, which wields great influence.
It is to be hoped that these three countries will succeed in coming up with several proposals to make to the leaders meeting at the Nairobi Conference, which will result in a genuine peace process.
We must, of course, endeavour to put forward a solution based on respect for the country's integrity, although the decision-makers will have to decide whether to give some of the regions of the country specific forms of autonomy. The problems are immense, as the Commissioner said.
We need, first and foremost, to demilitarise and disarm the people.
That is the main objective.
We need to clear the territories of mines and, most importantly, we must isolate the terrorist groups which are present or have established themselves in the country. Moreover, we must define an institutional structure and set in motion a process of introducing democracy and respect for human rights.
As the Commissioner stressed, we must be motivated by a spirit of national reconciliation, which fully involves all the parties concerned.
Furthermore, the issue of refugees must be addressed: refugees must be able to opt to return freely to their country without risk to their safety. Another serious problem is health: there is a health crisis in this country which requires an urgent response.
If, as I think, these are the key goals for the Nairobi Conference, it is essential that the conference takes place without delay, before the month is out if possible, for that will allow the European Union to launch aid programmes. These must be more effective and more rapidly implemented than previous programmes.
If these goals were achieved, Somalia would be in a position to dialogue with the other countries in the region with a view to setting in motion a vital economic process.
Moreover, it would appear that there is hope of the democratic process being launched in Eritrea too, and this makes it possible for the European Union to use the instruments laid down by the Cotonou Agreement to provide an initial structured programme of aid measures for the entire region.
I believe that precisely this regional element can create cooperation within the region, encouraging countries such as Somalia, which need help and comprehension but which also need to take courageous decisions which will ensure the full participation of all the regional authorities, to follow the example of other countries in the region.
Mr President, clearly, a joint motion for a resolution can only call for a peace process and commit the European Union to monitoring the political and military developments in the country.
The authors of the resolution call for assistance from the international community, of course, which is essential, although they also point out that armed clashes have claimed many more civilian victims in recent weeks.
However, we have to conclude that national reconciliation is an undertaking which is chiefly the responsibility of the peoples of Somalia.
Some progress has been observed in this direction.
Indeed, the aim is to prevent instability, to prevent the waves of refugees and to endeavour to repatriate them, to prevent the suffering and the ongoing acquisition of arms as far as is possible, even just by means of temporary measures, for all these factors contribute to the danger of Somalia's instability having a destabilising effect on other countries.
In this case, as in many others, politics and the often vain attempts to organise a conference are endeavours to find non-violent ways of making progress in situations dominated by violence. Despite the extremely complex, involved situation, in our opinion, the Nairobi Conference must take place as soon as possible and find new ways forward.
This is my personal opinion, the opinion of my colleague and, I believe, the opinion of all the other Members too.
However, these are only expressed hopes.
Our document welcomes the initiative to organise a conference, although it is impossible to know as yet whether all the parties will agree to sit down at the same table.
It calls on countries which export arms to respect the embargo laid down by the UN Security Council, although we know that if a faction wants to buy arms it will certainly find them on the market.
It calls for vigilance to ensure that Somali territory is not used for criminal activities, but it is not clear who will be able to carry out this supervision.
The Transitional Government?
I am somewhat sceptical about this, given that not even the other actors in the region have full control over their own national territory.
I would like to end by pointing out that the resolution warns Europe that the Somali question could have a disastrous impact outside the country and informs the Somalis too that the world is in one way or another attentive to their problems and willing to help them.
It may be that, for the first time, there is a glimmer of hope that more rational, positive ways out of the crisis will be found.
Our duty is to condemn the situation while, at the same time, discussing ways forward.
In this regard, I feel that the peace initiative described by Commissioner Diamantopoulou is a way out of at least the worst phase of the Somali crisis.
Thank you, Mr President.
Not so long ago, there was a war in Ethiopia, the Ogaden War, and there was a war in the north of Kenya, the Rift War, and the intention of both wars was to unite all Somalis in one country.
If we consider the situation today, it has completely changed.
The Somalis are fighting each other more than they do other governments in neighbouring countries in order to reunite Somalia.
As it would appear today, the country is breaking up into all kinds of groupings.
The most stable area seems to be the north, and what was the subject of consultation two years ago, a transitional national government, in actual fact, came to nothing.
Everyone is now at war with each other, which is a dangerous situation.
It means that we in Europe, and other countries in the region, will be receiving many refugees from Somalia, and I do not know whether they will be welcome everywhere.
There is also a considerable risk that it is a breeding ground for extremist groupings.
We know all too well since 11 September what the implications of that could be.
What can the European Union do in the current situation?
In my view, it should first and foremost apply the special rules of the Cotonou Agreement, because we all know that Somalia was unable to sign this agreement and is not a member of it either; but the special provisions will need to be applied in this instance.
This means that we would then be able to alleviate human suffering and grant emergency aid, and I gather that that is what the Commission is doing.
However, in the regions that enjoy a certain level of stability, we can start repairing and building roads, hospitals, and suchlike, so that some sense of stability will return to the region.
Above all, it is up to the Somalis to solve their problems; we could never do this for them.
The role of the neighbouring countries is also crucial.
In the light of their past, do they really want Somalia to be reunited?
This is something that I very much doubt.
Someone has already raised the forthcoming IGAD Conference in Nairobi; if I counted correctly, this is the fourteenth in the course of a decade or so. Let us hope that it will be successful this time round.
Given the signs, I am not so optimistic as the previous speakers, but in my view, the Italians still know Somalia better than any other nationality in the EU.
I hope that they will be proven right.
It is also up to the European Commission to get the EU Member States, in particular, to sing from the same hymn sheet.
I have a feeling that if we look at the United Kingdom's attitude, or Italy's, these are quite different.
The European Commission has some missionary work to do in this area too, for which I wish you every success.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, although mood and pessimism put me more on Mr Mulder's wavelength, I do believe Mr Gemelli and Mr Volcic's suggestions to be very interesting and I can also support them.
I do not propose to go over them again.
It is, of course, not a very good sign that we are having to put Somalia back on the agenda.
It means that there is renewed hostility and that we all are, in fact, extremely anxious about that country ending up in a hopeless war again.
This is something we must avoid.
The country has now, at least partly, restored peace, and another war situation is thus to be avoided.
This is why it is not so helpful that the interim government should call for military interventions.
I have no faith in these.
We think that other means should be employed.
Commissioner, you mooted the idea of a partnership with the local authorities.
We can welcome this with open arms, but I should like to add that this should not only be done via Kenya, because in Kenya, it is the men who have all the authority.
The women in Somalia have told me that they are the ones who make sure there is food and water available, which is, of course, essential.
You will not be insensitive to this, but these women are not in Nairobi.
I should also like to ask you to especially consider the refugees.
Maybe we ought to ask the Council to stop sending refugees back to Somalia since the situation there is actually not at all safe for a large proportion of the people.
Finally, I do not believe we ought to have a unitary system at any price.
If we need to start from regional autonomy in order to rebuild the Somali state, I can imagine that a federation may be formed, as was also necessary in Ethiopia.
In any case, I think that the emergency aid you are planning to grant will remain necessary in any event, and that Europe must back the peace process with vigour and in a spirit of solidarity.
Mr President, Commissioner, for two years, the Union for Europe of the Nations Group has been calling upon Parliament and the Commission to adopt a position on the Somali situation with regard to the most urgent issues: the renewed terrorist activities of groups such as Al-Itihad; the constant pressure on the people from organised fundamentalist groups; the threat of fresh terrorist action against other countries, borne out by the fact that Somalia was recently the base for the attacks in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam; the worrying internal political situation, which reflects the ambiguous position of figures connected with what is known as the Transitional National Government with regard to rejecting terrorism; the repeated requests from other Somali regions - Puntland and Somaliland - for national reconciliation through the creation of a federal State; and the hunger and distress of the entire population because of the shortage of food.
The motion for a resolution, signed today by some of the political groups, does not take into account what we said in our motion, nor does it address the issues we condemned in questions to the Commission and the Council. It calls upon the European Union to support the Transitional National Government, despite the fact that the government was not democratically elected and that the task of this same Nairobi Conference, which has already been put back from April to July, should be to define the new institutional system and lay down new conditions to ensure that the peace and normalisation process is accompanied by measures to combat terrorism and population aid.
For these reasons, and we are increasingly concerned by the situation in the different Somali regions, the threat of terrorism, the political inaccuracy of the authors of the joint resolution which reveals a disturbing lack of awareness of the facts of the Somali and African situations - I heard someone mention a war in Kenya and there has been no war in Kenya since the time of Kenyatta - and the consequent risks both for the local population and for all the other countries, Europe included, we will vote against a resolution which seeks to take the place of the Nairobi Conference or, in any case, to dictate its outcome.
Thank you, Mr President.
Somalia's implosion constitutes a great danger to the country itself, to the region, and also to the rest of the world.
Being adrift, the area is unable to control its borders, and has been, certainly in the past, a safe haven for Al-Qaeda.
The fragmented internal security situation and the diverse agendas of the Arab neighbouring countries could turn this country into another breeding ground for international terrorism.
The most dangerous indigenous Islamic organisation linked to Al-Qaeda is Al Itihad.
It wants to impose a fundamentalist, Islamic state on all seven million Somali inhabitants.
This is a real spectre looming over the 64 million Ethiopians, whose Christian majority and Islamic minority are still living together in peace.
Somalia has sunk into oblivion, while the threat of international Muslim terrorism requires the involvement of the United States, the United Nations and the European Union as a matter of the most pressing urgency.
However, closer cooperation with the regional players is required.
I therefore welcome the IGAD initiative for a reconciliation conference for Somalia to be held in Nairobi later this month, and hope that all Somali parties will take part unconditionally, as is set out in Paragraph 5.
Contrary to the request expressed in paragraph 8 of the motion for a resolution for the European Union to help the national transitional government establish its authority across Somalia, I call on the Council and the Commission not to jump to any conclusions before the Conference.
I call for open-ended negotiations.
The unified state should not be defended at all costs, but the free world needs to stand against Muslim terrorism.
Mr President, when I was in the British Parliament I co-chaired the all-party Somali group and I, and my Labour colleague, represented ports of Britain which had substantial Somali residents. That was because of the tradition of people from British Somaliland serving in the British Merchant Navy.
As a result of that I learnt a lot about Somalia and Somaliland and I particularly learned what a complex area it is.
I learnt that in the old flag there were five stars, one for each of the five Somali nations: French Somalia, which is now Djibouti; the British part of Somaliland, which is now part of Somalia; the British part of Kenya, which was made up of Somalis; the Italians with southern Somalia, which is now very much Somalia; and the Ethiopians in Ogaden.
As has been said, the Ogadeni Somali community led to a war between Somalia and Ethiopia in an attempt to reunite the Somali peoples.
It is the European Union's duty to help all the Somali nations.
It is also our duty to understand their history.
That is what they need now.
They need political solutions that respect the five traditions, and support also for the economy, education, health, infrastructure and the security of those nations.
In 1996 Somalia ranked 172 out of 174 countries on the UNDP's human development index.
It was par excellence a least-developed country.
Recent history has seen wars and destruction resulting from that.
We have over 100 aid agencies working in Somalia.
As the Commissioner has highlighted, the European Union and the Member States are the largest donors to the area, giving some EUR 60 million in all, compared with EUR 26 million from the Americans.
But let us also remember the Somali diaspora, which brings back some EUR 400 million per annum to the country.
Yet the average lifespan has fallen from 48 in 1990 to 45 in 1997; infant mortality is 125 per 1 000 live births; one in eight babies dies in the first year; 4 000 women die in childbirth every year.
We have problems that are no longer just a result of civil war but are due to famine, the weather, contaminated water, abysmal sanitation and desertification.
Only between 10% and 20% of children, depending on the region, attend school.
Women are abused.
They have little, if any, educational opportunities.
Nearly 100% female circumcision is practised.
There is a lost generation of Somali professionals - doctors, teachers, civil servants - who fled the country before the war and have not returned.
The worst of the crisis is in southern Somalia, in central areas such as Galcaio, which was devastated at the peak of the troubles and is now being rebuilt, even with street lighting being reinstalled.
We should not forget the progress that is being made in Somaliland: charity maternity hospitals are being built and opened, and there is a nurse training school.
In Hargeisa unskilled wages are now twice the rate they are in Nairobi.
In other words, political stability in some regions is bringing recovery and the hunger elsewhere is caused partly by fighting, although only sporadically, but much more by the drought.
So our task must be to support aid and sustainable development projects and to look for political solutions.
We must support the transitional government.
We must also remember that areas like Somaliland have voted twice now - in the 1960s and again in 2001 - in a referendum to have independence. That is their choice.
They have elected governments.
It shows that Somalia is a complex region.
There are some areas of despair and desolation. There are also areas of regeneration and stability.
We need to rescue the hungry and vulnerable, support moves to bring political stability, but also respect the various traditions of those five Somali nations so that they can come together through these conferences to live as neighbours in peace and prosperity.
Mr President, I would say that, first, as far as the European Commission's position on the political problem of Somalia is concerned, the European Commission agrees with and welcomes the IGAD resolution on Somali supporting the unity and integrity of the country.
As far as support is concerned, the situation has been described objectively, albeit in the blackest terms, by all the honourable Members.
Clearly the European Union is the biggest donor of development aid to Somalia and it has earmarked a further EUR 200 million for the period from 2002 to 2007.
Plans to strengthen Somalia must naturally give priority to the social sector, especially education, as the members have said, given that it is the best way of dealing with extremism and terrorism.
Of course there are huge demands as regards administrative capacities and aid distribution; this is one of the biggest challenges and the Commission needs to be flexible if it is to ensure that the money is distributed correctly.
As far as the last comment is concerned, on coordinating aid and intervention in Somalia, I have to say that, obviously, the European Union is working together with the United Nations, it is implementing some of its programmes and it is one of the founder members of the initiative to coordinate aid to Somalia set up in Nairobi.
I have received five motions for resolutions
The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance.
The next item is the joint debate on the following two motions for resolutions:
B5-0405/2002, by Mrs Almeida Garrett, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, Mr Mendiluce Pereiro, Mr Lage and Mr Colom i Naval, on behalf of the PSE Group, Mrs Isler BÃ©guin and Mrs Maes, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, Mr Miranda, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group and Mr Van den Bos, on behalf of the ELDR Group,
B5-0423/2002, by Mr Ribeiro e Castro and Mr QueirÃ³, on behalf of the UEN Group
on Angola.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a few days ago a delegation from Parliament's Committee on Development and Cooperation, led by its chairman and which included, amongst others, our colleague Teresa Almeida Garrett, visited Angola.
They had the opportunity to see on the ground the seriousness and the scale of the humanitarian tragedy, which requires European and international aid to be sent as a matter of urgency.
This must be done not only to improve the living conditions of an entire people, but because this is the last chance to save many lives, above all of children, who are dying every day of hunger and disease in the most scandalous silence, without the energy and will even to cry.
This aid must be provided effectively and quickly.
Often, in this amazing bureaucracy that we are becoming, by the time we decide to act, it is already too late.
Angola needs emergency humanitarian aid which can be translated, for example, into realities as practical as the urgent dispatch of seeds and farming tools before the rainy season starts in October, to prevent another year of famine.
We have made our priorities clear in the motion for a resolution that we endorse and support: we must provide emergency humanitarian aid; we must contribute to the consolidation of peace, which includes turning UNITA into a political party and integrating its members into national life; we must support democratic conciliation, seeking to ensure legitimisation through democratic and free elections which respect fundamental freedoms, specifically the freedoms of information, association and expression, and we must pursue economic consolidation and social reorganisation.
As we have already said in this Chamber on numerous occasions, Angola is a huge country with the potential to assert itself as an influential and important regional power and thereby to contribute to the democratic stabilisation of the entire region and to its economic and social progress.
The war limited this potential, but all options are now open and depend on the will of the Angolan people, but also on our support.
Let us ensure that our resolve does not falter and thereby weaken theirs!
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, almost thirty years ago now, everything seemed to favour the emergence of a new nation in Angola: the immense size of its territory, its fabulous natural resources, its small population and its network of small towns spread across the entire country.
Everything could have been so different, had it not been for the blindness of the Portuguese dictatorship and the brutality of the fight for power that followed decolonisation.
Bereft of the pity of the gods and victim of the madness of man, Angola was engulfed in one of the great tragedies of our time, one-third of the population displaced, hundreds of thousands of children abandoned, the destruction of towns and the dismantling of the country's burgeoning economic infra-structure.
All the resources seized by the opposing forces were dedicated to war and to cruelty, with total indifference for the population.
We know that in the midst of the poverty and the widespread suffering, countless individuals linked to the State apparatus managed illegally to accumulate incalculable wealth.
The time has at last arrived for peace and for hope.
The international community and the European Union in particular must spare no effort to consolidate peace, to promote democracy and to save millions of people who are exposed to hunger, disease and poverty.
The motion for a resolution that we will be approving today shows that the European Parliament has not forgotten Angola.
As a matter of fact, the EP has given many moral commitments to Angola.
We must redouble our efforts to provide emergency aid to the population under threat, particularly those people who, located in the areas under the influence of UNITA, are living in the most abject poverty.
The Angolan authorities, however - and this must be emphasised - also have the moral obligation to give up much of the wealth they have accumulated and help their own people.
They also have the obligation to contribute to steer emergency aid in the right direction and to guarantee that it reaches those for whom it is intended and does not disappear en route.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, we in the European Parliament are therefore keeping a close eye on events in Angola.
The European Parliament wants Angola to be a land of peace and of progress, a land and a country that is part of the international community.
Angola has enormous resources, huge talents and huge hopes.
And here, in the European Parliament, we must stand shoulder to shoulder with the Angolan people, even if at times we have to get tough with the authorities installed in Luanda.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it now seems that the regeneration of Angola and its people has taken on a positive and long-lasting character - in the same way that the tragedy caused by this conflict was appalling and endless.
Three decades of hatred and barbarity have devastated an extraordinarily rich territory and natural environment, ruined Angola's national infrastructure and annihilated, physically and psychologically, an entire population.
Given the virtually unprecedented extent of the tragedy suffered by a country situated on a continent that has already seen so much bloodshed, and in the light of the renewed optimism emerging in Angola, the European Union has more than a role to play - it has a real duty, a historic duty, that it must perform.
The EU has an extremely urgent humanitarian duty, first and foremost, to increase security in a country that has been deeply scarred at every level by bullets, famine and mines. But the EU also has a moral and political duty over the long term, which it must assume immediately in order to strengthen the fragile civil and religious peace that is being restored in Angola.
It also has a duty to resurrect a still liberated economy and to restore a transparent democratic system within the institutions. On the scorched earth of Angola, which has such abundant mineral resources, the European Union, with its experience, its technical and financial resources, can assist in the emergence of a new model in Africa, that of a model of national recovery which needs to be based primarily on the education of its citizens, achieved through knowledge gained from schooling, from the respect of civilian values and citizenship and the requirement for democracy.
This period also marks a turning point in terms of the economy.
We should rethink and relaunch a development model that is based on the fundamental resources and sustainable and renewable potential.
It is on these conditions and these alone that an economic development strategy will be credible and have a bright future.
Oil and diamonds will not always be in demand in the economy, the authoritarian policy of colonialism cannot go on, nor can the industrial exploitation of Western businesses continue.
Angola's sudden and promising recovery has taught despairing Westerners an unexpected lesson.
It is up to our Union, the European Union now to provide Angola with its experience and its support in writing new pages in its common and turbulent history.
. (PT) Mr President, I shall confine myself to some essential aspects, since the motion for a resolution that we are considering and that we supported is sufficiently exhaustive and also because we will yet have the opportunity to debate a report on our recent mission to Angola in the Committee on Development and Cooperation.
I shall therefore refer firstly to the new and auspicious political situation we are seeing in Angola, where finally, following decades of war, peace seems at last to be irreversible.
We can only welcome this extremely positive fact for the expectations it creates for stability, governance and improvements to the living conditions of the Angolan people, for the doors that it is opening to consolidation, improvement and democratic life and for the positive effects that it could bring to the entire region.
Difficulties nevertheless remain and these could affect the course of the peace process itself.
The expectations created by the signing of the memorandum of understanding are enormous and they must not be allowed to come to nothing.
In addition to the inevitable trauma, the most pressing problems are to be seen at the humanitarian level, but also concern the much-needed reconstruction of the country, whose economy and infrastructures have been destroyed by the war.
All the figures are worrying and prove the impossibility of Angola alone providing an appropriate and timely response.
This is why I shall focus on some guidelines which I believe are crucial at this time: the need for the international community and, therefore, the European Union, to consider humanitarian aid to Angola as a priority, especially consignments of food, clothing and medicines, as well as the urgent need to supply such aid more rapidly and effectively; the urgent need to supply tools and seeds to enable people to grow crops and to reduce, in a short space of time, the current total dependence on food aid; specific support for the resettlement of displaced populations, specifically with aid for the rebuilding of basic infra-structures; and, as a corollary, clear and committed adherence to the two Conference of Donors phases recommended by the Angolan authorities.
Angola expects a great deal from as and we must really not fail these expectations.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I was a member of the mission headed by Joaquim Miranda which recently visited Angola and I therefore have a very clear idea of the words that must define our debate and today's resolution: absolute priority.
We must attach priority to the issue of Angola.
First of all, in humanitarian terms, we are still facing an enormous emergency.
This must be followed up at the political level, given that the peace that is opening up for Angola could make this huge Portuguese-speaking country a major factor for stability in a very troubled region, from Central to Southern Africa.
This is what all of us in the European Union, both the bodies of the Union and the Member States, must work towards.
We must take action to strengthen factors for trust.
We are now, however, facing a clear humanitarian emergency.
We cannot allow the war to continue to kill in Angola, as a result of our indifference or of our slowness, when the weapons fell silent some months ago, thanks to the Angolans' efforts to achieve a rapprochement.
I would also like, in the little time I have left, to draw your attention briefly to the unusual tragedy of the two Portuguese children who have disappeared and to explain the amendment that we tabled on this matter.
We have had the opportunity to address the issue with the Angolan authorities; the difficulty of the situation was explained to us, which we understand, given the state of war that the country was in a while ago, but we cannot allow this issue to drop out of sight.
We were told that official investigations are now underway and we wish to express our confidence that these investigations will finally bring to light what happened in that barbaric attack in November last year and what has happened to the Portuguese children and, in the event that they are still alive, as their families believe, that they will be reunited with them.
I also ask for the support of the House on this point, which is of particular importance to the Portuguese public.
Mr President, the situation in Angola is indeed most tragic.
From day to day, images of starving people and dying children are winging their way around the world.
According to the information at my disposal, 500 000 people - half a million - are in immediate danger of death.
What this makes clear is that humanitarian aid, especially food supplies, is second only to the ending of the war as a matter of priority.
If the country is to be put on a stable footing, though, this will of course presuppose that the destruction of its infrastructure be ended.
The consequences of the depopulation that was enforced in order to cut UNITA off from its supply lines must be dealt with.
Emergency aid is a prime necessity before any process of political consolidation can be set in motion, and the establishment of peace and the conditions for successful elections both presuppose and require that this be done.
Mr President, the Commission is committed to supporting the peace process and to addressing effectively and without delay the dramatic humanitarian crisis in Angola.
In response to the signing of the peace agreement between the government and UNITA and to an appeal for assistance in addressing the humanitarian situation, the Commission drew up an action plan for Angola to support the peace process.
The action plan identifies a financial package of EUR 125m aimed at addressing the most pressing concerns at this stage, including emergency relief, food aid and food security, reintegration and resettlement of refugees and displaced persons, and de-mining operations.
The Commission provides substantial humanitarian support to reduce the suffering of the displaced populations in Angola.
The Commission urges the government to take further measures to facilitate delivery of emergency relief assistance. The Commission encourages the government to prioritise the extension of the assistance to the entire territory in its discussions with UNITA.
We are conscious of the fact that the presence of land- and anti-personnel mines is an enormous obstacle in terms of humanitarian access, resettlement and rehabilitation.
Increased security on the ground will make it possible for the Commission to implement, through specialised organisations, the substantial funding already earmarked for de-mining operations.
The Commission considers the demobilisation of UNITA and the Angolan armed forces troops a vital element in the peace process and in this context is considering with other partners support for the Angola Demobilisation and Reintegration Programme.
To ensure lasting peace, the government should improve the democratic conditions in Angola, especially promoting improvements in the human rights situation and freedom of the press.
These, together with freedom of movement, reform of constitutional and electoral laws and a proper census of the population, will be essential to allow free and fair elections to take place.
Continued efforts to allow UNITA time and space to reorganise and become a viable political force are encouraged.
The Commission urges both parties to consult all segments of Angolan civil society, including the churches, with a view to national reconciliation and lasting peace.
The Commission stands ready to support the organisation of elections as soon as conditions on the ground allow.
We underline that interventions to promote good governance will have high priority at all stages in the support strategy for Angola.
We propose to contribute in particular to the reinforcement of the judicial sector and to the reform of administration and public finances.
The Community's future strategy for Angola under the 9th EDF is currently under discussion with the government and civil society.
That strategy will establish links between relief, rehabilitation and development.
Substantial funding will be earmarked to support resettlement, including micro-projects and the re-establishment of agricultural production and livestock breeding in order to provide a boost to the socio-economic recovery of war-affected zones, particularly in the Central Highlands.
The Community will continue to provide support for health and education, as well as capacity-building to the provincial administrations, which should ultimately take responsibility for establishing and maintaining social structures and systems.
The Commission welcomes the government's intention to organise an international conference for the reconstruction of the country and trusts that the views of all groups of society will be reflected in the reconstruction plan to be presented.
The Commission has offered to cooperate in the preparation of this international conference.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
The next item is the joint debate on six motions for resolutions:
B5-0403/2002, by Mr Van Orden, Mr Deva, Mr Parish, Mrs Foster, Mrs Banotti, Mr Corrie, Dr Tannock, Mr Gahler, Mrs Korhola, Mr Lehne, Mrs Maij-Weggen and Mr SacrÃ©deus, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group,
B5-0406/2002, by Mrs Maes, Mrs Isler BÃ©guin and Mrs Lucas, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group,
B5-0417/2002, by Mr Van den Bos and Mr Mulder, on behalf of the ELDR Group,
B5-0418/2002, by Mrs Junker, Mrs Kinnock and Mr Van den Berg, on behalf of the PSE Group,
B5-0425/2002 by Mr Belder, on behalf of the EDD Group,
B5-0429/2002, by Mr Miranda, Mr SjÃ¶stedt, Mrs Boudjenah, Mr JovÃ© Peres, Mrs Fiebiger, Mr Bakopoulos and Mr SeppÃ€nen, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group,
on Zimbabwe.
Mr President, this Parliament has been a consistent critic of the Mugabe dictatorship in Zimbabwe, a country which, 20 years ago, was deemed to be a model for a prosperous, multi-racial African democracy.
However, after the slaughter of thousands in Matabeleland the ZANU-PF Government has brought the country to the verge of economic collapse and starvation.
The March presidential elections were a travesty of democracy, with repression of a free press and the MDC opposition leader now on trial for treason.
Mugabe has rewarded his cronies - or so-called 'veterans' - with confiscated white farmers' land.
The Land Acquisition Act is even now preventing the harvesting of the crops to feed the hungry.
The EU sanctions have been poorly applied, with the Minster of Police recently attending an Interpol function in Spain and Mugabe attending a hunger conference in Rome, which is a clear affront to world opinion.
Children of the regime's leaders are allegedly attending expensive British boarding schools. the New Partnership for African Development and the EU Troika have been supine in galvanising regional - particularly South African and Nigerian - opinion against the president.
Although Zimbabwe faces expulsion from the Commonwealth on 25 July, the government seems more concerned with prosecuting a disastrous war in the Democratic Republic of Congo in order to safeguard Mugabe's cronies' diamond mining interests.
I strongly urge the General Affairs Council, on 22 July, to beef up the sanctions and to allow no excuses from Member States that their multilateral treaty obligations override the sanction restrictions.
I also call on the Commonwealth to suspend Zimbabwe from the forthcoming Commonwealth Games on 25 July in Manchester.
Ordinary people can rest assured that the EU will continue to provide emergency humanitarian aid in order to prevent undue suffering and a total breakdown in civil society.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Zimbabwe is one of our recurring worries.
Although I endorse the resolution we have submitted, I do have concerns, which are based on our manifest powerlessness.
So far, none of our punitive resolutions have achieved anything.
Mr Mugabe is a figure who has survived the loss of two elections , the moral victor being the opposition.
He is a sad figure who tries to have complete control over the law.
Furthermore, I am actually proposing we start selecting the means that befit the tone of voice we adopt.
If we do not want war, if we do not have the means to wage war, then we should not sound a warlike note.
This is what I should like to ask of our British MEPs.
I should like to start by putting Mr Mugabe out of action in the Congo, where he is stealing raw materials and deploying his army.
He must leave the Congo in accordance with the international agreements in Lusaka.
We are aware that his support for the young Kabila's regime is of great importance.
If we want peace restored in the Congo, he must leave that country.
No longer having any resources, he will have to take his troops home with him; these troops have to get paid and he does not have the resources to do this.
I would recommend actions of this type, and I should also like to stop making all these fine appeals to the neighbouring countries, because they get nothing done.
In my view, we ought to start telling these neighbouring countries that it is no longer acceptable to support Mr Mugabe's policies, or that they, on the one hand, pay lip service to such things as good governance, and yet continue to display their loyalty to Mr Mugabe.
We should put pressure on them too.
I would ask the Commission to completely overhaul its way of behaving vis-Ã -vis Zimbabwe, because we were unable to apply even the few sanctions that there are.
Mr Mugabe is leaving for a trip abroad with his entourage, and you are well aware of it.
Thank you, Mr President.
It is unfortunate that Zimbabwe is once again on the agenda.
The situation is deteriorating by the day, and we, the European Parliament, the European Union, are, in actual fact, watching helplessly.
There is just one thing we can do and that is to grant humanitarian aid immediately in view of the present famine.
Something has to be done about this, and the European Union is in a position to do it.
One thing has changed since last month's part-session, when we last discussed Zimbabwe .
The G8 Conference was held in Canada, where the well-known NEPAD initiative was discussed, with reference to which it was stated that it was more or less up to the Africans themselves to guarantee such things as democracy and human rights, and that they need to exert pressure on the governments in Africa that fail to do so.
I would say that Zimbabwe's neighbouring countries now have a golden opportunity to show what last week's pledge in Canada is worth.
They can bring pressure to bear on Mr Mugabe, and we can help them do this.
These countries do receive aid on a large scale, and we could do something with this, but they would, in turn, have to exert pressure on Mr Mugabe so that the situation there changes.
I am in complete agreement with Mrs Maes regarding the situation in the Congo. Mr Mugabe has no business there and should leave that country at the earliest opportunity.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, whilst there are perceptible signs of hope in Angola, it has to be said that the situation in Zimbabwe is being made ever more desperate by that country's obstinate President, who is incapable of letting go of the reins of power even at the cost of his country's wholesale destruction, and is thereby reducing his people to a wretched state.
I want now to quote a figure supplied today by the aid agencies, one that is especially appalling, even though it is only a snapshot.
Of Zimbabwe's adult population, 33% are infected with the HIV virus.
From day to day, between 2 000 and 5 000 people die of this scourge; there are already 900 000 orphans in Zimbabwe, and that too is a consequence of the unspeakable policies of Mugabe and the ZANU-PF.
No longer is there either prevention or treatment.
Poverty makes these people's misery even worse.
In this country, which once possessed a system of medical provision that was an example to Africa, there are scarcely any medical facilities left, and what provision exists is far from covering the whole country. The reason for this is that the country's doctors and nurses have fled, the hospital system has collapsed and there are no more medicines.
These things are all consequences of a policy under which those with any hope for the future leave the country, and only the poor are left.
The hunger there - the hunger that is spreading throughout southern Africa - is only partly a result of the drought and natural calamities that afflict such regions from time to time, but is man-made and used as a weapon.
There is a need here for Europe to exert really massive pressure in the hope that sanity will yet prevail.
Any such pressure, though, in fact needs also to be applied to those who now openly declare to NEPAD that they are committed to promoting good governance, the defence of human rights and democratic values.
If they seriously mean that, then they can demonstrate their credibility by speaking frankly to their neighbour Mugabe, withdrawing political support from him and making it clear to him that he is isolated on a continent that is finding its way out of wretched poverty while respecting human dignity.
'When my chickens continued to lay eggs, I was formally in breach of the law?, according to a white farmer in Zimbabwe. This neatly, and tragicomically, sums up the criminal madness of President Mugabe's land appropriations policy.
Criminal madness indeed, for how else can a government policy be described when it simply comes down to pure theft on a massive scale, with probably a huge famine around the corner?
Mugabe's regime prohibits thousands of white farmers from continuing to work.
In this way, it also leaves hundreds of thousands of black land workers and their families with no means of support.
And this with the winter harvest on the fields ?
Imagine too the improbable situation which white cattle farmers are facing thanks to Mugabe.
Cows simply need to be milked.
To the power-mad President and his entourage, the country's white farmers and the opposition are all one and the same, and they are dealt with mercilessly, even if the country is heading for a humanitarian disaster.
By the way, President Mugabe had the audacity to show up in all his glory at last month's World Food Summit in Rome.
At the same time, a Zimbabwean economic expert lamented that 'not one government in Africa has condemned this theft of private property?, rightly following that up by asking what trust the outside world can place in the New Partnership for African Development.
This joint motion for a resolution faces all African leaders with the same pressing question.
It thus calls for credible African action against Mugabe's reign of terror.
I hope and expect that the Council, the Commission and the Member States will actually endorse this appeal.
Mr President, it is quite clear from the previous speeches that the situation in Zimbabwe is one of clear and total demoralisation amongst the people living there.
President Mugabe has presided over the destruction of a once vibrant country.
Not only that, but he has reduced what was once one of the strongest economies in Africa to the depths of despair.
While we all condemn this, we have stood by and watched his henchmen murder innocent white farmers and be rewarded by the President for their actions.
Nobody should stand by and allow this to happen.
Yet the world has stood idly by and allowed it to happen.
That must not continue.
I agree with Mr Tannock when he says Zimbabwe should be removed from the Commonwealth. It should not be allowed to take part in the Commonwealth Games.
But you will not resolve the problems of the long-suffering people of Zimbabwe by simply turning a blind eye and pretending they do not exist, nor by allowing President Mugabe to leave the country and attend conferences.
It is high time that strong sanctions were imposed.
We should be prepared to help, and make clear that we are prepared to help a democratic Zimbabwe rebuild, because a democratic Zimbabwe could once again flourish in the African continent.
I have no hesitation in saying that.
Zimbabwe was once the bread basket of Africa.
Zimbabwe was once a flourishing country and it could be again.
But it cannot be if we stand by and pay lip service to a despot like Mugabe, who is not only destroying his country and his people, but ensuring that the aid that is given does not even reach those who really need it.
Mr President, could I draw your attention and that of the services to paragraph 12 of the proposed resolution?
I would also like to ask the British MEPs to have a look at the text.
Paragraph 12 of the Dutch text states that 'eist dat deze maatregelen de uitbreiding omvatten van de lijst van buiten de wet geplaatste individuen...? [demands that these measures include the extended list of individuals placed outside the law].
In my view, what is meant here is individuals to whom access to our territory is being denied because this is a reference to the sanctions.
The French text states 'des personnes frappÃ©es d'interdiction?.
This should, in my view, read: 'interdiction d'accÃšs?.
I do not have the English text here, but I think that these three texts relate to the same kind of sanctions, namely the ban on access to our territory in the European countries, in the EU countries.
I should like to ask for these texts to be checked and for paragraph 12 to have the same scope in all language versions.
Mr President, like Parliament, the Commission is most concerned about the dangerous political situation and social polarisation in Zimbabwe.
Violence and oppression continue, the opposition has, to all intents and purposes, been crushed, civil society and an independent press no longer exist and, of course, there is the issue of the highly adverse impact of the land redistribution policy on food security, especially for the most vulnerable sections of the population and, may I say, for workers on large farm holdings.
The problem is the political and social crisis, the humanitarian disaster which is at the top of the Commission's agenda; as you know, the European Union undertook at the General Affairs Council in June to respond generously to calls by the United Nations for action on the humanitarian crisis in Zimbabwe and other countries in the area.
In addition, the Union is pushing for the farm reform procedure to be revised in accordance with the guidelines in the proposal contained in the United Nations development programme.
The humanitarian crisis has taken on huge proportions.
The Commission, for its part, has already set the procedure for responding to demands for food aid in motion and has earmarked a total of EUR 55 million for the area.
These funds will be managed by the World Food Aid Programme and non-governmental organisations.
We are, of course, doing the best we can, but we know from reports that the Zimbabwean government is making political capital out of the food crisis.
We have emphasised in our contacts with the Zimbabwean authorities that aid must be given to everyone facing a humanitarian emergency, irrespective of their political persuasions, and we have reiterated the need for food to be distributed impartially.
Of course, numerous members referred to what we too have stressed, i.e. that Zimbabwe was a food-exporting nation and that the current food shortage is mainly the result of misguided policies and only due in part to the drought.
If order to prevent a repetition of the crisis and the situation from worsening in forthcoming years, the government really must review its macroeconomic and sectoral policies, in order to get the country back on the road to a more stable economy and development.
The Commission accompanied the United Nations development programme mission to Zimbabwe to examine the farm reforms and expressed its wish to support transparent and fair reforms predicated on the needs of the poorer sections of the population.
It also emphasised the particularly useful role which neighbouring countries can play by exerting pressure.
However, in order to deal with this situation, priority has to be given to resolving the political conflict through negotiation, so as to put an end to the violence.
Only if the rule of law is restored will there be any chance of changing the situation and resolving the pressing problems in Zimbabwe, which is why I should like to highlight the action we are taking to find a political settlement to the crisis, to contain the violence and support democracy.
After so many unsuccessful attempts at mediation and the deterioration in the situation in Zimbabwe, we understand that people are sceptical as to whether or not these initiatives will succeed.
However, it is very important to understand the particular significance of contacts established between the European Union troika and the Southern African Development Community or SADC.
The troika has tried to support international initiatives to manage the crisis in Zimbabwe.
We need to give these efforts some time before condemning them.
During the troika's mission, our partners in the SADC insisted that European Union sanctions had had the opposite effect.
Even though we do not share this view, we need to seriously reconsider if our objective is to support regional efforts to deal with the crisis in Zimbabwe.
The European Union imposed specific sanctions on 20 members of the governing party by refusing visas, freezing assets and suspending bilateral ministerial contacts.
Because the dialogue has ground to a halt and violence continues in Zimbabwe, most groups in Parliament propose that the Council should impose further sanctions.
The Commission realises that the Zimbabwean authorities are endeavouring to undermine the reliability of the ban on visas.
However, the advantage of extending this ban to other people should be examined in relation to the damage which this might inflict on the Union's contacts with the SADC.
It is for these reasons that, come what may, we must continue to support the initiative of the Southern African Development Community and to monitor events and re-examine our policy towards Zimbabwe after the summer recess.
Of course, our support for the people of Zimbabwe will continue under our programmes in the humanitarian aid sector.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.

Mr President, we have a partnership and cooperation agreement with Russia, and are working on a comprehensive energy partnership with it, yet there are to this day still no democratic standards in Russia.
There is still no room for either democracy or a free press to thrive.
One touchstone for the rule of law in Russia is the case of Grigory Pasko, in which, as in so many other cases, the judgment is founded on secret military legislation, dating back to the Soviet Union and not even recorded in the country's own Ministry of Justice.
What did Grigory Pasko do?
He did nothing more than was his duty as a journalist and a citizen.
He demonstrated his public-spiritedness by photographing the illegal dumping of atomic waste.
For that, Russia has condemned him, sentencing him to many years' forced labour.
I consider it a scandal that Europe stands by watching such a thing happen.
A petition will be drawn up requesting that the court's judgment be reconsidered, but I do not get the impression that efforts within Russia will be enough to get this flagrantly unjust sentence revised.
I therefore see it as a matter of urgent necessity that President Putin, who has expressed his willingness to let independent media into his country, should be taken at his word.
I would like Mrs Diamantopoulou to tell the cabinet that I see it as one of the Commission's important responsibilities, in any planning involving Russia, to put human rights and fundamental democratic rights at the top of the agenda and, as a matter of prime importance, to demand an answer on this from the Russian government before moving on to intergovernmental discussions about energy.
Mr President, according to the Russian Constitution, the journalist Grigory Pasko would have rendered himself liable to punishment if he had withheld information on environmental issues or environmental disasters which might have endangered human life.
That is what is stated in Articles 41 and 42, brilliant as they are, of the Russian Constitution.
That, however, is something he did not do.
On the contrary, he has continuously reported on the way in which the Russian Pacific fleet dumps nuclear waste and redundant weapons in the Pacific and so gives rise to an environmental disaster in the making.
For having done so, he has been found guilty of high treason by a Russian military court and sentenced to four years' imprisonment.
Everything took place behind closed doors, and seventy journalists were expelled from the courtroom.
Last month, his sentence was confirmed by the Military Collegium of the Russian Supreme Court in Moscow.
It is deeply tragic for Grigory Pasko, and it is deeply tragic in terms of the situation in Russia where democracy and human rights are concerned.
It shows that, in Russia, these are very hard times when it comes to freedom of expression and the principles upon which our European Union is based.
This Parliament must clearly express our repudiation of laws and sentences which restrict the freedom of the press, and we must, here in Parliament, call upon the Council to give expression to our serious concern in the forthcoming meetings between the EU and Russia.
The EU supports Russia economically and, in that connection, the Commission must be very careful that the projects we support comply with our demands for press freedom and the independence of the media and the courts.
Mr President, by their deeds rather than their words shall you know them - I agree with Mrs Schroedter that the case of Grigory Pasko will increasingly become a test case for whether or not Russia is working towards the rule of law, and thus an important test case for relations between Russia and the EU.
I often get the impression that our policy on Russia is a successful combination of deceit and self-deception, in which one is not quite sure where the deceit ends and self-deception begins.
We saw this at the NATO summit in Rome.
We see it in the OSCE.
We see it in the Council of Europe here in Strasbourg, and we see it also in relations between Russia and the EU.
There is constant talk about how Russia is well on the way to democracy, or even about how it is a functioning democracy.
This has nothing to do with reality.
We can see that in Chechnya, but we also see it very clearly in the fate of Mr Pasko, who has done the thing that the institutions I have mentioned are always talking about.
He took a stand for freedom, democracy, health and public safety.
He protested at the commission of a crime.
He brought to light a crime that put people in danger and through which they would have been in even greater danger if the crime had not be brought to light, and, as Mrs Schroedter so rightly said, in doing that he did his duty.
It is now high time for us, too, at last to do our duty and say clearly that we stand behind Grigory Pasko, journalist and defender of citizens' rights.
He has done us all a service, and we must stand by him in this situation in which his health and freedom are in the gravest danger, not only for humanitarian reasons, but also for the sake of the credibility of the European Union, for whose ideals of freedom he too has taken a stand, and for the sake of relations between the European Community and Russia, for no real partnership with Russia can succeed if, far from the rule of law in that country being strengthened, Russia is suffering further setbacks on the road to it.
There have been major setbacks in recent years, and we must fear that what is left of democracy and the rule of law in Russia will be endangered if victory goes to those who want to make use of the Pasko case in a struggle for power within Russia, by which they want to demonstrate that the armed forces and the secret services are still in charge.
That is incompatible with European principles, and so our credibility is also at stake.
The Commission shares the concern of this Parliament over the situation of Mr Pasko, whose conviction lacks some of the fundamental elements of independent and fair justice such as publicity.
We hope that a speedy solution will be found by the appropriate Russian instances to remedy Mr Pasko's unfortunate personal situation.
Furthermore, the Pasko case sends a very worrying message of self-censorship to other journalists and media in general, the impact of which one cannot underestimate.
In this respect, the second paragraph of the Joint Statement of the recent EU-Russia Summit in Moscow of 29 May states that it is a common goal to strengthen a society based on respect for democratic principles and human rights, of which the defence of freedom of expression is a fundamental element.
The EU has raised the case of Mr Pasko in the past in the framework of its intensive political dialogue with Russia.
The Commission agrees that further diplomatic action is needed in view of the recent developments.
It is clear that the European Union will also continue to raise the more general issue of freedom of expression and editorial freedom in its political dialogue with the Russia Federation.
In parallel, these issues will continue to be a priority in the framework of the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR), under which Russia is a core country.
Mr President, I was first concerned with this situation when a constituent of mine sent me the Amnesty International report on the 52 men arrested on the Queen Boat nightclub in May 2001 for presumed homosexuality, satanist practices and offences against Islam.
Europeans and women were spared from the charges.
It is alleged that they were tortured by whippings, electrocutions and threats from dogs into signing confessions of being homosexual.
Allegedly many were not homosexual but just enjoying the western culture of drinking alcohol and dancing.
Motivation for the arrest was in part to appease anti-western sentiment and distract the people from the government's economic problems at the time.
In the initial trial in November 2001, 25 were sentenced to jail terms, but the government has decided on a second retrial of its so-called perverts.
A number of irregularities were apparent in the first trial.
The Egyptian press law prohibits the publication of details in on-going investigations which might prejudice the trial outcome, which was blatantly disregarded with the publications of stories of alleged homosexual orgies, gay weddings and the identity and pictures of all the defendants.
The law does not prohibit homosexual acts, only "habitual debauchery", of which there was scant evidence.
The men were tried by a state security court rather than a regular court and forced medical examinations were carried out, clearly against the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
It is clear to me that a retrial is a breach of the double jeopardy interdiction of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and also the spirit of Article 2 of the EU-Egypt Euro-Mediterranean Agreement on respect for human rights.
Commissioner Patten replied to me, as did the UK Foreign Office Minister Bradshaw, expressing concern and willingness to monitor the situation, which this House is raising with concern again today.
Regarding the previous debate, I would also like to ask Commissioner Diamantopoulou to use all available means to keep up the pressure on Zimbabwe.
Mr President, the day before yesterday saw the commencement of this trial in Cairo of these 50 men accused of homosexuality.
We Liberals would like to protest strongly against this trial on several grounds.
We always condemn discrimination and injustices against people on the basis of homosexuality, ethnicity, gender, religion, etc.
What is more, homosexuality is not illegal according to Egyptian law.
Even so, these men risk harsh punishment.
In addition, they have already been through a first trial, as several colleagues have already pointed out.
A second trial contravenes all legal principles.
We Liberals would like to remind everyone of Article 2 of the EU-Egypt Association Agreement.
We refer constantly to this article on respect for human rights.
Is it not time, Commissioners, to take this article seriously and find the means to make it useable, allowing us, in certain cases, to bring countries contravening Article 2 to their senses or at least to implement sanctions against them?
I am counting on the Commission to protest in the strongest possible terms against this trial.
Mr President, I rise with a heavy heart because it is never a pleasant duty to speak about human rights abuses.
It reminds us that individuals throughout the world, because they are different, because of where they were born, to whom they were born, are not given those universal freedoms that we so often take for granted.
The heavy heart is also because I am a friend of Egypt.
I recognise the importance of Egypt and hold the Egyptian Government, President Mubarak and the Ambassador to the European Union in the highest regard.
But when it comes to human rights abuses, if we are selective in the application of principle, then we lay this House open to the charge of hypocrisy.
What do we ask?
We ask for simple human rights: the right to a fair trial, the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, the right to freedom from torture and cruel or inhuman treatment, the right to privacy, the right to equality before the law and we reaffirm also Article 14.7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which has been mentioned today.
Let me say personally - I am not speaking on behalf of my group - that, as a gay man, if I had been born in Egypt or somewhere else, because I was different, because of the people with whom I associated, or because I declared myself publicly, I could have every single one of the human rights I have mentioned taken away from me.
Look at me. I am human.
I bleed.
I laugh.
I cry.
We are each of us exactly the same, but strangely others find a difference to deprive us of our human rights.
Therefore to do nothing is to condone human rights abuses wherever they occur.
To look the other way is to throw away our own rights and our claim to call ourselves civilised.
I call upon the Egyptian President and the Egyptian Government to do the right, just and proper thing and to release the men in question.
Mr President, the first part of our resolutions generally comprises a list of old resolutions or international conventions.
On this occasion, however, the contents of this list are very important.
The first document cited is the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948, which we should always use as a guide; Article 2 of the EU-Egypt Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement, which is still to be ratified, is also cited.
When this document is ratified, we will probably have to maintain some influence over the handling of the case in question.
The same applies to section 6 of last year's resolution, which clearly expresses our feelings on the matter and demands that the Egyptian authorities free those persons who were then imprisoned. There is also the analysis of Egyptian legislation, which shows that homosexuality is not a crime there.
In accordance with all these considerations, we agree with what the resolution says, in other words, account must be taken of these rights: the right to freedom of thought, conscience, religion, sexual inclination, the right to privacy and equality before the Law.
Mr President, in Europe, over the past few days, large, so-called 'gay pride? demonstrations have been held.
In my country, specifically in Madrid, 250 000 people demonstrated peacefully in an enthusiastic, tolerant demonstration that is worthy of praise.
We must therefore, in a way that expresses our utmost respect, convey this sentiment and the rights of these people to the Egyptian authorities..
Mr President, a person's right to choose freely and express his or her sexuality without fear is a fundamental human right which Egypt is denying its citizens, despite the international outcry.
If the Islamic community really does want dialogue between cultures, then the first thing it has to do is to start a dialogue on the understanding of sexuality, so that people can stop being pilloried for allegedly offending public morals.
The recent report by Amnesty International describes the misery of thousands of people being persecuted and tortured because their real or supposed sexuality is perceived as a threat to the established order.
In over 70 countries, homosexual relations qualify as a crime, sometimes even attracting the death penalty.
But even in the European Union, Commissioner, we need to widen the legal basis of anti-racism legislation to include sexual orientation, as required under Article 13 of the Treaty of Amsterdam.
In this sense, we should welcome the decision by the Greek Minister of Justice to abolish Article 347 of the Criminal Code discriminating against homosexuals.
We trust that the Egyptian government will do likewise and will immediately release its citizens being held in jail on charges of homosexuality.
Mr President, let us remember that Egypt is one of the great ancient civilisations. It has always been a pillar of culture and progress since ancient days.
Today, its recent former foreign minister is Secretary-General of the Gulf Cooperation Council.
Egypt is primus inter pares in perpetuity in the Arab League.
Yet we have these most unfortunate men charged with an offence that we in the European Union cannot accept as a matter of anything other than rank discrimination.
In the light of the European Mediterranean Partnership that we have, we speak as friends of Egypt, because indeed Egypt today is still one of the foremost defenders of democratic rights and guarantees of democracy and human freedoms in the entire Arab world.
We respect its culture, its background, its history, its religion.
But still, as friends, and, in most particular, because of our deep profound partnership with Egypt, we ask it to think again.
Today, in supporting this important resolution, we call upon the Council and the Commission to speak for Parliament in asking the Egyptian Government to think again.
Mr President, I am going to reply on behalf of Mr Patten: It is a fortunate coincidence that I was the Commissioner who had the opportunity to propose this legislation two years ago in Parliament.
Now, finally, we have the adoption of the anti-discrimination legislation at European level.
It was the first time that we agreed at European level that there should be no kind of discrimination in employment on the grounds of sexual orientation.
This case is not a matter of discrimination; it is a matter of fundamental human rights.
The European Commission closely followed the case of the 52 men arrested in the so-called Queen Boat affair and the conduct and the outcome of the case raised several issues of concern.
The Commission was especially troubled by the use of National Security legislation, with no right of appeal for the 23 imprisoned men, and by the inflammatory language used at the trial and in the media, which undermined official Egyptian claims that the men were charged primarily for debauchery rather than sexual orientation.
Egyptian President Mubarak has recently ruled that all but two of the 52 men arrested in the Queen Boat case should not have been tried in the Security Court and their case will now be reheard in a misdemeanour court.
A decision on the referral is expected to be given on 16 July.
This is an important and potentially positive development, although its impact is mitigated by the possibility that even those acquitted in the first trial will be retried.
The European Commission will continue to follow the Queen Boat case and other similar prosecutions.
The European Union's concerns have already been communicated to the Egyptian authorities through the normal channels and will be reiterated if appropriate.
The European Union is committed to the defence of human rights and condemns the prosecution of individuals or groups for their sexual orientation.
This commitment is integrated into the European Union's external policy as a matter of principle and in the form of concrete measures and actions.
At a global level the European Union supports the protection of human rights by grants to civil society groups and non-governmental organisations through the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights.
At a bilateral level, the Association Agreements increasingly govern the European Union's relations with third countries and require that such relations "shall be based on respect of democratic principles and fundamental human rights as set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights".
The recently signed European Union-Egypt Association Agreement contains such a clause and respect of human rights is explicitly identified in the text as an "essential element" of this agreement.
The Association Agreement with Egypt provides an important additional forum for both parties to discuss issues of human rights and democracy.
Mr President, the great deterioration in the situation in Belarus is manifested, among other things, by its presence among the topical and urgent subjects of major importance two part-sessions of this House in a row.
That really is exceptional, as this item on the agenda is otherwise much more diverse.
It is quite incredible how the autocratic Mr Lukashenko keeps on believing that he can get away with things in Belarus that would be permitted nowhere else in Europe and allowed nowhere else in the area covered by the OSCE.
It is quite clear to my mind that he has lost his grip on reality.
The tragedy of the situation in this country, and of the developments occurring in it, is exemplified, in the area of freedom of opinion, by the fact that opinion surveys now have to be cleared by the government, with checks having to be carried out on who is commissioning them, how they are funded and how they are run, and a government commission demanding corrections to their results.
To take another example, our delegation in this Parliament received a letter from the Ambassador of Belarus dictating to us what we are to do with our agenda.
Perhaps he can do that with his own parliament, but we are freely elected deputies and still decide on our agenda ourselves.
That only goes to show in what sort of situation Belarus' parliamentarians find themselves.
We are submitting this resolution at a time when the question is being raised within the OSCE as to whether or not Belarus' Parliamentary Assembly is to be recognised.
I do not believe that it can be recognised, as it is not freely elected.
Mr President, whereas, in the rest of Central and Eastern Europe, considerable progress has been made when it comes to freedom of the press, matters have, as we have mentioned, taken a wrong turn in both Russia and Belarus.
As the Commissioner said earlier, these retrograde steps are in danger of having a harmful effect upon developments in the rest of the region.
It is deeply worrying that, in recent years, an average of ten journalists per year have been murdered in the two countries.
They have typically been journalists in the process of investigating events which those in power did not want to be discovered.
The authorities rarely have much desire to throw light on such matters.
Parliament should support the recommendations by the International Federation of Journalists, or IFJ, which rightly points out that there is a need for the international community to be much more vigilant in monitoring and protesting against the infringements of press freedom that take place.
That applies when. through legislation, governments attempt to prevent the operation of independent media that are critical of them, as happened, for example, with what was termed an 'information law' in Belarus. It also applies when, in specific cases, governments restrict the freedom of the press, as happened, for example, in the case of the journalists Nikolai Markevich and Pavel Maozheiko who took the liberty of criticising President Lukashenko during the presidential election campaign in Belarus and were given severe sentences as a result.
We have clearly expressed our rejection of laws which restrict the freedom of the press, and we must protest against specific infringements of press freedom wherever in the world they may occur, including Russia and Belarus.
We must step up our monitoring of what is happening in those two countries when it comes to pluralism and freedom of the press. Over and above that, the international community should also do a very great deal more to support projects aimed at promoting the professionalisation of the media through the training of those who work in the industry and through giving the industry's organisations a more significant role in democratic development.
Thank you, Mr President.
I share Mrs Schroedter's view that it is actually regrettable in itself that, within the space of one month, we are having to talk about Belarus twice in the plenary session.
This is a bad advertisement for that country.
Last time, we discussed the problems surrounding the OSCE mission in Minsk and its closure by stealth.
This problem has still not been solved.
Up in the gallery, we have Mr Carpenter, one of the diplomats who has left Belarus and with whom we had a talk this morning, and Mr Stakewitz, one of the opposition leaders in Belarus, and I think we ought to give them a warm welcome here.
Again, there is talk of a number of incidents relating to freedom of press.
Old times persist in Belarus.
This is on top of our own experiences.
Everything we do there and try to do in tandem with the OSCE and the Council of Europe is often misrepresented in the state media, which always ends up with me, the chairman of your delegation, being alleged to be a NATO spy.
This is indicative of the climate in that country.
My invariable response is that I am a spy for democracy rather than for NATO, even though I form part of the NATO delegation.
I do not want to say too much about freedom of the press; our resolution is crystal-clear.
As far as solutions are concerned, I should like to call on the Council and the Commission to try to engage in more dialogue with Russia about Belarus.
The Russian Federation has an enormous impact on that country and has, so far, refused to help us bring pressure to bear on the Lukashenko regime.
Relations between the EU and Russia, and between Russia and NATO have improved considerably, but we ought to use these to galvanise Russians into bringing about greater democratic involvement in Belarus.
The criticism is sometimes levelled at us that, with our policy and our resolutions, we are trying to isolate Belarus, and that this is only playing into Lukashenko's hands.
Although I am sensitive to this criticism, I think one could claim that Lukashenko is mainly isolating himself and that we are actually waiting with bated breath for a sign on his part, an essential concession to democracy, so that we can respond by opening up a gateway for his country.
After all, we are keen to do something together for Belarus; there are plenty of problems to solve together, but this should be made possible by the regime in Belarus itself.
Mr President, President Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus cannot handle any criticism.
The sentencing of two editors of the independent weekly Pagonya once again provides unfortunate proof of this.
Their punishment - a number of years in a labour camp -is intended to silence all the critical voices in that country.
The take-over of various Belarussian literature magazines, masterminded by the Ministry of Information, serves the same purpose.
Nearly all their editors-in-chief were dismissed at the same time.
A number of those who replaced them immediately announced slavishly that they would no longer publish any work by journalistic critics of the apparently untouchable Belarussian Head of State.
Parallel to this, the authorities in Minsk are working towards ever tighter government control on people's basic constitutional rights.
Two recent examples illustrate this recent development.
A special control committee for 'political-social' surveys has been set up, which is most certainly behind the publication of President Lukashenko's painful popularity figures (just 30% in April 2002).
In addition, a revised 'Law on faith and religious organisations? is threatening to drastically limit freedom of religion. This led this week to an urgent appeal by the Protestant church leaders to Lukashenko to intervene and to enter into a dialogue with them.
This is why I urge the Council, the Commission and all Member States, on the basis of paragraph 6 of the present joint motion for a resolution, to give our unqualified support to this church initiative.
Another personal comment on the motion for a resolution concerns the provision of specific support to the independent press in Belarus, which, although very much in the official firing line, could be afforded solid backup by cooperation agreements with western newspapers.
I would gladly commend the plan and funding of this option to the Council, the Commission and EU Member States in order to protect the fundamental rights of the people of Belarus.
Mr President, three weeks ago the European Parliament was highly critical of Belarus' closure of the OSCE office.
The fact that its top official Andrew Carpenter, who has been deeply involved in democracy and human rights in this European state, failed to received an extension to his visa in practice meant the closure of the office.
Now we are once again lamenting the infringement of human rights in Belarus, injustices against journalists, dissidents, people who are subjected not only to trial and serious prison terms but who are also violated, degraded and sidelined from official society.
People have actually lost their lives in the fight for democracy in Belarus.
This is a further expression of the lack of faith in the political and popular legitimacy of the country's own regime.
The Commission, represented here by Commissioner Diamantopoulou, must now seriously review the European Union's strategy with regard to Belarus.
The country is, and has long been, isolated.
We must not give an inch in our demands regarding human rights, but we must, at least at a lower technical level, open a dialogue with Belarus.
Despite everything, it is a European state.
It is a neighbour of Latvia, Lithuania and Poland, of the enlarged EU.
A new strategy is required.
Allow me to mention a few points which may serve as suggestions for such a strategy.
Firstly, no one person, namely President Lukashenko, can stand in the way of a whole country of ten million inhabitants.
These people must be given a European vision, must be given hope of a different future.
Secondly, civil society must be strengthened and local elections in Belarus prioritised as an expression of strong grassroots involvement in democracy in this country.
Thirdly, election rules in the country must be more open and create greater confidence that elections actually are reliable and fair, which has not previously been the case.
Fourthly, we in the EU must act in such a way as to avoid strengthening polarisation in Belarus.
We must support democracy but without splitting the country.
Fifthly, we must continue in our single-minded fight for human rights.
Belarus may once again crop up under topical and urgent matters in the European Parliament in September.
Sixthly, we must remind Belarus and President Putin that they have a responsibility within the framework of the union with Belarus to stand up for human rights in this country.
Mr President, for centuries, Belarus tended to see itself as part of Central Europe and had a close relationship with what is now our Community, but the twentieth century dealt it some appalling blows.
First there was the imperialism of Greater Russia, then Stalinism had a particularly cruel effect on it and on the Ukraine, then came Nazi occupation with its crimes - for the war affected White Russia particularly badly - then renewed Soviet colonialism, Chernobyl, the effects of which were particularly felt there, and now, at length, Mr Lukashenko.
Mr Lukashenko is a scourge on this country, and has become - thank God, one has to say - a figure unique in modern-day Europe.
Since Milosevic fell from power, Mr Lukashenko has in fact come across as a relic of an age which has - thank God - come to an end.
It is precisely for that reason that we must do everything possible to support Belarus' democracy movement, which has been suppressed, to act to bring about the release of persecuted journalists, and intervene in defence of the rule of law, democracy and freedom of opinion.
We are dealing with one of the last tyrannical regimes in Europe, which must be overcome by peaceful, democratic and lawful means.
I therefore consider it right that we turn our attention to this country a second time within a very short period, and we will not cease from doing so until this country is in actual possession of the things we enjoy, namely democracy and the rule of law in accordance with European standards, until this country has also returned to the community of free European peoples.
In real terms, this involves us supporting civil rights campaigners, supporting - as Mr Belder pointed out - the independent media, and making it our concern that the spirit of freedom should not be smothered by tyranny, but that that same spirit of freedom should prevail in Belarus as elsewhere.
Mr President, the right to freedom of expression and the right for journalists and the media to scrutinise power and social development are taken for granted by those of us living in countries with deeply-rooted democratic traditions.
These rights are not as obvious in every country in our world.
In Belarus, for example, those who put forward a view different to that of the governing powers are persecuted.
People who follow a political line different to that of the government are subject to reprisals.
Nor is there any freedom of the press in Belarus.
Journalists and the media are prevented from critically scrutinising and reporting on both domestic politics and the outside world.
There are powerful reasons for strongly condemning the way the Belarus regime handles freedom of expression and freedom of the press.
It is important that all democratic institutions are assisted in work to strengthen the independent press in Belarus.
Therefore, I welcome the fact that Parliament is once again training the spotlight on the situation in Belarus.
The situation in Belarus regarding democracy and human rights is of the greatest concern to the Commission and the Member States.
In principle, Belarus should be among our most important partners: it will be a direct neighbour after enlargement, and is a main line of communication between the EU and Russia.
However, the systematic suppression of opposition elements, including a number of 'disappearances?, the lack of democratic checks and balances and the treatment of the media have led us to freeze relations.
We have indeed, as recommended in some of the motions which have been put down today, warned the Belarussian authorities that they cannot expect any change in that situation unless they take clear steps towards respect for human rights and democracy and introduction of the rule of law.
The treatment of journalists and authors in Belarus is scandalous.
The practice of preparing lists of writers which should not be published reminds one of times we all believed were over.
They are in total violation of OSCE and European standards.
We are also deeply concerned about the closure of the newspaper Pagonya, already mentioned by two Members of Parliament, and the sentencing of its editor and one of his collaborators, as well as the charges against the editor of Rabochy.
These men had all been accused of slandering the president during the electoral campaign last year.
Belarus refuses to cooperate with the OSCE, which it has accused of meddling in its internal affairs.
We strongly believe that the OSCE should continue to maintain a presence in Belarus and should actively assist the country to implement the obligations it took on in acceding to the OSCE.
The Commission will continue to stress that Member States should not make concessions to, or deal with, the Belarussian Government unless and until there is a fundamental shift in its attitude.
At the same time we should be ready to respond if and when that shift takes place, while continuing to use our instruments to support civil society and people-to-people contacts.
Both Tacis and the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR) are active in these fields.
I also have no doubt that the EU will continue to raise the cases of individuals, including these journalists, opposition politicians, and academics like Professor Bandazhevsky.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
The next item is the debate on the following 5 motions for resolutions:
?5-0421/2002 by Mr Linkohr, Mr Medina Ortega and Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the serious incidents in the city of Buenos Aires;
?5-0428/2002 by Mr Andria and Mr Posselt, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on the situation in Argentina: economic, institutional and social crisis;
?5-0433/2002 by Mr Marset Campos, Mr Di Lello Finuoli, Mr Miranda and Mr JovÃ© Peres, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on repression in Argentina;
?5-0434/2002 by Mr GasÃ²liba i BÃ¶hm, Mr SÃ¡nchez GarcÃ­a and Mrs Marieke Sanders?ten Holte, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the situation in Argentina;
?5-0435/2002 by Mr Lipietz, Mr Mayol i Raynal, Mr Nogueira RomÃ¡n and Mrs Frassoni, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on the situation in Argentina.
Mr President, we should in fact have addressed the Argentina crisis last January, when it was at its crucial point, but the changeover of duties prevented this.
The Argentine situation has improved since December, but we are still faced with tremendous difficulties.
A few days ago some incidents took place, in which two people were killed and dozens wounded.
Yesterday, the President of the Argentine Republic, Mr Duhalde, announced that the elections would be brought forward to May instead of October.
In any event, when we address the problem of Argentina in these institutions, we should refrain from lecturing.
Naturally, I do not think either Parliament or the institutions of the European Union as a whole are in a position to lecture.
In particular, it is difficult to do so in the case of a country like Argentina, which has been the prize pupil of the International Monetary Fund and which we have often praised for following this type of policy.
The pupil, however, was not as good as it appeared: there has been an excessive accumulation of public debt, uncontrolled public spending and now, as a result, the financial system has collapsed.
I think it is difficult to recommend doctrinaire solutions.
On the one hand, I do not think that going back to old recipes of replacing imports, or old recipes of dependency theories, solves anything.
They might satisfy us intellectually, but they do not solve anything.
Of course, it is equally untrue that the solutions devised at Davos, the solutions of the gospel of neoliberalism, have led the country towards a solution.
I think we need to look for a far more pragmatic solution.
There are countries in Latin America which, albeit with difficulty, are overcoming these problems. The best example of this is Chile, but Brazil, under Fernando Enrique Cardoso, also seems to be coping under difficult circumstances.
The most important thing is for the European institutions to instigate aid to Argentina, which is a democratic country, with freedom of the press, a high level of culture and excellent economic, commercial, political etc. relations with our Union.
We should consider similar aid to that given to Turkey.
In Turkey's case it is possible that this aid may have influenced its role as a strategic country in the Middle East.
Argentina may not be in a strategic area, but if we do not help Argentina, there is a danger that the rest of Latin America might follow in its footsteps.
From my point of view and that of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, therefore, the important thing now is not to provide solutions or recommendations, but to ensure that the European institutions and our Governments take action to support this economy and this country which, given the close relationship it has with us, deserves our backing.
Mr President, I welcome the debate taking place in this Chamber.
With reference not to January, when the crisis started, but to the fact that I have been trying to get this resolution debated for over two months with little success, I feel that the very nature of urgent debates must be reviewed.
Indeed, whether we achieve much or little depends on the speed with which decisions are taken and recommendations laid down.
The situation in Argentina is certainly awkward and sensitive. It is awkward in that all economic or financial mechanisms are effectively frozen.
In particular, it is absolutely impossible to withdraw money from a bank deposit except by means of credit card transactions, and these transactions carry the obligation to replenish the reserve.
A deposited sum can therefore not be used in any way.
Extremely dubious options have, moreover, been provided for the purchase of three- or ten-year bonds but the yield or redeemability of these is uncertain.
In any case, it is worth pointing out that it would be absolutely impossible to survive on the yield from these bonds.
There is something else I would point out to Mr Medina Ortega, and that is that, rightly or wrongly, where Argentina leads other countries follow: it is seen as an example.
There is therefore a possibility that Uruguay, which is already in a similar situation - not to mention Chile and Brazil - might follow Argentina's bad example.
Lastly, I would like to stress that it is extremely difficult to draw up proposals.
Indeed, the resolution seeks purely to stress the fact that there is a crisis.
It is up to the International Monetary Fund to make a quick decision as to whether to provide aid to the Argentinean crisis and the Argentinean State.
One initial step towards resolving the crisis could be to propose once again the creation of an export circuit, specifically a credit card circuit, which must not just be virtual but provide the possibility for people to use their own funds within the bank circuit.
Mr President, unlike three of the Parliamentary groups, we did not sign this resolution because we believe it does not tell the whole truth about what is happening in Argentina - although this is difficult to do through a resolution, I admit - and it seems rather weak.
The best example is recital H, which states: "whereas the violent incidents in Argentina that have claimed victims stem from the serious economic and social plight of the country [...], and from the fact that over 40% of the population is out of work".
This is true, but it is not the whole truth, because the victims were caused by military suppression and two real people, with first names and surnames, have died, while more than 90 have been injured, and, moreover, the police shot their way into the headquarters of the United Left Party.
In other words, poverty, unemployment and the serious crisis situation are not the whole story.
The resolution calls on the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to provide aid to help Argentina weather the crisis, but says nothing about the conditions required for this to happen.
Our amendments point out that Joseph E Stiglitz, former Vice-President of the World Bank, states that market deregulation, financial speculation and flight of capital are contributing factors to this crisis, in addition to any errors that might have been made by the Argentineans.
Mr President, a country as wealthy as Argentina has no right to leave the majority of its population in poverty.
We must therefore help it to overcome its crisis, but only insofar as this is necessary.
Mr President, Argentina is in crisis, and when Argentina cries, the whole of the Americas are concerned, as, I believe, Europe is too. Not just because Argentina is a favoured partner of the large trade bloc that goes by the name of Mercosur, but also because of its strong social and cultural links with old Europe.
I am afraid we are discovering, through some worrying facts, that the political and economic populism of this wealthy republic does not have a happy ending.
The winds sown by certain governments are now being felt by Argentinean citizens, with the disastrous results of the economic whirlwinds we are currently seeing.
That is why the European Parliament is calling for international solidarity to try to help these citizens of the southern cone of South America to come up with an appropriate economic policy.
We must help a people which, in desperation, lives with and bears the consequences of damaging former government policies, on a daily basis.
Our contribution should be to work towards social stability in Argentina and the economic recovery of its people, because what is good for Argentina is good for everybody.
Mr President, I agree with what Mrs GonzÃ¡lez Ãlvarez has said.
We need a proper debate on this and not just an urgency.
This is a crisis that risks spreading to the rest of the economies of Latin America.
The crisis is to a large extent the co-responsibility of the IMF's and the World Bank's irresponsible and crazy lending policies.
Argentina was for a decade their favourite pupil, opening up the markets, putting money into financial speculation instead of productive investments and increasing the debt enormously.
The dollar/peso parity, provided for through a change in the constitution, made exports far too expensive and therefore killed off the exports sector.
We would like to see a huge aid package for social and productive investment, debt cancellation and a tribunal for those who were accomplices in buying out the country.
This is a country that used to be the richest nation in Latin America and No 6 in the world!
We should also be concerned about the actions of some Europeans.
The Spanish are reclaiming the money they put in through their investments by buying up the electricity, water, banking, telecom and airline sectors.
A thorough investigation of the crimes is essential, with those responsible being brought to justice.
In the last week alone there has been excessive and violent repression by police, including the use of firearms.
Two demonstrators have died, 90 people have been injured and 150 people have been arrested.
There was also a raid on the headquarters of the United Left Party without even a court order.
These issues need to be addressed and those responsible brought to justice.
The European Union needs to distance itself from the neo-liberal economic programmes that are being provided.
We must reject the IMF's and World Bank's recipes.
Mr President, at the turn of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, there were shiploads of Europeans wanting to emigrate from Europe to Argentina.
Visiting Buenos Aires today, what you experience is a fascinating mini-Europe.
The peoples of Europe are united there in all their cultural richness and live peacefully together.
The position is reversed today, a century and, in some cases, fifty years later, with long queues of Argentineans of European origin forming in front of the European embassies in their desire to emigrate to Europe.
This is symbolic of the success of Europe and of European unification, but is also, alas, an indication of Argentina's failure.
I have to say, as someone who loves and values that country beyond all measure, that this is something that we as Europeans must regret, and something that requires that we offer our help in a spirit of solidarity.
I do believe, though, that Mrs McKenna is oversimplifying matters with her references to international institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
It must be clear to us that Argentina is a country which really is flowing with milk and honey.
It has meat, honey, milk and wine - all of it of the highest quality and available in abundance.
Argentina's agriculture could feed Europe as well as its own people.
Argentina has oil and natural gas, exports energy and, with its ideal conditions, is one of the richest countries in the world.
That such extreme social tensions should have come about in this country - I really have seen urban areas ablaze, burning tyres on the motorways, blockades and riots - simply has to be primarily attributed to the lamentable fact that Argentina has a political system that does not work, that is inefficient and corrupt and gives rise to enormous costs.
For example, in poor provinces such as Misiones, the members of the provincial legislature earn more than an MEP.
I do not begrudge anyone their salary - that is not the point at issue - but Argentina has an enormously inefficient system, and if it does not sort out its home-grown problems itself, as its neighbour Brazil has made a start on doing, then we Europeans can do nothing either.
We must help others to help themselves.
Mr President, your uncontrollable, uncontrolled and faltering economy has bled Argentina dry; 50% of the population has fallen below the poverty line, there is mounting anger within the working population which, without work and largely deprived of benefits, is reduced to scavenging rubbish dumps. The only response that Argentina's leaders have found is to shoot on unemployed Argentineans who were taking part in demonstrations, killing two youths and injuring hundreds of people.
What is happening in Argentina is appalling, all the more so because this country, which was not even one of the world's poorest, was plundered for years by large American - and European - corporations, which enjoyed a booming trade whilst running this country into the ground.
Although the majority of the population is bankrupt, a rich minority, be it Argentinean or foreign, continues to grow richer.
The only thing that the joint resolution finds to say, apart from some vague turns of phrase condemning the economic, political and social crisis as if it were a natural disaster, is to protest against the attack on the right to property and to call for action from the Argentine Government to enforce respect for the fundamental right to property of local savers and foreign investors.
In our view, this amounts to saying that those who do not have property or investments therefore only have the right to die, and Parliament will not even utter a word of protest.
We would have voted for a motion for a resolution by the Confederal Group of the European United Left, which at least condemns the police's brutal repression.
We utterly reject the joint resolution.
The Commission regrets the acts of violence which occurred in the city of Buenos Aires.
The Commission agrees that the deep root of these acts lies in a monetary crisis, which transformed itself into a commercial and economic crisis (sharp fall in trade, investment and GDP), deteriorated into a social crisis (unemployment, poverty and social exclusion) and is ending in a crisis of confidence in the national institutions.
It is very complicated to analyse the reasons for the crisis in a resolution or discussion in Parliament, but on the other hand it is very easy to blame the international organisations.
The measures linked to the so-called "coralito", the peso/dollar parity introduced by law, and the resulting lack of any room for manoeuvre on monetary policy, among other examples, do not correspond to the IMF recommendations.
Now there is a need for reforms.
The reforms that Argentina has to carry out are necessary not only to obtain help from the IMF, but more importantly to get the country moving again.
What is needed is to win back citizens' confidence in the democratic institutions, to win back the confidence of economic actors in the stability and credibility of law and order, and, in particular, to restore the credibility of the financial system.
The European Union and its Member States have already tried to help Argentina in the different international organisations, including the IMF and the last G8 Summit.
The Commission, in particular, has a very firm idea of what to do.
Something that would undoubtedly help Argentina is deeper integration of the Mercosur countries and the European Union is making an effort to accelerate its negotiations with Mercosur.
To this end, Commissioners Lamy and Patten will hold a meeting with the Mercosur ministers on 23 July in Brasilia.
The negotiations between Mercosur and the European Union will undoubtedly help promote internal cohesion in Mercosur that will in turn help Argentina.
In terms of traditional cooperation, the financial resources that we have at our disposal are disproportionately low compared to the problem we are debating.
However, our country strategy paper has identified the fight against poverty and institutional support as the two main priorities.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
Mr President, I should like to table an oral amendment. This would be a new sub-paragraph 7(a) as follows: 'Welcomes the recent announcement by President Duhalde with regard to bringing forward the electoral process by six months to spring 2003, in order to reinforce democratic legitimacy?.
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
The Irish government has published the wording of the question which is to be submitted to Irish voters for the purpose of ratifying the Treaty of Nice by way of referendum.
I believe the inclusion of an article which would prohibit Ireland entering into a common EU defence policy is a tactical mistake and it shows a clear misunderstanding of why Irish voters rejected the Treaty of Nice in the previous referendum.
A survey examining the attitudes of those that opposed the Treaty revealed that 'fear of loss of power influence and money' rather than the issue of neutrality were the major factors.
Furthermore, this decision by a government led by a Fianna Fail Taoiseach is a betrayal of the European idealism of his predecessors as far back as Sean Lemass who indicated that Ireland would be willing to participate in a common EU defence policy.
It is also in marked contrast to the previously stated remarks of Foreign Affairs Minister Brian Cowen in the Irish Examiner of the 3rd July 2000:
Instead of pandering to eurosceptics within his own party, such as Minister O'Cuiv, and eurosceptics outside it, he should be giving decisive leadership instead of further confusing the voters.
(Abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137 (1) of the Rules of Procedure)
Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 4 July 2002.
I should like to take the opportunity to welcome everyone back for the autumn session of our work.
I am sure that you are now relaxed and ready to do battle on the various public policy issues ahead of us.
In recent weeks in Central Europe, particularly in upper and lower Austria, eastern Germany and parts of the Czech Republic, entire areas have been ravaged by floods of unprecedented and catastrophic proportions.
More than 100 people have lost their lives and tens of thousands have been forced out of their homes and out of their work places.
Today, on behalf of myself and this House I want to express our deepest sympathy with the victims of the floods and their families, and to recognise the extraordinary efforts of the rescue services and so many volunteers.
Tomorrow, in a specially convened emergency debate, in addition to our heartfelt sympathy of this afternoon we have the possibility, in a practical way, to lay the foundations to show real solidarity.
As a mark of respect for those who died, I ask you to rise in a minute's silence.
(The House rose and observed a minute's silence)
On Sunday, 4 August, Cecilio Gallego Alaria and a six-year-old girl were killed by a car bomb which had been placed near a bus stop in the Spanish town of Santa Pola in Alicante.
On 1 August David Caldwell was killed in an explosion in Derry in Northern Ireland.
By these acts, terrorists have shown once more in their denial to the right to life their essential provocation to the democratic order.
Terrorism denies the common values and principles that the European Union is founded upon, represents, promotes and defends.
Our Union is based on the principles of democracy and the rule of law which are common to the Member States and therefore can offer no justification for the use of terrorist violence.
On my own behalf and that of the House, I strongly condemn these acts of terrorism and express my deepest condolences to the victims' families, and our deepest sympathy for those affected by terrorist attacks.
On behalf of the House I express once more our support for the respective authorities in their efforts in the fight against terrorism.
I ask you to observe one minute's silence for the victims of terrorism.
(The House rose and observed a minute's silence)
The final draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday, 28 August 2002 has been distributed.
The following change has been proposed:
Wednesday:
I have received a proposal from the Verts/ALE Group to add to the agenda of Wednesday, 4 September a special debate on the International Criminal Court.
Mr President, I believe that the Criminal Court has the support of almost all the Parliamentary groups.
However, none of the governments - whether right or left-wing - really support the Criminal Court, and it is my view that we need to hold a debate during this part-session which will allow us to make it clear that we reject any proposal to grant immunity to anybody outside this Court.
Such a debate would give us the opportunity to adopt a resolution during the second September part-session.
In view of the fact that a meeting of Foreign Affairs Ministers is due to take place on 30 September to decide whether or not to allow exceptions, I feel that two debates will be more effective than one if we want to make it quite clear to all the governments that the European Parliament does not wish there to be any exceptions whatsoever.
That is why neither I nor my group feel that a single closed debate on a motion - on 24 September next - will be sufficient.
We recommend that a debate be opened so that the European public is informed of the firm position of all the Parliamentary groups.
We therefore call for another debate to be included in the programme for this part-session.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we do not disagree on the matter in hand, but we do urge that we go about it in another way.
On Wednesday, we will be having a truly wide-ranging and very serious debate on Iraq and other important issues, and our group has made very careful preparation for this not only as regards speaking time but also as regards what is to be said.
We therefore propose that it is not this week that we should have the debate on the International Criminal Court, but during the second September part-session.
That would in any case still precede 30 September and the Council meeting, so we can have a prior debate concluded by a resolution.
There is, then, no disagreement about this, but, when it comes to procedure, we favour the second September part-session here in Strasbourg rather than this week.
Mr President, I believe we are all in favour of the International Criminal Court.
There are no disagreements about this.
We are dealing with an issue of procedure and my Group is in favour of a debate with a resolution in the second September part-session.
But if you will allow me, Mr President, I am going to make a proposal which I believe will interest Mr Cohn-Bendit and many other members of the House.
I would also point out that my Group expressed its disagreement with dealing with a question on Mercosur during this sitting.
My proposal is as follows: the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy should include this issue in its next meeting, with an express request to the Commission to communicate the opinion, which appears to exist, on the possible consequences for a Member State of altering its position in relation to a common position adopted, since there is a common position on this point, and, apparently, that represents a violation of the Treaties.
The issue is very important and I would ask - I cannot see Mr Brok, but I imagine this will be communicated to him - that the Foreign Affairs Committee consider it.
In a common position, we have all - the Member States and Parliament - given our word.
This should be looked into and, if it is a violation of the Treaties, Parliament would be in a much stronger position to condemn any possible unilateral change of position on such an important issue.
Mr President, Mr Cohn-Bendit raises a very important point because this is an issue on which decisions may well be made before our September II part-session.
We know that Member States are under great pressure at present and the matter needs to be dealt with.
At the same time, it was the view of the Conference of Presidents last week - and I believe it would be the view of this House - that we need to have a full debate on the current situation regarding a possible armed attack on Iraq.
I would ask you, Mr President, either to take up Mr BarÃ³n Crespo's suggestion or to try to find a way of scheduling such a debate on the International Criminal Court this week without eating into the time foreseen for the debate on Iraq.
Mr President, this decision leads me, as a member of the delegation to Romania, to make a request of you.
In mid-September, the Romanian parliament will be discussing the agreement which their foreign minister has negotiated with the USA in this matter, without - as you will perhaps be aware - keeping them informed about it.
The debate in Bucharest will therefore be a very lively one.
If we are to discuss this only at the second September part-session, you should perhaps write to your opposite number to the effect that the Romanian parliament should hold fast to the EU common position and perhaps decline to support this agreement.
That is what would be called for in that situation.
Thank you very much.
I would be very pleased to do so on behalf of Parliament.
(The agenda was adopted)
Mr President, it is also with regard to the agenda.
As it stands in front of us, it does not contain an item which, under our new Rules, namely Rule 121a, should automatically be placed on the agenda for Mondays: a 30-minute period of one-minute speeches for Members to raise items of political interest.
That should have been on our draft agenda and it appears to have been left out - no doubt an oversight, these are new rules, not everyone is used to them yet - but it should automatically be on the agenda at some point during the Monday.
Mr President, over the weekend, 11 Palestinians, including 4 children aged six, ten and fifteen years old, were killed by the Israeli army during targeted attacks.
According to the Israeli daily newspaper, Haaretz, no less than 30 Palestinians were killed during the month of August.
Sixteen other victims, including 9 children, had already been claimed during a raid on Gaza at the end of July.
Even the Israeli press condemned the irresponsibility of these crimes while, as the Yediot Aharonot stressed, the number of terrorist attacks fell dramatically.
That is why, on behalf of my group, I call upon the Council, the Commission and Parliament to adopt a very clear position on this change of tactic by the Sharon government, which, in my view, will incite hatred and the desire for revenge when there is a vital need for de-escalation, dialogue and peace.
Mr President, for quite a long time, we Danes had a very major problem in that we were unable to watch Danish news on television.
Then, the problem was solved, thanks to our efficient Quaestor over there.
We have now, however, run up against another problem inasmuch as a dispute between the Danish Broadcasting Corporation and Danish journalists means that we are again unable to obtain any news.
Could you not demonstrate sympathy with the journalists in the hope that the dispute might in that way be ended and that we might again be able to obtain information on the same terms as our fellow MEPs.
I really do hope that you will do this.
Mr President, on a point of order, I would like to raise a question that is causing grave concern to people in Ireland, particularly those on the east coast of Ireland - and indeed it should also be a matter of concern to people on the west coast of the UK.
It concerns the current shipment of MOX pellets that is being returned from Japan to Sellafield and is due to enter the Irish Sea some time next week.
The Irish Sea is already highly radioactive as a result of the emission of waste from Sellafield into the Irish Sea.
The shipment is in two first-generation double-hulled ships, which are not completely double-hulled and are very old.
This is causing concern to people in Ireland because of the risk of accident and the very real risk of terrorist attack on these ships.
There has already been fairly widespread world concern expressed about these shipments.
They are an environmental hazard to the high seas and to coastal states.
I urge the President of this Parliament to raise this matter with the Commission and in particular with the UK Government.
If this shipment proceeds it is likely that shipments will continue for some time to come.
The actual pellets themselves have been refused and returned by Japan, when it discovered that the quality control standards had been falsified at Sellafield.
Therefore Japan would not accept them for use in its nuclear reactors.
I am gravely concerned about this.
All political parties in Ireland have expressed concern about this and I urge that we take action in relation to it.
Mr President, on 8 August, two Turkish Cypriot journalists from what used to be the 'Europa' and is now the 'Africa' newspaper, its editor Sener Levent and Mentuh Ener, were sentenced to six months in prison by an illegal court in occupied Cyprus, accused of allegedly insulting Mr Denktash.
This is yet another example of blatant violation of human rights by the occupying Denktash regime, in this case of the freedom of expression and freedom of the press, to which the powers that be here on Earth have turned a blind, not to say hypocritical eye.
Clearly, the aim is to silence any progressive Turkish Cypriot voices opposed to the occupation and plans to partition Cyprus and this is especially significant at this crucial stage of the proceedings on the Cyprus question.
I also understand that five teachers are to stand trial for taking part in a cross-community choir which gave a performance in Istanbul.
We condemn this action outright and ask you to bring your influence to bear in securing the immediate release of these two journalists.
Mr President, you may recall that before the summer I proposed an initiative on a global Christian/Muslim/Jewish dialogue with representatives of the Christian, Muslim and Jewish parliaments to be sponsored by yourself here in the European Parliament.
During the summer, it has been noticeable that tensions have risen regarding September 11 or Iraq or what is happening in regard to Israel/Palestine.
I think it is time for such a dialogue, as a focus for the good forces of moderation and moderate people.
This idea was mooted to me by the Speaker of the Philippine Parliament, when we were there, and I think the time has come for this initiative.
Mr President, the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy held a debate with the Danish Presidency last Monday on the implementation of the Sixth Framework Programme.
This debate included discussions between a number of Members, including the Chairman of the Committee and the Danish minister, in the course of which it was stated that the Council, having adopted the Framework Programme's specific programmes, which were laid down without Parliament's codecision, had come to an agreement with specific reference to the sensitive ethical issues.
This led a number of Members to assert that this agreement goes against the agreement which Parliament reached with the Council of Ministers in May.
There was no mention, in the documents we had to vote on before second reading, of any agreement on the issues that the Council has now come to an arrangement about, nor have I had any information about it.
It therefore follows that it is right and proper for Parliament to put questions to the Council.
As an ordinary MEP, though, I would also like to ask if the President or anyone else has been provided with documents that were not available to all Members of this House when the vote was taken.
I will have to check on the details so that I can give you a definitive answer, but, to the best of my knowledge, the documents to which you refer have not been forwarded in any formal way to this institution, its President or its secretariat.
I will check that.
Mr President, I would like to draw your attention and the attention of the House as a whole to another case of severe violation of the most basic human rights, of violation, above all, of the freedom to choose where to live.
This is the situation, what is happening at this time, even as we speak, in Tunisia.
The facts are these: an Italian woman, married to a Tunisian citizen, was taken to Tunisia with her two children, aged 16 months and 5 years, for a week's holiday - or that is what she was told by the father.
When they got to Tunisia, the father took away his family's passports and is now forbidding them to leave Tunisia. He expects his wife, an Italian citizen, to stay in Tunisia against her will.
A few minutes ago, I was informed that the Tunis Minors' Court has granted custody of the children to the mother, recognising that the father is not able to look after the children, but that it does not as yet intend to allow the family to go back to Italy, where they have a house, where the children were born and which is their natural home.
Mr President, we who have bilateral relations with these countries in all fields also have the duty to make them understand that they must bring their legislation - whose authority we respect - into line with the changing conditions in the world so that dialogue can take place between parties on equal terms, with equal dignity and in mutual respect.
If they wish to enjoy good relations with the European Union, they have to understand that we have certain rules which we intend to uphold, starting with laws guaranteeing human rights and the free movement of persons.
Mr President, today is an important anniversary for the Vietnam war, not what is usually referred to as the Vietnam War but the war which is taking place day after day in Vietnam against democracy, human rights and fundamental freedoms, the war being waged against the citizens of Vietnam, against the Buddhist monks, against the leaders of movements opposed to the Vietnamese regime.
Today is the anniversary of the birth of that regime. It is a significant date of grave import, particularly for the Catholic and Protestant minority of Vietnamese Montagnards who are being oppressed by this regime.
The Transnational Radical Party has called for next Saturday, 7 September, to be a World day of non-violent, Gandhian demonstration to promote democracy and freedom in Vietnam. Chinese dissidents such as Wei Jing-Sheng, the leader of the Vietnamese dissident community, Vo Van Ai, the leader of the Montagnards, and Kok Ksor, will take part.
I call upon all the Members to support the initiative of the Transnational Radical Party and to take part in this world day of non-violent protest against this new, constant, daily battle which is taking place in Vietnam.
Mr President, I should like to ask the House for support for your and this House's intervention in the case of the sentence of death by stoning imposed in various cases by a court in northern Nigeria.
This is both for so-called criminal offences and apparently, in the case of Amina Lawal, for the offence of bearing a child.
I am sure we are all agreed that whatever the case and merits of the case it is a dreadful death in any circumstances, but particularly in the case of a mother whose only crime is to bear a child.
I feel very strongly on this issue and would ask you - and I am sure you have done this already as I have written to you about previous cases - to intervene with all your best efforts in this particular case.
Mr President, this summer, as I was on my way along the Rome-Naples motorway to Rome airport, I stopped in Cassino.
Near Cassino, there is a small hamlet with 2000 residents, San Pietro in Fine, which was razed to the ground at the famous Battle of Cassino during the Second World War.
Not one stone of this hamlet, San Pietro in Fine, remained standing, and the few surviving inhabitants rebuilt the village a little way further up the valley.
It is my belief that young people should know what happened. To this end, San Pietro in Fine should be made a memorial which is a reminder of the horrors of war and commemorates the major role played by the European Union in the past 50 years in preventing war in Europe.
Mr President, I support Mr De Rossa in relation to the nuclear shipments.
It is quite outrageous that, despite huge public opposition, these kind of shipments are taking place.
Coming so close to September 11, people should be especially aware of the dangers of shipping materials like these.
The interests of the public should be served instead of the interests of the nuclear industry.
I also support Mr De Rossa in saying that you, Mr President, should do something about this.
Coming from a country like Ireland which is so strongly against these shipments and also against the whole concept of the nuclear industry, I think something should be done to send a message from this Parliament that we are extremely concerned about the shipments.
I would also like to support my colleague Mrs Ahern in relation to the stoning to death.
We need to encourage some countries in the European Union that have repatriation agreements with countries like Nigeria to review the whole idea that it is safe to send asylum seekers and refugees back to these countries.
I am speaking here about my own country which thinks nothing of sending refugees and asylum seekers back to Nigeria, knowing that this is the kind of situation they face.
Mr President, firstly I would like to join this House in its expression of sympathy for the victims of Santa Pola and Derry.
The question of political violence in the Basque country has been raised many times in this House.
However, the Basque issue has never been included on the agenda.
Apparently nobody dares to question Mr Aznar's views on the Basque country.
There is no political deal, only a problem of terrorism.
I am aware that some of the Spanish MEPs, although not all of them, and the majority of Members of this House, know perfectly well that there is indeed a political deal that should be urgently tackled.
But everybody stays silent.
This House should no longer ignore the lesson of Northern Ireland and instead of denouncing the tragic results of violence should, as Commissioner Patten said some months ago, develop methods to identify and tackle the root causes of political violence.
Mr President, in my country there is currently a judicial process under way to ban Batasuna, with the sole objective of protecting democracy and the system of freedoms and, in this regard, I am grateful for your institutional words of support, because the truth is that there are hundreds of pieces of evidence linking ETA with Batasuna and it is not acceptable that public subsidies are being used to finance terror.
Just today Mr Gorostiaga Atxalandabaso has missed another opportunity to condemn this murder.
Neither does he question the fact that his colleagues, at events that he organises, shout support for ETA or chant 'Kill them, ETA'.
What Mr Gorostiaga Atxalandabaso has done is to gather together more than EUR 200 000, put it in the boot of a car and try to send it to Spain.
Mr President, we cannot stand by, we have the right and the obligation to prevent this appropriated money being used for the evil purposes of terrorism.
Mr Gorostiaga Atxalandabaso, it seems to me the height of cynicism, and absolutely repugnant, to hear you once again justifying crimes, in this case affecting a pensioner and a Spanish girl.
It is absolutely repugnant.
It is also repugnant to discover that a proportion of public resources, the money of the European citizens, which you receive, ends up in the hands of the criminals and fascists of ETA.
That is how repugnant it is.
Mr President, something is not working in the system if we in this House have to endure the indecency of people who come here to justify crimes.
Mr Gorostiaga Atxalandabaso, please be aware that the impunity of individuals like you and the impunity of your activities is coming to an end throughout Europe.
