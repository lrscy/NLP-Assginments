Â· it supports the regions in danger of being damaged by the statistical effect of enlargement;
Â· it calls for the outermost regions to be treated as a special case as regards their access to the Structural Funds;
Â· it proposes that unspent resources due to the N+2 rule be reallocated to areas which can make good use of them;
Â· it rejects any renationalistion of regional policy spending;
Â· it calls for fair treatment for islands and sparsely populated regions;
Â· it makes the rights of people with disabilities a prime priority of cohesion policy.
The amendments which I tabled with other MEPs of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left:
Â· strengthen the text and make clear to the European Commission and the Council that competitiveness and entrepreneurship cannot be promoted at the expense of sustainable development and cohesion;
Â· call for an increase in resources for the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund, because an unequal Europe cannot be viable;
Â· call for better control of state aid, so that it is not an incentive for relocating businesses within Europe at the expense of the workers in various regions.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of this report because I feel that it covers a range of aspects that are of major importance to Portugal, and indeed equally positive for the European Union in which I believe.
The European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund are all of the highest importance in promoting the objectives of economic growth competitiveness, wealth creation and reducing the enormous regional disparities.
I was therefore pleased to see the rapporteur address areas that I consider essential.
For example, the report rejects any attempt to renationalise regional policy and any attempt to reduce amounts of state aid to least favoured regions, and endorses the Commissionâs proposal to penalise businesses that relocate but still enjoy the benefits of European funds.
Â Â  . The Hatzidakis report sets out the European Parliamentâs perspective on the future reform of structural funds.
The inclusion of âstatistical effectâ, the recognition of natural effect regions, the rejection of the 150 km limit for defining maritime regions, the emphasis on equality issues and the strengthening of environmental concerns should all be welcomed.
On Amendment 42 and original paragraph 13 the EPLP abstained due to the language of the text.
Â Â  . â The Communist Party of Greece voted against the reports on the Structural Funds for the fourth Community Support Framework for 2007-2013, because they serve the anti-grass roots policy of the ÎU and the safeguarding of increased profits for big business.
The Structural Funds are used by governments to strengthen the plutocracy of the Member States, the imperialist plans of the Member States, the concentration of capital and the escalation of the monopolies.
They are used to promote capitalist restructurings which strike at the wage and social rights of the workers and at health, welfare and education, and to make sweeping changes in the rural economy and other sectors.
They are used for ideological terrorism, military spending on the imperialist aggression of the ÎU and ÎÎÎ€Î and for bribery and corruption in order to mislead the working and grass-roots movement.
The law of asymmetrical development is inexorable.
Social and regional disparities are worsening instead of getting better.
Enormous problems are faced by the workers and, in particular, the residents of the island, outlying and mountain areas of Greece.
The allegations about promoting the convergence and cohesion policy of the ÎU through the Structural Funds are the greatest fraud against the workers, women, farmers and the grass-roots classes.
Greece is a typical example because, according to the statistics, seven Greek regions, 80% of the population, are in danger of falling outside Objective 1 funding from the Structural Funds.
Â Â  . We feel that one of the key issues with regard to the current proposal for a regulation for the Cohesion Fund â already covered in the previous regulation â is the pegging of the Cohesion Fund to the Stability and Growth Pact, in other words, the possibility of suspending all or part of the financial aid from the Fund to cohesion countries, such as Portugal, if the decision provided for in Article 104(8) of the EC Treaty is adopted.
The country concerned will thus be penalised twice over and the rapporteurâs proposal to make this a political decision by the Council, rather than an automatic decision, does not resolve the problem.
We are also opposed to the so-called ân+2â rule being applied to the Cohesion Fund, which will place new restrictions on the use of these funds by countries that ought to be aiming to bring their levels of economic and social development up to the Community average.
We also consider the amounts earmarked for this Fund for 2007 to 2013 to be inadequate, particularly in light of the EU enlargement.
In view of the rejection of proposals that we tabled aimed at amending these and other measures that we felt were steps in the wrong direction, we voted against this resolution.
Â Â  . One of the key aspects of the debate on the future of the Cohesion Fund is, of course, that of âstatistical wealthâ.
Every aspect of this fund is extremely important, yet the aspect that most concerns me, and without doubt the national authorities, is that of apparent wealth stemming from actual impoverishment due to the loss of support breaking an unfinished cycle of growth.
This is the key problem for Portugal in talks on the future of this fund, and is my greatest concern.
I welcome the fact that the report is mindful of the need to find an adequate political response to this question.
Â Â  . The accession of ten new countries has presented the EUâs internal cohesion with one of its greatest challenges.
It has exacerbated differences in economic development and regional economic and social disparities across the Union.
Greater effort is therefore required on the part of the EUâs cohesion policy, which is currently undergoing a root and branch reform with a view to taking on board the impact of enlargement.
In a Union enlarged to 25 countries, the instruments of cohesion policy must be provided with the appropriate financial resources, which must in turn be distributed fairly among the least favoured regions, not only of the ânewâ Member States but also the âoldâ ones.
This must be done in such a way that we can press ahead with reducing the gap between the levels of development of the various regions and the extent to which certain EU regions are lagging behind (the current âconvergenceâ objective), and with meeting the new âregional competitiveness and employmentâ objective.
The recommendations tabled in the various reports submitted to the vote today, and particularly that of my Group colleague Mr Fava on the European Regional Development Fund, address these concerns.
As regards the allocation to these funds, we await with interest the Council agreement on the Financial Perspective for 2007-2013, which we hope will be equal to the new challenges facing the EUâs cohesion policy.
Â Â  . I strongly welcome the adoption of my key amendments to the ERDF regulation, which will ensure full access to the funds, without discrimination, and will also seek to use the fund to tackle the particular social, economic and environmental problems faced by predominantly rural areas, such as my own constituency, particularly through diversification measures, entrepreneurship and through stimulating local employment.
I also welcome the adoption of my amendments to mitigate the environmental impact of business and domestic activity, and prioritise climate change, biodiversity, environmental management, and sustainable energy production in the use of funding - growth areas of massive potential in the East of England
Â Â  . Portugal has benefited considerably in recent years from the European Regional Development Fund.
At national level, we might take issue with some â or indeed a large number â of the priorities set by the different governments for the use of these funds, and can demonstrate our disappointment at the eventual impact, given that we deserve more and better.
Nonetheless, we must recognise the enormously positive effect that this fund has had on Portugal and must focus on the rules that will apply to it in times ahead.
Accordingly, I endorse the priorities expressed in this report, such as that of ensuring that these funds are distributed more fairly, in such a way that past and future enlargements do not undermine the least developed regions and countries of the EU.
Particular attention should also be paid to âstatistical wealthâ, which is not real wealth and should not be treated as such.
Â Â  . I welcome this report in general but am particularly pleased with the overwhelming support given to proposals to ensure non-discrimination and accessibility for 50 million disabled persons to goods and services, infrastructures, buildings and ICT funded by the new regulations for 2007-13.
The position adopted on Article 2 of the ERDF promoting social inclusion and recognising the need to remove barriers faced by disabled people in accessing goods and services in built up areas is particularly welcome.
Â Â  â Madam President, this is a sad and tragic day for the new Member States, which are suffering yet more discrimination.
With regard to the Hatzidakis, Fava and Andria reports, the ground rules have been changed.
The scope for new Member States to use the Structural Funds has been altered and severely restricted, with the goalposts being moved in terms of the N+2 rule for the Cohesion Fund and with the rejection of private sector participation.
It is discrimination against the local authorities and civil organisations in the new Member States.
All Members of Parliament for the new Member States have voted unanimously to defend their interests. What is happening is discriminatory, and it shows a lack of solidarity by Parliament.
It is a very unfortunate message to be giving to the new Member States.
Â Â  . The strengthening of economic, social and territorial cohesion through cross-border, transnational and inter-regional cooperation is one of the Unionâs fundamental objectives.
Such cooperation fosters the balanced and harmonious integration and development of the European Union.
To this end, the Union has set up internal and external instruments for cross-border cooperation within the EU.
Steps taken to reduce difficulties in managing cross-border, transnational and inter-regional cooperation are therefore of particular importance.
I therefore endorse the report by Mr Olbrycht on instituting a Community-level instrument which allows the creation of cooperative groupings in the Community territory, invested with legal personality, to be known as âEuropean groupings of territorial cooperation (EGTC)â.
I feel that an instrument of this nature can make a positive contribution to the balance of territorial cohesion in Europe.
Â Â  . The British Conservative party support the European Social Fund and in general the amendments made to the report by the rapporteur.
In particular, the initial block vote of 80Â amendments contained positive modifications looking to promote women's participation in the labour market and promoting work-life balance.
However, ConservativesÂ do not supportÂ amendment 58 which looked to specifically promote capacity-building and the networking activities of NGOs.
Â Â  . The resolution adopted by Parliament on the European Social Fund closely follows the Commissionâs proposal, in that it places emphasis on the European Employment Strategy and the Lisbon Strategy.
It is true that some amendments have been introduced, here and there, to cover the experience of the Equal Programme, gender equality, the fight against poverty and disability issues.
We regret however the rejection of four proposals that we tabled, which were intended:
- to promote high-quality work in all aspects, in addition to issues of training and acquiring new skills, by promoting improved working conditions (in terms of hygiene and safety, health and patterns of working time), stable contractual relations, adequate salaries, and working hours that are compatible with family life;
- in light of the social and economic situation in each Member State and the social challenges faced by the Union, to build a broad support framework, with special emphasis on increasing the workersâ qualifications, on improving working conditions, on the objective of full, high-quality employment with rights and on the fight against poverty and social exclusion.
Â Â  . The European Social Fund (ESF) has always played a key role in European development, albeit with certain changes of direction over time with regard to its areas of intervention.
The Commissionâs latest proposal can be divided into two parts: one with a view to modernising the European social model by investing in people, and the other to simplifying texts and procedures.
Although I welcome the Commissionâs proposal, I go along with the idea that the actions of the ESF should not be channelled exclusively into the regions belonging to the convergence objective.
Quite the opposite, in fact; I feel that support for people should be provided on a non-discriminatory basis.
Accordingly, I support the amendment to Article 3(1), aimed at broadening the scope of application of this fund, and broadly endorse the Silva Peneda report.
Â Â  Many of the reportâs objectives in terms of sustainable integration, social protection and increased gender equality are worth striving for.
However, these issues are best dealt with at lower levels of decision-making, rather than at EU level.
With a view to controlling the EUâs growing zeal for centralisation and regulation, the EUâs tasks need to be clearly demarcated and its budget kept within bounds.
In the light of this, we cannot support the proposal to allocate EURÂ 336.2 billion to the European Social Fund between 2007 and 2013.
Â Â  I strongly welcome a majority of the amendments adopted to the ESF regulation, aimed at using ESF funding to reinforce social inclusion and sustainable inclusion in the labour market.
In particular, my own amendments which seek to improve accessibility for disabled persons in the workplace, and to train employers in equal opportunities recruitment, disability awareness and non-discrimination.
I also welcome the adoption of my amendments that prioritise the involvement of local communities and enterprises and promoting local development initiatives, such as urban social projects, lifelong learning and active citizenship.
Voluntary organisations at the grassroots level must be enabled to take part in our funding programmes.
Finally, the emphasis on my amendments to supplement employment and growth criteria with social indicators such as skills deficits, numbers of elderly persons and lone parents - mean that pockets of poverty in otherwise relatively more prosperous regions like my own in the East of England can continue to have their needs heard at the European level.
Â Â  . For over 40 years the European Social Fund has been the financial instrument of Europeâs social policy and is widely seen as a resounding success.
For that matter, Portugal has been a privileged witness to this success.
This fund is of particular importance at this juncture, when our efforts should be channelled into implementing the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy.
It is very much in Portugalâs interests to see this strategy, which was set out in Lisbon, become a reality, not in terms of repeated statements of intent, but of practical steps, of realistic definitions of priorities and of significant action.
Against this backdrop, the proposals tabled by both the Council and the rapporteur are worthy of my wholehearted support, as both clearly address these concerns.
Â Â  We Moderates have today rejected the European Parliamentâs proposal concerning the European Fisheries Fund.
We believe that the European Fisheries Fund needs proper restructuring, as proposed by the Commission.
We do not, however, believe that fisheries policy requires increased appropriations.
Â Â  . Whilst it contained some points that we welcome, two points led us to vote against this resolution:
- the Commissionâs proposal for the European Fisheries Fund is consistent with the financial guidelines of the latest review of the common fisheries policy, in 2002, to which we were opposed.
- the financial envelope proposed for 2007-2013 is EURÂ 4.9Â billion, virtually unchanged from the amount set aside in Agenda 2000 for the EU of 15.
This clearly falls a long way short of addressing the challenges facing the fisheries sector and the regions that depend on that sector.
Increasing the budget earmarked for this Fund will play a key role in ensuring support for small-scale, traditional coastal fishing, securing investment in renewing and modernising the fleet, taking socio-economic measures to compensate for the reduced fishing effort, financing recovery plans, and providing support for aquaculture-related industrial and commercial activities, with the involvement of fishermen and their associations, in line with the co-management principle.
Lastly, we regret the rejection of our proposals to fund compensation for fishermenâs loss of earnings due to a recovery plan and to place owners and workers on an equal footing when it comes to public aid for permanent cessation.
Â Â  â European and French fishermen do not need a new financial mechanism â yesterday the FIFG, today the European Fisheries Fund â what they need is hope for the future.
Sustainable development and the precautionary principle, general principles applied to the common fisheries policy, only serve to disguise a restrictive policy in terms of fisheries, fishing areas, fishing days and agreements with third countries.
Under the pretext of protecting stocks, the fisherman is being eliminated â that is the overall approach of the European Commission which, moreover, does not impose the same constraints and costs on non-Community fleets as it does on European fishermen.
To combat this policy, we intend to foster the development of the French fishing industry, which indirectly provides employment for 100Â 000 people, in order to reduce our trade deficit and allow fishermen to ply their trade in optimal conditions of work and safety.
Â Â  . The Portuguese authorities and Portuguese representatives in Community institutions need to pay special attention to issues of fisheries.
It is good news that the sea, including fisheries of course, has once again become one of the main headings of national development.
It is therefore crucial that we attach the highest importance to this report, so that we can defend our legitimate interests.
I refer in particular to replacing old vessels, to broadening the scope of measures to modernise the fishing fleet, to protecting small fishing, to aquaculture, to commercialisation and to geographical concerns.
After all, Portugal must not forget that there are major conurbations in its coastal areas â due to the countryâs history and geography â and there would be no justification for excluding those areas from Community support.
As I said, these were the main factors that influenced my vote.
Â Â  . The Casa report reopens the CFP reforms negotiated in 2002.
The EPLP cannot back the report due to the report's inclusion of issues such as boat modernisation and renewal and joint ventures.
The use of public money to build new boats and therefore to increase capacity cannot be acceptable at a time when so many fish stocks are under threat.
If the European Parliament is serious about sustainability then it is a sad day that so many have backed this report.
Â Â  .The adopted resolution, which is, it must be said, unsatisfactory in certain areas, seeks to modernise the principle of equal treatment between men and women in matters of employment and occupation.
Unequal treatment can occur not only in the workplace but also in access to jobs, to training and to promotion.
The monitoring of these practices should therefore cover all of these areas.
What the Member States need to do, in conjunction with the social partners, is to combat the problem of the continuing gender-based wage differentials and gender segregation on the labour market by means of regulatory measures enabling both men and women to combine family and work commitments more easily.
This will entail regulatory measures covering parental leave arrangements, which can be taken up by both parents, and the establishment of accessible and affordable childcare services and care for dependents.
Furthermore, if we are to achieve equality between women and men, changes applicable to both men and women will need to be made.
It is therefore important that the Member States, in collaboration with the social partners, implement strategies to make equality between men and women a reality.
Â Â  We are completely in favour of women and men being treated equally in matters of employment and occupation.
This is a crucial area with which international organisations such as the ILO are adept at dealing.
We do not believe that the EU should regulate issues of this type in far-reaching reports along the lines of political programmes.
It is not for the EU to take charge of significant national issues such as working time regulations and parental leave.
These are matters that the Member States can usefully deal with independently in accordance with international agreements already adopted.
Â Â  â When the European Commission takes steps to simplify and strengthen the legal basis and codify Community legislation, it can count on us.
For me, this is an encouraging initiative because it concerns Community legislation on the equality of treatment and opportunity for men and women, which has developed since 1975.
In spite of its imperfections and the shortcomings in the way it has been applied, this legislation has made a major contribution to reducing discrimination against women, especially in the workplace.
Belonging to a generation which has suffered all possible and impossible types of discrimination, I understand the true value of the Community policy of equality of treatment.
Of course, in addition to codification, it could be the subject of innovation.
Our demands, which are intended to improve it, have been set out here, also in relation to self-employed workers and assisting spouses.
Our rapporteur and I, with other colleagues in my group, have had great difficulty in thwarting the preposterous demands of certain extremists, demands which are counter-productive for employment and the very equality of opportunity for women which they claim to want to foster.
Our amendments are intended to prevent unreasonable delays in adopting this important legislation at second reading, by bringing it into line with the Councilâs general philosophy.
Â Â  . The principle of equal treatment has been enshrined in Community legislation for decades, yet it has thus far not been possible to put an end to inequality between men and women.
Wage differentials between men and women in the EU have remained alarmingly high in recent years, even though the rate of womenâs participation in the labour market has risen.
The average gender-specific wage differential in the European Union is still 16%.
This is often directly linked to how well family life and employment are reconciled.
I therefore give my backing to the report on the Commission proposal aimed at modernising and simplifying Community law in the area of equal treatment of men and women in matters of employment and occupation.
I believe that the Member States must take further steps to implement Community law, by promoting information campaigns to change attitudes in the world of work.
At the same time, the social partners can play a decisive role in this by promoting flexible working arrangements which allow both women and men to combine work and family life more successfully.
Â Â  . Mrs Niebler has lent her backing to the Commissionâs primary objective, which is to use this directive to simplify and clarify the law in force.
I share her view that this new version of the directive represents a step in the right direction for Community law in the area of equal treatment between men and women.
I support Mrs Nieblerâs report, which draws attention to the need to meet the objective of modernising and simplifying Community legislation in the area of equality between men and women in matters of employment and occupation, in order to give greater clarity and legal certainty.
The rapporteur rightly points out that it has not yet been possible to put an end to inequality between men and women.
The legal conditions are there on paper, but we have yet to achieve success in this area, which is a key element of Europeâs social objectives.
Â Â  â If there is one field in which the rules must be clear and certain, it is the legal field in relation to contractual obligations.
And that is the great merit of Mrs Wallisâ report, which helps to improve legal certainty in this area.
Rather than seek an artificial unification of all rules of law, she achieves unification by proposing a harmonisation of the rules governing the conflict of laws and jurisdiction â which is the correct approach â in order to determine which law is to apply, and this makes it possible to combine the package of national rules with the demands of legal certainty.
With regard to the damage to personal reputation or private life due to attacks by the media, it should be emphasised that obtaining compensation has become extremely difficult.
The necessary right of reply, in particular, tends to be substantively violated due to the procedural difficulties with which it has to contend, all in the name of an abusive interpretation of press freedom.
In this context, the proposed solutions are reasonable but must not restrict the rights of the persons subject to attack.
We shall vote in favour of this report.
Â Â  We are in principle well disposed towards the proposal to create standard conflict-of-laws rules for non-contractual obligations.
The proposal would supplement the Brussels Regulation on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters, together with the Rome Convention on the law applicable to contractual obligations.
It would contribute to increased legal certainty and an efficient internal market.
We think it important, however, to guarantee that the regulation does not come into conflict with freedom of the press and freedom of expression.
The protection of press freedom and freedom of expression, afforded under the Swedish Constitution, must continue unchanged.
Nor would it be appropriate for foreign law to be applied in assessing the permissibility of industrial action taken under Swedish law on Swedish territory.
In both these areas, it is moreover doubtful whether there is a legal basis in the EC Treaty for such a regulation.
We therefore support those amendments whereby the law in the country in which the actions are carried out is applied to industrial action, and we reject the amendments entailing unacceptable interference in national rules on freedom of the press and freedom of expression.
Â Â  . Environmental issues are at the heart of policies on Europeâs future.
As such, the establishment of nationwide pollutant release and transfer registers (PRTRs) will be a key factor in providing the public with transparent and coherent access to information.
I voted in favour of this report.
Â Â  We voted in favour of the report on the mandate for the 2006 budget conciliation procedure before the Councilâs first reading.
It constitutes a sound basis for the continued budget process.
We believe, however, that the structure of the EU budget must become more modern.
This requires, for example, reform of the common agricultural policy, with a reduction in the intervention prices in the agricultural markets, a reduction in direct aid and a gradual transition to national cofinancing.
A reduction in the amounts for the international fisheries agreements is also justified.
We also believe that cohesion policy should focus on the needs of the new Member States.
Â Â  We are voting in favour of the report on the mandate for the 2006 budget conciliation procedure.
We believe, however, that the EU budget should be reformed and modernised in the future.
This mainly requires reform of agricultural policy.
We believe that the amount appropriated to agricultural aid should be reduced.
We also believe that cohesion policy should be focused mainly on the needs of the new Member States.
Â Â  â Madam President, I would like to comment on the Bozkurt report on the position of women in Turkey.
We eleven New Democracy MEPs supported the report, which our various and numerous amendments helped to shape.
We set great store by this report for various reasons:
Firstly, it emphasises that women's rights are an integral part of human rights, of the which the candidate countries have an obligation to adopt and apply.
Secondly, it sets the framework for our continuing negotiations with Turkey.
It is even emphasised in this report that the report drafted by the European Commission, which will form the framework for negotiations between the European Commission and Turkey, must also include the situation of women and Turkey's obligations with regard to this part of the .
Our reservation concerns the criminal code, which is why we voted against paragraph 4.
We welcome the application of the said criminal code, but we note that this has been a satisfactory point so far and we need to encourage steps in this direction.
However, it is not enough for the Turkish criminal code to be applied; it must also be reformed, because it does not refer to honour killings.
Â Â  We believe that the EU is a union of values and that Turkey is part of its neighbourhood.
We therefore also support the report aimed at increasing the role of women in Turkey.
We support Turkeyâs closer association with the EU but believe that neither Turkey nor the EU is at present ready for union.
Turkey does not, for example, fulfil the human rights requirements for becoming a member.
The EU must also change.
The rigid bureaucratic structure and the expensive agricultural policy must be fundamentally reformed before Turkey can become a member.
Â Â  â This report, or rather this indictment, should suffice to make it clear to all supporters of a Europe without frontiers, without culture and without a past, that Turkey is not a European country and that our western democratic model is not necessarily shared by a nation whose heritage has other sources.
This report is a litany of all the serious abuses of womenâs rights committed by the Turkish State, be it different types of violence, the access of women to the employment market or their absence from the representative political institutions.
This report also highlights the discriminatory system which, from the earliest age, forces women into a marginalised and subservient role.
Finally, it is clear that Turkey has a system for the oppression of minorities, particularly the Kurdish communities.
The limited steps that the Turkish Government has resolved to take in this area and the practical difficulties in implementing them rule out the possibility that Turkey will meet the conditions â which, moreover, are inadequate â for accession to the European Union.
In view of this, and mindful of the instructive outcome of the French and Dutch referenda, we demand an immediate halt to accession negotiations with Turkey.
Â Â  . I voted for this report which draws attention to the situation of women in Turkey.
It rightly notes that Turkish women face economic hardship, a high rate of violence against them and a low rate of participation in politics - only 44 of Member's of parliament are women.
However, it is also correct to note that the situation is improving and recent legislative reforms, especially in the Penal Code, have improved the situation.
Â Â  . The Turkish Governmentâs efforts at improving the position of women represent an attempt on its part at approximating to Western standards.
Women themselves benefit from the rights accorded them by law to varying degrees: while equality appears to have become established in elite circles, little has yet happened to affect the broad mass of people.
The contrary is the case, for, as the benefits of state-sponsored modernisation continue to be out of their reach, they are more and more likely to throw in their lot with Islamic parties that enjoy a surge of popularity by offering what they claim to be âsolutionsâ.
Many elements militate against the success of this approach.
In the first place, political and social involvement was, or is, fostered only in so far as it does not cause the relationship between the sexes to be questioned, or, to put it another way, only on condition that women remain subservient.
Another problematic aspect is the way in which the lack of social contact between the various ethnic or religious groups or social classes have resulted in entrenched divisions between some women and others.
It also testifies to the low esteem in which women are held that the stateâs official statistics make no reference to unemployed women, on the assumption that they will resume their ânormal roleâ as housewives.
This not only prevents Turkey from serving as an example, but also presents a distorted image of it, and this is something to which closer consideration needs to be given in view of the accession negotiations.
Â Â  .â Addition, as last paragraph to the oral explanation of vote already made by Ms Kratsa after the votes of the 06/07/05:
.âWe New Democracy MEPs voted against paragraph 4, which commends the Turkish Government on recent legal changes which make honour killings punishable by lifelong imprisonment and allow for the punishment of accomplices and accessories to honour killings.
This paragraph does not reflect the situation on the ground because, unfortunately, honour killings are still not expressly provided for in the new criminal code, while lifelong imprisonment may be reduced to 12 to 24 years (Article 29 of the criminal code).
Our objective is to encourage Turkey to develop its legislation and attitudes in accordance with the and to point out the omissions which exist today and the obligations created on the path towards democracy.
We await new legislative arrangements and political practices from Turkey to protect women's rights and wipe out all forms of discrimination at legislative, social, political and economic level.
Â Â  . I agree with the general approach of Rapporteur Dimitrakopoulos on EU-Iraq relations which contains a serious and realistic assessment of the present situation in Iraq, including a great concern over the deteriorating security.
The Report also incorporates key PES demands for the EU and its Member States to promote a new UN Security Council Resolution on Iraq which would lead to a decision on "substitution of foreign troops in Iraq by a UN peace-keeping force", the withdrawal "to be progressively implemented following a clear timetable."
I consider that Amendments 10, 11, 12, and 13 are vital to a balanced and acceptable way forward.
Â Â  The UN has an important role in the reconstruction of Iraq and in ensuring that democratic institutions are set up.
We support those parts of the report that emphasise the UNâs role in constructing a democratic and stable Iraq.
At the same time, the report is clearly aimed at strengthening the EUâs foreign and security policy mandate.
A strengthening of the EU within this area would be in danger of weakening the UN.
We therefore choose to vote against the report as a whole.
Â Â  . This report draws a veil of silence over the scandalous attack on Iraq by the USA and its allies, the 100Â 000-plus dead and the murder, oppression and torture carried out by the invading troops.
This is a report that seeks to expunge the âpastâ (which is after all the brutal present); a report that calls for âmore multilateralâ âconflict managementâ, by which it means the invasion; a report that equates the Iraqi peopleâs legitimate resistance with âterrorismâ; a report that glosses over the torture carried out by the USA, calling it âviolations of rightsâ; a report that hypocritically, calls on Iraqâs neighbours not to interfere in the countryâs affairs, without a single word of condemnation of the USAâs invasion and occupation; a report that seeks to share that occupation and plunder with the USA, under the UN umbrella; a report that, in an appalling act of meddling, advocates implanting capitalism, its instruments and its policies.
In other words, for the dominant players in Parliament, any misunderstandings that may have taken place between the EU and the USA must be overcome.
This is indicative of the trend for compromise, with a view to satisfying the interests of big business, and for retreat, in the face of the USAâs hegemonic intentions, whereby the UN is manipulated and reduced to a supporting role.
Hence our vote against.
Â Â  . I support the rapporteur's efforts to move the debate on Iraq away from the rights and wrongs of the war and the pre-war situation in the Country, onto an analysis of the present situation and the future of Iraq.
The report clearly condemns all forms of terrorism and acts of violence.
I welcome its references to the need for respect of international legality and for relevant international covenants of human rights, the respect of women's rights and all minorities in the Country and the condemnation of the violations of prisoner's rights in Abu Grahib prison
The report suggests a series of workable measures for the humanitarian, social and economic rehabilitation of the Country.
Â Â  . By legitimising the war of aggression against Iraq, the resolution submitted to this House for a decision on âthe EUâs increasing involvement in Iraqâ takes us in quite the wrong direction.
By expressing âthe need to move on from past eventsâ, it dismisses at the very outset the fact that no weapons of mass destruction were found in Iraq, with the evident intention that the waging of a war of aggression against Iraq by the USA and its allies should be forgotten.
While the resolution calls for âsupport for the active work of the European Union with the Iraqi authorities in the fight against terrorismâ, it does so without a single reference to what the causes of terrorism might be.
Although the EU is meant to be making even more funding available in the future, the fact is that the funds already provided are being administered in part by the World Bank Trust rather than entirely by the United Nations; moreover, it is also the case that the World Bank Trust has so far made actual use of only a fraction of the funds at its disposal, and the Iraqi authorities have simply failed to produce any transparent account of what has been done with them, thus making it impossible to ascertain where European taxpayersâ money is going.
All this adds up to no kind of guarantee that Iraq will be reconstructed along democratic lines.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of the final version of this report because it was improved substantially by the amendments made to it.
This is not the time for reopening the debate on military intervention in Iraq, an issue on which I have spoken before.
The important matter for debate now is what role the EU should have at this stage of Iraqâs political life.
As I see it, the EU must act in conjunction with its traditional allies and with the Iraqi authorities, bearing in mind the extraordinary courage shown by the Iraqi people, who responded positively to the call to the ballot box despite the terrible threats issued by the terrorists who continue to operate over part of Iraqi territory.
I also feel that this cooperation must, of course, fall under United Nations policy on Iraq.
In conclusion I believe that the EU must cooperate unreservedly with the legitimate Iraqi authorities, and must condemn unequivocally those who continue to destabilise the country by force.
We had our differences of opinion on military intervention, but we must show a united front in support of the Iraqi people currently suffering at the hands of terrorist groups.
Â Â  . To be consistent with previous votes on Iraq, I have abstained on the whole report and all amendments.
This report is badly drafted and detracts from the main issue before the House today which is 'Making Poverty History'.
Â Â  .â The report on Iraq expresses the EU's efforts to create preconditions so that it will have a larger portion when the area is shared out.
Since the summit in Athens in 2004 and in its subsequent resolutions and decisions, the ÎU has already legalised the imperialist war against Iraq and recognised the occupying government, demonstrating that it and the USA have a single imperialist policy against the peoples.
This is also expressed in the approval by the ÎU of the US-ÎÎÎ€Î plan for the Middle East as a whole, which endeavours to control the wealth-producing resources and the countries of the area in order to safeguard the interests of the multinationals, big business and imperialist sovereignty.
At the same time, antagonism between the imperialists is increasing in their bid to safeguard a bigger share of the spoils.
There can be no solution for the benefit of the Iraqi people as long as there is foreign intervention and occupation by the US and European military.
We voted against the report, calling for the immediate withdrawal of the occupying forces as the precondition to the finding of a solution by the people of Iraq, who alone are responsible for determining their future.
Iraq should be paid compensation for the damage which it has suffered and the US and its allies who unleashed the unjust, imperialist war should pay.
The right of the peoples to determine their future is non-negotiable.
Â Â  . I fully support this Joint motion.
It is totally unacceptable that extreme poverty affects over one billion people, and that in sub-Saharan Africa about 300 million people live in absolute poverty and millions of people die each year from a lack of health care, clean water, decent housing and adequate nutrition.
There is an opportunity for the EU and its Member States to demonstrate leadership on poverty and fair trade at the G8 Summit in Gleneagles, at the MDGs Conference in New York in September and at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) Ministerial Conference in Hong Kong in December.
Attaining the MDGs and combating global poverty will require all donors to increase the quantity and improve the quality of aid, make trade fairer and abolish unsustainable debt.
Â Â  I spoke in our plenary meeting in Luxembourg all those years ago in support of the first Live Aid event.
Today we have just seen the enormous upwelling of support again following Live 8 for Making Poverty History.
Yet politicians have failed to deliver, with almost a billion people in the world living on less than one euro a day.
Words are not enough; we need action.
The Globalisation Intergroup in Parliament, which I chair, has over 100 members.
We commit ourselves to pursuing fair trade and further aid here in Parliament. This will require enormous resources.
We believe one source will be through promoting a capital transfer tax.
France and Belgium have already passed the necessary legislation and Italy is considering the same.
I call on all other Member States to look urgently to emulating them and, in doing so, to raise enough funds to provide basic housing, healthcare, sanitation and education for all those living on less than one euro a day.
Â Â  We wholeheartedly support the fight against global poverty.
We believe that the EU can make a valuable contribution to this very important struggle by campaigning for radical reform of the EUâs protectionist trade policy, phasing out the EUâs destructive fisheries agreements with third countries and ceasing to pay export subsidies to European manufacturers of products such as, for example, milk and sugar.
However, the resolution contains extremely limited wordings when it comes to urgent reforms of this kind.
Our view is that the EU should not concern itself with aid issues.
Instead, significant issues of this kind should be dealt with by the respective Member States.
International aid efforts should be coordinated by organisations that have long experience and wide-ranging legitimacy, such as the UN and UN bodies.
Â Â  . I warmly welcome this resolution as a further step towards the realisation of the Millennium Development Goals, especially with regard to the G8 Summit currently being held in Gleneagles and the UK Presidency of the EU.
I particularly support the resolution's call on the UK to use its Presidency of the G8 to put poverty at the heart of the international as well as the European agenda, and for Member States to underline their commitment to the eradication of poverty by seizing the opportunities offered in the coming months.
Whilst focus on development policy must remain a key feature of the European Union after 2005, I strongly believe we must also be careful to maintain a balanced approach to the eradication of poverty, using Trade as central tool.
Â Â  . âFighting poverty in Europe: last week, in Paris, the elections were deferred at short notice, and hundreds of thousands of people protested, facing violence at the hands of police units.
Many of them were killed.
Almost unanimously, the European Parliament denounced the security forcesâ action and promptly appointed a committee of enquiry to determine whether any of the demonstrators had been killed by units trained by the EU.
At the same time, it passed a resolution to the effect that all EU military advisors should be recalled from France at once.â
This is a true story â apart from a few details.
On 30 June, in the Congolese capital, Kinshasa, people who had responded to opposition partiesâ calls for peaceful demonstrations against the deferment of elections were attacked by soldiers and police.
According to agency reports, several of them were killed, and a state of emergency declared.
The European Union, in the shape of âEUPOL Kinshasaâ, is currently in Congo training police units, some of which are deployed in Kinshasa.
EU military advisors (EUSEC D.R. Congo) have also been working âin the Defence Ministerâs officeâ and âwith the General Staffâ since 8 June this year.
This House did not, of course, hold a special sitting to debate these things, any more than it appointed a committee of enquiry to find out whether police units that the EU had trained had had any hand in the killings.
The EUâs military advisors continue to function at the highest levels in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
Â Â  . It is our duty and in our interest to promote better living conditions throughout the world.
A noteworthy series of initiatives to fight poverty was put in place a number of years ago, but it did not even fulfil the lowest of expectations, let alone produce the results that one would have wished to see.
There are countries and regions in the world where that fight has borne some fruit, not because poverty has been eliminated â far from it â but because it has emerged that they are moving in the right direction, and this is true of parts of Asia and Latin America.
Unfortunately, this is the exception rather than the rule in Africa, where we must redouble our efforts, but where those efforts must be reciprocated locally.
It is impossible to help those who do not allow their people to be helped, those who harm their people, those who foment the causes of poverty, not least corruption.
I therefore feel that EU-backed initiatives must attach the fight against poverty to the fight to create conditions for local development, by promoting democracy, freedom, human rights and a market economy.
Handing out money â or writing off debts â does not go far enough, and nor is it always the right way forward.
We must do and achieve more and, above all, better.
Â Â  . The 'Make Poverty History' campaign has placed the plight of the world's poorest at centre stage.
There is an opportunity, as the G8 begins its deliberations today in Scotland, to make real progress on Africa and climate change.
I hope the leaders will grasp this 'thistle' and make a real difference to those most in need.
Â Â  The June List supports the Swedish Governmentâs demand that cohesion aid be reduced from the proposed EURÂ 336.1Â billion to not quite EURÂ 200Â billion in the financial perspectives for 2007-2013.
The reports should be about the most suitable ways of reducing expenditure so as to come closer to meeting the G6 countriesâ demand for a budget not exceeding 1.00% of the Member Statesâ gross national income.
The basis for any cohesion policy must be that aid needs to go to the very poorest countries.
At present, far too much money goes to poor regions in relatively rich countries.
The current system is not only unjust towards the poorest countries.
The system may also appear cynical because rich countries are not themselves permitted to help less well-placed regions in the same way as they could if the larger part of cohesion policy were re-nationalised.
Â Â  Â The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the Balkans 10Â years after Srebrenica.
Â Â  . Mr President, I am delighted to be here at the European Parliament at the start of the British Presidency of the European Union.
The next six months will be a critical time for many of the western Balkan states.
As Minister for Europe, I am looking forward to pursuing the inherited agenda and working to help the countries of the region move further along the road to Europe.
Next week â as recognised by the title of this debate â marks the tenth anniversary of the massacre at Srebrenica in July 1995.
Seven to eight thousand Muslim men and women were killed in cold blood in the worst act of genocide in Europe since 1945.
We recognise that the international community failed to realise what was happening until it was too late and failed in its duty to protect innocent civilians, unarmed men, women and children.
However, whatever the sins of omission of the international community, which we deeply regret at this time of sadness and remembrance, let us not forget the sins of commission by the attacking Bosnian Serb forces.
The ultimate responsibility lies with those who murdered, raped and tortured in cold blood.
As we all know, some have already been tried and found guilty of their part in these atrocities, others have been acquitted.
But those held most responsible â Ratko Mladic and Radovan Karadzic â are still at large as fugitives from justice.
Ten years on from this terrible event, it is surely time for the authorities in the region â in Serbia and Montenegro, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and in Croatia â to grasp the nettle and meet their international obligations to cooperate fully with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.
But it is also time for them to honour their obligations to people to remove the outstanding obstacles to them taking their rightful place within the European family of nations.
I call upon all those in a position to make a difference to work together to remove this poison from the body politic, and to hand over all outstanding fugitives indicted for war crimes so that they may face justice in The Hague.
It is also a privilege, in taking over the European Union Presidency at this time, to be faced with so much hope and, indeed, opportunity.
Croatia is on the cusp of opening accession negotiations to become a full member of the European Union, only ten years after the end of the war in 1995.
As the European Council has made clear on a number of occasions, it is Zagrebâs responsibility to remove the one outstanding obstacle to these negotiations: the continuing failure to cooperate fully with the International Criminal Tribunal in The Hague.
As the European Union Presidency, we stand ready to open negotiations as soon as the Council is satisfied that this obligation has been met.
Clearly, the easiest way to overcome this obstacle would be to arrest and hand over the fugitive Ante Gotovina.
It would be a sign of our commitment to all the western Balkan countries and to the Thessaloniki commitments that they are all prospective candidates if we were able to open accession negotiations during our Presidency.
But the ball lies firmly in Zagrebâs court.
The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has also made much progress since the outbreak of ethnic conflict in 2001.
Whilst there is still work to do to implement fully the terms of the Ohrid Framework Agreement, later this year the Commission will publish its opinion on the Republicâs application to join the European Union submitted last year.
As with any other applicant, full compliance with the Copenhagen criteria is a precondition.
We look forward to assisting the authorities in Skopje in making further progress on the terms of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, especially in targeting corruption and organised crime and implementing economic and judicial reform.
The timing of opening negotiations will depend on the authoritiesâ commitment to tackling these issues in deed as well as in word.
In Albania, it would appear that the recent elections passed in a generally peaceful manner.
While the count continues, we urge all political forces to respect the due electoral process and resist premature judgements on the outcome.
Nevertheless, we hope that a new government can be formed as soon as possible to ensure that Albania can continue her progress towards a stabilisation and association agreement.
In this respect, the new government will need to tackle the endemic problems of corruption and organised crime and implement judicial reform if it is to fulfil its European aspirations which we fully support.
One of the greatest challenges we face, of course, is Kosovo.
The time is fast approaching when we should address the difficult and sensitive issue of Kosovoâs final status.
Any outcome must work for all of Kosovoâs communities and reinforce regional stability.
That is why the contact group and the European Union have both ruled out any return to the ante-1999 or any internal partition of Kosovo.
Neither would serve the interests of the people of Kosovo or the region.
As for independence, that is clearly one option.
But I would remind those who advocate independence that they must convince all communities and the world at large that independence can work and that the rights of Kosovoâs minorities as well as those who have yet to return to Kosovo after the violence of 1999 will be fully respected.
If the people of Kosovo wish to join the European mainstream, they must learn to live together as equals, respecting their differences.
The current comprehensive review of standards is therefore a critical challenge.
How positive the review will be depends on progress on the ground.
Its outcome is not a foregone conclusion.
I recognise that there has been real progress with standards implementation, but more needs to be done.
A failure to demonstrate commitment for further work in key areas would not bode well for a positive outcome to the comprehensive review.
The future is therefore in the hands of the Kosovo authorities in Pristina.
In the meantime, the European Union has an important role to play in supporting further progress, in particular in the area of economic development.
Serbia and Montenegro have clearly made great strides in the last six months.
In April, the European Commission concluded a positive feasibility study recommending that the European Union open negotiations with Serbia and Montenegro on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement.
The Council of Ministers has accepted this recommendation and invited the Commission to prepare a negotiating mandate.
This is an important step for Serbia and Montenegroâs progress towards European Union integration.
By 5 October, which marks the fifth anniversary of the democratic changes in Belgrade, or by the tenth anniversary of the Dayton-Paris Accords in November at the latest, we would like Serbia and Montenegro to have begun negotiations for a stabilisation and association agreement.
But cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal must continue to improve and in this respect Mladic and Karadzic are key, all the more so in light of the anniversary of the Srebrenica massacre, which we will commemorate next week.
I would also like to underline the importance of dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina in the interests of all the people of Kosovo.
Only through participation in the democratic institutions of government can Kosovar Serbs ensure that their concerns are taken into account.
We have welcomed Belgradeâs decision to encourage the Kosovar Serbs to participate in the decentralisation working groups and look to Belgrade to carry this through.
Bosnia and Herzegovina have also recently made important progress towards the opening of negotiations on a stabilisation and association agreement with the European Union.
This prize is within Bosnia and Herzegovinaâs grasp but will remain out of reach until it has met the relevant conditions, which include agreeing on police restructuring, reforming public broadcasting and demonstrating full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.
We would like Bosnia and Herzegovina to open SAA negotiations under our Presidency by the tenth anniversary of the Dayton-Paris Peace Agreement, but that requires further progress by the Bosnian authorities to meet the feasibility study priorities.
I have attempted today to summarise the present situation regarding our priorities for the Western Balkan countries over the next six months.
There are certainly big challenges ahead, but let me end on a note of optimism.
In the last ten years so much has changed for the better: free and fair elections have been held throughout the region; changes of government via the ballot box are routine; large-scale conflict no longer threatens; countries of the region work together to improve the lives of their citizens.
The European Union and other international partners are united in working with the region to maintain stability and create prosperity.
The dark days of the early 1990s seem predominantly to be a distant memory.
But as we move further down the road to closer integration between the western Balkan countries and the European Union, it is up to the countries concerned to make their cases irrefutable.
We understand that the European Unionâs commitment to the regions has to be honoured and we undertake to do so.
But during this time of introspection within the European Union and of uncertainty about its future shape and direction, it is all the more important that the countries of the region fulfil their own commitments, not in the interests of the European Union â although that is important â but for the sake of their people who for far too long suffered at the hands of those who claimed to represent their interests but who in fact only fomented hostility and strife.
Â Â  Thank you, Minister.
I should like to congratulate you on winning the contest for hosting the Olympic Games.
I hope â and I am sure everybody here feels the same â that it will be not only a world event, a British event, but also a European event.
Â Â  . Mr President, almost 10 years ago to the day, on 11 July 1995, Srebrenica fell.
No-one should ever forget the horrors that unfolded during the following days and weeks.
We have a duty to remember so that we will see no other Srebrenicas; so that ethnic hatred and destructive nationalism will be definitively buried in Bosnia and Herzegovina, in the Balkans and in the whole of Europe.
I shall go to the commemoration ceremony in Srebrenica next week to honour the victims and their families.
I shall go there to express Europeâs support for peace, reconciliation and democratic development and for the European future of the Western Balkans.
I also expect all the parties to ensure that the ceremony will be a dignified event and will contribute to the reconciliation process.
Reconciliation is a very painful process after a devastating war like this, after violations of the most fundamental human rights, but it is also a necessary process.
The European Union, as the greatest peace and reconciliation project, can testify to that and serve as an example of what can be achieved, including in the Balkans.
Justice is an essential element of reconciliation.
There can be no reconciliation until war crime suspects are held accountable in a court of law.
In this respect, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, the ICTY, plays a crucial role.
The countriesâ cooperation with the ICTY has steadily improved, which is an encouraging sign, but more remains to be done to achieve full cooperation.
Only then can this very sad chapter in the regionâs history be truly closed.
The people carrying the main responsibility for the Srebrenica massacre are still at large.
This is unacceptable.
MladiÄ and KaradÅŸiÄ should have no place in the region.
Their place is in The Hague.
The European Union has major responsibilities in ensuring peace and stability and enhancing democracy and prosperity on our continent.
This is what the European Union is all about.
As Mr Alexander stated regarding the EUâs policy in the Western Balkans on behalf of the Presidency, the inclusion of our Balkan neighbours in the European integration process has been a powerful incentive for enhancing stability, human rights, the rights of minorities and the rule of law in the region.
This is no small achievement, and we must make this perspective firm and tangible and thus ensure steady progress towards the respect of European values.
An important and intensive period for the Balkans lies ahead of us.
The Kosovo standards review is a work in progress and the status talks are likely to start in the autumn.
The prompt resolution of this issue is very important for the stability and progress of the whole region.
We are about to open negotiations on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Serbia and Montenegro.
The Commission is ready to contribute to the timeline Mr Alexander presented, i.e. this autumn, to get the negotiations started.
We also aim to start negotiations with Bosnia and Herzegovina soon, as long as the country fulfils the remaining criteria.
When we have fully examined the conduct of last Sundayâs elections in Albania, we can determine the future pace in the negotiations on a Stablisation and Association Agreement with Albania as well.
The Commissionâs opinion on the membership application of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is under preparation.
We are also looking forward to opening accession negotiations with Croatia, as soon as the one remaining condition is satisfied.
We are all aware of the serious problems that we are presently facing in the European Union.
It is only natural that enlargement policy will be a part of the broader debate on the future of Europe.
I was therefore satisfied that the June European Council very clearly confirmed the Unionâs existing commitments on enlargement policy and on the European perspective of the Western Balkans.
This was very wise.
Our enlargement policy has helped transform countries in regions that are still very fragile.
We shall continue to help them to become stable, democratic and prosperous societies able to join the Union.
The building of a better future for the Western Balkans is indeed the best way to commemorate the victims of Srebrenica.
It serves the cause of peace, stability and prosperity in Europe, and our own vital interests.
I am looking forward to continuing to work closely with European Parliament and its relevant committees to this end.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, after 1945, the promise was made that there would be no more mass murder, Srebrenica is a byword for its having been broken.
Ten years on from Srebrenica, the Western governments have to ask themselves why they did not intervene in good time to prevent expulsions, murder and war.
At the beginning of the 1990s, they looked the other way and let MiloÅ¡eviÄ, KaradÅŸiÄ and MladiÄ have a free hand to expel people from their homes, to rape them and, eventually to put them to a gruesome death, which is what happened at Srebrenica, where, in a cowardly manner, Serbian criminals slaughtered thousands of Muslims before the eyes of UN troops acting under an inadequate mandate.
As we commemorate this massacre today, we call on everyone to endeavour to get KaradÅŸiÄ and MladiÄ, who bear responsibility for it and are now on the run like the cowards they are, handed over to the Tribunal.
There is no hope of reconciliation in Bosnia and Herzegovina if they are not.
Good though it is that high-ranking Serb politicians will be attending the commemorations at Srebrenica, they should also prevent certain Serbian politicians from naming in the same breath the Serb victims of the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the victims of Srebrenica, as if they were talking about one and the same thing.
The failure of the Serbian parliament and of the parliament of Republika Srpska to condemn these massacres testifies to their lack of either maturity or penitence.
How are the Serbs to show either if those who represent them do not first give a good example?
Today is an opportunity to remind the Serbs in particular that reconciliation is possible only when one acknowledges oneâs own guilt, and, as a German, I know what I am talking about.
It took a relatively short time after the war for our relations with the rest of the world to be restored, and that was because we admitted our responsibility for the heinous crimes committed in Germanyâs name.
By no means are all Serbs guilty today, any more than all Germans were guilty then, and so those holding political power or religious authority, and the media, should do everything in their power to make reconciliation possible.
At the same time, though, the EU must neither stint in its efforts nor shirk its responsibility in helping the countries in the region to put their tragic past behind them and set their sights on a better future.
The young people in the region have gained the right not to be left high and dry by us, but it is their politicians, their parents and grandparents upon whom the obligation rests of preparing for the day when they will be able to name the events at Srebrenica as the crimes they were and to reach out the hand of reconciliation.
Â Â  . Mr President, it is with embarrassment, indeed with shame, that we commemorate the victims of the massacre at Srebrenica.
Many of those who carried it out have not yet been arrested, but we too, as representatives of the people of Europe, cannot fail to be aware of our share in the blame for the tragic events in the Balkans, and to face up to the consequences, and it is not only the victims and their families who have the right to hear us acknowledge our guilt and express our regret.
It is also for the sake of Europeâs future, for the sake of the regionâs future, for the sake of Serbiaâs future, that there must be an acknowledgement of oneâs own guilt, an acknowledgement without which forgiveness and reconciliation will be impossible.
Acknowledgement and sorrow are needed, not in order to humiliate Serbia, in order that the Serbs as a whole might be condemned, and not in order to excuse the misdeeds and crimes of other peoples, but we do expect them.
We must be clear in our minds about the fact that contemplation of the past helps to build a better future.
It is now for Europe to give this region a clear vision of what the future can be like.
History shows us how the countries of the Balkans were for too long at the mercy of the interests and schemes of the great European powers, as well as of Turkey, which you may or may not, depending on your point of view, regard as having been one of them.
What I say now I say not only as rapporteur for Croatia, but also as one who is committed to the region as a whole: we have to give them a chance to put their own house in order, to show that they have learned their lessons from history, that they take human rights â and the rights of minorities in particular â seriously.
As Mr Alexander and Commissioner Rehn have described to the House the various processes by which it is intended that these countries should be brought closer to the European Union, I would like to make it abundantly clear that the object must be to give them the chance to accede to it as Member States.
It may well be the case that other sentiments prevail today, and people fight shy of enlargement, but we, in Europe, must be clear in our own minds about the need to prepare ourselves for an enlargement along these lines.
Nor must we lose sight of the fact that these countries are themselves under an obligation to do their homework and do their bit in making their accession possible.
Many of their young people, though, look to Europe as their ideal, and it is for their sake that, as Mrs Pack has just said, we must hold out to them the prospect of one day, when the time is ripe and they have overcome their own problems, being in a position to become Member States of the European Union.
Whatever our criticisms of the way in which the European Union is developing, we have to concede that, for many people in the Balkans, the great hope is that they will one day belong to the European Union and be part of one single Europe, and we must give them the chance to do that.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, next Monday, it will be ten years ago since Srebrenica was captured by Bosnian Serb troops under the UN troopsâ noses, that the slaughter of more than 80Â 000 Muslim men and boys began, that thousands of women, children and elderly were deported and hundreds of women were raped.
Immense misery was inflicted and still persists to this day, while those responsible are still at large, because not all victims have been recovered, many of the deportees were not allowed to return home and, above all, because the misery inflicted is not recognised by many Serbs. This was only recently evident when the Serb parliament rejected a resolution in which the slaughter in Srebrenica was acknowledged and condemned.
From our own experience, we know that post-war reconciliation is possible only when those who were formerly on opposite sides manage to agree on the history of the events, to ask for forgiveness for the misery inflicted and to bring to justice those responsible for the genocide and crimes against humanity.
The tragedy has also painfully exposed the shortcomings of the EUâs foreign and security policy at that time, as well as those of UN peacemaking and peacekeeping policy.
Some of these have since been rectified, but unity of foreign and security policy is still not guaranteed, mainly because of a less than total willingness on the part of the EU governments.
The European Union and its Member States did manage, though, to stabilise and improve the situation in the Western Balkans both under their own steam and with NATO backing.
These efforts must be continued and the prospect of accession to the European Union must be kept open.
That will only be possible, though, when all authorities in the region fully cooperate with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and bring those responsible before this tribunal.
Â Â  MrÂ President, some people of our generation find it difficult to talk about Srebrenica, because it is true that we have always asked ourselves what we would have done when, for example, the fascists came to power in Germany.
For a long time, we in Europe have been onlookers:Â the British, by tradition, tended to be pro-Serb, as did the French; the Germans were for Croatia and the Bosniaks had nobody.
For years, we left the Bosniaks alone.
It was following the tragedy in Srebrenica that we understood the necessity for a European position, in other words a position that could not be either British, German or French, but that had to be a common position.
Today, when we discuss the Srebrenica massacre, we must question the behaviour of Europeans, question the behaviour not of the Dutch soldiers who were in Srebrenica but of the UN itself, because, while the UNâs mandate in Srebrenica authorised the 50Â 000 soldiers posted to Bosnia to do everything, to control the traffic and so on, it did not authorise them to protect the population.
As Europeans, we must examine that, and consider what we did.
MrsÂ Pack was right to bring up the role of governments: her government, at the time headed by MrÂ Kohl, closed its eyes just like the socialist government in France.
That was also the reality of the time.
Today, the European Union provides political stability.
The Dayton Agreements provided stability, but nobody here is talking about the problems posed by the Dayton Agreements.
Those agreements, which were necessary at the time, contain an ethnic definition of the region, an ethnic definition that is included in the Bosnian constitution.
The tragedy in Srebrenica cannot be overcome unless we address the problem of the Dayton Agreements, unless we address the problem of the ethnic definition of the region, because it is that ethnic definition that is now preventing not only the Serbs but also the Croats and Bosniaks from admitting their crimes.
That is why we are calling on you, MrÂ President, MrÂ Alexander and the Commission, to launch a European initiative to re-open the debate on the Dayton Agreements.
Ten years on, we need to re-examine what was decided.
The Bosnian constitution is an ethnic constitution that will not allow Bosnia to join the European Union.
In conclusion, if we do not have the courage to challenge the Dayton Agreements, we will never learn the lessons of Srebrenica.
Â Â  . Mr President, ten years ago, the presence of the Dutch armed forces gave the people of Srebrenica a false sense of security.
This place that was proclaimed a safe haven was an indefensible island in the middle of the much bigger Serbian Republic, which was, and still is, considered a safe haven by another section of the population.
By completely misjudging the situation, action was not taken in time to prevent the inevitable surrender from culminating in retaliation and even mass murder.
My group takes the view that the ultimate outcome would not have been much different had there been an EU centralised common foreign policy or a mandate that authorised Dutchbat to use more force and ensured support in the form of aerial bombardments.
If you want to guarantee the peaceful coexistence of the three nations in Bosnia, you have to look for solutions that are backed by all parties and not just by one or two that enjoy our favour.
Only a federative model that recognises diversity, along the lines of Belgium and Switzerland, can do justice to everyone.
We have to take as our starting point the reality that the North and East are very much oriented towards Serbia, and the South West towards Croatia, and that it is in those areas that most of the people live.
That is why Bosnia and Herzegovina need open borders with the neighbouring countries.
Any attempt to create a centralised, united state can only result in a permanent battle for power between the different sections of the population.
No one group should be able to dominate another; that is the lesson we should have learned from Srebrenica and from the chaotic implementation of the Dayton Peace Agreement.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, todayâs debate on the future of the Balkans is being held on the 10th anniversary of the crime which was committed in Srebrenica, and which was the worst in Europe since the end of the Second World War.
There can be absolutely no doubt that part of the reason for the wars and massacres in the Balkans was the lack of action by the European Union and NATO in this region.
The EU institutions acted like Pontius Pilate, who simply washed his hands of responsibility.
I am delighted that things are changing in this respect, and that in 18Â monthsâ time Bulgaria and Romania will join the EU.
It is also to be welcomed that EU military and political forces are working to stabilise the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and indeed I had an opportunity to see this for myself in April of this year.
Yesterday I returned from an observation mission to the parliamentary elections in Albania, and it has to be said that these elections were a step in the right direction.
They were more democratic than previous elections in the country, and we should acknowledge this progress.
Question marks remain, of course, and there are still a great many questions left unanswered.
Among other things, they relate to the future of âSolaniaâ, the state named after MrÂ Solana, and that of Serbia and Montenegro, given that Montenegro wishes to be an independent state.
One thing is certain, however, namely that the EU still holds an attraction for these countries, despite the crisis in which it finds itself.
It has gone out of fashion to talk about EU enlargement, but it should be stated quite clearly that EU accession for a number of Balkan states would be a very good idea.
This is the only means whereby economic and political stability can be achieved in this region, and such stability will benefit the EU in the future.
I should like to conclude by saying that putting fires out in the Balkans costs more than preventing them in the first place.
Â Â  â Mr President, I agree absolutely with my honourable friend, Mrs Doris Î¡ack, that Srebrenica should be a permanent living memory.
The tragedy, which claimed thousands of lives, marks and imposes the end of a chapter and the final move from the tragic past in the area to a new era of peace, security and prosperity.
It marks and imposes the overcoming of ethnic standards and historical and cultural bondage through dialogue and assent.
The European Union failed to act as a reliable power for the production and export of security to its neighbours.
If the reason was the immaturity of the European political system, then the message is the need to arm the European Union with the qualities of a single and genuine political identity.
The Western Balkans continue to lag well behind in terms of economic development and regional integration.
No one doubts the efforts of the European Union.
However, the approach of each Balkan country separately, on its own, has proven to be inadequate.
In my opinion, an advanced and cohesive strategic plan is needed for the area, a single contractual framework for a privileged partnership between the ÎU and the Western Balkans.
I am talking, Commissioner, about a plan which will articulate the development priorities of each country in a single regional entity.
The programmes under which the European Union intervenes must be of a cross-border, cross-regional character.
This will help regional economic integration and the construction of a climate of political collectiveness, cooperation and trust.
The immediate challenge for relations between the European Union and the Western Balkans can be reduced to the following triptych: articulated political dialogue, cross-border infrastructure networks and the opening of the markets.
I wish the British Presidency good luck.
Â Â  Mr President, our primary concern today is, of course, to remember the most horrifying event from recent European history, namely the murder of thousands of men from the Muslim enclave of Srebrenica in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1995.
The story of Srebrenica has had an enormous impact in Europe and the rest of the world, but particularly in my country, the Netherlands, for it was Dutch wearers of the UNâs blue helmets who, at that time, appeared incapable of offering citizens, inhabitants and refugees the protection they needed.
Ten years on, this debacle is still a subject for debate in the Netherlands.
The sense of horror and sympathy for the victims of this mass killing and their surviving relatives is great.
Our thoughts are mainly with those who cannot live with the fact that those responsible for this crime, the then Bosnian President KaradÅŸic and General Mladic, are still at large.
Remembering should, though, go beyond sympathy with the victims.
We must learn from the lessons and try to move on.
First of all, to the countries of the Balkans, whom we must support if they are to be able to come to terms with the experiences of the wars they have lived through, we make our pledge: âNever againâ.
While remembering the past, though, we must above all look to the future.
The support given by the EU needs to be within a clear framework, with an important role played by the prospect of integration into the EU, which the Council has held out.
Support from the EU will help bring about peaceful, stable and prosperous societies.
Let there be no doubt, though, that the responsibility for the future rests, in the first place, on the countries of the Balkans themselves.
There is now, fortunately, peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina, but they have not fully come to terms with the past, and that is forming an obstacle to the functioning of the state and society, and so important decisions on such matters as the return of refugees and the arrest of those suspected of war crimes are not being taken.
I believe that coming to terms with the past is as important as working towards the future.
A second lesson is broader, and that is the lesson that has been hotly debated in the Netherlands.
âNever again, not in Europe, but, above all, not anywhere else in the worldâ means that vigilance is called for to prevent dormant conflicts from escalating into bloody and hopeless situations.
We must be more alert and act more rapidly, and where necessary, take a tougher line, when what happened at Srebrenica threatens to repeat itself, in order to prevent European troops from ever finding again themselves in the same situation as Dutchbat ten years ago.
Â Â  Mr President, representatives of the Council and the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, in the 59 seconds available to me I would simply like to point out a small detail.
There is something that you should be ashamed of, although you do not realise it.
Yesterday evening in this Parliament a commemoration was held and next week ceremonies are planned in Srebrenica.
Among the many embarrassments that have been got rid of there is one in particular, called Emma Bonino.
Emma Bonino has been got rid of: she does not exist any more, she is not invited.
I understand the reason behind this, because Emma Bonino, when she was in Srebrenica in her role as European Commissioner, tried desperately to warn the Dutch Government, which did not listen to her, and we are well aware of the consequences.
Yes, Emma Bonino was there, as Reuters can bear witness.
All the recordings have been found.
At the time of the tragedy Emma Bonino got through twice to Radio Radicale, and also to the BBC, to say that thousands of people were missing.
Mr Morillon, we will be able to speak again about the issue of responsibility, and of all the initiatives, on another occasion.
Mr President, thank you, my time is up.We shall see whether it will be possible to commemorate Srebrenica in another way, by giving it, at the least, the tribute of truth and an acknowledgement of the cowardice of Europe and the UN.
Â Â  Mr President, in this debate and at this time, a great deal of attention is being paid to the past, and rightly so.
How was it possible for what happened in Srebrenica to occur and what are the lessons we should draw from it?
Srebrenica not only has a painful past, it also has a painful present.
There are people from Srebrenica who are languishing in refugee camps, still unable to return home.
Children are given a totally one-sided view of the events ten years ago, as a result of which a necessary conciliation is not forthcoming.
The identification of victims is desperately needed if those left behind are to begin to accept their loved onesâ terrible fate, but because identification is expensive, it takes far too long.
What we now need is not just to consider what happened ten years ago, but also Srebrenica today, which will involve understanding it and, where necessary, providing funds to rescue it.
Fortunately, a second Srebrenica is not likely to happen in the Balkans today, but the wounds inflicted across the whole region then can be healed structurally only if the countries of the Balkans know themselves to be welcome in Europe.
I am therefore completely behind the Commissionâs position that stated that the countries of the Balkans still have the prospect of membership.
The Balkans are in Europe. So is Srebrenica.
Let us never forget that lesson.
Â Â  Â âÂ Â Peace will not be achieved in the Balkans until we stop applying different standards to the different communities.
Anyone who thinks that the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia applies the same standards to everyone is very much mistaken.
It is quite intolerable that the pilot of the plane that fired two missiles at a train travelling over a bridge, the second one of which hit a pillar and destroyed both the bridge and the train, has not yet been brought before the Tribunal.
There is no point pretending that you are unaware of these things, ladies and gentlemen.
How many Albanians or foreign Muslim mercenaries have been sentenced so far?
Some of these people are now ruling over Kosovo, and they have your backing.
Can you sleep soundly at night, ladies and gentlemen?
Are you quite happy to discuss such matters calmly in this Chamber?
As if that were not enough, you even want to endorse their split from Serbia.
You should be ashamed of yourselves.
ParagraphÂ 4 of the motion for a resolution quite rightly says that all those guilty of war crimes must be caught and brought before the Tribunal, and I believe that you are quite serious about this.
If that is the case, then you should monitor the work done by the Tribunal.
If you have even a shred of honour, then we should try to ensure that this issue appears on the agenda again in the near future.
If you believe that those in power are and will continue to be exempt from punishment, then you should say so quite clearly.
The public in the EU and in the rest of the world will doubtless react in such a way that makes it quite clear what they think about such hypocrisy.
The amputated heads and maimed bodies of the victims should not be forgotten, and both friends and enemies should be subject to the same justice.
Hundreds of thousands of refugees are still waiting to return home, for example to Slavonia and the border regions between Croatia and Bosnia.
Today the Czech people are commemorating the 490th anniversary of the burning at the stake of JanÂ Hus by the Catholic church.
He has not yet been rehabilitated.
Â Â  Mr President, we could talk for many an hour about the errors of the past, and, having done so in the places where they were made and also, in the past, in this House, I would rather concentrate on the errors of the present time.
Let me start with the statement by the President-in-Office of the Council to the effect that negotiations with Croatia, a country crucial to the stability of the region as a whole, could begin only as and when Mr Gotovina is extradited.
It is very interesting that, in saying that, you put yourself at odds with the Luxembourg Presidency, and are acting as if the United Kingdom were to be allowed to assume the Presidency of the Council only on condition that the Loch Ness Monster were caught first.
Nobody in this House has any idea where Mr Gotovina is.
If you have any knowledge of his whereabouts, then I would ask you to inform both this House and the Croatian Government.
We should be treating Croatia in the same way that you â wrongly â want to treat Turkey, which is to say that we should start negotiating with it, and it is only if full cooperation turns out to be lacking â and we have a committee to monitor whether that is the case â that we should abandon or suspend them.
The fact is, though, that Croatia is a Central European democracy with a stabilising influence on the whole region, and so a start should be made on the negotiations.
On Bosnia, to which I turn secondly, Mr Cohn-Bendit is absolutely right to say that the Dayton Agreement has failed.
What is needed is a Bosnia-Herzegovina made up of three people with equal rights and, above all, of free citizens.
Failing that, the structure will be a source of new dangers and grave conflicts.
Thirdly, there is Kosovo, which I visited only a few days ago, and where radical elements will gain in strength if we carry on letting President Rugova miss the mark with his policy of seeking peace.
In view of the bombings a few days ago, I appeal to the Council to tarry no longer and to move towards the inevitable, that being an independent Kosovo â subject to stringent conditions, planned for long-term existence, and monitored by the international community.
The fourth point I want to make has to do with minorities, about which we talk endlessly.
In Kosovoâs Assembly, minorities are guaranteed representation.
In Serbiaâs parliament, a new electoral law, introduced a few years ago, makes it impossible for any representative of a minority to have a seat.
What we need is uniform standards across the board, without which we will not be able to arrive at a credible policy.
Â Â  One of the major reasons and perhaps the key reason for the tragic war in the former Yugoslavia was the fact that the international community was neither consistent nor even-handed in its approach to solving the key question, that is, the right of people to self-determination.
At the moment there is peace in the region, but we are still some distance from the kind of progress that would bring about long-term prosperity.
It is right and proper that with this report and the action of the Commissioner we are sending a message to the region that it is welcome in the European Union, and it is also right that we are placing emphasis on economic progress, although it is as yet insufficient.
The European Union faces a task that in a certain way it faced before the tragic war took place, namely to have a consistent and even-handed view of the basic questions of status relating to the peoples and states in the region.
The Dayton Agreement cannot secure progress in Bosnia and Hercegovina because what that country needs is a modern constitution.
We must find a solution to the question of the independence of Kosovo and the rights of Serbs and Montenegrins to self-determination.
We cannot accept that the Macedonians do not merit the name they have given themselves.
These are all fundamental questions of status.
I would like to support the Commissioner in that the European Commission should be more active in this policy than it has been hitherto.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the resolution we shall vote on tomorrow is important, not only because it comes at a time when, ten years after the massacre, there are still people who do not believe that it happened, but also because neither the Serbian nor the Bosnian-Herzegovinan Parliament has been able to agree upon such a resolution.
The Serbian Members of the Bosnian Parliament could not accept either the wording of the resolution or the compromise proposals.
As recently as today, someone has placed an explosive charge by the monument erected in Srebrenica in memory of all the victims.
As someone born in Bosnia who experienced the war we are talking about today, I feel a responsibility to convey to you at least a few of the many feelings we were forced each day to deal with during the war.
The world was shocked by the video images shown recently in The Hague of young men being executed.
We lived those images.
I therefore want to describe to you what it is like to be on the other side.
I am now going to read out part of an accusedâs statement to the Hague Tribunal, written down by a journalist and writer who followed the proceedings.
âIn the corner of his eye, the accused saw a young boy get off the bus.
The boy may have been fifteen years old or perhaps younger.
He looked at the soldiers and then at the rows of dead bodies in the field.
His eyes widened as if he could scarcely believe what he was witnessing.
When the prisoners fell to their knees, just before the soldiers were ordered to shoot, the accused heard the boyâs voice: âMummyâ, he whispered; âMummyâ.
That day, the accused heard people pleading for their lives and grown men crying.
He heard them promise the soldiers money, cars and even houses.
That boy, however, called for his mum, as children do when they have had a horrible dream.â
If we are to have any chance at all of moving on after the Balkan wars, we must primarily ensure that everyone who is guilty of crimes is brought to justice: not only those who are accused before the Hague Tribunal but also those who are still free and who should be prosecuted before the national courts as soon as possible.
We owe that not only to those who were murdered but also to those who survived.
Â Â  â Mr President, in a few days' time, it will be ten years since the greatest barbarity to shake Europe since the end of the Second World War. I refer to Srebrenica.
This is one of the blackest pages in the history of European and European civilisation.
Today we have an obligation to strengthen the memory of history, we have an obligation to honour the innocent victims of the ethnic violence in Yugoslavia, the Muslims, Serbs and Croats, without selective sensibilities and without any philosophy when it comes to bloodshed.
Ten years later, Bosnia is still deeply divided.
Ten years later, this country has five presidents and two prime ministers and is being kept alive artificially.
The international community and the European Union must take initiatives to review the Dayton agreement in order to bring about a functional, federal, democratic and multi-ethnic state.
The European Union has a political and strategic responsibility to defend and strengthen the European prospects and the integration of the countries of the Balkans into the European institutions.
We need to firmly oppose those who contest enlargement today with a strategy of political and social democratisation, peace, security and stability through the progress of the Balkans towards Europe.
If we deny the peoples in the name of political expediency, we shall have contributed to the prevalence of the most extreme ethnic forces.
Europe made a great many mistakes in the 1990s.
It must not repeat them.
Â Â  . Mr President, thank you for your gracious words of congratulation on Londonâs Olympic bid.
I would have been delighted if any European city had been successful in Singapore today, but I am particularly delighted that London has secured this.
I hope that the 2012 Games will be a great European success.
I would like to thank all the Members of the European Parliament and the European Commission for their contributions to what has proved to be an insightful and wise debate this afternoon.
It is clear that there is a real commitment by all of you to support the European aspirations of the Western Balkan countries.
We certainly aim during our Presidency to work towards bringing the region within the European family of nations and will be working assiduously to achieve that.
We are conscious of the many challenges ahead, but we are committed to working together to overcome them.
I shall respond to some of the main points that have been raised by Members on both past and future issues.
Mrs Pack spoke powerfully on the need for reconciliation.
I recognise the need for a wider recognition of responsibility and this was a subject that I discussed only last week with the Reis-ul-Ulema, the Grand Mufti of Bosnia, who has been leading efforts to achieve exactly this reconciliation within and between communities in the regions.
Mr Swoboda rightly recognised the need for countries to have opportunities to right past wrongs.
That is certainly true but, as Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck reflected, it is necessary for all the countries in the region to cooperate fully with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.
Mr Cohn-Bendit spoke of the Dayton Accords and urged the international community to now take the initiative.
Whilst listening with care to the points that he made, I would respectfully remind him that only the three constituent communities of Bosnia can make changes to the constitution.
Mr Czarnecki questioned the European Unionâs policy towards Serbia and Montenegro.
The Serbia-Montenegro state union is a loose federal arrangement, created in 2003 largely through the initiative of Javier Solana.
Under the terms of the state union Constitutional Charter, either republic can hold a referendum on withdrawal after February 2006.
It is looking increasingly likely that Montenegro will seek to dissolve the union in 2006.
The European Union continues to support the state union as the best means of promoting stability and ensuring faster progress towards Euro-Atlantic integration.
However, the European Union recognises the terms of the Constitutional Charter, which allows for a referendum to be held after three years and emphasises the need for any dissolution to be constitutional, consensual, negotiated and transparent.
Mr Papastamkos spoke of the need for a clear regional approach, so let me say a further word about the European Unionâs priorities for the Western Balkans during the United Kingdomâs Presidency.
During the next six months, a number of key issues will come to a head.
The Commission will publish its opinion on Macedonia, Lord Ashdownâs mandate in Bosnia will come to an end and a positive assessment of standards implementation in Kosovo could lead to a process to determine Kosovoâs final status, a process in which the European Union will have a key role to play.
Across the range of Western Balkan issues, the Presidency will help the region make progress towards European standards and values.
The Presidency will continue to drive forward the European Unionâs Stabilisation and Association process, designed to build stability and prosperity in the Western Balkans and guide these countries towards eventual European Union membership.
The progress of each country within the stabilisation and association process will be judged against established political criteria.
Full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal, as I have already mentioned, remains a key political requirement.
Mr Posselt raised the issue of Croatia.
As a proud Scotsman, I do not want to disabuse him of his apparent certainty that the Loch Ness monster exists, or to dissuade him from the opportunity of visiting Scotland to continue the search, but let me make a deadly serious point to him.
The European Union has made it clear that it stands ready to open accession negotiations as soon as there is full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.
We hope this will happen during the UK Presidency, but it is ultimately up to Croatia to take the necessary steps to ensure full cooperation.
The easiest way for Croatia to address doubts about Croatiaâs commitment to ICTY is to cooperate in locating and detaining Ante Gotovina.
Mr Beglitis raised the question of how European Union help to Bosnia-Herzegovina in implementing the reforms necessary for European Union integration can be taken forward.
The European Union is providing a range of instruments to help the authorities carry out the necessary reforms.
The European Union Police Mission aims to help the Bosnian police force reach European standards.
It focuses on police reform through the monitoring and mentoring of middle-ranking to senior officers in the police force.
The EU CARDS Programme also supports reforms for European Union integration.
The European Union Special Representative and High Representative, Lord Paddy Ashdown, plays a coordinating role between the different European Union presences and has played a leading role in encouraging the Bosnian authorities to take the reform agenda forward.
I pay tribute to his work today.
His Mission Implementation Plan closely reflects the 16 priority areas identified in the European Union feasibility study published in November 2003.
In addition to the terrible anniversary of the Srebrenica massacre, which has been mentioned by so many speakers today and which we will commemorate next week, this year will also mark the tenth anniversary of the Dayton Accords, as was also mentioned in passing by at least a couple of speakers, and the end to the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
I believe that the next six months therefore offer an historic opportunity for these countries to demonstrate their wholehearted commitment to European values, to tolerance and the rule of law, to good neighbourly relations and to the difficult but very serious process of reconciliation, which a number of speakers have talked about today.
None of this will be easy.
Each country will face particular and different challenges, but I encourage them to work jointly and to encourage each other on this path.
In this respect, I echo the sentiments expressed by Commissioner Rehn.
I cannot stress too highly the importance of full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.
Handing over the last remaining indictees for trial in The Hague, notably Karadzic, Mladic and Gotovina, is not just an obscure European Union condition, but is required under several United Nations Security Council resolutions.
This will not only transform the nature of these countriesâ relations with the European Union but will also serve to transform their societies and contribute to the long-term process of rehabilitation that has been spoken about so convincingly today.
In that respect the joint statement by the presidents of the Dayton signatories issued following the recent meeting of the Mount Igman initiative in Belgrade was a welcome step.
It will contribute to the normalisation of relations between those three countries.
It represents an excellent basis for further work and we look forward to the implementation of the important commitments it contains.
The forthcoming tenth anniversary of the Srebrenica massacre is a vivid reminder of how far the Balkans have come, but also of how much remains to be done.
Thankfully armed conflict is and must remain a thing of the past although, as Mrs Ibrisagic reminded us, recent discoveries of explosives have shown that there are still those minded to advance their cause by violence.
The European Union has recognised the regionâs aspirations to join the European family once conditions have been met, but corruption and organised crime are still far too prevalent and economic growth is lacklustre.
But whilst we stand ready to help, the answer to these challenges lies not in Brussels, The Hague, London or, with the greatest of respect, Strasbourg.
It lies within the region and within the people whose energy and talents have outlived the years of conflict and it depends on their willingness to demand that their decency, hope and integrity are fully reflected.
Â Â  .
Mr President, after President Chiracâs ill-informed views on British and Finnish cuisine, I feel free to congratulate London as the European city for the venue of the 2012 Olympic Games. .
I thank the honourable Members for a dignified and substantive debate that fully respects our duty to remember and draw conclusions for the present and the future.
There was a wide convergence of views on a number of issues.
First of all, on the countryâs need to cooperate fully with the Hague Tribunal.
Clearly there is no lasting peace without historical truth and justice.
We have to learn from what happened so that history does not repeat itself.
I also note wide support for the continuation of our prudently managed accession process, combining the historic mission of European integration for peace, democracy and progress with consideration for our citizensâ legitimate concerns about the absorption capacity of the Union.
We therefore have to practice strict conditionality in our enlargement policy.
The future of the Western Balkans is clearly in the European Union.
It is fair to say that the European perspective is the glue that keeps the Western Balkans on a peaceful and stable track.
So is the future of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the European Union.
The Dayton Accord managed to put an end to the war, but I agree with Mr Cohn-Bendit that it is certainly not an ideal constitution on which to build a properly functioning, multi-ethnic modern state.
Therefore it is important that Bosnia and Herzegovina can itself reflect on the constitutional changes that can serve the country and its people better than the current construct.
It is up to the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina and their representatives to play a key role in this exercise.
In my view, it would not be useful or appropriate for the international community to force yet another blueprint upon its citizens.
We need consensus and a consensus-building political process in Bosnia and Herzegovina to achieve that objective.
I can assure you that the Commission will play an active role in the region in order to sustain hopes for its future in Europe.
I very much look forward to working together with the European Parliament and the Presidency to achieve that objective.
Â Â  Â I have received six motions for resolutions(1) tabled pursuant to RuleÂ 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12Â noon.
Â Â  Â The next item is the Council and Commission statements on relations between the EU, China and Taiwan and security in the Far East.
Â Â  . Mr President, in the 30 years since the European Union established diplomatic relations with China, both the European Union and China, and indeed the EU-China relationship, have seen quite remarkable change.
The European Union-China relationship is now as close as it has ever been.
But now, more than ever it is crucial that the European Union adapts to the challenge of Chinaâs political and economic growth.
European Union economies need to be able to respond to the competition and the opportunities offered by China and other emerging economies in Asia.
The European Union has many interests at stake in China and East Asia more widely, clearly a highly important region in the 21st century.
It is vital that the European Union and China both work together, with other international partners, to tackle global problems.
Discussion between the European Union and China is now rightly on a broad range of topics, including regional security, human rights, environment, education, migration, climate change and transportation.
Just last week, the first EU-China Aviation Summit took place.
All these discussions bring benefits to both parties.
The European Union already has a lot of experience to share and often China is approaching problems in a new way and the European Union can learn from its fresh approach.
The eighth European-China Summit in September in Bejing will be an opportunity to celebrate 30 years of official relations between the European Union and China and to look forward to the next 30 years.
This will be an opportunity for the European Union and China to work together as global partners on global challenges.
We look forward to this chance for the European Union and China to combine their efforts in order to address the challenges of climate change and energy security through dialogue and practical cooperation.
Of course there are differences between us, but it is a sign of the maturity of the relationship that we can discuss these constructively, for example, through the EU-China human rights dialogue.
Human rights are of course a fundamental part of European Union foreign policy.
The European Union acknowledges that China has made considerable progress over the last decade in its social-economic development and welcomes steps towards the strengthening the rule of law and cooperation with UN human rights mechanisms.
But much more is needed.
The European Union continues to have serious concerns about human rights in China, such as freedom of expression, freedom of religion and freedom of assembly.
Journalists, lawyers, and members of NGOs continue to be harassed.
The death penalty continues to be used extensively; there is widespread administrative detention and we have serious concerns about the use of torture.
The situation in Tibet and Xinjiang remain a concern.
The Council welcomes Chinaâs work towards the ratification of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and hopes that as this work continues there will be real improvements in the day-to-day lives of all Chinaâs citizens.
Another issue which China and the European Union discuss frequently is that of Taiwan.
The last 30 years have seen tremendous change in Taiwan too.
Taiwan is one of the most successful Asian tigers, experiencing an enviable 5.9Â % economic growth just last year.
GDP per capita in real terms is considered to be on a par with Japan and Hong Kong.
But change there has not just been economic, but also political.
Thirty years ago Chiang Kai-Shek died and his son Chiang Ching-kuo continued in power thereafter.
It was not until 1996 that Taiwan had its first democratic presidential election.
Now Taiwan is a full democracy.
The European Unionâs Member States have no diplomatic relations with Taiwan.
Nevertheless, its economic and commercial ties with Taiwan are strong.
Taiwan is of course a member of the World Trade Organisation.
Taiwan and the European Union also enjoy solid relations in other non-political areas, such as science, education, culture and various technical fields.
However, other aspects of the cross- Strait relationship are not so positive and this has consequences for regional security.
In March this year China introduced its âanti-secessionâ legislation with the intention, it said, of halting or deterring Taiwanese moves towards independence.
It was largely a codification of existing Chinese policy but it made reference to Chinaâs strong commitment to peaceful reunification and more disturbingly made reference to the use of non-peaceful means should circumstances warrant.
The description of what those circumstances might be was rather vague.
The European Union reacted by reaffirming its adherence to its one-China policy and its opposition to any use of force to resolve this issue.
The European Unionâs position has always been that the question of Taiwan should be resolved peacefully through constructive dialogue and it has urged both sides to avoid unilateral measures which might heighten tensions.
In a statement at the beginning of this year, the European Union welcomed the agreement to cross-Strait charter flights over the Lunar New Year.
It considered that this type of practical cooperation would help to promote dialogue and understanding between the parties and hoped that ways could be found to build upon it.
We note the dialogue between the Mainland and visiting opposition Taiwanese leaders and hope that the Mainland will soon be able to commence similar dialogue with the elected leadership in Taiwan.
On regional matters, China and the European Union share a common interest with others in a stable Korean peninsula.
Given its influence with the DPRK, China has a key role in efforts to achieve a nuclear-weapons-free peninsula, a role which the European Union supports.
The European Union remains keen to contribute to peace and security in the Asia and Asia-Pacific region.
It is one of our key objectives.
Speaking for the United Kingdom for a moment, we are keen to use the United Kingdomâs Presidency of the European Union to take forward work in this area.
The European Union should aim to engage more actively in the political management of the regional security challenges.
Among current concerns, the European Union has called for early and unconditional resumption of the six-party talks and for the complete verifiable and irreversible dismantling of any DPRK nuclear weapons programme.
We need to look further at ways to strengthen the European Unionâs contribution in regional fora such as ASEM and as a member of the ASEAN regional forum, the only Asia-wide multilateral forum on regional security.
It also makes sense for the European Union to develop strategic dialogues with other key players in the East Asian region.
The security of the region is not just a concern to those there, but to all of us.
Since Chinaâs reform of the economy which began in 1978, its economy has grown by almost 10% a year on average.
In that time, Chinese-European trade has grown more than fortyfold.
The EU is now Chinaâs most important trading partner, and China is the EUâs second most important trading partner, after the United States.
In 2003, China became the worldâs fourth largest trader, and its foreign trade continues to grow by 37%, a growth rate unrivalled by any major trading nation.
China has also overtaken the US as the largest recipient of foreign direct investment anywhere in the world.
China has made considerable efforts to live up to its new role in the global economic system.
To comply with its World Trade Organisation obligations and accession commitments, it has cut tariffs across the board and engaged in a thorough overhaul of laws and regulations.
Nevertheless, concerns remain.
The business environment in China is still a difficult one for the foreign businesses that operate there.
For example, laws to protect intellectual property rights are not implemented vigorously enough.
The WTO Ministerial in Hong Kong this year provides an opportunity for the European Union and China to work together once again to help achieve an ambitious and balanced outcome.
With this tremendous economic growth in China has come change in other areas too.
It was not until the mid-1990s that the European Commission drew up its first Asia strategy and China policy papers.
This first policy paper attempted to define a long-term strategy to address Chinaâs swift economic and indeed political development.
At the same time, engagements stopped being rather haphazard and regular annual summits became the norm.
In 1996, the first Asia-Europe meeting was held and two years later the first EU-China Summit took place.
Against this backdrop of rapid change, the main legal framework for EU-China relations, the Bilateral Trade and Economic Co-Operation Agreement of 1985 is looking decidedly out of date.
The European Union is looking forward to the introduction of a new framework agreement that is more in keeping with the multifaceted relationship we enjoy today.
I hope that during the period of the United Kingdomâs Presidency of the European Union, progress can be made on this.
We will also be looking for progress on a number of other issues, including climate change of course in this week when the G8 leaders gather in Gleneagles, and towards market economy status for China.
Energy security is an issue of concern to all countries.
It is a requirement of economic growth and development.
Current global levels of energy production and consumption are already considered as having a negative impact on the global climate, and greenhouse gas emissions are expected to rise over the coming decades.
The European Union and China face an important dual challenge, ensuring energy security and combating climate change.
The European Union recognises its obligation to reduce its own emissions while at the same time assisting countries such as China to meet their growing energy needs in a sustainable manner.
The European Union and China have significant and internationally respected scientific and technological expertise.
There is therefore excellent scope for the European Union and China to significantly strengthen collaboration in this important field.
The European Union and China do, of course, have differences.
The agreement reached at the conclusion of the recent EU-China textile negotiations shows what can happen when we sit down to discuss those differences amicably and seek win-win solutions.
China has acted, as the Commissioner for Trade, Mr Mandelson, said and I quote âas a responsible and valued partnerâ.
The time available to me for these remarks to the Parliament today is too short to encapsulate relationships which have evolved over 30 years, but I hope that others will now be able to contribute their thoughts on this important evolving relationship.
Â Â  . Mr President, I wish to begin by welcoming Mr Alexander in his new role, especially here in Parliament.
We will have many debates together and it will be a pleasure to work with him.
I am very happy about this debate, because the situation in Asia and also in East Asia is indeed a major strategic issue.
Asia is today not only the continent with the largest population but also with the highest economic growth rate and the highest rates of spending for research and development.
The Far Eastern countries invest in their future and Asia will, no doubt, be the continent at the centre of the world stage in the 21st century.
We have to know that and prepare for it.
Security in the Far East is a topic, therefore, of direct concern to European interests.
It is part of the overall global responsibility for security and stability that lies at the heart of the European Unionâs role in foreign policy.
Moreover, stability in the Far East directly impacts not only on the prosperity and the well-being of our citizens but also of the citizens of this continent.
China, Japan and the Republic of Korea are among the worldâs top six economies, if the EU is counted as one.
They also count among our major trading partners and are also key recipients of European foreign investment.
Japan, for its part, is also a major source of investment in Europe, not least in some of the new Member States.
In short, instability in the most dynamic region in the world would have serious consequences that would be deeply felt in Europe.
What, therefore, are the European responses and what are the instruments at our disposal to address this issue?
I would like to tackle that question now.
Let us look at the main issues at stake in East Asia.
Over the medium-term future, three major policy issues will dominate the political agenda in East Asia.
Firstly, how to respond to the rise of China.
Secondly, ensuring stability on the Korean peninsula and, thirdly, a peaceful resolution of tensions between China and Taiwan.
The proper handling of these issues will have major implications both for our regional and wider security.
By contrast, the degree of economic integration in East Asia is also very impressive.
However, this alone will not be sufficient to make East Asia more stable or more peaceful, particularly as the DPRK is still outside the emerging economic cooperation.
Moreover, unlike in Europe in the later half of the 1980s, economic ties have not resulted in improved political relations.
On the contrary, the economic rise of China and its assertive foreign policy have fanned concerns in some neighbouring countries that a more prosperous China could use its economic gains to pursue its national interests more forcefully and dominate the region both politically and economically.
The China-Japan rivalry has surfaced earlier and more visibly than expected by many observers.
A trend in all East Asian countries towards a more nationalistic orientation may set the stage for using bilateral conflicts as a valve for domestic consumption.
In China, for instance, as part of the process to move away from ideological constraints, nationalism has been revived as a unifying theme.
With a generational change in Korea, anti-Communism based on the traumatic experience of the Korean War has lost its appeal.
The new leadership, in line with the views of the younger generation often appears to see a forceful policy vis-Ã -vis North Korea as more of a threat to peace than North Koreaâs nuclear programme.
In Japan, a nationalistic renaissance can be observed, not founded on a young generation movement, but on an eliteâs wish to change a so-called âself-denigrating attitudeâ in Japan.
This tendency in all three countries to favour nationalistic policies does not bode well for solving the concrete political problems that will become more urgent in the years to come.
Moreover, with the technological rise of China, the economies may, in fact, move from complementarity to more intense competition and thereby heat up the political environment rather than cool it down.
Rising tensions are not a given, however.
For instance, the meeting in Jakarta on 23 April between Japanâs Prime Minister Koizumi and Chinaâs President â at which I participated â was held specifically to de-escalate the tension and that demonstrates that both sides understand that they would stand to lose economically from rising tensions.
It is unfortunate, therefore, that the follow-up steps complicated rather than calmed down the situation when Vice Prime Minister Wu Yi abruptly cancelled a scheduled meeting with Prime Minister Koizumi.
If nonetheless managed well, the Tokyo-Beijing rivalry could lead to constructive competition and thus would open the way to addressing long-standing conflicts, as witnessed, for instance, by the India-China rapprochement, followed by a visit of Prime Minister Koizumi to New Delhi and Tokyoâs increased interest in South East Asia.
In this regard, it is very interesting to see the European example of overcoming war hostilities and cold war separation become a object of strong interest and study in East Asia.
This provides us with an opening that we should use to foster relations with all regional players.
We are taking a number of concrete steps to address the various issues at hand in order to clearly voice Europeâs views for a way forward and to express our concerns about the situation.
There is a political dialogue.
It is true that we are just celebrating our 30th anniversary of diplomatic relations.
There is also a human rights dialogue and all the security issues are there and are being discussed.
Indeed, at the next summit with China, which will be held in September, we will try to come up with the idea of a more comprehensive and more ambitious framework agreement, because the old one is no longer fulfilling our most ambitious goals.
There are 20 sectoral dialogues with the various ministers at ministerial level to prepare China for its WTO trade obligations and also, for example, for its obligations as regards intellectual property rights and as regards labour protection, which our colleague also mentioned.
The general idea is fully reciprocal two-way relations.
On the China-Japan tensions, we have used recent high-level meetings â notably the EU-Japan Summit on 2Â May in Luxembourg â to discuss stability issues in East Asia at the highest governmental level.
In that context, we have agreed to intensify our political dialogue and we have said that energy issues in particular should be very high on our agenda, together with Japan.
We want to do this, not least with a view to responding to Japanâs concern over a possible future lifting of the EUâs arms embargo on China.
As a first follow-up, we held a ministerial Troika with Japan on 6 May in the margin of the ASEM meeting.
In our political dialogue with China, we are also addressing the issue of Sino-Japanese tensions and calling for moderation and reconciliation.
On the arms embargo, the European Council Conclusions of December 2005 clearly stipulate that there should not be any change in the quantity or quality of arms exports to China.
Therefore, any possible future decision on lifting the embargo should not alter the security situation in East Asia.
Moreover, the European Union has started a strategic dialogue with the United States on East Asia to address the security concerns of our partners, and information missions have been carried out to the US, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand to explain our position.
We are finalising the reinforced Code of Conduct on arms experts.
Let me say two more things before the debate and then I will answer your questions.
Regarding Chinaâs Anti-Secession Law, in its statement issued on 15 March, the European Union clearly expressed its concern about this legislation.
On that occasion, the European Union reiterated the principles guiding its policy, i.e. its attachment to a âone Chinaâ policy and to the peaceful resolution of disputes.
We have also called on both sides to develop initiatives for dialogue and understanding.
It must be said that we were happy to see that Taiwan opposition leaders went to mainland China.
We hope that in the future all parties will be involved in such contacts.
I refer again to the DPRKâs nuclear programme.
I would remind you that the European Union â and the Commission also â is a board member of KEDO.
We have financially and otherwise supported this â currently suspended â activity with a view to finding a peaceful resolution of the nuclear issue.
We continue to give our full support to possible six-party talks as a way forward and have impressed our view very clearly on the North Korean Government on various occasions.
I hear that a parliamentary delegation is going to North Korea.
We will be very happy to listen to you and to learn from you when you come back.
I will stop here.
There is a lot to be said, because these issues, as I have said, are at the centre of our global policy for the 21st century.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we could actually do with a double allocation of speaking time in order to respond properly to the excellent speeches by those who have spoken to this topic so far, and it is for that reason that I have no option but to speak in summary form.
I think we all agree that the tensions in the Far East have to be taken seriously, whether we are talking about the tension between Japan and China or that between North Korea and Japan.
You can take that further, as far as Russia, if you want to include such issues as the four islands that have been occupied ever since the end of the Second World War.
It is vitally important that this Europe of ours should make a proper contribution, not merely out of economic considerations, but also with political considerations in mind.
After all, we all agree â and I assume that the President-in-Office does too â that we want to promote democracy, human rights and the rule of law, and that we regard our work to these ends as a long-term basis for sound economic relationships.
Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner was right to mention the success of the May summit held between Japan and the EU in Luxembourg, but I sometimes get the feeling that members of the Council and the Commission visit Peking three times as often as they visit Tokyo.
It would be no bad thing either for them to visit Taipei; after all, both Taiwan and Japan are countries with multi-party democracies, in which human rights are observed and the rule of law prevails.
Neither of those things are yet the case in the Peopleâs Republic of China, and there is only a very distant prospect of either of them being so.
If we want to demonstrate the need for democracies to cooperate among themselves, then the numbers of visits and contacts would have to be more evenly balanced.
What I would very much like the Council to tell us now is what position has been reached in the ongoing deliberations on the lifting of the arms embargo.
We in this House insist on three things before this can happen.
Firstly, we â like you â expect substantial improvements as regards human rights in China.
Secondly, the stand-off between Taiwan and China must be brought to an end.
With China threatening Taiwan with over 700 rockets stationed on its coast, this is a flash point to the like of which you do not deliver weapons.
To the Commissioner, who, I think, was being rather evasive, I would ask whether the Code of Conduct on Arms Exports is now to be legally binding, and if so, when.
That, too, is something we regard as a if there is to be any sort of talk about lifting the arms embargo.
We must do everything in our power to get the countries of Asia to where we are now: the state, sixty years after the end of the Second World War, of having been reconciled with one another.
It is for that reason that we should encourage them to press on with the same process of reconciliation, without which there can be no stability and no security.
Â Â  . Mr President, I speak on behalf of the Party of European Socialists.
This compromise resolution is one that we support, because we believe that it is important that the European Parliament speak with one voice.
However, understandably it does not exactly represent the views of my Group, nor for that matter those of the other Groups that have signed it.
It is exactly what it says: a compromise.
The Far East is an increasingly important region for trade and aid with increasing globalisation of both economics and politics.
Security issues affect us all: now when North-East Asia sneezes, we all threaten to catch a cold.
I would like to make three main points.
First, with respect to the arms embargo with China, it was rightly imposed after the horrors of Tiananmen Square.
We rightly still have concerns about Chinaâs human rights record, but, as the Council said, things are moving in the right direction.
For us, it is the lack of a full legal base for the code of conduct on arms that is as much a problem for the lifting of the embargo as the situation in China.
Second, with respect to North Korea, as you have said, Commissioner, a delegation is leaving tomorrow, of which I am part, under the leadership of Ursula Stenzel.
This will be the first meeting between a standing delegation of the European Parliament and the Supreme Peopleâs Assembly of the Democratic Peopleâs Republic of Korea.
This Parliament has made its position clear in the past and will reiterate it in the vote tomorrow.
The European Union has contributed EURÂ 500 million to humanitarian aid, development and KEDO in North Korea.
We believe increasingly that we should have a policy of âno say, no payâ.
We will seek to continue critical engagement to bring North Korea back to the table, out of the cold and into the world, but we want a place at that table when they come back to it.
Lastly, no country is immune from blame for the current tensions in this region: the China-Taiwan, China-Japan, Japan-South Korea issues and that of the Korean peninsula itself.
There is a continuing need to come to terms with the regionâs history.
The countries might well learn from the historical Franco-German and German-Polish reconciliations here in Europe.
As Commissioner Rehn said in a previous debate, âthere is no lasting peace without reconciliation around truth and justiceâ.
Â Â  . The European Parliament has declared itself in favour of retaining the arms embargo on China by a substantial majority.
This embargo must remain in place as long as the reasons for its imposition persist.
For example, as long as several hundred people who participated in the Tienanmen Square protest are still in jail.
The examples show that economic relations are developing despite the embargo, so it clearly has no influence whatsoever on economic relations, but it needs to serve as a pointer as regards political relations.
Personally, I trust the position of the British Presidency; in my experience, the stance of the United Kingdom is clear and unambiguous regarding this issue and I commend it for this.
The other important issue: Taiwan has sought observer status in the World Health Organisation since 1997.
Its application has been rejected every year, including this year, unfortunately.
And unfortunately, the Member States have participated in turning down its application.
It is my opinion, however, that Taiwanâs 23 million inhabitants have a right to the security and protection that the World Health Organisation has to offer, but the reverse is also true: we also need the knowledge and experience and â I have to say, the financial resources â that Taiwan has to offer.
It is utterly incomprehensible why they keep rejecting Taiwanâs request.
I have no desire to call into question the âone Chinaâ policy, but this has nothing to do with that.
Taiwan already participates in numerous areas of international cooperation.
For example, it is a member of the World Trade Organisation; it participates in economic cooperation within APEC and is a member of other international organisations.
At the same time, organisations such as the Holy See, the Knights of Malta, the Red Cross, the Red Crescent, and even the Inter-Parliamentary Union have observer status in the World Health Organisation.
In the light of this, it is utterly absurd that Taiwan has been turned down.
I ask the Presidency and the Commission to persuade the Member States to grant Taiwan observer status in the World Health Organisation next year.
Â Â  . Mr President, China in fact plays a fundamental role, both in European foreign policy and in European commercial policy.
That is why it is so important for the European Union to ensure that its policy on China contributes to improving social, environmental and human rights standards, and that it does not jeopardise regional stability and security.
In this context, I agree that some of the recent actions of the Chinese authorities are worrying, such as the adoption of the anti-secession law in relation to Taiwan.
We must also remember that the European Union will only be able to accept an agreement between China and Taiwan if it is the result of a peaceful dialogue between the parties and, in particular, if it respects the democratic progress achieved by Taiwan.
Furthermore, as has already been said, with regard to the arms embargo, we must remember that it must remain in place, at least until there is significant progress with regard to human rights, which also includes the situation in Tibet, until what happened in Tiananmen is sufficiently clarified, and above all, in my view, until the European Unionâs code of conduct becomes a legally binding text.
I would therefore like to urge the representative of the Council to delight us in August by adopting a legally binding statute for the code of conduct, which would be warmly welcomed by this House.
Â Â  . Mr President, for a long time, my group took a straightforward view of the Peopleâs Republic of China and of the government that sits on the island of Taiwan.
It was that, in 1949, an old and incompetent clique of profiteers, incapable of offering a solution to poverty and injustice, was sent packing by the people, and rightly so. They fled to an island where most of the people did not feel Chinese and which, up to 1945, did not belong to China for sustained periods of time.
On that island, they set up a military dictatorship and tried to carry out attacks on the mainland, eventually forfeiting international recognition and being thrown out of the United Nations.
Meanwhile on the mainland, all kinds of interesting experiments were going on, including the industrialisation of the countryside and a sweeping reorganisation of agriculture.
The advent of factories, railway and dams helped the country move forward.
Unfortunately, during those experiments, such as the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution, as a result of inexperience, serious mistakes were made which claimed many lives.
That seemed to be the price they had to pay for a prosperous future.
The situation now is that, led by the heirs to this revolutionary regime, China is still a country with a future, but our political line has changed completely.
Despite enjoying exponential growth, the Peopleâs Republic suffers from very pronounced inequality, imposes the death penalty, and lacks both democratic processes and freedom of organisation.
For the moment, the model is reminiscent of what South Korea and Taiwan have rightly abandoned.
Taiwan has developed from a military dictatorship into a democracy that can increasingly be compared with Europe and Japan.
As a democracy, it aspires to become a non-Chinese, and therefore independent, Taiwan.
In our search for a solution to a 56-year long division of what is internationally recognised as Chinese territory, we will need to take these new developments into account.
Only in that way can we help find peaceful solutions for the future.
Â Â  . Mr President, between China and Taiwan could considerably improve the security situation in the Far East, which at present appears anything but secure.
The Council and Commission have the urgent task of promoting a more businesslike relationship between Beijing and Taipei.
The strong European trading position with both countries not only offers an objective opportunity of doing this, but also means that such action must necessarily be in our own interests.
One thing is clear, the Councilâs positively premature intention to lift the arms embargo against the Peopleâs Republic has, together with the recent Chinese anti-secession law, enormously increased tension in the region.
It is difficult to tell what predominates here: a lack of strategic thinking or the disturbing lack of diplomatic straight talking within Europe, let alone of transatlantic consultation.
I hope that the Council, under the British Presidency, will abandon this unsafe approach.
If the European Union takes up its strategic responsibility towards the Far East, it will support flexible cross-Straits relations.
Time has not stood still in Taiwan either.
For years, it has developed its own national identity and has undergone an impressive democratisation process, both of which are at the heart of the Taiwanese conflict today.
The Taiwanese are also, and understandably, very much aware of recent developments in Hong Kong.
The Council and Commission certainly do not appear to be ignoring Taiwan commercially speaking, but they are, unfortunately, doing so on the diplomatic front.
That is why I am happy to endorse paragraph 9 of the draft resolution.
I urge you to support Taiwanese observer status in the World Health Organisation and give 23Â million free Taiwanese a vote and a face in international fora.
That is how the European Union can help establish the desperately needed inter-Chinese dialogue.
Â Â  .Â Â Â MrÂ President, Commissioner, MrÂ Alexander, the proclamation by the Peopleâs Republic of China of an âanti-secession lawâ is a key moment for security in the Far East.
By enacting a bill that blatantly violates international law, the Peopleâs Republic of China has made it clear to the rest of the world that the Peking regime is not becoming more moderate as had been hoped, even though the country has allowed market forces to operate in parts of its economy and the West has become more open to contacts with China.
China knows that the Taiwanese will never voluntarily agree to unification, and so it is making preparations for an armed attack on this democratic and prosperous country.
It is entirely up to us to determine the outcome of a process that began with spending on armaments, followed by the above-mentioned law, which is nothing short of scandalous, and which in turn has had a direct effect in that 600Â ballistic missiles have been targeted at Taiwan.
We are already familiar with the reactions of some EU Member States.
While this provocation was going on, the President of the Member State that does the most trade with China, or in other words France, announced that there was no longer any point to the embargo on arms exports to China, and that this embargo was a manifestation of hostility.
The German Chancellor has echoed his comments.
This is the worst of all possible responses, and if we followed this advice, we could be providing arms to a country that makes no secret of its aggressive intentions towards its neighbours.
Europe needs to respond differently to this âanti-secession lawâ.
It needs to keep the embargo in place, and to step up its policy of active support for Taiwanâs position in the international arena, by acting in close cooperation with the United States.
Our aim up until now has been to maintain the status quo, but the latter has been undermined unilaterally by the Peopleâs Republic of China.
If I may, I should like to make one final comment which occurred to me while listening to the debate, and which should not be taken too seriously.
If there were an EU-wide ban on praise for totalitarian systems, I do not believe that the Members of this House from post-Communist countries would manage a single day out of prison, and there would be 50Â fewer Members of this Parliament.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, we know that China, because of its influence over North Korea, holds the keys to peace in that region of the world.
However, the increasingly aggressive attitude of Communist China towards Taiwan constitutes a threat to this peace that is all the more serious because the leaders in Beijing have nuclear weapons.
Ever since 1949, those leaders have never given up hope of annexing Taiwan, which has, thanks to the courage of its inhabitants, become one of the most dynamic economies in the Pacific and a model of democracy in a region where there are still many totalitarian regimes.
This aggression will not be appeased by the shady deals in which some European leaders are indulging, foremost among them being MrÂ Chirac, who has gone as far as inviting the Chinese Communist dictator to his chateau.
Only a firm, decisive attitude will bring the authorities in Beijing to make compromises and, in particular, to recognise the right of the Taiwanese to self-determination.
Until they do so, the Member States of the European Union must maintain the embargo on exporting arms to Communist China.
Were our governments to adopt a different policy, not only would they be betraying the values of freedom and democracy that they are always so proud of affirming, but they would also be seriously compromising the stability of the Far East.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I welcome the resolution on security in the Far East, and particularly the broad consensus on the part of all groups that underpins it.
That being so, it will determine the political remit for the mission to Korea, which sets off tomorrow, and which I have the honour to be chairing.
Although there have already been two ad hoc missions, this one, following on from the recent establishment of a Parliamentary Delegation for the Korean peninsula, is the first ever to both North and South Korea.
Politically speaking, this trip is the expression of Parliamentâs desire that the European Union should have influence, as a seventh negotiating partner, on the six-party talks.
It is also in our interest that North Korea should emerge from its isolation and thus become able to receive from the EU the humanitarian aid that it needs.
Its return to the negotiating table, its decommissioning of existing nuclear weapons and its abandonment of plans for new ones are essential preconditions not only for rapprochement between the two Koreas and for the resultant in the region, but also for its own access to more help from Europe.
We will also be having the opportunity to meet representatives of the Foreign Policy of the Chinese Peopleâs Congress, and here too, this resolutionâs core statements will be our policy guidelines.
Our primary aspiration is that the Peopleâs Republic of China should exert considerable influence on North Koreaâs attitude towards naming a date for the resumption of the six-party talks, which will make a political solution possible.
It is towards this end that we, Europeâs parliamentarians, offer our good offices.
Â Â  In the interests of ensuring that security is maintained and development continues in the Far East, I would like to call upon the governments of countries where disputes over territorial issues still persist to resolve these as soon as possible by means of bilateral negotiations.
In this day and age, the persistence of differences of opinion in connection with the Second World War is an indication that the region still needs to come to terms with its past history and work through it.
One issue relating to security in the region is the âanti-secessionâ legislation passed by the Republic of China in March 2005.
I consider it important to maintain the in the region, and I support the peaceful resolution of the issue by means of dialogue between the parties, bearing in mind the âone Chinaâ principle.
I would like to express my dismay regarding North Koreaâs announcement in February 2005 that it possesses nuclear weapons, and that it is pulling out of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and suspending the six-party talks indefinitely.
I would like to make it clear that I still believe the multilateral, six-party talks provide the primary framework for resolving the issue, and that an agreement in principle reached on this basis is needed to ensure a Korean peninsula free from nuclear weapons.
I hope that North Korea will review its position as soon as possible, provide the appropriate international guarantees and return to the framework of the Treaty.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, members of the Council, the European Union has always laid great emphasis on encouraging democracy and the free rule of law and on worldwide support for human rights.
These goals should be the strategic priority and a moral necessity for the democratic Europe, geared towards the reinforcement of civil society and democratic institutions in the worldâs third countries.
These aspects are what should determine our assessment of the relations between the European Union, China and Taiwan, as well as of security in the Far East.
That is why I particularly call on you to bear in mind the circumstances in which the arms trade embargo on China was introduced.
It is no secret that from an arms trade point of view, the embargo on China is practically inoperative.
That is why the embargo should be evaluated not as a means of restricting the spread of weaponry but solely as a political instrument of the European Union for assessing the situation of democracy and human rights in China.
Therefore a wish to lift the embargo suggests that the Commission is no longer concerned about the questions of democracy, freedom, the rule of law and human rights in China.
Is that really so?
Is not this hypocrisy?
Do the Commission and the governments of France, Germany or the Netherlands really not see, in their search for business opportunities in China, that dissidents are still being suppressed, followers of Falun Gong are still being persecuted, democracy and freedom are being restricted in Hong Kong, that more than 700 Chinese missiles are targeted towards democratic Taiwan, and that authoritarian China passed a law this spring giving it the right to carry out a military attack on the developing democracy in Taiwan?
Ladies and gentlemen, this is an occasion for the European Parliament again to put on record that some individuals holding office in Europe and representatives of Member States are acting in accordance with double standards when pursuing narrow economic interests.
They are emboldening China and showing a willingness to ignore democratic ideals.
Such an attitude not only reduces security in the Far East but can also rebound like a boomerang in future and affect security and stability in Europe itself.
Â Â  Mr President, the arms embargo against China was imposed as a protest against the bloody crackdown on student demonstrators in Tiananmen Square in 1989.
Have any fundamental changes been made in the area of human rights in China in the subsequent 16 years?
None whatsoever.
In fact, a huge portrait of Mao Tse-Tung, the biggest mass murderer of the 20th century, is still on display on Tiananmen Square.
To this day, there are people in prison for being present at Tiananmen Square.
Nor, in fact, are they the only political prisoners, for the so-called Peopleâs Republic is still a Communist one-party state without any freedom of expression of opinion, freedom of the press or freedom of religion.
Only the day before yesterday, for example, Bishop Jia Zhiguo, an underground Roman Catholic bishop in China, was arrested.
He has already spent more than 20 years of his life in prison.
Not only does the Peopleâs Republic of China systematically and continually violate human rights, but it also forms a threat to regional stability and, by extension, to peace full stop.
The so-called anti-secession law is like a knife held to Taiwanâs throat.
The European Union is blowing hot and cold at the same time.
On the one hand, it stresses that the human rights situation in China should improve, while on the other, it seeks to lift the arms embargo, thereby sending a message to the Chinese regime that it does not have to be too careful about human rights.
Taiwan is given credit, and rightly, for its economic success and for real democracy, but it is not being spelled out to the Peopleâs Republic that it is unacceptable to challenge Taiwanâs integrity.
Under such circumstances, a strategic partnership with China should not be an end in itself, any more than the so-called One China Policy should remain an end in itself.
If Taiwan ever declares formal independence, then Europe must recognise this without delay and our Member States must establish diplomatic relations with it.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, representatives of the Presidency, the regular visits to Brussels and Strasbourg of Chinese officials and the meetings between them and representatives of the European Parliament highlight the interest in developing relations between China and the European Union.
At the same time, however, they have also brought to light differences at political level which slowly but surely are leading both sides to an unavoidable and harmonious symbiosis, because the People's Republic of China needs the European Union and the European Union needs China.
In addition, I do not believe that the presence of China and India in the area of international trade represents a threat, as recently maintained here, in his first appearance, by the President-in-Office of the Council, Tony Blair.
On the contrary, one would maintain that it is a very good opportunity for between the peoples in all sectors of cooperation and friendly rivalry, a unique opportunity, during which at all levels will provide solutions even to outstanding issues such as those between China and Taiwan, which is seeking secession, the lifting of the weapons embargo against China by the European Union and the United States and, finally, the abolition of the illegal and indiscriminate export of goods, especially in the pharmaceutical, electronics and textile and clothing sectors.
It is no coincidence that, in the face of the impasses, the Chinese are trying to compromise.
The bilateral relations which China has developed with states throughout the world are increasing and extending at a rapid pace, from the United States and Latin America to Europe.
Is this enough or is coordinated action needed on the part of the European Union so that these objectives are common, single objectives?
One of these major objectives was achieved last week, as we heard just now.

The European Union therefore needs to speed up procedures to settle outstanding issues with China.
