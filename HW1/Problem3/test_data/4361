An institution like the Commission must not argue in favour of the draft Constitutional treaty or of the development of increased supranationalism in the EU.
For example, the proposal in paragraphÂ 9 of the report that the EU institutions should reach agreements with TV companies able to produce drama series, game shows and films etc designed to promote the EUâs ideas and values is downright ridiculous.
Some of the EU institutionsâ information material goes beyond what may be regarded as factual information, and some of the information about the EU aimed at children and young people should never have been given out.
In a democracy, a variety of players should engage in free and open debate.
There should be no player promoting a political line âfrom aboveâ with the help of taxpayersâ money.
Â Â  The Moderate delegation has today voted against the report on the European Unionâs information and communication strategy.
We are of the view that a political institution such as the European Parliament should not be used for opinion forming geared to certain ideas or for influencing the media to act in a particular way in relation to the political debate being conducted in the Member States.
Â Â  This report is a real gem of official propaganda in which the Commission and the governments surpass themselves in building their new world.
This document demonstrates, if there were still a need to do so, that the European project is firstly a totalitarian project aimed at inculcating a new way of thinking, behaving and living.
The foundations of European policy are characterised by utopia, demagogy, political correctness and the absence of any reference to the values on which our civilisation is based.
To this desire to have people forget what we are, on the model of the Communists who wished to make a blank sheet of the past, can be added a commercial dimension whereby the EUâs communication strategy inevitably becomes subject to market principles, to the point at which there is talk of promoting a âEuropeâ brand in the same way as an everyday packet of washing powder.
Children, seen by the fervent supporters of Europe as being more malleable, are the preferred target of this communication.
A promise is even made to them to âdefine the soulâ of this new Europe - an odd term, âsoulâ, when you have rejected any Christian references in your draft Constitution.
Either one has, or does not have, a soul, and Europe has nothing of the kind.
As a cherry on the cake, the possibility is raised of allocating financial bonuses to media that have apparently been able to communicate the European idea and European values.
Corruption is being reinvented, but at European level.
That is a good start!
The European project that you are constructing for us is a monstrous one, so reminiscent is it of methods and procedures that have proved themselves in other totalitarian systems remembered with horror. Never forget, however, that resistance to oppression is an inalienable right of peoples who wish to remain free.
Â Â  . I welcome this report and the rapporteur's recognition of the importance of a more effective communication strategy.
I am pleased to see the Commission recognising the need to improve communication with citizens and agree with the rapporteur that it is vital Europe be bought closer to its citizens. This is particularly pertinent in light of the continued decline in European Parliament election turn-outs, reaching a record low of 45.7% in 2004.
A more effective Communication strategy will do much to counter the Euro-myths propagated throughout the EU.
Â Â  . The political institutions can have but one communication strategy: truth and transparency, in tandem with a readiness to listen as much as to make ourselves heard.
Even if it is true that the vast majority of Europeâs citizens feel close to the essence of the spirit of the EU, it is nonetheless also true that that there is a sense of alienation when it comes to its day-to-day running, and with regard to the content of some of its texts.
The prime objective is, therefore, by means of transparency and truth, and complete respect for pluralism, to increase the visibility of what the Union is, and to pay attention to what the citizens are saying.
There are two sides to all forms of communication and this is one of its most democratic characteristics.
Let us therefore take this on board.
Â Â  Like motherhood and apple pie, information and communication are what almost all of us in the European Union can believe in.
This really is the only topic that unites us. From left to right of the Chamber, we are all agreed in lamenting the disastrous shortage of information and communication.
It is a black hole in which sceptics of all kinds are swallowed up, there to dispense their venom. One has only to consider the debate that is raging in France at present.
The ânoâ camp will stoop to lying in any way in order to advance its cause. In the name of Europe, is nothing sacred?
How paradoxical it is, too, that Commissioner for Communication MrsÂ WallstrÃ¶m, who took part in the debate, had a ten times higher profile with her previous portfolio - that of the environment â than with this one, which should however thrust her centre-stage.
Poor old Europe, the ânon-communicableâ subject, it would appear.
I have no magic solution, any more than anyone else has.
Just a few certainties.
I am certain, for example, about paragraph 5 of our report, which is about teaching Europe in schools, explaining it, recounting it and decoding it, and doing so in a lively way involving dialogues, exchanges and visits.
This is a crucial task, and not an impossible one.
Having spent six years replying to the questions of thousands of secondary school pupils, I personally know that, for them, the EU will never again be a merely virtual object.
Â Â  The next item is the Commission statement on the drought in Spain.
Â Â  . Mr President, the Commission is fully aware of how serious the drought is in Spain.
It understands the concerns in this respect and is determined to help.
There exist today means which provide possibilities in situations such as this.
The Commission has already issued, on 10 May, a decision allowing areas in set aside to be used for grazing animals in nine independent communities in Spain.
However, the Commission has received no other specific request on the part of the Spanish authorities in connection with the application of direct aid schemes within the framework of the situation created by the cold weather and the drought.
Any request submitted by the Spanish authorities to the Commission, for example for payment of advances, will be given serious consideration.
The Commission's response will be based on current legislative provisions, taking account of the budget available.
The Commission has issued a communication, in which it outlines the various alternative possibilities for combating the dangers and crises in farming.
As talks on this issue are at a very early stage in all the institutions, it is too early for the Commission to commit to specific action, even pilot action.
Nonetheless, I can say that the Commission, in response to a request from the European Parliament, will shortly set a pilot study in motion on the subject of farm insurance schemes.
Within this framework, I should also like to refer to the question of transferring intervention reserves raised in the resolution.
The Commission is firmly against this sort of transfer, in order to avoid distortions of the market which put local and regional producers and wholesalers at a disadvantage.
As regards the call for flexibility in the common market organisation in fruit and vegetables in the resolution, the Spanish authorities are responsible for this matter, subject to certain criteria.
Although there are possibilities for using rural development resources to relieve producers hit by the drought or cold weather, the Commission has not as yet received any such request from the Spanish authorities.
If such a request is submitted, the Commission will examine it immediately, so that it can do whatever possible.
Within this framework, it could examine the possibility of redistributing amounts already budgeted on the basis of rural development, by channelling them to actions to reinforce measures such as 'replacing farmers' for which provision is made on the basis of Council Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999.
Similarly, the Spanish authorities, as happened in the case of Portugal, could examine the possibility of derogations from the application of certain measures, such as agricultural environmental measures, by notifying the Commission of cases recognised as cases of '' on the basis of Commission Regulation (EC) No 817/2004.
As regards the risk of forest fires, certain preventive actions can be included under rural development measures financed by the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund on the basis of Council Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999.
The Spanish authorities could also ask for the regional programmes to be amended, in order to reinforce, within the framework of these programmes, measures to prevent forest fires.
However, it should be mentioned that additional support based on the above measures can only be set in motion subject to compliance with the budget for existing programmes.
As regards using the Solidarity Fund, it is true that the serious drought and cold weather may be seen as a natural disaster and, as such, to generally fall within the scope of this fund.
However, in order to mobilise the Solidarity Fund, the interested Member State must submit the relevant application to the Commission within ten weeks of the date of the first damage noted.
In order to qualify for aid, the calculated cost of the overall direct damage must exceed EUR 3 billion at 2002 prices or 0.6% of the gross national product of the country in question, whichever is the lower.
This means that the damage threshold for 2005 applicable in Spain's case is just over EUR 3.1 billion at today's prices.
The Solidarity Fund can only cover specific emergency aid measures taken by the public authorities, such as, for example, temporary replacement of infrastructures of vital importance, which will allow normal daily activity to resume.
It is important to emphasise that the Solidarity Fund of the European Union was not set up in order to cover all the costs connected with natural disasters.
In particular, the EU Solidarity Fund does not allow compensation for damages of a private nature, including in the agricultural sector.
The Commission has repeatedly proven that it uses all the possibilities offered by the Solidarity Fund for the benefit of states hit by disasters, including mobilising the Solidarity Fund for the shipwreck of the .
However, the effort being made to achieve a degree of flexibility does not mean that certain provisions of the regulation will be overlooked.
Similarly, as the honourable Members of Parliament will know, the Commission approved, on 6 April, a proposal for a new Solidarity Fund.
This proposal, which will need to be examined by the Council by Parliament, makes provision, among other things, for a significant reduction in the damage threshold for mobilising the fund, extends its scope and defines a broader range of eligible actions.
The Commission will be delighted if its proposal is supported by Parliament, given that it moves to a considerable extent in the direction being sought today.
Finally, Spain may decide to compensate farmers with state aid for loss of income as a result of the serious drought and cold weather.
The Spanish authorities must notify the plan to the Commission.
It is, nonetheless, fundamental that:
- firstly, they must prove that the losses caused by the weather reach the 20% or 30% threshold;
- secondly, that there is a direct connection between the losses and the bad weather;
- thirdly, that there is no overcompensation of the damage caused.
The Spanish authorities can also use the new 'de minimis' rule for state aid.
Aid of up to EUR 3Â 000 per farmer may be granted for three years without notifying the Commission, provided that, among other preconditions, the upper limit applicable to Spain is not exceeded.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, thank you very much for what you said.
It clearly indicates your sensitivity towards the urgent problem, indeed the tragedy, currently facing the Spanish countryside.
Unfortunately, you have confirmed some of my suspicions about the Spanish Governmentâs inertia in this connection.
I hope that this resolution and other measures that we are adopting as a matter of urgency in this Parliament will also be a wake-up call to our government.
Commissioner, the damage caused in Spain by the frost and drought is already in excess of EURÂ 2Â 000 million, representing a third of the aid received by our country under the common agricultural policy.
According to the estimates made by farming organisations, the effects of the bad climatic conditions suffered in January, February and March will go on being felt for a number of years, since a substantial number of trees have been lost, and farmers will not regain their productive capacity in the short term.
What has been most affected is production in terms of fruit, olives, plants, flowers and crops.
Cattle breeding has also been affected by the loss of pastureland and the damage caused to the water supply.
This is a pressing matter in my own region â that of the Balearic Islands â where, in Menorca, there is currently a shortage of more than 1Â 500 tonnes of food for the animals â a very serious situation for them.
The shortage of pastureland, combined with the problems in piping water to farms, has also caused extraordinary harm to cattle throughout Spain.
The increase in fuel prices also exacerbates an already critical situation, so it would be as well to take account of the requests that are being made for a European directive to be prepared that would slow down this increase in fuel prices, which is such a burden on our farmers.
The Spanish regions most affected by this frost and drought are as follows: Valencia, Murcia and Andalusia, where 50Â 000 hectares of olives may disappear, with a major environmental disaster somewhere along the line and, shortly afterwards, a possible process of desertification; Aragon, Castille-La Mancha, Catalonia, Estremadura and, as I said, the Balearics; and La Rioja, with its vineyards, and Galicia.
The European Union should devise specific instruments for tackling extreme situations such as this disaster happening in Spain.
I should be grateful to you, Commissioner, if the matter of this insurance fund could also be addressed.
These are practical measures that need to be implemented as soon as possible.
The Solidarity Fund was set up a few years ago following the floods, remembered by all of us, in the centre of Europe.
As you mentioned, it was also used for some very practical measures.
Think of the aid granted to Spain following the accident involving the , the funds duly requested by the Peopleâs Party government or the money used to restore the vegetation in a number of areas affected by the fires.
At the present time, Community solidarity should also be demonstrated through the release of resources from this fund to cover, at least, the costs sustained by many Spanish farmers due to loss of productive capacity, since the frost in question has damaged numerous plantations, often irreversibly.
As your draft resolution points out, the frost and drought are causing damage to the economies and living conditions of many areas this year.
MrÂ President, I shall attempt to sum up.
Taking advantage of the presence of the Commissioner, I should like to urge the Commission to be flexible, since the situation experienced in Spain is ultimately the result of a climate disaster, the kind of event for which this Solidarity Fund was first set up.
Apart from referring to this fund, the resolution also mentions simple measures that can be applied.
I hope that the Spanish Government will act quickly and that we shall be able to implement these measures.
My political group has proposed this series of measures in this resolution, and I hope that they will be approved by plenary.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I should like to thank the Commissioner for his understanding remarks about an extremely serious problem in Spain which, in my own region of Aragon, as well as in the Pyrenees, is coming to a head in a way that may have a series of repercussions over the next few years.
I also want to say that this is due in part to the fact that the previous government did not put the plans relating to drought into effect.
These were to have been fully implemented by 2003, and we are attempting right now to make up for this failure.
We must, however, focus in any case on current measures with a view to the future, and it must also be said that the government has now already made contact with the services of the Commission, even if it has not yet got the assessment under way in practical terms.
This is because the frost damage is being assessed throughout the south.
A start has now been made on assessing the impact in the north of Spain, specifically throughout the northern half of Spain.
As I said, our government has already been in contact with your services, and the interventions both of our government and of Commissioner Fischer Boel in recent days are a specific incentive to conclude this assessment, which was obviously going to require more time than had been expected because of the problems I mentioned, relating to the frost.
The measures proposed by our Socialist Group in the European Parliament are, specifically, this flexibility that the Commission is planning to apply, the anticipated aid, the release of grain reserves for livestock â which are also in a very critical situation â and flexibility in also making available to such livestock fields and pastureland that have been taken out of cultivation.
We also put forward the proposal â and I hope that the Commission will be alert to this â for special attention to be paid to preventing the fire risk that, throughout the northern part of Spain and especially in Galicia, will increase over the next few months, and we should naturally also like to demand or propose that special consideration be given to the problem of drought in the context of the Solidarity Fund, which is now being adapted.
Finally, we would ask the Commission to establish a European Drought Observatory because we believe that this drought is neither unique nor peculiar to the present time but that, precisely because of the climate change that is under way, it will become a structural phenomenon.
We would ask the Commission, then, to coordinate all the preventive and remedial actions and all other possible measures, from the environmental to the agricultural, in order to ensure that this European Drought Observatory can prevent future problems.
Â Â  MrÂ President, this resolution begins with a long list of the problems that have affected Spain.
Unfortunately, these are no isolated phenomena.
We remember the heatwave in France last year.
The fact is that nine of the ten hottest years during the last 500 years have now occurred during the last ten years.
Moreover, it is not good enough merely to alter agricultural policy in order to compensate farmers who are affected.
We must have plans for dealing with disasters, but the big plan expected of us in this House today by future generations is one designed to combat climate change.
Otherwise, what has happened in Spain will just be the first in a long list of disasters in which people, animals and natural features suffer as a result of climate change.
Climate research shows unambiguously that not even our ambitious objective of a no more than two-degree temperature increase will be achieved with the objectives we have set for emissions reductions.
On the contrary, a much more vigorous policy is required.
We must not adjust policy in the wake of disasters.
Rather, we must adjust policy in order to remove the reason why disasters occur.
The former Spanish Government, which for a long time fought EU initiatives to introduce climate taxes and to alter the energy system with a view to protecting the climate, must, in actual fact, be criticised on this point.
If this fight against constructive work on climate change continues, Spain will be hit on further occasions too.
I therefore hope that, on behalf both of future generations of Spaniards and of people in the rest of the world, the Spanish Government will now place itself in the forefront of combating climate change on our earth.
Â Â  â I should first like to apologise on behalf of Mr Meyer, a Spanish Member of my group, the Confederal Group of the European United Left â Nordic Green Left, who is not able to take part in this debate, due to the air transport problems that you mentioned, Mr President.
In any event, the problem of the drought in Spain is also a problem in Portugal.
The entire Iberian Peninsula is suffering the consequences of the drought that has already lasted for many months and that, in tandem with the frost, has had a devastating effect on vegetables, flowers, grasses and fruit trees, and on livestock and certain manufacturing sectors.
In many towns in Portugal, however, there is even a risk that there will not be enough water to supply the population.
I should therefore like to stress at this point that water is an irreplaceable public asset and a universal human right, which must be protected and which must not, under any circumstances, be treated as merchandise.
In addition to standing shoulder to shoulder with Spanish and Portuguese arable and livestock farmers, we are also showing solidarity with the towns and populations affected by a tragedy that could have serious consequences in the not too distant future.
Whilst it is important to take one-off measures, such measures do not take account of the fact that the situation could last for many more months, due to the shortage of seed and cattle feed.
We are similarly concerned about the risk of forest fires, and various regions are already under threat.
We therefore feel that effective action must be taken, as a matter of urgency.
What is needed is an effective, Community-wide system to protect European farmers from the risks and crises of the situation in Portugal and Spain.
It should be borne in mind that the reform of the common agricultural policy forces farmers to take responsibility for managing the risks that had previously been absorbed by policies supporting the market and prices.
As a result of trade liberalisation, farming is now much more vulnerable to specific risks and crises that are beyond the farmersâ control.
It is therefore not enough to say that a study is due to be carried out into the pilot project study agreed in the 2005 budgetary process to set up a Community insurance scheme.
We must press ahead more quickly with the creation of a compensation mechanism such as a farmersâ insurance scheme financed by Community funds, aimed at offsetting the effects of natural disasters such as droughts and forest fires, by guaranteeing a minimum income for farmers.
We also urge greater openness and flexibility so that resources from the solidarity fund can be used to minimise the damage to production capacity in a large number of regions and to remedy the most serious cases in Portugal and Spain.
That way, the standard of living and economic stability in many regions will not be affected.
There must also be financial support to offset the rise in costs and the reduction in agricultural production and in farmersâ incomes.
Full-time farmers on low incomes must also be temporarily exempt from social security contributions, without loss of rights, and seasonal credits must also be extended for two years, interest-free.
We also feel it is important to look into the possibility of setting up a European Drought Observatory and of taking action to encourage people to use water more sensibly.
Â Â  â Mr President, on the occasion of my first speech in this House with you in the chair, I should like, if I may, to heartily congratulate you on your election and to say not only that I hold you in high regard, but also that I consider you a great friend.
Ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, on 14Â April, in this House of European Democracy, Mr Casaca expressed his solidarity with the people worst affected by the drought, especially the farmers of the South of Portugal and the region, as well as the farmers of regions such as Seville, Huelva, Badajoz and CÃ¡ceres.
Unfortunately, drought cuts across national borders.
This is a genuine, large-scale, natural disaster, on which the European institutions, and consequently Parliament, must focus a great deal of attention.
Accordingly, to pick up last monthâs debate, we wish to restate our solidarity with Spain and with Spanish farmers.
Crop and livestock farmers, and producers of forest products, must be compensated for the considerable losses that they have suffered and will continue to suffer.
We must minimise the effects of the drought suffered by workers who depend on crops, livestock and forests and who have already lost their jobs, or whose jobs are under serious threat.
In Spain and in Portugal, exceptional measures must urgently be taken to promote jobs in the affected areas.
In my country, the Farming, Food and Forestry Union puts the number of workers who have already lost their jobs, or are in danger of losing their jobs, at 50Â 000.
This situation is expected to worsen as stocks in water protection areas and in groundwater run out, and given the impossibility of operating irrigation channels.
In Portugal and in Spain, it is the oak groves that are under the greatest threat.
Thousands of Iberian oak and holly oak trees are in the throes of death.
Major regions of the Iberian Peninsula are on the brink of desertification.
We are not embellishing a situation that is genuinely dramatic.
My description of events is based purely and simply on objective facts and realistic parameters.
Desperate times call for desperate measures.
The European institutions have not ignored this disaster.
The Commission, for example, has committed itself to providing assistance in its resolution, which we note and welcome.
At European level, however, we must do more and do better; the support that has been offered must be stepped up and a multifaceted programme of action â given that the situation is complicated by a wide variety of factors â must be drawn up and implemented.
The Europe that we are constructing must be a thing of great substance, hence my words today, which are both an overview and a call for action; an overview and a call for action not addressed to the deaf and the mute, but to each and every one of you, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner.
I address these remarks primarily to your conscience, as free, fair and fraternal men and women.
We are counting on you.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, I believe that we are all aware of the same problem and that we all know that this is not a problem for political parties but a problem at state level for each of our countries.
It is a European problem, the tackling of which has, for many years, been postponed when dealing with overall policy.
I think it is very important to bear in mind that drought is a disaster which, moreover, also afflicts areas least able to be defended against water shortages or bouts of frost.
My fellow MEPs have already talked about the tragedy of losing more than EURÂ 2Â 000 million.
For myself, I should like, however, also to talk about the human factor.
I walk every weekend through my own region and know what it is to see black trees that will never grow again.
I know the nature of a people like that of the Mediterranean region in which those with substantial farms, in many cases on the verge of retiring from farming with no one to take over from them, also think that the trees being planted will take more than six years to grow.
As a result of this disaster, much of the land will go uncultivated and will be liable to end up as mere desert.
Let us not forget â and this is an important factor â that, in the future impact assessment, due weight will need to be given to the fact that it is, for example, the very olive groves and almond trees that are key factors in preventing desertification and preserving the scarce rain in our soil.
Nor must we forget that livestock are dying of thirst.
The other day, a shepherd told me, âtwenty-five per cent of my livestock will be going to the slaughterhouse this year.
I cannot keep so much livestock.
I have no water.
The animals are thirstyâ.
I want to say something more.
The Natura 2000 network, about which Europe is so concerned, is in danger because the wetlands are without water.
Those of us who live at this Mediterranean latitude in Murcia, Valencia or Andalusia know perfectly well that the birds are already no longer heard in the mornings because they have gone to places where they can drink.
Even if householders put water out for them to drink, that is not enough because they lack not only drink but also food.
That much is obvious, and Europe will need to include the fact among the variables it will have to study.
There is a series of measures proposed by the European Union.
I am grateful for what you said, Commissioner, about forestry aid, but let us bear in mind that the summer has not yet begun.
The Mediterranean climate, pitiless as it is, is really going to put us through it because our situation is already critical.
It is May, and it has not rained.
I am also grateful for the idea of a pilot study, but I would point out that such a pilot study will have to be comprehensive.
Not only has my government acted belatedly, but it has taken measures that will exacerbate the situation.
Why?
Specifically because, four years ago, this Commission was presented with a National Hydrological Plan whereby water would be carried to these regions, indeed to the whole of the agricultural area.
The European Commission delayed accepting the plan, the subject became politicised and, in the end, the Spanish Government kept the water where it was.
Water is what, moreover, would have enabled the wetlands to thrive.
It would have created a degree of hope and enabled the trees planted to replace those seriously affected by the frost or drought to grow again.
We now face bleak prospects, a plan having been shelved for entirely political reasons.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to thank all the honourable Members for their reaction to this Commission statement.
I should like to make a number of brief comments:
First of all, the Commission has repeatedly demonstrated that it is flexible and that it uses all the possibilities at its disposal, such as, for example, the Solidarity Fund, which it tried to use in order to respond to requests from various countries including, as I mentioned earlier, Spain in the case of the .
I should like to say to Mr LÃ³pez, as regards the question of insurance, which is extremely important that, as I mentioned in my initial statement, we have set in motion and have in fact already started this study.
We do not yet have any results but, in all events, they will form part of the more general debate on combating and managing the dangers and crises in farming.
In reply to Mrs Figueiredo, I should like to say that, as far as insuring farmers' income is concerned, this runs counter to the principle behind the revised Community agricultural policy and most of the issues she referred to come within the jurisdiction of the Member States.
In all events, as I said in my initial statement, the national government has the facility, without any other procedure, to pay EUR 3Â 000 to farmers who have sustained losses.
Mr Schlyter's comments on the adjustments needed in various countries in order to combat climate change are absolutely correct.
In Buenos Aires we agreed, within the framework of the United Nations, on the adjustments needed in all countries, especially in very poor countries, which have trouble meeting requirements caused by the overheating of the planet and, of course, in the Member States of the European Union, where measures of this sort are needed.
It should be noted that the Mediterranean will face an even bigger problem from climate change, given that the temperature has risen over the last 100 years by 0.6Â°C in the world as a whole, but by approximately 0.9Â°C in the Mediterranean.
In other words, we had a far bigger increase in temperature and, as a result, many more problems, including the problem of drought.
That is why Mrs Ayala's proposal on a drought and forest fire observatory is very interesting.
The Commission is examining this proposal and evaluating the possibility of creating such an observatory, but has not taken a decision in this respect.
Finally, I should like to mention that the Commission is particularly concerned about the situation prevailing in Spain.
We have already taken a number of actions to help farmers and their families, which will, in turn, help the agricultural economies which have been hit.
For the time being, preliminary preparations are being made for a number of additional actions and, at the same time, my colleague and Commissioner with jurisdiction, Mrs Fischer Boel, is in close contact with the Spanish Minister of Agriculture.
I have taken note of the various important comments made and, of course, I shall pass them on to my colleague who, I am sure, will take them into serious account.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I want to say to the Commissioner that, previously, when he remarked that they had not received the letter from the Spanish authorities, I was rather confused because I had been told that it had in fact been sent.
I have now confirmed this.
The letter from the Spanish authorities was in fact sent out last week, so that, if it has not yet arrived in the Commissionâs post, it should be about to do so.
Â Â  I have received four motions for resolutions to close the debate, in accordance with Rule 108(5).(1)
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place immediately following the ongoing debates.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Togo.(1)
Â Â  . I represent Scotland, on the north-west frontier of our European continent.
We recreated our Scottish democracy in 1999 with the establishment of the Scots Parliament, when it was reconvened by my party president and former Member of this House, Winnie Ewing, with the words: 'The Scottish Parliament, adjourned in 1707, is hereby reconvened'.
So why am I raising the subject of Togo and the situation there within this House?
Because my internationalist party is appalled by injustice wherever it occurs, and it is up to us within this House to shoulder our global responsibilities.
Since 1999, other countries across Europe have rediscovered democracy.
Ukraine, Georgia and others have looked to the EU for inspiration, guidance and support, as they have stepped towards democracy.
Therefore, it is all the more important that our European Union does not lapse into double standards.
My group and I fear that in the case of Togo the EU could be on the verge of doing precisely that.
I would refer you to our motion for a resolution and I commend it to you.
Last month's presidential election in Togo, on 24 April, has been marred by allegations of massive vote fraud, even including allegations that almost a million phantom voters were created, swelling the ranks of those eligible to vote by one third.
The response of the EU to this, and to the resulting deterioration within Togo itself, is in marked contrast to the inspirational response of this House and our European Union to the situation in Ukraine.
In a statement last Friday, our European Commissioner, Mr Michel, said that the EU would be watching to see whether Togo complied with pledges it made last year to respect human rights and public liberties.
My group says that we need to do more than watch.
Our resolution sets out rational, reasonable, sensible and constructive measures, which we in the EU could take to support Togo.
I am glad the Commission is committed to watch.
What my group wants to know is: what is it going to do?
Â Â  . Mr President, on 21 April, at Bamako in Mali, a neighbouring country to Togo, a meeting was held of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly of the EU and the African, Caribbean and Pacific states.
Three days before Togo went to the polls, we had vigorous debates on the situation there.
The situation was, unfortunately, that, of the two sides in the debate, the Europeans took the view that something was amiss in Togo, while most of the African delegates, in particular, protested when we tried to declare in advance of the election that it was neither free nor fair.
We were, unfortunately, right, for it was clear even before the election that no attempt was being made to keep to what had been agreed with help of the regional economic union in West Africa, ECOWAS, namely that opposition parties would be allowed to take part in the preparations for the election.
It was noted that up to a million extra voters suddenly materialised, that the issue of electoral registration cards was far from transparent, and that votersâ registers were hardly, if at all, checked.
Incidents of violence ensued.
We unequivocally demand that the Togolese Government, which bears full responsibility for this, should, along with all the interested parties, return to the negotiating table.
We call on it to arrest those involved in inciting violence.
We take the view that what we saw happening in that election cannot justify a resumption of the European Unionâs cooperation with Togo.
Under these circumstances, that is not possible.
We therefore call on the Commission to make it quite plain to Togo how that country is to conduct itself in the coming months, so that the people there may be in no doubt about what line we take.
Â Â  . â Mr President, the narrow strip of land on the west coast of Africa has been on the receiving end of criticism for many years now from the international community for systematically violating human rights and for irregularities in political governance.
Although the political parties were formally legalised in 1991 and there has been a constitution since 1992, large international organisations, such as the United Nations, the Economic Community of West African States and the African Union, complain that there is systematic violation of human rights.
Of course, violation of human rights is nothing new in this part of the world; it has been taking place for a great many years, for the 38-year long dictatorship of the then president, who was succeeded, when he died, by his son, who was elected as president in the recent elections.
The outcome of the elections is of course the result of forgery.
I do not think that there can be any doubt about that and, of course, it was the reason for the outbreak of unbridled violence, which has already cost over one hundred lives and forced eighteen and a half thousand refugees to flee to neighbouring counties.
The European Union is rightly calling on all the political powers and institutions to demonstrate a sense of responsibility by showing full respect for human rights.
Without fail, the twenty-two commitments which the Togo Government made and signed during consultations under Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement on the question of respect for human rights must be honoured in every possible way.
I support today's motion for a resolution which, among other things, accepts that action by all the European Member States of the European Union must be united and that statements must be avoided which are of no material help and merely give rise to reactions in the area.
Â Â  . Mr President, the presidential elections held on 24 April in Togo were subject to serious irregularities, as a consequence of which there was an outbreak of violence resulting in many deaths and injuries.
In addition, thousands of people fearing for their lives fled Togo for neighbouring Benin and Ghana.
Togo has suffered election violence on several occasions in the past because the previous dictator-president, father of the current president, repeatedly rigged the polls in his own favour.
According to Amnesty International, several hundred opposition supporters were massacred by state security forces during the 1998 election.
Opposition supporters claim that similar attacks by the security forces are taking place today.
In order to stop the present escalation of violence in the country and prevent similar shameful events from taking place in the future, we join our voice with those calling for, amongst other things, the establishment of a national unity government in Togo and the speedy implementation of constitutional and electoral reforms.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the commitment and action of the European Union â particularly of the Commission and the Council â should be focused both on censuring usurping governments â identifying any foreign intervention â and on encouraging the cancellation of debts owed to the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank â particularly by means of support for international trade through an equitable and joint formula.
Instead of sending relief aid and calling on NGOs for support for development projects, moreover, Member States should commit themselves directly to training efforts in the country and to the better use of agricultural resources, by exporting European technologies and expertise.
The Union could, for instance, directly organise technical teams, made up of recent graduates or senior citizens with experience, who are specialists in building infrastructures, in the food processing industry and in other sectors that are vital for the development of Togo and other similar countries.
We vote in favour of the resolution.
Â Â  . Mr President, the presidential elections held in Togo on 24Â April of this year gave rise to bitter controversy, with accusations of vote-rigging and violence.
The Commission has associated itself with strong condemnations of the riots and violence against civilians that followed the announcement of the provisional results and which left a reported number of 50 dead and 300 injured.
The violence and the brutal repression by military forces also caused 23Â 000 Togolese to take refuge in neighbouring Benin and Ghana.
Given the very tight electoral timetable, under which elections had to take place within 60 days of President Eyademaâs death, the European Union could not send an electoral observation mission that would have met our usual standards of observation.
The European Union abstained from any pronouncement on the fairness and transparency of the vote.
Admittedly, many problems arose during the preparation of the elections, and irregularities were reported by the Ecowas electoral observation mission on election day.
Today, we believe that the utmost priority is the re-establishment of calm and stability and the prevention of any further violence.
In order to achieve this, we attach paramount importance to the fulfilment of the 22 commitments undertaken by the Government as a result of the consultations held under ArticleÂ 96 of the Cotonou Agreement.
These commitments include respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms, namely press and media freedom, as well as a true political dialogue with all political protagonists in Togo, with a view to preparing the next legislative elections.
We believe that the effective implementation of the 22 commitments, with close scrutiny from the European Union, as well as from the international community, will allow the country to progress towards national reconciliation and democratic development.
In conclusion, I would like to assure you and Mr Smith that we are not just watching, but we have decided that the conditions for the redemption of cooperation established by the Council decision of 14 November 2004 remain valid.
Such a resumption can only take place in the context of the fulfilment of the 22 commitments I just referred to.
More specifically, full resumption will not be possible until free, fair and transparent legislative elections, held in an electoral framework accepted by all parties, have taken place.
The Commission is ready to give its support to the holding of such elections, including the sending of a European Union electoral observation mission.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place immediately after the ongoing debates.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on violations of human rights and democracy in the Republic of Mari El in the Russian Federation.(1)
Â Â  . Mr President, when I speak about the troubles of the Mari El minority in Russia, it is not my aim to blame, once more, the Russian authorities.
Russia is not a member of our Community.
One can say that it has more than enough problems without my criticism.
The situation of the Russian minority in some European countries is also worrying - perhaps, sometime, we can discuss that as well.
However, this afternoon we are talking about a small Finno-Ugric nation somewhere in the huge Russia.
Around 750 000 Maris live in the Republic of Mari El inside the Russian Federation.
The autonomous Republic is named after them, but they happened to become a minority in their own land.
In a country with fair minority rights it is not a problem, but that is not the case in the small Republic of Mari El.
The Russian-speaking majority elected a Russian president against a Mari candidate, which can be understood.
However, the re-elected president seems to lead an undemocratic and brutal fight against his opposition and, through them, the whole Mari community.
Mari opposition newspapers can be printed only outside of the Republic.
Opposition journalists and intellectuals have been attacked frequently; some of them have been killed.
Minority language education is threatened by the local authorities.
We have to condemn those kinds of anti-democratic atrocities always, but in the case of a small nation, the attacks against the basic national institutions, such as schools and media, threaten the very existence of the nation.
That is why we condemn the violence against the Mari minority in Russia, and that is why we ask the Russian Government to show the same kind of attitude toward its minorities that the Russian Government would like to be provided for the Russian minorities elsewhere in Europe.
I believe this is the first time that the name of the Mari people has been mentioned in the European Parliament.
I welcome them here, both as a European and a Finno-Ugric brother from Hungary.
I wish them all the best.
They should know that a nation, small or big, inside or outside of Europe, deserves the same respect and the same rights.
I hope our Russian partners also understand that every minority â Russians out of Russia and non-Russians inside Russia â deserve the same rights to save their identity, culture and linguistic heritage.
Â Â  . Mr President, many nations share the same linguistic roots.
Connected with that is a respect for oneâs native language.
Moreover, using oneâs own language creates a sense of security.
A personâs language is the basis of his or her culture.
Culture is language-bound and language is culture-bound.
Certain events in the region of Mari El, in Russia, have caused us, as Finno-Ugric linguistic relatives of the Mari people, to focus our attention on the status of minorities and minority languages in Russia.
This is also a matter of democracy.
Democracy is not just about voting.
Democracy also means working on issues with others and being able to use oneâs own language.
The events that have taken place in Mari El, which are clearly associated with violence and human rights violations, need to be made the subject of a local criminal investigation.
This will increase Russiaâs credibility as a state subject to the rule of law.
There are three Finno-Ugric nation states in the European Union, and in addition there are three million people representing the Finno-Ugric nations in Russia.
There are seven countries in Europe with populations smaller than that of the Finno-Ugric peoples in Russia.
These representatives of the Finno-Ugric nations in Russia are, however, spread over many regions in a large country.
In this connection, we could talk far more generally about safeguarding the position of minorities and languages in Russia.
We hope that the state authorities in Russia will give more support than they do now to school attendance and studying in oneâs own language.
Cultural and linguistic diversity is a source of immense wealth in Russia, and we hope that it will be exploited better than it is now, and more than it is now.
Â Â  . Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the Greens, I would like to make a brief statement on this motion for a resolution.
I am glad to see all parties making clear their unanimous and unequivocal position on this matter.
When fundamental democratic rights and issues of civil and minority rights are at stake, any appeal to reasons of state or economic interest is false and inadmissible.
I am from the South Tyrol, a region with ethnic minorities, and, in comparison with many others, it is now in a privileged position.
Particularly now, 60Â years after our liberation from fascism and National Socialism, we still remember well how the state used the traditional forms of oppression to discriminate against minorities, including the banning of political opposition, attacks on the media through the intimidation of journalists, putting at a disadvantage all who did not speak the official language, outlawing mother-tongue education, the courtsâ unwillingness to act against such injustices, and so on.
State power uses always the same means of oppression against minorities, for whom solidarity from outside is very important, and so I very much welcome this Houseâs outcry today against the Russification of the Republic of Mari El.
The Mari speakers are a small linguistic group, and need a great deal of solidarity from the international community.
Â Â  . Mr President, Czarist Russia was nicknamed the prison of nations, and the Soviet Union was called the gulag of nations.
Unfortunately, the collapse of Communism did not bring about freedom, nor did it grant rights to the small nations of Russia.
At a conference at the end of last week, Vladimir Kozlov, one of the leaders of todayâs opposition, said that real ethnic cleansing is being carried out in the Republic of Mari, especially in administration, the overt goal of which is the elimination of the autonomous Mari Republic.
His statement is of no surprise, since the current president of the Republic of Mari is a Russian citizen, the Moscow-born MrÂ Leonid Markelov, who does not even speak the local language.
During his presidency, attacks against free press have become regular, opposition leaders and journalists have been assaulted, including the opposition candidate, Mihail Dolgov, a Mari national, who was brutally assaulted.
By the way, no judicial verdict has been reached in any of these cases yet.
Mari language schools are being closed down, and education in the Mari language is only allowed in the primary levels of elementary education.
Only Russian can be used in administration, all of this pointing to the fact that this minorityâs rights are seriously restricted.
An agreement, called the action plan, was ceremoniously concluded between the EU and Russia the day before yesterday.
At last, we have an opportunity to provide direct assistance to those who live there, instead of just condemning Russiaâs practice.
This plan allows us to cooperate in the field of minority rights, that is, to promote the use of minority languages, preservation of cultures, the publication of textbooks, to encourage exchange programmes, scientific and scholarship schemes, and to foster an independent media and education in the mother tongue.
This action plan also promotes strengthening an independent and unbiased judicial system.
We must, therefore, help Russia in order for the offenders to be brought to justice, so that order and safety may finally prevail in the Republic of Mari as well.
For this reason, I would like to ask the Commission and the Council to act firmly and provide specific programmes to protect the maltreated Mari minority based on the new agreement.
Â Â  .Â Â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, today we are debating yet another issue that one might well call sensitive.
We are being called upon to consider the life and tragedy of a small nation that has, quite frankly, been conquered by Russia.
Ever since the 16th century, Russia has adopted a different approach to national expansion from that of the colonial powers.
Although the latter gained power over various countries throughout the world, they did not generally believe that these countries should be fully integrated with the colonial homeland and robbed of their cultural, national and linguistic identities.
Russia approached the matter differently, by immediately deciding to Russify every country it conquered, and to deprive the country of its identity and the inhabitants of their religion and language.
Russia took this approach towards Poland in the 19thÂ century, and the Poles suffered a great deal as a result.
As a rule, Russiaâs attempts to Russify the country were extremely cruel, as they consisted in exiling tens and hundreds of thousands of people.
Although some of them were simply encouraged to leave, many were brutally forced to do so, with Russians then arriving to take their place.
There was a sharp rise in such practices when the Communists came to power following the October Revolution, as it was then that Russia decided to intensify efforts to Russify all of the countries under its rule.
The small Finno-Ugric nation we are discussing today, namely the Republic of Mari El, also fell victim to Russia.
This small republic is now entirely under the control of the Russians who went to live there, and its original inhabitants, the Finno-Ugric people, are now nothing more than a persecuted minority.
I would remind the House that the same is in fact true in those countries that have freed themselves from Russian rule.
The majority of the people in these countries still belong to the original population, rather than being Russian, but there is a powerful Russian minority that does not view itself as being in any way integrated.
This kind of situation can be seen in Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, where the Russian minorities are determined to make their presence felt, regardless of the interests of the countries in which they live.
One need only pick up a newspaper in any of these countries to see that the Russian populations are antagonistic or downright hostile to their countries of residence.
These populations frequently claim rights that in any other circumstances we would acknowledge, yet a prerequisite for the acknowledgement of such rights is that the people concerned demonstrate at least minumum loyalty towards the countries in which they live.
Matters are even worse in the Republic of Mari El, as Russians now form the majority, and the original population has become a persecuted minority.
Journalists are murdered, there are not enough schools, it is impossible to receive an education and anyone who speaks out in favour of the Finno-Ugric population is persecuted.
We must ensure that a balance is achieved between the rights of the original owners of the country and those of the democratic majority.
The latter is in fact simply an occupying force, and it must not be allowed to tyrannise and persecute the minority of original inhabitants.
Â Â  . Mr President, I am very happy that almost all political groups have joined forces in this Chamber to address this very serious and alarming problem.
In the Russian Federation there are 19 different nations of the Finno-Ugric family, totalling 2.7 million persons.
All are minorities in their respective autonomous republics.
There are serious obstacles to the practical implementation of the cultural and educational rights of these minorities.
For example, education in the Mari language is provided only in some elementary schools, so that only about 20% of children can enjoy lessons in their mother tongue.
The publication of textbooks in Mari is practically non-existent.
So the linguistic identity of the Mari is slowly fading.
I am also concerned about political developments in Mari El Republic.
Last December, the local president, Leonid Markelov, considered to be a strong pro-Moscow politician to the detriment of native cultural autonomy, was re-elected.
When the Mari ethnic opposition, led by MrÂ Vladimir Kozlov, questioned the fairness of the election results, Mr Kozlov was brutally beaten up.
There has still been no satisfactory investigation into that act of violence.
Alarmingly, independent journalists have been harassed for a considerable period of time; three of them were murdered in 2001, many others have been intimidated and their papers forced to close down.
Also, as a result of the recent elections, several Mari school directors and civil servants of Mari background have lost their jobs.
School directors were forced to give explanations as to why people in their areas voted for the opposition candidate.
A considerable number of MEPs have signed an appeal in support of the cultural rights of Mari people.
This appeal has collected almost 10Â 000 signatures.
The point of our resolution is to call on the Russian authorities to respect their obligations under international law and 'to provide quality education in one's native language on all levels, thus securing that the Mari language and Russian are placed on the same footing throughout the Republic.'
Â Â  Mr President, both Russia and its predecessor, the Soviet Union, have always practised a homogenising policy: the notion of Russian authority dislikes diversity.
During its course of history, the Mari nation, for the most part, has successfully withstood assimilation, and has effectively fought to preserve its own language and identity.
After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the situation of Mari El, the Republic of Mari, was promising.
However, it did not last long, eight to nine years, perhaps, when a new anti-diversity policy was launched by Russia.
The Mari nationâs hope for enjoying equal rights with Russians was shattered.
The Mari language is excluded from the public sphere, education and the media and Mari activists are harassed, assaulted and forced to leave Mari El.
Although it would be absolutely necessary for the central authority to intervene, there is no sign of it at all.
Either ignorance or the tacit acceptance of anti-Mari campaigning prevails.
Pressure on Maris has considerably increased this past year.
This proposalâs goal is to send a multi-dimensional signal towards, firstly, Moscow as a reminder of its commitment to preserve the cultural diversity of its minorities instead of eliminating them.
Secondly, this signal would also be directed to the Russian elite living in Mari El to remind them that it is not possible to launch minority oppression unnoticed in the 21st century.
Thirdly, toward the Mari people to reassure them that the European public is attentively monitoring their hardships, and is ready to support their cause.
Â Â  .Â Â Â The violations of human rights and democracy we are debating today are taking place in the small Republic of Mari El, which is part of the Russian Federation.
Unfortunately, this Republic belongs to the Mari only in name, as it is one of the numerous countries and nations that have been subordinated and annexed by Russia.
Like the Armenians, the Chechens and many others, the Mari people have fought for years to retain their identity and independence.
Even though the Mari ASSR declared its sovereignty in 1990, the situation of this nation is unfortunately becoming ever more difficult.
Its inhabitants, known to us all from Russian and Polish literature as the Cheremis, speak a Finno-Ugric language.
They have repeatedly been the victims of repressive measures, particularly during the Stalin era, when Komsomol groups chopped down their holy groves and the Mari were exiled to Siberia.
It is for this reason that only half of the Mari people currently lives in the Republic of Mari El, with the rest scattered around Russia and forced to integrate with the Russian population.
PresidentÂ Markelov, who rules over the Republic of Mari El, came to power following a controversial election.
He was born in Moscow and does not identify himself in any way with the nation, and in fact cannot even speak Mari.
He systematically curtails the rights of the population, in particular with regard to freedom of speech.
The Mari people find it difficult to receive education in their own language, as Mari schools have been closed and there are not enough schools or universities.
Ethnic Mari civil servants have lost their jobs, and opposition journalists suffer persecution, as do the independent, private media.
This has prompted them to seek help, both from the Finno-Ugric nations of Finland and Estonia, with which they share many cultural similarities, and from the European Parliament.
The Mari people have a right to sovereignty, independence and their own identity, as do all those fighting for the independence of countries and nations in the former USSR and elsewhere in the world.
We are therefore opposed to the persecution they are suffering, as well as to the attempts at denationalisation and human rights violations that are taking place in the country.
Although history provides us with many examples of the spirit and staying power of occupied nations, and even though their efforts have often been crowned with success, the price of such success is frequently the suffering and death of a large number of people.
As the late Holy Father John Paul II once said, one nation must never expand at the expense of another, that is at the expense of another nationâs subordination, conquest, coercion, exploitation and death.
If different countries and nations are forced to live together under one government, sooner or later this will always result in a threat to peace and a struggle for independence and sovereignty.
An emerging superpower like the European Union would do well to heed this warning.
Â Â  Â  Â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, European standards should be observed across the whole of Europe, Russia included.
The right of all peoples to use their own language, to preserve their cultural identity and to promote their own culture, even if the language and culture involved are those of a very small nation, is one of these standards.
Russia signed the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages exactly four years and two days ago.
It is therefore by no means unreasonable to call on Russia to respect the Mari language, which has been officially recognised as the language of the Republic of Mari El.
This is especially important with regard to secondary schools and universities, where respect for the Mari language is currently lacking.
The repressive measures taken against head teachers and journalists who have defended the sovereignty of this small nation are also a particular cause for concern.
We have no desire to chastise Russia, as it is a country with which we wish to cooperate closely.
Yet we cannot shut our eyes and ears to human rights violations, wherever in Europe they occur.
We cannot sacrifice human rights and the rights of minorities for the sake of cooperation with Moscow.
Â Â  . Mr President, the Commission is generally aware of the situation of the Finno-Ugric indigenous populations such as the Maris.
We also know about the problems raised by certain Members of the European Parliament in connection with the treatment of Maris â the problems aired again here today â and, specifically, as regards the Mari language in schools, the obstruction of the media and the recent presidential elections in December 2004.
The Commission considers that common values, including respect for human rights, are the cornerstone of its relations with Russia.
During the EU/Russia summit in The Hague in November 2004, Presidents Putin and Barroso agreed to hold regular consultations between the European Union and Russia on human and minority rights and fundamental freedoms.
The Commission's objective is to use these consultations to strengthen the open and constructive dialogue with Russia on all related matters.
A first round of these consultations was held on 1 May 2005 in Luxembourg.
During this meeting, certain matters were examined, including the human rights situation, the rights of people who belong to minorities and fundamental freedoms in the Russian Federation and the European Union.
We are also engaging in a constructive exchange of information about matters relating to cooperation on human rights in international fora, especially in the UN Commission on Human Rights, the Council of Europe and the OSCE.
The Commission considers that these consultations with Russia provide an appropriate framework for more detailed talks with the Russian authorities about the situation of the Maris.
For this, however, more information will be needed and, consequently, information and analyses by Members of Parliament are welcome.
Finally, I should like to inform you that the next round of consultations with Russia on human rights, the rights of people who belong to minorities and fundamental freedoms will probably be held in the second half of 2005 under the United Kingdom Presidency.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place immediately after the ongoing debates.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Burma/Myanmar.(1)
Â Â  .Â Â Â The international community should not tolerate the violations of human rights that are taking place in Burma.
During the 40 years in which Burma has been under military rule and forced to follow the âBurmese way to socialismâ, the country has gone from being one of the richest and best-educated in South-East Asia to one of the poorest.
The Burmese generals who rule the country, which is one of the most repressive dictatorships in the world, have resisted any kind of pressure from the international community for the past 10Â years.
Aspects of the Burmese regime that should be particularly condemned include the Burmese generalsâ fight against the opposition, the use of chemical weapons by the Burmese army, the failure of the country to cooperate in any way with international organisations, the persecution of ethnic minorities and the political arrests.
It is well known that political prisoners, who number around 1Â 300, are tortured during interrogations, and international standards of justice are not observed in political life.
Forced labour is an extremely common occurrence, with 800Â 000Â Burmese citizens affected every day.
Furthermore, restrictions have been imposed on citizensâ freedom of opinion, movement, information and assembly, as well as on participation in political life.
The Burmese education system is falling apart.
Since 1988, more universities have closed than have opened, due to fears that students will become politically active.
Half of the state budget is spent on the military and on maintaining a 400Â 000-strong army, even though the country is not presently at war.
The number of children forced to serve in the army stands at 77Â 000, and many of them join when they are only 11.
Only a very small fraction of the budget is set aside for medical care, and the medical sector is in a disastrous state, with a shortage of basic medicines and qualified staff.
Another major problem is the sexual exploitation of young women, girls and children from ethnic minorities.
Given these problems, it would appear that the only chance we have of ensuring that the regime starts to make the necessary changes is to impose tough economic sanctions, targeted at strategic sectors where the regime holds a monopoly, such as oil, gas, timber, the extractive industries, and marine products.
UN diplomatic measures are also needed.
In fact the UN and the European Union both have a moral duty to intervene and even to interfere in the domestic affairs of a country that commits such gross violations of human rights.
Â Â  . Mr President, the Burmese people continue to suffer extensively under inhuman repression practised by a long-lasting authoritarian military government.
Thousands of political prisoners are subjected to mistreatment and torture and denied access to a lawyer or a fair trial.
Burma holds the disgraceful record of having more child soldiers than any other country in the world.
It also holds the shameful record of having the world's only imprisoned 60-year-old Nobel Peace Prize recipient, Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi.
On 19 June 2005, her 60th birthday, this remarkable lady will have spent a total of 2Â 523 days in detention.
Gross violations have been committed by the Burmese army against ethnic minorities, including summary executions, torture and rape.
An estimated one million people have been internally displaced and several hundreds of thousands have fled to neighbouring countries.
The organised violence exercised by soldiers against women, including young girls, in areas of internal conflict, is a well-known atrocity in Burma.
Hundreds of cases have been documented, with a high percentage of these cases involving gang rape and, in many cases, resulting in the killing of the victim.
The ALDE Group has long supported Mrs Suu Kyi's efforts to bring democracy to her country, and we call for her immediate release from detention.
In addition, my Group wishes to see an increased role for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees in the refugee camps along the Thai-Burmese border and a permanent UN Human Rights Monitor in eastern Burma to investigate thoroughly human rights violations.
Furthermore, the ALDE Group will continue to urge the European Union to take every opportunity to put pressure on the Burmese junta to restore democracy in the country.
We also support the tourist boycott of Burma and are in favour of the targeted imposition of economic sanctions on Burma in order to encourage a speedy democratic reform.
Â Â  . Mr President, here we are at the end of a week full of anniversaries and memories, for it was 60 years ago that National Socialism was defeated and Europe liberated, and 15 years ago that the Iron Curtain was rent asunder.
These anniversaries shed a very unflattering light on those who, in former times, kept quiet about oppression or did business with those who inflicted it.
Let us then give some thought to what judgment future generations will pass on those who, today, do likewise, for the Iron Curtain may well no longer be there, but what has been called the Bamboo Curtain, erected by socialist generals around Burma, is still there, and terrible tragedies are being played out behind it, ranging from brutal violations of the human rights of tens upon thousands of political detainees to the targeted deployment of poison gas against the Karen people.
With the use of gas, the attempt is being made to kill off a people or at least to break its spirit.
These are terrible things to be going on in the 21st century, and they impose an obligation upon us.
Two things need to be given particular emphasis.
The first is the urgent necessity of our ensuring that Burma does not take over the presidency of ASEAN in 2006.
ASEAN is in some sense the EUâs offspring, being a federation like the EU, albeit as yet more economic than political, but it is still our most important partner, and it is intolerable that such an important partner organisation should have a murderous regime at its head.
Secondly, we must, by all political, economic and legal means, oppose those who are still unscrupulous enough to do business with such a regime.
The question we must of course always ask ourselves is: what harms the people, and what benefits the people?
Cutting the country off completely is obviously not the right way to go about it, but allowing those in power to shamelessly accumulate wealth, while presenting them with only flimsy paper protests about human rights violations, wrecks Europeâs credibility.
That is why our words must be backed up with deeds.
I appeal to the Commission â and I would say the same thing to the Council â to adopt, once and for all, a tougher approach to dealing with Burma.
Protesting from time to time is useless; instead, we must be systematic in bringing pressure to bear until this repugnant regime is no more.
Â Â  . Mr President, last Saturday, in Burmaâs capital, Rangoon, explosives were detonated in shopping arcades, department stores and in an exhibition centre, killing 11 people and seriously injuring 150 others.
On behalf of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I denounce this resumption of terror.
These attacks show that, since our debate in September 2004, the situation, far from improving, has, tragically, become more acute â something highlighted by Mr Posselt and by other previous speakers.
Burma/Myanmar is a multi-ethnic state, and has been under military rule with scarcely any interruption since 1962.
To this day, the military refuse to allow the National League for Democracy, which won the 1990 elections, to form a government, and the National Assembly meets without democratically elected members.
In February 2005, the leaders of numerous opposition parties and ethnic groups were arrested.
Despite massive international protest, including â on many occasions â from this House, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi is still under house arrest.
Forced labour is so widespread that the International Labour Organisation ILO has called on the EU Member States to reconsider their relations with Burma.
I have to say, Commissioner Dimas, that, with these things going on, I do not understand what the Commission is doing.
During this yearâs âBurma/Myanmar Dayâ, you presented a report that held out the prospect of increased economic and social cooperation with the regime.
The EU is a community of values, first among them the protection of human rights and the safeguarding of democracy.
If the EU wants to be able to make a tangible contribution, let it appoint a Special Envoy for Burma.
At long last, there must be dialogue between the military junta and the democracy movement.
Ethnic groups and minorities must gain acceptance at long last.
Humanitarian and social evils must be done away with.
Only when there is demonstrable progress in these areas will there be any justification for stepping up aid from the European Union.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to start by pointing out that the Commission shares completely the concerns expressed today by Members of Parliament on the situation in Burma/Îyanmar.
The Commission continues to call for the unconditional release of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and other political prisoners.
It also continues to call on the Burmese regime to participate in a substantive dialogue with all the political parties, including the National League for Democracy and all the ethnic groups.
It is clear that national reconciliation and the restoration of democracy can only be achieved through a transparent and constructive dialogue between all the legitimate interested parties.
That is why the Commission regrets that the terms which might allow the National League for Democracy and all the other legal representatives to participate in the national assembly are not being met.
As no specific positive developments have been noted in respect of the political situation and human rights in the country and given that Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and other political leaders continue to be detained, the common position of the European Union on Burma/Myanmar was renewed on 25 April for a further year.
The serious sanctions against the military regime have been maintained and I can assure the honourable Members of Parliament that all the representatives of the European Union will continue to take every opportunity to raise specific issues, such as human rights, forced labour, the lack of democratic development and the continuing detention of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and other politicians.
At the same time, on the basis of the agreed policy of the European Union, communication channels with the Burmese regime will continue to be kept open.
The European Union is ready for direct, substantive and open talks with the regime during high-level Asia/Europe conferences or bilaterally on the fringes of such conferences.
The recent conference of foreign ministers of ASEAN, the Association of South-East Asian Nations, in Kyoto on 6 and 7 May was an opportunity of the first order to discuss all the European Union's concerns openly and directly with the Burmese leadership.
These discussions took place both during the ASEAN conference itself and between the EU troika and the Burmese foreign minister, Mr Win.
During the meeting between the troika and Foreign Minister Win, he was also given a list of the names of political prisoners about whom the European Union has expressed its concern.
As regards the chairmanship of ASEAN, the Commission continues to hope that significant progress can be made towards national reconciliation and democratisation and the release of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi in the run up to Myanmar's taking over the chairmanship of ASEAN.
There is as yet no agreed EU position on its participation in ASEAN conferences if Burma/Myanmar takes over the chairmanship.
However, it is clear that a good number of countries have reservations about participating in ASEAN regional meetings unless there are decisive positive developments in Burma/Îyanmar before it takes over the chairmanship.
Consequently, the efforts being made by numerous parliamentarians in ASEAN in order to pressure Burma/Myanmar into making political changes before it takes over the chairmanship are particularly encouraging.
Finally, I should like to say a few words about Burma Day, which the Commission organised on 5 April and during which a debate was held on the basis of the independent experts' report prepared by two excellently trained consultants.
Even though the report also refers to EU policy on Burma/Myanmar, the objective of Burma Day 2005 was to focus the debate on the possibilities for providing aid inside Burma/Îyanmar.
This aid will not be channelled through the government; it will be implemented transparently and responsibly through UN agencies and non-government organisations.
EU political sanctions were not debated during Burma Day.
All the speakers were selected on the basis of their ability to contribute to the overall debate on aid and their experience from working inside Burma/Myanmar, not their views on the sanctions.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Â Â  We shall now proceed to the vote.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to make an oral technical amendment.
There is some confusion in this resolution.
In the introduction, it is mentioned that presidential elections took place in the Republic of Mari El on 19 December 2004.
However, in Article 3 of the resolution, where the same presidential elections are mentioned, the date given is 4 February 2005.
In fact, that is the date when the Mari opposition leader was attacked.
I would suggest that in paragraph 3 we delete the date '4 February 2005' and replace it with the correct date of the presidential elections, 19 December 2004.
Â Â  Mr President, I just wanted to ask you to bear in mind, in the next sittings here in Strasbourg, that we should have a quarter of an hourâs break before the vote, thus maintaining the Houseâs dignity through speeches and votes and visits by honoured guests.
A 15-minute break is good for concentration, and I would ask the Bureau to make provision for one in future.
Â Â  This sitting of the European Parliament is suspended.
Â Â  I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 12 May 2005.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, I must begin by informing you that, within the context of our interparliamentary relations, a delegation from the Knesset chaired by Mrs Naomi Blumenthal, Chairperson of the Delegation for Relations with the European Parliament, is visiting the European Parliament.
I would like to welcome Mrs Blumenthal.
I hope that the meetings you have held with Members of the European Parliament have been fruitful, MrsÂ Blumenthal, and that, by means of better reciprocal information, they can contribute to highlighting the conditions necessary for a fair and lasting peace amongst all the parties involved in the conflict between the Israeli and Palestinian people.
Â Â  I must point out that last week two of our Members of Parliament were amongst a group of Europeans who were detained at the Havana airport and were not allowed to enter the country, in which they had arrived on tourist visas with a view to attending the âAssembly to promote civil societyâ.
I must point out that the Presidency had no knowledge of that visit to Cuba, that the said group was not an official parliamentary delegation and that the Presidency was not informed afterwards by the Members in question.
But that will not prevent me from expressing the concern and condemnation that I share with the Commission and the Council with regard to these incidents.
I have raised this issue with the Cuban authorities, but I also believe that I must tell you that the recipient of the European Parliamentâs Sakharov Prize Mr PayÃ¡Â â has been very critical of the said meeting, which he has described as a great fraud against the opposition.
It is no weakness to be courteous, but I believe that we should all seek the best possible information about the political events that we attend.
I would insist that this in no way means that the actions of the Cuban authorities do not warrant condemnation, but I also believe that you should be made aware of this situation and of the opinion of a person to whom this Parliament has paid tribute.
Â Â  Mr President, I feel that this Parliament has the duty to expressly condemn the terrorist car bomb attack this morning in Madrid.
I feel duty bound to completely and roundly condemn this attack on my own behalf and on behalf, I believe, of everybody here.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr Mayor Oreja.
The applause following your comment demonstrates that this Parliament â of course â joins you in your condemnation of the attack this morning, in which, fortunately, nobody has been killed.
Â Â  There are a series of amendments to the agenda, in addition to those announced on 12 May.
These amendments, which appear in the corrigendum that has been distributed, are as follows:
The first debate of the afternoon will be the debate on the motion of censure against the Commission.
The report by Mr Leinen is therefore brought forward and we shall deal with it before the report by Mrs MalmstrÃ¶m, and the report by Mr Skinner will be withdrawn from the agenda.
Â Â  Mr President, I would just like to point out that, while we agree that MrÂ Skinnerâs report should be removed from the agenda, I do ask that care be taken in future to ensure that translation â particularly of draft legislation â is given absolute priority.
We have a major problem not only with translations, but also with interpreting, and often have problems with deadlines if reports of this kind cannot be translated and processed in good time.
I would ask, firstly, that this be noted, and, secondly, that the Skinner report should, if at all possible, go to the top of the list for the June partsession, so that we can consider it before the relevant Council meetings.
Â Â  Alright, Mr Swoboda, you are correct.
It will be included on the agenda for the next partsession.
The reason for its withdrawal, at the request of the rapporteur, is that it was not available in every language, as you have pointed out.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to amplify the point made by Mr Swoboda, as the report on the protection of minorities in an enlarged Europe has also been withdrawn from the agenda because translation was not completed.
I wish to confirm that translation was not completed and to emphasise to the House that a number of reports are now being withdrawn for this reason.
Mr President, will you investigate why this is happening so frequently to Members across this House?
I request that the debate and the vote on the report on the protection of minorities in an enlarged Europe take place in the June I partsession in the presence of the Council.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mr Moraes.
The reason is quite simply the great complexity of working with 20 languages and the problems we sometimes face in having to produce translations into all of them properly and on time.
I regret that we also have to withdraw this report.
We shall deal with it during the next partsession.
Please understand that the only reason is the complexity of this Parliamentâs work.
Â Â  Mr President, it is nice to hear that the rapporteur is said to have withdrawn his report.
In fact he found out about it last night at 9.15 p.m.!
Surely that is not usual in this House, but then perhaps we should expect anything.
Or perhaps it is truer that we have had to make way for the vote of censure today and therefore legislative business comes second in this regard.
It is clearly a problem for this House.
As we know, we have to move this legislation into an important phase; the next meeting of Ecofin can only be held on 7 June, so it will be a very close vote indeed.
I hope that your services will take that into account when you next consider moving legislative items on the agenda.
Â Â  Mr President, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I simply wish to protest against the amendment of the agenda.
The rapporteur has expressed himself on this point.
For my part, I wish to stress that, while we can understand these translation issues, they still disrupt our entire working routine, both in the parliamentary committees and in plenary sittings.
There is a real problem here, and I imagine you will be anxious to resolve it, so that we can settle back into the normal rhythm of parliamentary activity.
As regards the legislative dimension of the draft that has just been withdrawn from the agenda, let me make an additional point.
The Council wanted us to aim for an agreement on this particular instrument at the first reading.
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs took the necessary steps to comply with this wish. The draft was duly adopted in committee, but it still awaits adoption by the House.
I find this regrettable, as do many of my colleagues.
Â Â  I take note of your protest, Mrs BerÃšs.
We will do everything we can to ensure that you do not have to protest again.
Â Â  Mr President, this is not specifically about our agenda for this mini-session but a matter that affects our work generally and therefore the June I partsession.
Many of us suffered disruption to our flights out of Strasbourg on the Thursday of the May I partsession. Could I ask you what steps you have taken to discuss this with the French Government and the authorities at Strasbourg airport to try to ensure that we have smooth and uninterrupted travel to and from Strasbourg?
Many of us go to Strasbourg under protest in the first place, and the fact that it cannot even be ensured that we can get there and back properly is a matter of grave concern.
So, could you please tell us what steps you have taken to ensure that we have trouble-free travel next time?
Â Â  As you know, the difficulty was due to a strike by workers at the airport.
I imagine that Strasbourg airport is not the only airport in which strikes can take place.
I therefore imagine that you have nothing against the right to strike.
To continue with the agenda for tomorrow, Thursday 26Â May, the following amendments will also be introduced:
The final vote on the report by Mr Busk on exceptional market support measures is postponed until a later partsession.
The report by Mr Costa on the Protocol to the Agreement on sea transport between the European Community and China in view of the accession of new countries is withdrawn from the agenda since Parliament has not yet been consulted.
And the report by Mr Leinen on the revision of the Framework Agreement on relations between the European Parliament and the European Commission will be voted on after the reports voted on pursuant to Rule 131 of the Rules of Procedure.
Â Â  We shall proceed to the debate on the first item, the motion of censure presented against the Commission.
I must inform you that this motion of censure, presented on 12 May and announced in plenary, has been amended with regard to the list of Members presenting it, due to the fact that certain new Members have signed it and other Members have withdrawn their signatures.
Nevertheless, the net result is that the number of signatures still exceeds the number required by the European Parliamentâs Rules of Procedure for the presentation of a motion of censure.
Â Â  . Mr President, I wish to say to Mr Barroso that it is nice to see everyone here today.
It has taken some time to organise this gettogether.
I am conscious that many of the Commissioners would much rather be in France campaigning for a âYesâ vote. However, they are here for a very simple reason: I wrote to all of them on 3Â February asking what free holidays and hospitality they had received since becoming European Commissioners â but answers came there none!
Luckily, the newspaper has produced a series of revelations.
It informed us that Mr Barroso had enjoyed a cruise aboard a luxury yacht owned by Spiro Latsis, who has done business with the EU institutions for many years, and whose Lamda shipyards, just one month after this holiday, received the green light from the European Commission for a tenmillioneuro grant.
Just last week a Latsis company â the Aegean Motorways Group â was put on a shortlist of for the lucrative Athens to Thessaloniki motorway project.
I now see that even within the European Commission itself, the head of the Bureau of European Policy Advisers, MrÂ Sidjanski, also speaks for the Latsis Foundation.
Thank goodness for !
We also learned that Mr Mandelson enjoyed a holiday with the lobbyist Peter Brown, and that he also went on a luxury yacht owned by the Microsoft cofounder, Paul Allen.
Last November, at President Barrosoâs inauguration, I asked of this Commission: âWould you buy a used car from them?â.
I suppose I should have said âa luxury yachtâ!
What fairminded person could think that the Commission should police itself in this regard?
I have not accused Mr Barroso or any of the Commissioners of any wrongdoing, but it is a case of Caesarâs wife; it is a case that you have to be seen to be above suspicion.
However, Mr Barrosoâs reaction was one of denial.
He stated in his letter â when it finally arrived â that âhospitality is a normal fact of private lifeâ.
He obviously has a better circle of friends than me, but no matter.
Was the relationship with Mr Latsis really purely personal?
Was there really no conflict of interests?
If that is the case, perhaps Mr Barroso could tell me why he resigned the maritime portfolio shortly thereafter?
I suggest that he did possibly feel compromised.
I hope that Mr Barroso will make some concessions today.
We all hope that he will.
However, he should remember that what we are asking for is full disclosure.
As long ago as 1961, President Kennedy introduced a code of this type into the White House.
It can be done and it should be done!
By ignoring my simple request and by maintaining that these free holidays do not constitute a conflict of interests, Mr Barroso has put himself in an unenviable position.
When in a hole, one should stop digging, and I therefore ask him to give us full disclosure.
However, none of this would have happened if it had not been for the bravery of 77Â Members of this House.
These independently minded people have been subject to very unpleasant threats and bullying.
Mr President, with your permission and pursuant to Rule 141(4), I give way to my colleague, Mr Helmer, to put a question to me.
Â Â  One moment, please.
For the time being, it is for the Presidency to give the floor.
Â Â  . Thank you, Mr President!
Nonetheless, there has been a lot of bullying going on.
The leaders of the four big groups are so blinded by their belief in European integration that they simply cannot accept any criticism, particularly when it comes from dreaded eurosceptics like me.
In fact, there are plenty of people on this list who will vote âYesâ to the Constitution and who believe in the European project.
It is simply a question of having this Parliament do its job!
What is the European Parliament for?
It cannot initiate legislation and it cannot repeal legislation.
What it can do is hire and fire the bosses.
It can hold to account the Commission: â the government of Europe, as I keep being told.
I contend that this Parliament has failed and that it is the leaders of the four big groups who are in fact the guilty parties in this matter.
It happens time and again.
Last November, when I revealed that Commissioner Barrot had recently received a criminal conviction for his part in an embezzlement case, what happened?
I was attacked; I was called a hooligan; I was told I had behaved like a football supporter.
However, all I had done was tell the truth!
In that episode, and in this one, Mr Schulz will say âsomething must be doneâ and, like the Grand old Duke of York, he marches his ten thousand men up the hill, only to get a phone call from Gerhard SchrÃ¶der and march them back down again!
I suppose that there is great irony in all this in that, as a very committed eurosceptic, I have been asked to lead this charge today.
However, this is not an argument about whether the EU is a good thing or a bad thing.
All we, the signatories, want is transparency and proper governmental procedures.
We also want the European Parliament to stand up and to do its job for once!
Â Â  Pursuant to Rule 141(4) of the Rules of Procedure, Mr Helmer may put a question to Mr Farage.
Â Â  Mr President, with your permission, I rise under Rule 141 to put a question to Mr Farage.
I wonder whether he agrees with me that the pressure exerted by the larger groups to have signatures withdrawn from the motion of censure was an affront to democracy and transparency, and brought shame and disrepute on this House?
Does he agree with me that it was particularly discreditable for Mr Poettering to bring such pressure to bear on the British Conservatives, given that we were elected on a manifesto commitment to oppose fraud and corruption?
Finally, does he agree that it was inappropriate for the leader of the British Conservatives to demand withdrawal of Conservative signatures under the threat of âvery serious consequencesâ?
Â Â  Mr President, I agree with what Mr Helmer has just said, which I am sure is a surprise to everyone.
I wish to thank him for illustrating so clearly the kinds of bullying tactics that have been employed.
Frankly, the leaders of the four main groups should be ashamed of themselves for the way they have behaved.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen of the European Parliament, the motion of censure at the heart of this debate is clearly unwarranted and entirely without foundation.
Let me explain why.
Its authors tabled it on the grounds that it was the only way to compel me to come and explain myself to the House on the matter in question.
In fact, you know perfectly well that I am always available to the European Parliament.
I regard my availability as a sign of respect for your institution and of interest in its work and as part of a commitment to openness and transparency.
The fact is that the vast majority of this House, whose views were expressed through the Conference of Presidents, considered that the present matter did not merit a plenary debate.
It took the view that any questions there might be had been adequately and fully answered in my letter of 22Â AprilÂ 2005 to President Borrell.
In other words, all the explanations I was asked to give were provided in good time.
As far as the substance of the matter is concerned, I have nothing to add to the content of that letter.
Last August, together with my family, I spent a week with a former lecturer and friend of mine at the invitation of another mutual friend on the latterâs private yacht in Greece.
My friendship with them goes back more than twenty years to the time when I was at the University of Geneva.
In other words, this is a longstanding personal and academic association that predates my entry into politics, and its character has not changed since then.
Our relations have never involved any sort of business dealings or interests, and I have no knowledge of any link between these friends and the Commission which could justifiably arouse suspicion of a conflict of interests.
The author of this motion of censure maintains that a few days on holiday among friends raises questions regarding a decision taken by the Commission authorising a payment of state aid in Greece and, in more general terms, regarding the Commissionâs code of ethics.
This is a malicious allegation.
There is no link whatsoever between this aspect of my private life and the activities of the Commission.
With regard to the decision authorising the state aid in Greece, let me remind the House that it was taken by the previous college of Commissioners under MrÂ Prodi on the basis of a proposal made by MrÂ Monti at a time when I did not hold any position of responsibility in the Commission, which truly shows how unjust, unwarranted, unfounded and absurd is this motion of censure against the present Commission.
This time lag which the author neglected to mention in the text of the motion which explains why some Members signed the motion without proper knowledge of the facts is clear evidence of deliberate sophistry on the part of the author.
Besides, I must remind you that the incumbent college of Commissioners, at my behest and under my authority, has applied the most stringent set of rules on transparency and conflicts of interest ever to be adopted by any institution of the European Union.
In short, the motion of censure is based on a gratuitous insinuation.
The fact that the members of the Commission can have personal friendships â and, moreover, that the nature of these friendships is exactly the same before and after a Commissionerâs assumption of office and bears no relation to his or her appointment â does not equate to a conflict of interests and cannot be described as such.
The fact that friends and acquaintances of a Commissioner might be affected by Commission policy does not and cannot of itself warrant suspicion of a conflict of interests.
This applies equally to the Commission, to Members of the European Parliament and to members of governments. There is not a single political decisionmaker who has no friends or acquaintances; if the thinking of the authors of this motion were taken to its logical conclusion, the very existence of these links would paralyse every democratic political process.
This, as I have said already and shall say again, would be absurd.
On the other hand, if the censure motion is absurd, why are we debating it today?
Why have I come here, given that my predecessor, for example, sent a representative to the debate on the last motion of censure rather than attending in person?
I have come because I believe it is important to know exactly what this Parliament feels about this type of political manoeuvre.
If I am here, it is because I do not regard this motion as a personal attack on myself.
I have nothing against the author, and I do not believe he bears me a personal grudge either.
He merely finds it very strange that someone should receive an invitation to spend some days on a yacht.
I must admit that I know of no one who would be brave enough to invite him aboard a yacht for a single day.
I well understand his difficulty.
So it is not a personal issue, but it is a serious institutional issue, because this type of attack reflects a populist undercurrent which resorts to manipulation by oversimplifying important and complex matters, an undercurrent opposed to the Europe we are engaged in building.
This particular motion actually invokes essential values and concepts of democracy, such as ethical conduct and transparency, but it does so with a view to mystification on the basis of pure supposition.
It is an attempt to disguise the true aim of the motion, which is to undermine the credibility of the EU institutions and the entire integration project by substituting the fabrication of alleged scandals for ideological debate.
This is where the line separating democracy from demagogy is crossed, and we cannot accept this abuse of the democratic process.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the people of our Union have no taste for political posturing.
Europeans utterly reject gutter politics.
I am sure that the overwhelming majority of this House thinks likewise and wishes to make that abundantly clear.
The political challenges confronting us at the present time require both deep thought and wholehearted efforts on our part.
It is entirely legitimate to be more or less enthusiastic about the European Union.
It is entirely legitimate to be more or less critical about the direction taken by the Commission or by the European Parliament.
It is entirely legitimate to have different political visions.
What is not legitimate is to play off one European institution against another.
Nor is it legitimate to pervert parliamentary procedures in the way that this motion of censure does, to use sophistry and insinuation and impugn peopleâs motives without any evidence.
These are not constructive contributions to the debate; on the contrary, they deprive the people of Europe of their rightful claim to our concentration on their expectations, their concerns and their problems.
The extremist approach adopted by the author of this motion is designed to obscure the issues rather than clarify them.
Let me reiterate to all of you, President and Members of the European Parliament, that my entire college and I are committed to the highest standards of transparency and ethical conduct.
Let me reemphasise our openness to dialogue with this Assembly.
Let me also express once again our gratitude for the support and solidarity shown by the vast majority of you, and in saying that I am thinking particularly of those who do not always agree with me ideologically but who have nevertheless made a point of distancing themselves from this type of political manoeuvre against the Commission.
It is in this spirit that I ask you â and I believe this will be the only merit of the present debate â to censure this motion of censure by rejecting it overwhelmingly.
That is the signal of hope we could send out from here to the whole of Europe, because that would be the best way to serve the cause of democracy, which is at the heart of our European Union.
Â Â  . Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, there are debates in which one participates out of a sense of duty and responsibility towards European integration and its institutions, and this debate today is one of them.
Those who have tabled this motion of censure have done so on the basis of Article 201 of the Treaty establishing the European Community and of Rule 100 of our Rules of Procedure.
Whilst respecting that right, we would also say that the authors of the motion, by availing themselves of it, devalue these rights by what is a selfevident misuse of them.
Along with the members of the other groups mentioned a short while ago, my friend Mr Brian Crowley, the Chairman of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, has informed me that he endorses what we said on 13Â May, that being that the action by the authors of this motion is wholly unjustified and utterly overexaggerated.
To that, I would add today that I regard this motion as unworthy of decent human beings and as a politically transparent act of opposition to the integration of our continent.
As the President of the Commission has pointed out, and as I am well aware, the cruise took place in the second half of August.
The Commission gave its approval for the project to which the motion refers on 23Â September, this House voted to express its confidence in the Barroso Commission on 18Â November, and the Commission took office on 22Â November.
So it is clear that the responsibility for the approval on 23Â September lay with the Commission under Romano Prodi.
This shows how absurd this motion is and how it lacks credibility.
So it is that this motion of censure collapses like a house of cards!
The authors of the motion are not, in fact, concerned with JosÃ© Manuel DurÃ£o Barroso as a person.
It is an attack on the European institutions and on their credibility, particularly on that of the Commission.
It is a personal vendetta, pursued with the improper purpose of bringing discredit upon the European institutions, and to do so only a few days before the referenda on the Constitution in France and the Netherlands.
Five Members belonging to the European Democrat element in this group signed this motion; they did so without informing, let alone consulting, the chairman of their national delegation or the Chairman of the group.
Let me say here and now that these five Members have placed themselves outside the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and no longer enjoy its solidarity.
I am addressing Mr Helmer when I say that there is no member of this group with whom I have had as much patience as with him.
You, Mr Helmer, have just resigned your membership of the PPEDE Group, and, out of respect for the dignity of every individual, let me say that I wish you personally all the best for the future.
Let me tell the House that we have confidence in the Commission and in its President.
A fortnight ago, in what was for me one of the high points of my political endeavours here in this House â an overwhelming majority of us faced up to Europeâs past and, by adopting the resolution on the 60th anniversary of the end of the Second World War, joined in a great majority decision to acknowledge the historic truth of Europe and set out on the road into the future.
We are well aware of our responsibility, and we will not allow anyone to undermine our determination to keep on working on the labour of peace that is the integration of Europe.
So, Mr President, you and your Commission may continue with your work, for we are right behind you!
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the President of the Commission tells me that his links with Mr Latsis go back a very long way into his past.
In that case, Mr President of the Commission, I have to ask you whether he was with you in the Maoist youth movement, for if he were, that would make him the only Maoist billionaire in Europe.
What Mr Poettering has just done is, I think, very much the right thing to do.
With Members like the one you have just addressed in your group, Mr Poettering, you have no more need of political opponents.
I can therefore do no other than warmly congratulate you on taking the action to which you have just referred.
The case we are here to discuss has, in fact, already been answered.
The decision that is supposedly worthy of criticism was not taken by the Commission under MrÂ Barroso, but by the Commission under Mr Prodi, and was within Commissioner Montiâs sphere of responsibility.
As Mr Poettering has just demonstrated by naming dates, it is in no way something for which this Commission has to answer.
The authors of this motion, or at least the brains behind it, are well aware of that, and so one has to ask why the motion was tabled in the first place.
It was tabled precisely in order to bring about what is happening here right now. That is what it was aimed at, no more and no less.
There are no political motives behind it.
The aim was that there should be cameras up there and crowds of people jostling one another in front of the entrance to this Chamber; it was that what is happening should happen.
Just for show, and nothing more: that is the political substance behind this.
Mr President of the Commission, you are entitled to have this House tell you what it expects of you and of your Commission.
We did so in some detail when the Commission was appointed.
My group has not always been satisfied in its dealings with this Commission, and you can take it as read that, if there are things to be criticised and objected to, we in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament will do just that.
If these accusations turn out to be substantiated, then we will give them our attention.
I speak on behalf of all the members of this group when I say that I am not prepared to allow defamation and insinuation to become a parliamentary strategy.
That is something we are not prepared to accept.
It is for that reason that I declare, on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, that we will not be voting in favour of this motion.
Â Â  MrÂ President, on behalf of the Democrats and Liberals in this House, let me say to the signatories of this motion of censure that they are being ridiculous.
They presume to say ââ, but neither MrÂ Farage nor MrÂ de Villiers is an Ãmile Zola â far from it!
This motion is nothing but a ploy to discredit the European Commission.
What is the real motive of those who have tabled this motion?
It is not transparency; if it were, the signatures of at least four British separatists who refused to publish details of their financial interests on the Internet would not be appended to this motion.
The signatories of this motion of censure had but one aim, which was to discredit the President of the Commission and the entire Union with him.
Why, moreover, did they choose to make this move only a few days before the referenda in France and the Netherlands?
Not for any of the reasons they put forward, but to cause the Union maximum embarrassment in the runup to these public consultations.
Mr Barroso, you must feel rather perplexed.
We started a debate about hospitality.
You volunteered us the information about your holiday with Mr Latsis as an example: a friendship of long duration, a holiday accepted before you took office, before there was any debate about whether you might assume certain responsibilities you are now accused of abusing â quite apart from the fact that there is hardly a major industry in Europe which does not receive some government support.
And if you had no contacts with industrialists, you would have as few friends as Mr Farage!
Liberals and Democrats will defend accountability and transparency in all of the European Unionâs business.
It is part and parcel of a governmentâs contract with the electorate.
We are proud to have been at the forefront of the campaign for this.
We all know there is a case for greater transparency.
Under President Pat Cox, under President Borrell, through interinstitutional agreements with the Commission, we have made, and we continue to make, progress.
The Commissionâs code of conduct was revised with the entry of your Commission.
It probably needs to be more explicit about the notion of hospitality.
We also defend the right of Members to bring a motion of censure under our Rules, but such tools should be used with caution.
Members should beware that frivolous use such as this risks discrediting both the tool that Rule 100 gives us and this House.
This debate is a deflection from serious business.
We must all be vigilant on matters of public accountability, but we must also let the Commission get on with the job of bringing the European Unionâs Member States closer together.
Europe needs builders, not a demolition squad; MEPs who look forward, not those who look back; parliamentarians who see opportunities, not those who exploit difficulties.
There is room for diversity of view about the future of the European Union, provided those views are presented honestly and openly through public debate.
As a recent election in the country I know best shows, when the views of the movers of this motion are presented openly, they get very, very little support.
I trust that this House will give a clear answer to the signatories of todayâs motion.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, a very large majority of my group considers this motion of censure to be inappropriate and they will vote against it in June.
They consider it to be inappropriate because PresidentÂ Barrosoâs personal relations with MrÂ Latzis do not strike us as being relevant to the future of Europe.
I very much regret that the fury directed towards the alleged financial irregularities of the Commission causes us to forget more and more that 80% of cases of mismanagement of Community finances involve the Member States.
I would prefer it if Members were more active in also dealing with this issue.
We believe that using the motion of censure does nothing to help the legitimate cause of greater transparency and responsibility from the Commission, and that it only serves to strengthen the opinion of those who, like MrÂ Farage, believe that the Union should simply be abolished.
That does not mean, however, that our political judgment on the work of the Commission and its President has changed.
I must say that my Group is slightly uneasy about the way in which this debate is being conducted.
It is certainly adhering to the rules, but with such restrictions on the time and opportunity to speak that it seems to be a show for those who are for and against MrÂ Barroso, providing too great a platform for MrÂ Farage and his playmate, MrÂ Helmer.
MrÂ President, we take this opportunity to draw MrÂ Barrosoâs attention to the fact that this is only the first and obvious consequence of the mistaken decision to keep MrsÂ Cruz in her role.
This situation is clearly a golden opportunity for machinations and insinuations, in addition to obviously greatly delaying and complicating the legitimacy of the proceedings taking place.
In addition, it is more than obvious that only complete transparency and a greater readiness to agree immediately to a debate can help prevent us from falling into these traps.
Today, the Commission is exposed to issues of potential conflict of interest which have not been tackled at their roots.
To conclude, MrÂ President, it is our opinion that in order to win the debate, and to sideline MrÂ Farage and his associates in the political debate, your role must be reasserted.
You must reassert your role as the guardian of Europeâs interests.
There are currently no positive initiatives emerging from the Commission in the context of the environment, society or culture.
Do something in order that the people of Europe can acknowledge you and can acknowledge, alongside you, the complete legitimacy of the European plan.
Â Â  â Mr President, the president of my group cannot be here in the House today, but he made his position clear in a letter published this morning.
If the aim of the motion is public clarification as regards a potential conflict of interests, then that aim is being achieved as we speak.
A number of members of my group put their names to this initiative, convinced that it would be a means of obtaining the necessary public explanations regarding the allegations that had been circulating and were consequently not expelled from our group, Mr Poettering.
On the other hand, if the intention was, or is, one of censure based on the President of the Commissionâs holiday, or using the holiday as an excuse, then that is something that we wish to have nothing to do with.
The Leftwing opposition in this House is political in nature.
We do not seek to deflect attention away from the real issues that oppose us to the Commission, namely the neoliberal policies that it pursues.
We would have taken a different view had Mr Latsis, the owner of the yacht, been involved in financial matters requiring a decision from the European institutions, in which case the services of the Commission would have been alerted about the illadvised holiday.
As it happens, in this connection, nothing â nothing whatsoever â has yet been proven, and there is therefore no merit in this motion of censure.
This is the view held my most members of the Group.
Mr President, I was one of those who signed, and was among those who withdrew their signatures when satisfactory information was forthcoming.
Mr Barrosoâs holiday is not worthy of a minute of attention.
Transparency, on the other hand, is very much worthy of constant attention, something that we must all strive for, in light of the disengagement between the citizens and the blindness of the current leaders of Europe.
The promotion of transparency requires facts, rather than insinuation or obfuscation.
Ladies and gentlemen, we do not advocate a freeforall in the cause of promoting transparency; after all, people in glass houses should not throw stones.
I want no part in this populist clamour.
If we were to table a motion of censure it would seek the truth and block those policies that hinder employment, rights and the desire for peace in this world.
Â Â  MrÂ President, responsibility for todayâs debate lies with those who did not allow us to have the debate last time.
When MrÂ Farage raised the matter, I asked for a list of all gifts in excess of EURÂ 100.
I have still not been given that list.
Last Sunday, I asked Eva Joly â the examining magistrate who has got business people and politicians into prison for corruption â about where the dividing line is between gifts and corruption.
âEURÂ 120,â she said.
Gifts of more than that amount do not belong in the public sphere.
I want to know who gets what from whom and I want to be able to check whether consideration is provided.
Matters got off to a good start with Barroso.
He gave us a list of 3Â 000 working parties, which had so far been kept secret.
That list is now at Bonde.com.
We do not, however, know the names of the participants.
How many friends have been placed in the expert groups?
How many people have been appointed independently of the general appointment procedures?
How many EU employees and consultants also receive salaries from elsewhere?
Openness is the best tool honest people in power have for defending themselves against pressure from their own friends.
The new Commission is not responsible for the sins and scandals of the past, but it could demonstrate a new approach.
Provide us with the names of all the experts.
Let us see who obtains what from the budget.
Let us see all the Commissionâs contributions to the legislative process.
Sack the next person who lies, instead of sacking whistleblowers.
Give the Commissionâs sacked accounts manager, Marta Andreasen another job.
Begin afresh with openness, democracy and proximity to the people.
You will lose some friends in the upper echelons, but you will gain in terms of peopleâs confidence in you and in terms of support for European cooperation.
Thank you, MrÂ President, even if I still do not have enough to express gratitude for.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to thank the Commission President for coming to the Chamber to respond to the motion tabled by some of my colleagues.
I was at the Conference of Presidents meeting which took the decision that there was no substance to the allegations being presented, and that it was right that President Barroso should respond by letter.
The Conference of Presidents took on board his opinion, as expressed in that letter, that there was nothing to substantiate the allegations made.
Be that as it may, I do not deny Members and colleagues the opportunity to table this motion of censure.
The fact that it makes them look ridiculous, takes up our time and diverts us from dealing with really important issues that affect the everyday lives of European citizens obviously does not matter to them.
It matters to me.
We have a situation in which conspiracy theories, innuendo and general misconceptions, lies and myths are told about what goes on in the âdark corridorsâ and âcubby holesâ of the European Commission.
We are told we should be afraid of the danger lurking behind us, and that things are happening that we do not know about, when the reality is that every single decision taken is accountable.
Every single action taken is not taken in an exclusive format or by one person, but goes through a host of motions and a series of individuals and organisations before a final decision is reached.
What we are really witnessing today is opportunism of the most crass and basest order. It is an opportunism which seeks to create a myth that âthere is danger lurking out thereâ, predicated on the basis that we are the white angels who shine the light into dark corners.
That is what the authors of this motion would have us believe.
However, the reality is that they are trying to prevent positive action being taken, and to prevent real debate taking place on issues of concern to the people of Europe.
Most importantly of all, this is an attempt to undermine a project in progress for the good of all the peoples of Europe.
As we have seen with the most recent enlargement, it is one which continues to progress.
Finally, Mr President, I would like to thank President Barroso for coming to the Chamber.
I apologise for being a member of a Conference of Presidents which may have put you in the embarrassing position of thinking you would not have to come to the Chamber.
However, I know that in the future you will recognise it depends very much on who is asking the question, and then you will decide whether or not you should come.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to praise the Commission â or some Commissioners at any rate â for having produced, on 18 May, a paper from which I shall now quote: âWe must bring more light to bear on the way we work and find new ways to reconnect with the European public.â
The document goes on to say that all official correspondence by letter should be made available in a public register.
One of the people who got this initiative underway was Commissioner Siim Kallas.
There is also the issue of the power exercised by lobbyists, for, in this House, in contrast to the USA, there is a great lack of transparency where they are concerned.
The reason why I signed the motion â a reason I share, I think, with many other Members â was that I expected precisely that sort of explanation from you, and what, Mr President of the Commission, did you give us?
What must be the feelings of the editorial staff of , who made the whole thing public, not to mention the reporters of the or those working on the ARDâs âTagesschauâ yesterday evening, when they hear you using words like ârabblerousingâ and âmisuseâ.
Not least as one who has been a journalist for many years, I object to such accusations.
Your statements, Mr President of the Commission, put you on the wrong side of the debate.
You are sending out the wrong messages.
By saying what you say, you are defending an EU lacking any transparency whatever, full of intolerance, and â yes, I will say it â characterised by paralysis.
The stunned rigidity associated with the EU Constitution is precisely because of the sort of behaviour of which you have, lamentably, given an example today.
By this pushing away, you are making yourself a symbol of an EU characterised by oldboy networks and â oh, yes â the power of lobbyists.
In so doing, you do damage to the ideals in which many of us believe.
The fundamental problem is precisely that; this attitude of withdrawal, this no longer comprehending what is at issue, when what is at issue is the ideals of the EU.
Like many others, I am in favour of Europe, but not of this EU and its abusive practices.
Without transparency, there is no democracy.
Stick to what you said a fortnight ago, and then we will not have to say .
Wake up, I beg of you!
Â Â  Mr President, first of all I should like to thank all the political groups.
In fact, all of the groups, except the one that initiated this motion of censure, have rejected the terms of the motion, and I thank them for that.
I do believe they have all helped us, in the European institutions, to send an unmistakable signal of our determination to distinguish clearly between democracy and demagogy.
There remains one substantive and serious question to be answered, and for all those who are committed, as I am, and as all the members of my Commission are, to the principle of transparency, I should like to spell out our position precisely.
To this end, I shall repeat what I said on the matter in my letter to President Borrell.
Since the letter was written in English, I shall read it in English.
âI should add that the rules applied to members of the Commission are stricter than those currently applied in most Member States.
Nevertheless, the question has been raised of whether additional rules in this area would be helpful.â
Some of you, like Mr Watson, have spoken about that possibility.
I then said to President Borrell that it is perhaps useful to recall that the Commission proposed an agreement to create an advisory group on standards in public life back in November 2000, which would have covered the European Parliament, the Council, the Court of Justice, the Court of Auditors, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, as well as the Commission.
That proposal is still on the table and the Commission is of course ready to discuss it with the other institutions.
Ladies and gentlemen, I want it to be clearly understood that the Commission is ready to work constructively with all of you for transparency, good governance and proper accountability within our institutions.
What I cannot, however, accept as President of the Commission is this suspicion towards the institution I have the honour to lead, this sort of anathema some people pronounce on it. I just cannot accept that.
We shall work together for greater transparency, but we shall not give in to demagogy.
I therefore thank all the political groups for having drawn this distinction today between demagogy and democracy and for having contributed in this way to the realisation of our European ideal.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place during the next partsession.
Â Â  MrÂ President, we put forward a proposal, which was rejected, for a general debate.
We put a number of questions to the Commission during the hearings, where we were promised information about the expert groups.
We have still not been given this, and nor shall we be given it.
What information is it that has to be protected?
Â Â  Mr Bonde, I regret that the switch by means of which I intended to cut you off did not work, and that you have therefore been able to speak without the permission of the Presidency.
I am very sorry.
Â Â  â Our position on the Commission is abundantly clear; we voted against it because we object to its profoundly neoliberal agenda, as we have highlighted on many occasions.
The reasons behind this motion of censure, however, had nothing to do with opposition to such policies.
Instead it is based on personal relationships and events prior to the current Commission taking office, which we voted against.
We want more transparency in the Commission.
We want different policies to address the terrible problems of unemployment and social exclusion.
We do not base our policies on personal attacks.
We therefore do not endorse this motion of censure, although we are ready to back motions of censure against the Commissionâs appalling policies.
Â Â  I have listened to the debate on the motion of censure with increasing disbelief.
The issue at stake here is not who lodged the motion or the motives of the Independence Democracy Group, it is about whether the Commission President is under a duty to answer questions asked of him by members of this house.
The people of Europe have a perception that MEPs and Commissioners do not live up to high standards, and whether or not we like it this is the reality which we must acknowledge and remedy, not close ranks and pretend does not exist.
The need for continued reform of our and the Commission procedures is urgent.
I deplore the motives of the Independence and Democracy Group, but their actions could have provided an opportunity to strengthen our procedures.
By attacking them rather than the problem, the leaders of the groups have missed an opportunity today.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report by Mr Leinen on the revision of the Framework Agreement on relations between the European Parliament and the European Commission [2005/2076(ACI)] (A60147/2005).
Â Â  . Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, after what we have just been discussing, which is destructive in its desire to disrupt relations between the institutions, thank heaven we are now going to deal with something constructive and something that is intended to strengthen these relations.
This fourth framework agreement between the Commission and Parliament embodies a culture of cooperation in which the role of each institution is respected, whilst at the same time an effort is also made to deepen mutual understanding and cooperation.
This is set down in writing in the articles of the agreement.
This is the fourth agreement between the Commission and Parliament.
I can say that each successive agreement has seen this Houseâs role as a âChamber of Citizensâ and hence as a body monitoring the European executive progressively reinforced.
This agreement, too, takes us another few steps further down this road, and so I should like to thank the Conference of Presidents and, in particular, VicePresident WallstrÃ¶m and everyone else who played a part in bringing about this framework agreement.
Let me mention some of the key aspects of this fourth framework agreement.
For a start, what we have just been debating finds a place in it; it is unequivocal in specifying the political responsibilities of the President and Members of the Commission when conflicts of interest occur.
Notwithstanding the Commissionâs collegial nature, each of its Members is responsible for what is done in his area of responsibility.
That all 25 of the Commissionâs members are individually responsible for what they do in their own sphere is a most important principle.
The President of the Commission is responsible for the steps to be taken if Commissioners are involved in conflicts of interest, and for any decisions that need to be taken.
There are also clear provisions concerning the procedures to be followed when one Member leaves the Commission and is replaced by another, and indeed there were long drawnout negotiations on this point.
It is clear that a new Commissioner cannot take up office until he has appeared before Parliament, gone through the hearings and been given a vote of confidence by the whole House.
A second set of provisions relates to cooperation on lawmaking and on budgetary decisions.
I see that we have managed to ensure that the Commission and Parliament will agree in advance on annual legislative programmes and multiannual programming, and that the Commission will not make public any legislative or other significant initiatives before notifying Parliament.
This is a crucial step in terms of Parliamentâs right of codecision on key EU decisions.
Furthermore, Parliament is treated as the Councilâs equal in this respect.
We will be kept fully informed at every stage of the legislative process, and at the same time as the Council.
It has also been agreed that regular dialogue will be established at the highest level, on a threemonthly basis, between the Conference of Presidents and the President of the Commission or the VicePresident responsible for such matters, and it is my belief that this dialogue will result in greater cooperation.
The Commission has also agreed to provide information on the composition and work of its expert groups, at the request of the relevant committee.
Furthermore, the agreement contains several provisions concerning Parliamentâs position at international conferences.
The Commission undertakes to keep Parliamentâs delegations fully informed of the progress of such conferences, and, wherever possible, to allow them to participate in negotiating delegations.
The Commission will also provide backing for Parliament in the field of election observation, and regularly update it on the progress of accession negotiations with candidate countries.
While this agreement does incorporate the Lamfalussy procedure, Parliament would have liked it to go further in this respect, as the relevant provisions apply only to securities, banking and insurance.
We would have preferred it to have covered other areas as well, but it would appear that we will have to wait until the next stage of the process for this to happen.
Furthermore, Members have expressed a desire for the framework agreement procedure to become more transparent in the future, and for the relevant parliamentary committees to be involved somewhat earlier in the process.
All things considered, however, I would recommend this agreement to the House, since it represents real progress.
As I said earlier, it symbolises a culture of cooperation that is based on mutual respect and the desire to work constructively towards the EUâs goals.
After all, this is what the public and the citizens expect of us.
Â Â  Mr President, MrÂ Leinen, ladies and gentlemen, it is an honour and a great pleasure for me to address the House at this crucial juncture, prior to the vote on revision of the framework agreement governing relations between the European Parliament and the Commission.
Since my investiture as President of the Commission, I have been telling you of my intention to establish constructive collusion and a sustainable strategic partnership with Parliament.
In the early stages, we experienced some moments of institutional and political tension.
An undiscerning observer might have concluded that the desire for cooperation proclaimed by myself, by Margot WallstrÃ¶m and by the whole Commission reflected nothing more than our intention to avoid any further friction.
This interpretation has proved to be fallacious and shortsighted.
In fact, the desire for cooperation by which we are driven results from an appreciation of the institutional reality of our Union.
Under the Treaties, Parliament is the depositary of the will of the peoples of Europe; it is the only directly elected institution and the legitimate representative of the citizenry of the Member States.
No other supranational organisation can rely on such an advanced degree of democracy as the European Union; no other multinational structure has assigned such an important role to the directly elected representatives of the people; no territory in the world except our continent, reunited at long last, has an institution that represents four hundred and fifty million people at the present time.
The Union is not a remote abstract entity that takes its decisions behind closed doors, disregarding the inclinations and opinions of its peoples.
On the contrary, it is based on the will of the people and on fully democratic institutions.
That is the real wealth of our Union.
That is what makes it unique among the existing structures in an increasingly globalised world.
We are proud of this profoundly democratic character of the Union, which reflects the historical traditions of its Member States.
We must act accordingly, and we intend to do so.
This, then, is the underlying reason why we considered it opportune and necessary to revise the framework agreement, the main instrument governing relations between our institutions.
This revision has taken place in a climate of excellent cooperation under the direction of the political authorities of both institutions.
I wish to take this opportunity to thank President Borrell, the heads of the political groups, MrÂ Leinen, chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, and all those who have contributed to this exercise, which is such an important milestone in the history of our bilateral relations.
The negotiations have enabled considerable progress to be made.
We have agreed on a wellbalanced text which meets the expectations of both parties and substantially improves cooperation between our institutions.
Mr Leinen has already pointed to many aspects, but I should like to outline what we consider to be the five main results.
Firstly, we have enhanced the political dialogue between our institutions.
Together with VicePresident WallstrÃ¶m, I will on a regular basis attend the meetings of the Conference of Presidents, which will become the main forum for discussing political developments as well as the work and activities of the Parliament and the Commission.
Furthermore, the timetable for the Commissionâs legislative and work programme has been streamlined, and the process leading to the Commissionâs legislative and work programme has become more political.
In this context, Margot WallstrÃ¶m met the Conference of Committee Chairs in February, and will do so again in July.
Secondly, we have strengthened openness and transparency.
The Commission commits itself to providing Parliament with a full list of the expert groups assisting us in the exercise of our right of initiative.
In addition to this, the chairpersons of the relevant Parliamentary committees may ask the Commission to provide information on the activities and composition of these groups.
When taken in conjunction with the existing rule on transparency relating to the âcomitology groupsâ, this new provision is a very useful step.
It will definitely contribute to enhancing transparency in the context of interinstitutional relations.
Thirdly, we have reinforced the provisions concerning political responsibility.
The framework agreement enshrines the key principles of the openness, fairness and consistency of the entire hearing process.
It ensures that the Commissionersdesignate disclose all relevant information in accordance with the duty of independence laid down in the Treaty itself.
In addition, we have agreed on the procedure to be followed should Parliament express a lack of confidence in an individual Commissioner.
In such cases the Commission President will give Parliamentâs deliberations all the political attention they deserve.
That is why we have agreed that I will either ask the individual Commissioner to resign, or I will be prepared to explain before this House the decisions I have taken.
This procedure safeguards the collegiality of the Commission and the powers and prerogatives of its President.
If new Commissioners are appointed during the mandate of the Commission, I will ensure, together with the President of the Parliament, that they present themselves immediately to Parliament.
My fourth point concerns the improvement of our cooperation regarding the negotiation of international agreements and other aspects of our daytoday work.
We have made provision for the Commission to keep Members of Parliament systematically informed on the conduct of negotiations on multilateral agreements.
We have agreed on measures for consultation of the budgetary authority on the occasion of the announcement of new financial undertakings made at international donor conferences.
We have deepened our cooperation in the field of Community election observation missions.
Finally, we will act within the framework of the existing treaties and safeguard the competences of the other institutions, particularly the Council.
While the Commission attaches great importance to our cooperation with Parliament, one should not forget that the Community method is based on a triangle.
The Commission is responsible for proposing legislative and budget proposals, and the two branches of the legislative and budgetary authority are responsible for deciding on these.
As guardian of the Treaties, the Commission is fully committed to safeguarding this method and to paying all due attention to the balance between the institutions.
With your permission, Mr President, I would like to give the floor to VicePresident WallstrÃ¶m to comment on specific features of the Leinen report.
I sincerely hope that this House will support the revised Framework Agreement, thus opening a new dimension to our fruitful relationship.
Â Â  . Mr President, the Leinen report welcomes the revised framework agreement and approves it.
I am very pleased by that and I hope that this House will do the same.
This morning the Commission authorised President Barroso and myself to approve the text on behalf of the whole Commission after the positive vote that I hope will take place tomorrow.
Following the speech by President Barroso, I wish to respond to a few remarks made in Mr Leinenâs report.
As regards implementing powers, the Commission has already made use of its right of initiative to place the Council and Parliament on an equal footing as regards supervising comitology decisions and proceedings with regard to instruments adopted under the codecision procedure.
To this effect, the Commission presented a legislative proposal in 2002, which was amended in April last year, taking into account the large majority of amendments tabled by Parliament.
This is the only possible legal way to change the current situation.
I wish to stress that our proposal is based on the existing Treaties and could be adopted without waiting for the entry into force of the Constitution.
The Commission continues to attach considerable importance to this proposal.
We are aware that Parliament supports it and we hope that the Council will give it all the attention it deserves.
For the time being, the Commission will continue to implement the current rules on comitology in full respect of the role of Parliament, as laid down in primary and secondary law and in our bilateral agreements.
An internal assessment is currently taking place in the Commission to ensure effective and coherent application of these rules.
As regards providing information to Members of Parliament on the occasion of negotiations on international agreements, the solution found in the revised framework agreement is the only one possible due to the legal context.
As you have certainly noticed, the Commission has committed itself to keeping Members of Parliament systematically informed.
Members will be appropriately informed by the Commission in full respect of their role as observers.
Finally, we have taken note of the request made as regards ensuring proper consultation of Parliament on the integrated guidelines.
The latest integrated guidelines, which will be endorsed by the European Council in June, cover a period of three years.
From our point of view, this implies that in 2006 and 2007 the next integrated guidelines will have to be updated rather than drastically modified.
For the next guidelines, the Commission will have to analyse not only contributions from the Member States but also data and statistics which are normally available only in December or even in January.
It is a complex process.
Nevertheless, in that context, the Commission will pay attention to the need to allow Parliament adequate time to deliver its position and will use its best endeavours to facilitate this process.
In conclusion, I believe that our debate today paves the way for reinforcing constructive relations between Parliament and the Commission.
As I said, the Commission stands ready to approve and sign the framework agreement.
It is not just a list of wishes and formal commitments: it is a concrete and detailed instrument to regulate our relations.
It will be our common responsibility to translate it into concrete facts.
