I should like to finish off with a final comment about an important matter, namely what is termed economic immigration and the idea that new immigrants must be attracted, which, if it was up to the Commission, would certainly not just be a handful of highly educated individuals.
This view has just been confirmed by the President of the Commission himself.
The absurdity of the idea that massive immigration of non-Europeans is economically profitable in order to alleviate the effects of the demographic situation in Europe has been demonstrated before.
The immigration that we have experienced first-hand is an immigration of people who cannot read or write, combined with religions and cultures that cannot be assimilated.
Putting it bluntly, we are importing even more unemployment, even more rootlessness, along with the effects of this all, namely crime, run-down areas and de facto apartheid.
This also involves enormous economic costs.
For those reasons, and many others, I conclude that we can do no other than express our disapproval of this work programme that is so full of platitudes and good intentions that cannot be kept and in which the essential concerns of the European citizens are completely overlooked.
Mr President, I would firstly thank the honourable Members for their comments.
Members do confirm that this is a more political programme, as recognised by Mrs GrossetÃªte, whom I thank for her general support for the programme.
Our objective is, indeed, to join with the other institutions, notably Parliament, in better targeting the priorities each year and placing them in the context of Europe's overall efforts.
Since I cannot reply to all the specific questions, I shall reply at least to those that I think particularly important, beginning with the principle of annuality.
This principle is not called into question. Far from it.
We are establishing very clearly the 21 strategic initiatives for next year and committing ourselves not to withdraw any of them once they are under way.
At the same time, however, we are offering Parliament and the other institutions the opportunity to acquaint themselves, in the course of the next six months, with what we are including in our programme and the opportunity to draw their conclusions in advance if the work is complete.
This is a good example of the combination of flexibility and security.
Secure in the knowledge of what may be done in the course of next year, you have increased flexibility which, in turn, means that Parliament can do a better job of setting out its programme.
That is what we aim to achieve, and I also hope that it is in keeping with what you need in terms of your work.
Mr Schulz recognised a number of features from other programmes.
True, there is a degree of continuity.
We want to maintain an element of coherence.
The work done by the Commission and by the other European institutions cannot consist in re-inventing the wheel each year.
One of my country's great thinkers said that in speaking the truth, one cannot be original every day.
There is some truth in that.
We are sticking to these objectives.
We need to keep the pressure up and show great determination.
The achievement of a large portion of these objectives does not depend simply on the Commission and Parliament.
It also depends on the Member States.
That is why we must continue to be coherent over time, and to be so in the interests of a Europe that is not only more competitive but also characterised by greater solidarity and by greater resolve on the world stage.
In the light of this, there is indeed an element of continuity, which is also to be found in the motto 'Unity in diversity', referred to by Mr Jonckheer and other Members.
To reply specifically to Mr Schulz's question, I would say, as I have already done to Mr Orban, that my idea is for the Commissioner appointed by Romania to assume responsibility not only for multilingualism but also for interculturalism in Europe, so supplementing the work done, under my direction, by the Bureau of European Policy Advisers (BEPA), which organises meetings on this subject.
It is also what Commissioner Figel' does on the subjects of education and culture.
As soon as his appointment has been confirmed by the institutions, Mr Orban will therefore be given responsibility for multilingualism, which is a very important subject for Europe.
It is by no means a 'second class' portfolio.
When you think how many languages are used in the EU, a policy not only on multilingualism but also on interculturalism seems to be more and more necessary if we really want to respect the diversity of the EU.
Dialogue between the various cultures needs to be established, and efforts made to integrate the different communities, without of course neglecting the minority communities within the EU.
I believe, therefore, that it is a highly important portfolio that will be entrusted to Mr Orban as soon as his candidacy has been approved.
As for the question put by Mrs Koch-Mehrin, I accept, above all, the point on which we most agree, namely the need to go all out for less bureaucracy and more efficiency.
This is not a mere statement of intent.
At the meeting of the College that took place this very day, the Commission approved a reduction in the obligations imposed on small and medium-sized enterprises in Europe to supply statistics. Instead of asking them all to make the presentations designed for statistical purposes, we shall ask for information on a sampling basis and confine ourselves to requiring only a portion of the information otherwise available.
I believe that this is a practical measure to reduce the administrative burden on our companies, and particularly on small and medium-sized companies.
We shall, of course, study the proposals for combating climate change presented, in the person of Mr Jonckheer, by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance.
Be assured that we want very much to continue to be a world leader on this issue, and we in the European Commission have, in particular, committed ourselves to strengthening the emissions trading system, to attaching more importance to renewable sources of energy and to working to achieve better levels of energy efficiency.
Perhaps there will be a number of differences in terms of practical objectives, but I believe that there is a convergence of views between our institutions about the point of the actions to be taken and the ambition behind them.
Regarding the issue of climate change, I want to tell you that, in our view, it is closely linked to the energy question.
In this area, we do see the solid outlines of a possible accommodation between the concerns of those who, like yourselves, are more ambitious where the environment is concerned and those who are more ambitious when it comes to competitiveness. The two sets of concerns are not mutually exclusive.
On the contrary.
Contained therein are extraordinary economic opportunities for the Europe of tomorrow.
In the same way, I think that there is an opportunity to be seized in the area of innovation and, in this connection, I would particularly thank Mr Crowley for his support for the European Institute of Technology, which I think will be Europe's workshop of the future.
More and more, the work that needs to be done is that on combating climate change and on pursuing a coherent energy policy and a Europe that is not only more competitive but that also derives its strength from a sustainable economy marked by solidarity - all of which presupposes, of course, greater investment in innovation.
In conclusion, I shall try to reply to the question put to me by Mrs Koch-Mehrin, who was wondering what was the main theme that drew everything together.
At first sight, it is difficult to see the connection between such diverse areas.
The common theme resides, however, in the objective of preparing Europeans to confront the age of globalisation; not to submit to it, but to face up to it; and not to see it as the end of Europe but, on the contrary, to have the courage to affirm our values and interests while, at the same time, helping - by means of our beliefs and our values of democracy, freedom and, indeed, solidarity - to shape that very globalisation and the future of the 21st century.
Therein lies the common theme linking the areas of energy and climate change to the areas not only of justice and home affairs but also of innovation and education.
That is our programme.
- Growth - Employment - Competitiveness
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (NL) Mr President, I too have great appreciation for the policy statement by the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, and I am delighted that he now has a grasp of Dutch.
He can understand Dutch.
The Commission President understands Dutch.
I should like to make five comments with regard to the statement.
I am delighted about his remark that Europe is more than just a market. When you say this, though, you also have to follow it through.
This means to us - and we will be putting this request in the resolution - that you have to outline the consequences of the internal market on the European citizens.
Once those consequences have been mapped out, it is possible to respond adequately.
I would like to make a second remark by way of priority.
The combination of work and family, more people within this labour market, is also one of the priorities in the Lisbon process.
We would like to see more action on this score.
Thirdly, a Green Paper on labour legislation is pending.
We have seen this announced for a long time, but when exactly will it be issued?
Fourthly, President Barroso mentioned attracting immigration.
When I hear this, I wonder how I should justify this to the colleagues from Poland, Bulgaria and Romania who will be approaching us shortly, where this free movement of workers has not even taken off yet.
I would appreciate a response to this.
Fifthly, I should like the Social Affairs Commissioner to attend more to all matters that are still outstanding in the Council, namely posting of workers, working hours legislation, but also the mobility of pensions, which I happen to know leads to major problems and to which a number of improvements are now being made at Commission level too.
We as a group in Parliament are happy to have further discussions with you on these matters.
Mr President, we have taken note of what the President of the Commission has had to say about the new Commission, particularly about the new Commissioner, Mr Orban, and I have to tell him that a certain amount of clarification is still called for, not least in consultation with Commissioner Figel', as regards, among other things, the question of who is to have responsibility for dialogue between cultures and religions, although it has to be said that this sort of expansion goes some way towards meeting the expectations of Social Democrats like ourselves.
Secondly, and still on the same subject, we will of course be asking the new Commissioners about their commitment to the programme for a social Europe and to solidarity, to which you have made reference.
It is because the Commission is a collegial body that we will be questioning all new Commissioners as to their actual commitment to this social Europe.
Thirdly, Mr President of the Commission, there is growth and social security; you were right to describe this as a political programme, and important steps have indeed been taken in this direction, but let me give you two examples of where we see progress as being needed.
The energy sector, for example - although Commissioner Piebalgs appears not to be here - is an important factor in terms of growth and job creation, but when a Head of Government asks how we are meant to run a single European energy policy when everything is geared to liberalisation and nothing else, then that is when the Commission must establish a political framework for the European energy policy.
If I may turn to the trans-European networks, indirect reference has, today, been made to your having at one time been very much in favour of using measures taken by the individual countries as a means of pressing on with coordination, and it is this coordinating role that I would ask you to exercise.
I would also emphasise once more that we see solidarity as the principal objective of the European Union.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (SV) Mr President, Commission, fellow Members, ladies and gentlemen, I intend to devote my speaking time to three elements of the Commission's work programme, namely global competitiveness, green growth and energy.
All three of these issues are crucial dimensions of a competitive Europe.
Firstly, then, global competitiveness.
Europe's future lies in competing at the cutting edges of research with quality and with skill.
Only in that way can we retain the European model.
The Seventh Framework Programme is therefore the most important document on industrial policy for many years.
I am afraid I have to say that there is to some degree a lack of drive in this work programme.
It is a good and important thing to engage in space exploration, but where are the ambitions in relation to the medical industry?
Why is IT mentioned only in the context of IT crime?
If I were to express one wish, it would be for a more cohesive strategic plan to enable us to compete in the 21st century.
Secondly, the environment and growth.
All too often, when documents such as this are presented, one gets the feeling that the environment and growth are somehow mutually opposed.
I am convinced that this is not so, something that I think is proved through the work of REACH.
In the next few decades, the world will be forced to do something about the climate issue.
This will involve new technology for saving energy, new technology to power cars and so on. There will be an enormous market for environmentally friendly technology and for energy-efficient products.
That is where our European companies should be.
I therefore wish that, over the next year, the Commission might devote more energy to developing environment-driven growth.
Thirdly, energy.
Europe's competitiveness stands or falls according to whether or not it has a secure and economically feasible energy supply.
It is easier to fight for your principles than to live up to them, but I hope that the Commission manages to do the latter when it comes to global competitiveness, green growth and a secure and sustainable energy supply.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, I would like to point out to the Commissioner that we are going to have to carry on talking about old and new Member States for as long as we have the transition periods to which my colleague, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten referred.
However, I was also very pleased to hear Mr Barroso talking about dealing with unscrupulous employers.
I assume by that he means those employers who keep people in conditions approaching slavery, pay them extremely badly and exploit them, with this applying, of course, not just to those who employ not only third-country nationals but also EU nationals, as we have been hearing about recently.
I assume that measure will be part of driving up job quality, as we have talked about so often, by getting rid of low-quality, poorly paid employment, and I look forward to seeing that mentioned more explicitly in the Commission's programme.
As others have said, we are very pleased to see as well this continued mention of sustainable development and linkage with climate change, which is something we have long argued for, and I agree entirely with what Mrs Ek was saying about environmentally-driven growth.
We therefore look forward to the action plan on sustainable production and consumption next year, which we assume will be a move forward in terms of eco-efficiency and in spelling out how we are to decouple environmental damage from growth.
We also look forward to the stocktaking social reality document, which is extremely important as regards benchmarks of wellbeing.
We assume this will also include environmental factors, given that we know that the poorest people often live in the poorest and most degraded environments and housing, with the effects that has on mental health.
We would rather have seen a framework directive on social services, but will nevertheless be looking to see whether the proposals brought forward also take into account the effects of existing European legislation on the future of services.
Finally, we would have welcomed something that picked up on the sustainable development strategy as regards the issue of targeted training for professions in helping to meet climate change requirements.
If you cannot fit solar panels and cannot repair your energy systems, you are not going to meet your climate change targets.
(Applause)
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (PT) Mr President, reading the legislative programme and listening to the presentation of the Commission's work for 2007, we can but conclude that we are in for more of the same; more of the same neoliberalism, which is undermining social and labour rights, which is making work more unstable, which is returning to old methods of exploitation, which is promoting the liberalisation of services, including public services, leaving no one in any doubt as to the intentions behind what is referred to as the Lisbon Strategy.
In the name of flexibility, the completion of the internal market and globalisation, employment contracts are being trampled underfoot, and there is a danger of more multinational company relocations, as in the case of GM Opel in Azambuja, Johnson Controls in Nelas and Portalegre, and Lear in Valongo, to name but a few of the most serious cases currently threatening thousands of workers in Portugal, where unemployment is already very high following redundancies in the textile, clothing and footwear industries.
It is these unemployed workers who are now at the mercy of temporary employment agencies and other unscrupulous bosses, as in the recent cases we have heard about in the media of hungry and penniless Portuguese workers in the south of the Netherlands.
Is this the social responsibility of business in action?
At the same time, in the name of the single currency and price stability, the European Central Bank regularly raises interest rates and governments use the Stability and Growth Pact to undermine manufacturing, hinder social development, undermine micro and small enterprises and create a culture that is conducive to the shameful exploitation of emigrant and immigrant workers and their families.
We therefore stress the need for a sea change away from these neoliberal policies.
The time has come to prioritise social development and welfare policies and I should like to call for solidarity in the case of hungry, exploited Portuguese workers such as those in the south of the Netherlands whose cases have just come to light.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, European integration is just part of the solution to the question of economic growth in Europe.
The Member States themselves, making their own decisions relating to public finance and economic reform, have a key role to play here.
In this respect we have many examples of good practice.
The success of domestic reforms in some countries has allowed them to quickly absorb enlargement in 2004 and to adopt the principles of the common market in all areas.
The success of countries such as Ireland, Finland, Holland or Great Britain has allowed these countries to regard world competition more calmly.
On the other hand, a social model based on rigid and short working time, and on avoiding competition not just at a global level but at the level of the common market is the road to social and economic crisis.
This political and economic alignment of forces within Europe gives me serious doubts as to whether the oft-mentioned Constitutional Treaty is a good solution to our economic pains.
It will give those countries which are less adept at resolving their internal problems increasing influence on EU affairs.
We will lose the balance between different models and restrict competition between systems.
This diagnosis of the alignment of forces has come as a result of the debates on services, working time and worker delegation.
Speaking figuratively, I am worried by a treaty which as regards legislative and regulatory matters will give us less Britain and more Germany and France.
Of all the activities the Commission plans to undertake in 2007, the most important to me are those in respect of better regulation.
It is a disgrace that an organisation that has for 50 years given voice to the four basic freedoms enshrined in its treaties, today costs business EUR 600 billion per year.
And it is an even greater disgrace that despite the agreements made in the last year, it has been impossible to reduce red tape and or to improve European law.
I hope that 2007 will mark a breakthrough in this respect. However, this will not happen if we cannot honestly answer questions about the reasons for this failure in 2006.
How is it that proposals for streamlining, codification and unifying European law face resistance?
And who is resisting them?
Where are the Gordian knots that we have not managed to cut?
I would very much like to hear an answer to these questions today.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (SV) Mr President, legal certainty means that the exercise of power and the administration of justice can be anticipated on the basis of legal rules.
It is clear from its legislative and work programme for 2007 that the Commission expects the draft Constitution to be implemented. This is despite the fact that large majorities in the Netherlands and in France have rejected the draft.
The struggle between the political establishment and the peoples of Europe continues apace, then.
The European project is on a dangerous road.
The European Court of Justice will lose its legitimacy as a result of the arrogant attitude it displays towards the popularly elected governments of the Member States.
The Court of Justice is, in reality, a self-appointed power in Europe.
It chose to declare itself the guardian of the principle of the separation of powers even before the Amsterdam Summit of 1998.
It did this without any democratic or political basis whatsoever.
The Court of Justice has also made clear to the national courts that they cannot regard themselves as independent, but rather that they represent the extended arm of the Court of Justice, through which it performs its judicial activism.
I would therefore call on the Members of this House to think things over before it is too late.
The EU does not need more concentration of power with no democratic basis.
The EU needs competition, not just between companies on the market in order to create better products, but between countries in order to come up with sound political solutions to the problems of the day.
Mr President, the Commission will review the operation of the single market, and about time too.
I hope that the Commission will read the report by the Conseil d'Analyse Economique, a high-powered economic committee of the French Government chaired by Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.
That report says 'economic integration has stagnated and no longer promotes growth'.
It says that the euro's creation has not produced the knock-on benefits expected.
Then it gets serious: 'We are convinced that the situation we describe is perilous'.
It says that poor economic performance is driving away investment and damaging employment and social provision and it speaks of 'a manifest exhaustion with Community procedures threatening to trigger a vicious circle which will unravel the acquis communautaire'.
I hope the Commission will note the estimate by its own Vice-President, GÃŒnter Verheugen, who says that the costs of excessive regulation in the single market amount to EUR 600 billion a year.
That is nearly four times the Commission's own estimate of the trade benefits from the single market.
In a recent UK study of more than 1000 CEOs commissioned by the think-tank Open Europe, a clear majority felt that the EU was doing more harm than good and that Britain should renegotiate its relationship with Europe to something more like a free- trade deal.
The position is very clear: Europe's share of world trade is shrinking fast.
Membership is costing far more than any benefits it offers.
EU regulation and the EU social model are doing huge economic damage.
The EU is making us poorer and less democratic and less free - and we have had enough of it!
(DE) Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I am sure that Mr Helmer would defend the British internal market, which he sees as geographically limited, without wishing to undermine the principle of the market economy.
I think, Mr Schulz, that we may have a semantic problem here.
For me, the market means meeting customers' needs and providing a range of services and products that the public actually buy.
That is my understanding of the market.
That, I think, is why your speech received so much applause.
We must not design the European single market and determine what we offer on it in future without taking into account the needs of the public.
The second thing - and it is something I see as very important - is the energy issue.
Energy - together with agriculture - is going to be one of the big issues full stop.
We will need more initiatives to be taken on the renewable energy front, and, on the food front - considering the way prosperity is on the increase in China, India and many other countries around the world - we will need a lot of energy for new and relatively high-quality foods.
We see the opening up of markets on the international level as having absolute priority.
We should be creating new openings for our farmers and food producers to sell their products in future.
Moving on to the CO2 debate, I would like to ask what we are supposed to do when a barrel of crude oil sells in Russia for 8 dollars - and to heavy industry, too - whereas here one has to fork out anything up to 80 dollars and emission trading also means that we have to pay the CO2 levy, so that our energy - and hence our raw materials industries - are subject to double taxation?
How, this being so, are we supposed to keep jobs in Europe?
A debate on the subject of these disparities on the market is urgently called for - and in the sphere of foreign policy too.
We will indeed see whether Russia allows its neighbours to pay the same prices as it charges at home; this will make for exciting debates in the future.
From the employment and social standpoint, I find this work programme very disappointing.
Yet again we are promised little more than a raft of Green and White Papers and communications, recycling the same old material.
We are about to get a Green Paper on labour law that lists questions that were put and answered ten years ago by Allan Larsson while he was the Commission's Director-General for Employment.
The communication hails flexicurity as a means of realising opportunities offered by European labour markets.
In reality, it has been shown to have no positive meaning for working people.
For millions flexicurity is a weasel word, a codeword for exploitation, insecurity and uncertainty.
We need an EU legislative framework to tackle unfair and exploitative employment and quasi-employment relationships.
All workers in all regions deserve access to decent work to give them and their families the chance of a decent life.
In the meantime, social Europe is at a standstill.
The last piece of EU legislation in the social field was adopted over three years ago.
The Commission's lack of ambition reflects its own imbalanced policy perspective.
Better regulation means no legislation in the social field but also reflects the poor prospects for any proposal in the Employment Council.
Employment ministers need to begin to play a positive role and they could start by doing something positive on working time and temporary agency work.
Lisbon promised more and better quality jobs.
What has been done to deliver that promise for working people?
Precious little.
So my message to both the Commission and Council is this: let us stop the rhetoric and start to deliver.
(Applause)
Demographic change is one of the greatest challenges for European competitiveness.
We want to make it a priority to bring people who are excluded into the job market, elderly and disabled people included.
That is why the 2000 Employment Directive should be fully implemented.
But we must do more, especially as 2007 is the European Year of Equal Opportunities.
However, I welcome the Commission's commitment to cutting down on unnecessary legislation.
That is why I ask the Commission to reaffirm its intention to withdraw the Temporary Agency Workers Directive and also to consider separating the issue of calculating what is considered as working time where someone is on call, from that of the individual opt-out from the Working Time Directive.
If we are really to achieve growth and competitiveness, legislation should only be brought forward in the employment field if it cannot successfully be enacted at local or national level.
In the field of health and safety it should brought forward only if scientific and medical evidence prove the need for it, as is the case for an amendment to the 2000 Biological Agents Directive to protect workers from needlestick injuries and contracting hepatitis or HIV.
Can the Commission tell us when it will bring forward that amendment to the Biological Agents Directive, in line with the own-initiative report that was adopted by the European Parliament?
(EL) Madam President, I wish to comment on three points in the European Commission's programme on employment.
The first relates to the Commission proposal to encourage the creation of common principles to strengthen job flexibility and security.
The Commission even notes that this combination has been recognised as a necessity.
By whom has it been recognised?
Obviously by the employers who approve the framework of the pure market.
However, no one should cite the workers, because it is they who suffer from minimum working times, breaches of working times and flexibility of the market.
My second comment concerns the question of immigration.
The Commission says that, because the needs of the market have increased, immigrants need to be approached.
That is exactly the message which the exploiters are waiting for in order to import cheap labour and use it to 'break' domestic markets and reduce wages.
Immigrants should not be used as battering rams, but as people with the same rights alongside local workers.
Finally, as with the directive on the liberalisation of services, the same with the Commission programme: the workers and citizens are not suffering from a problem of reduced perception, as some have said; they simply disagree and no one should misinterpret that.
(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I speak on behalf of the new Italian Socialist Party.
The Commission communication on competitiveness is a necessary step towards implementing policies aimed at improving the Union's economic performance in the global context and within the framework of the Lisbon Strategy.
It is important, as proposed, to create a framework encouraging technological development, innovation and support for the area of industry that, through research and development, is capable of expanding the EU's competitiveness in the more innovative sectors.
I therefore support the proposals for the Globalisation Adjustment Fund, the new generation of cohesion programmes and the guide to innovation proposed by Commissioner HÃŒbner, which encourage the regions to focus more closely on development, and which, I hope, will provide sufficient information and support to allow our smallest and most vulnerable enterprises to respond to the new energy and commercial challenges in the international environment.
In fact, I believe that is fundamental to support a key factor in the European economy: small and medium-sized enterprises, in particular those in manufacturing, which are, by nature, less inclined to innovation and more vulnerable to the globalisation of the economy.
While I welcome the adoption of good internal practices, I also believe that it is essential for small and medium-sized enterprises to be suitably protected, above all in the area of international trade, particularly in connection with markets that exploit unfair competition and often do not reject practices that damage workers' rights and at times even violate children's rights to childhood.
(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to address the Commission with some thoughts and suggestions.
Since within Europe there is a desire for Europe, I believe that the responses that people expect are those of a strong Europe that is able to provide, to direct and to propose.
This is the main reason why I believe that we need to put across a clearer summary of the truly significant propositions of our programmes.
Furthermore, I believe that the Commission, Parliament and the Council are making quite good progress, having succeeded, in recent years, in delivering a series of directives and regulations responding to the demands for quality of the environment, quality of life and greater integration.
There are, nonetheless, important areas of European and international policy on which we must be more adventurous.
These areas have been pointed out to us in many of the speeches made today: the environment, energy, employment, security and immigration.
A common thread runs through all of these topics, that of equal opportunities for all: for young people facing the world of work, who have a level of training that differs too much across the various Member States, and equal opportunities for women, who, in this old Europe, have not yet managed to attain the equality to which they are entitled even in the world of work.
(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, you should say to Mr Barroso that, despite the high ambition of what he said, we look forward to seeing his words converted into deeds and that what we therefore need, if we want to win back our fellow citizens' confidence, is both better regulation, which does not necessarily mean less regulation, and what, in the English turn of phrase, is called the capacity to deliver.
In the field of the ecology-energy partnership, which the Commission is extremely keen to see put in place and which Parliament will most certainly support, we need to give some thought in advance to the resources required for bringing this about. These do not amount solely to that capacity in terms of competence that the Constitution would supposedly have given us, but also to capacity in budgetary and taxation terms.
The Commission needs therefore to lose no time in setting to work on revising the financial perspective so that this exercise is not simply compensatory but is marked by an ambition equal to what is at stake for the European Union in the 21st century.
Of the 21 strategic initiatives, only one falls within the competence of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs: the idea of a communication - a further one - on social services of general interest.
There is not a word about the proposal you withdrew from the Commission's work agenda - a move unanimously condemned by Parliament. I am talking about the withdrawal of the proposal on mutuality.
Ask Mr Barroso what has become of the initiative in this area. Parliament is awaiting a proposal.
In the area of financial markets, the exercise we are involved in is a dialogue between institutions.
We had made some definite and practical requests concerning micro-credits, alternative funds and rating agencies. The Commission proposals have nothing to say about these subjects.
Finally, I would ask you to take relevant action in the field of accounting, so enabling the European Union to be equal to the ambitions we need to espouse.
(ES) Madam President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, Commissioners, Mr Almunia, better and better legislation requires better and better budgeting.
There is, and there will be, no new legislation or new initiatives for next year unless the Community institutions, the Commission in particular, carry out a full assessment of the availability of funds and of how to allocate the resources in the manner demanded by the Union's citizens.
In other words, the Union, and the European Commission, need legislative priorities and budgetary priorities that are in unison.
At the moment, the Commission's current work programme is not consistent with the resolution adopted by the European Parliament for the annual political strategy or with the first reading of the European Parliament for 2007.
I would remind you of paragraph 47 of our resolution on the Annual Political Strategy, in which we insist that the European institutions must reach an agreement on this legislative programme in December 2006, in order to coincide with the end of the budgetary procedure for 2007.
I shall end by mentioning the budgetary principles laid out by the European Parliament for the conditions for releasing the reserve for European Commission staff posts in 2007.
When it comes to these conditions, Parliament is the European Commission's ally here, rather than the Council.
In particular, we are asking for a commitment to improving the procedure for delivery to the European Parliament of the Commission's legislative and work programme which leads to the presentation, in February 2007, of a legislative work programme for that year and which takes account of our budgetary vote in December.
You, and the Commissioner responsible for budgets in particular, are perfectly aware of the situation and we therefore hope that we can reach an agreement at the conciliation on the 21st.
(ES) Madam President, Commissioners, the President of the Commission, who has discourteously failed to attend this debate, has justified the correction of his programme in an extraordinary fashion by quoting an anonymous philosopher from his country who defended truth.
Since the infallibility of the Commission is not laid down in the Treaties, I believe that it would be more appropriate to quote the old proverb 'rectificar es de sabios [to rectify is for the wise]'.
The Commission has rectified two points that are important for next year.
Firstly, the President of the Commission began to speak, I would not say passionately, but at least with a degree of enthusiasm, about the European Constitution.
I welcome that. Secondly, the Commission has introduced immigration as an urgent issue.
I would like to refer more specifically, however, to an issue that is very important and that cuts across everything we are talking about, and which the President of the Commission has not mentioned: the need to re-direct the Doha Round of development negotiations.
It is an absolutely crucial issue, which has a very direct influence on Europe's policy towards globalisation, and about which not a single word has been uttered.
Are we going to continue along the line proposed by Commissioner Mandelson?
Is the bilateral going to be given priority over the multilateral?
How are we going to coordinate this issue with the environment policy and the human rights policy?
I believe that this is an issue that the Commission must take into account and that it has not mentioned today.
(ES) Madam President, I too regret that the Council is not here.
The Council's absence from these debates has become far too frequent and I believe it would be good to remind it that it should be here and that it should take good note of that.
It was not here for the presentation of the Court of Auditors report this morning either.
Although Mr Weber, President of the Court of Auditors, has met with Ecofin, the political debate amongst those of us representing the citizens takes place in this Chamber.
I therefore disapprove of the Finnish Presidency's absence.
This morning we read the report of the House of Lords, which gave us a real pasting: it says that we do things badly, that we do not control our spending.
Furthermore, we have once again been presented with the report by the Court of Auditors, a report that has always been negative, ever since I joined this Parliament in 1994.
For the last twelve years it has said that the Commission and the Council is making an effort, but it has not given its approval.
As FranÃ§oise GrossetÃªte has said, the Commission's programme is a political programme and I therefore believe that it is right for the Commission to aim high, but it is doing little in terms of controlling spending.
I would like to say to the Commission, which is here today - I regret that the Vice-Chairman of our Committee on Budgetary Control is not here and I thank Mr Almunia for listening - that unless we spend properly, the Council will continue to reduce the budget and we will end up without any Community policies.
If your work programme says nothing about controlling the Europeans' money, what will happen in the end?
We will not even reach the 1% threshold.
Next year we will have 0.9% of the budget and we will end up with no Community policies in Europe.
Get your act together please.
State that we want to spend well, better than the Member States, that we want to put the Member States in a position in which that can say that they agree with the way spending is carried out.
The citizens must be aware that, if money is spent badly, it is not just the Commission's fault, but also the fault of the Member States, of the agents.
Let us get our act together, let us do something, not just for transparency, but for good spending.
(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by following the chairman of my group, Mr Schulz, and highlighting something Mr Barroso said to the effect that, 'without solidarity, the internal market will not come into being'.
He got that absolutely right, and it comes up again in the text of the work programme, in which the Commission commits itself - and I quote: to 'the delivery of an active policy agenda focusing on citizens' expectations and needs'.
That is precisely what is needed.
It is not, however, enough simply to keep on saying that; it also has to be brought to life.
It is evident to me, from looking at the measures, that the ones that really matter in the internal market are not there, particularly those needed for the protection of consumers.
The term 'consumer protection' is nowhere to be found.
Now you are looking to appoint a new Commissioner to handle it.
Does that mean that you want to have a rethink or a closer look and see to it that consumer protection really is put centre stage in policy?
If you do, that is something that really will get across to the European public.
I also note the lack of any progress towards harmonisation in European policy that might point to the Member States sharing in it, that might indicate an opening-up of borders in the services market and elsewhere, for these things need to be tackled with much more vigour than they have been, and there is plenty left to do on those fronts.
Finally, the most important thing is that the primary competence should be political.
You are always talking about impact assessments, but what sort of impact assessment should be carried out?
Any impact assessment should also take into account social life, gender policy and other areas as well.
- Cohesion - protection of natural resources
Madam President, there is a tendency for all speakers to consider their issue as the most important in the debate.
As we are talking about the European Commission's legislative and work programme, I wish to say - as I shall be referring to regional development - that we shall not have very important issues to debate next year.
This year we passed the legislation and the major challenge for the European Commission is for this legislation to be applied correctly.
We need to start the application of programmes promptly, so that the appropriations are taken up and, more importantly, European taxpayers' money is used for the benefit of social and economic cohesion.
This is the major endeavour and Parliament wants to participate actively in this endeavour, which we must jointly make together with the Member States and the regions.
We shall be present, therefore, to control what the European Commission is doing.
Within this framework, the fourth report on cohesion which the European Commission is to present and which we are awaiting will obviously also be important.
Within the framework of the purely legislative initiative, there is the question of the Solidarity Fund; in other words, the fund which covers problems which arise from natural and technological disasters.
Here we have finished the first reading, but there is an unjustified delay in the Council.
The old regulation is out of date and the European Union needs to demonstrate its solidarity in the areas affected, especially when we are talking about major disasters, because that is how it gets closer to its citizens.
The Commission, therefore, needs to stand by Parliament.
We need together to convince the Council which, for some reason - perhaps because the Ministers of Finance, who are competent, do not want to give any more money - does not understand the need for us to proceed further.
We are therefore waiting for tangible proof from the European Commission.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FR) Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, there is a time for words and there is a time for action.
I think that quite a number of those who have spoken this afternoon, on various subjects, have demonstrated the absolute necessity for the European Commission to take action.
We want more innovation, more security, more solidarity and more competitiveness, and I am disappointed to see that the text presented to us by the Commission includes just a few lines on what is certainly the main heading in the European Union's budget, given that the 2007-2013 financial perspective allocates EUR 308 billion to the Structural Funds.
However, if we want to provide real answers for ourselves and for our fellow citizens, with the Member States and with the various players, we need to make good use of the tools provided by the financial measures included in the Structural Funds, amounting, as I said, to EUR 308 billion.
What, therefore, is the issue for 2007?
Are we going to use the billions at our disposal to give our fellow Europeans real answers in the context of the regulations we adopted in this very House in July, or, mired in administrative mazes and in many and varied problems, are we going to reach 31 December 2007 without having got much further forward?
I and my colleagues in the Committee on Regional Development brought these matters up with Mrs HÃŒbner; we are disappointed that the Commission's document before us today pays hardly any attention to how the Commission intends to set out to achieve its objectives.
We want these objectives to take particular account of circumstances in the new Member States, which will receive funds but will also need to be in a position to use those funds wisely.
We have made proposals, as Mrs HÃŒbner knows, and we are now waiting for practical responses to help these countries to use this money properly.
There is another point that I, as chairman of the Urban Housing Intergroup, must obviously not neglect: how can towns and cities act as a real driving force in a Europe that needs to be more competitive and more innovative?
On this matter, too, we are waiting for further action from the Commission.
Finally, on behalf of my colleague Mr Davies, who cannot be here because he is at another meeting, I would like to say to the Commissioners that the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe is partly satisfied with the proposals on the environment, but that, as in the case of the previous point on the Structural Funds, we expect practical implementation - we expect action.
In conclusion, Commissioners, we have no complaints about your communication skills, but we now expect practical action.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, it is evident that the Commission is pressing on with the policy that deeply divided European society last year.
Were the riots in the suburbs of Paris not warning enough?
Having seen them, we in Europe surely cannot continue with a policy that writes off some members of our society.
How, having had this experience, is it possible that the Commission should seek, in the new work programme, to address social issues quite separately from the growth strategy?
Why is it abandoning the former consensus according to which social inclusion policy was part of the Lisbon Strategy and hence an expression of social cohesion?
Are we, in future, to have a state of affairs in which everyone will no longer be allowed, irrespective of where they live or of their social status, to share in Europe's economic successes and in its prosperity?
Our group does not accept such a thing.
It does not accept that people such as those in the banlieues of Paris should no longer be allowed to benefit from Europe's strategy for prosperity, for a policy of social division will demand a high price from all of us.
The work programme, lamentably, perpetuates this general trend.
As well as the one-sided Lisbon Strategy, the Gothenburg strategy is also to be treated in isolation, with economic growth being treated as having higher priority than sustainable development in what is a completely backward-looking policy that represents the selling out of our living resources and amounts to writing off our rural areas, thus abandoning the interconnection of our economic, social and environmental goals.
How does the Commission justify using ear-marking within the structural funds as a means of taking money away from territorial cohesion and sustainable development for all regions and making policy only for prosperous cities and thriving economic hubs, while many European regions, the young people in the banlieues, and their counterparts in rural areas, are treated as less important?
That will not do.
Sustainable development must be brought back to the heart of European politics.
Madam President, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, I thank our Commissioners for the work we do with them - often constructive, often with great thought, often with what I hope is constructive criticism.
I say to the Commissioners that we look forward to what they are going to be doing in the coming year, although perhaps I could start with what they are not going to be doing, because it would be helpful to hear from them again a new list of steps that they are not going to take.
We have had the first tranche of that as part of the Lisbon Agenda.
We would like to know a little more about where the Commission is pulling back so that it can concentrate on the things that really matter.
Linked to that, in terms of better legislation, we look forward to the development of environmental and health impact assessments in such a way that they are seen to, and really do, contain an element of independent assessment.
I would suggest that we need a panel of independent experts, not a new building or agency, but people on whom we can call to help to ensure that the impact assessments are effective.
I believe we would also want to ensure that the agencies for which we are responsible are efficient and effective.
There are some key ones in health, medicines and food safety which need sustaining.
They are mostly new ones and doing good work.
I would like to see prioritisation between agencies as well as good support for those that we cover.
We would want to see proper enforcement as well.
So perhaps the package is to do less than we have done in the past, but to do what we do even better.
In our committee we look to the work in the health sector.
We have seen that prosperity is not an alternative to wellbeing.
Healthy people and a healthy environment are prerequisites for healthy economic growth, competitiveness and jobs.
We want to see more work to improve health promotion, collaboration between health services, not only on patient mobility, patient safety and the new areas of mental health, but also on continuing areas such as flu preparedness.
The environment goes hand-in-hand with growth and jobs.
Eco-innovation is a major component in winning the fight against global warming.
I certainly call on the Commission to lead initiatives in the post-Kyoto process outside the European Union, developing the 'green diplomacy' concept.
Having recently been in Gaza and seen the devastation to people in the hospitals there, we urge that, with the new opportunities coming from the appointment of the new Prime Minister of the Palestinian Authority, the European Union should work closely with that authority and the Israelis to stop what is happening in Gaza and to promote real reconciliation and peace.
(FR) The legislative programme before us today is just a quiet renewal of the programmes for previous years.
Even so, I find it quite remarkable that the Commission has not said a single word on two major reforms on which it is currently working, namely the review of the financial perspective and the mid-term review of the common agricultural policy.
These are politically very difficult issues, but we cannot just ignore them.
The fact that the constitutional, budgetary and agricultural debates are all taking place in 2007 means that the institutions really need to prepare themselves.
With regard to the reduction in administrative costs set out by the Commission, the vision of European policy that underlies it is, in general, very simplistic and penny-pinching - it is a short-term vision from which our political priorities will suffer.
Instead, we should reconsider whether the resources, particularly in terms of staff, provided to the Commission are adequate for the implementation of the policies we are seeking to promote.
True, the solutions proposed by the Commission in its citizens' agenda are based on the idea of a proactive political programme targeted at the needs and expectations of Europeans.
Unfortunately, though, I cannot now find in this document any specific or new proposals for how to achieve the objectives of this programme.
The same is true of the Lisbon Strategy, which we are told has been relaunched.
I cannot share your optimism.
Finally, let us not forget that, every year, the overall budget allocated in fact contradicts the document that you are presenting to us today and distorts the political will demonstrated and voted on by our Parliament.
Does this document today not ultimately come down to words and pious hopes?
(FI) Madam President, Commissioner, our competitiveness and prosperity depend on our ability to develop sustainably.
Research and innovation are therefore essential.
New energy efficiency technologies such as hydrogen, fusion, LED light, and solar and wind power are important, for example.
Energy consumption in Europe is growing, even though it should be falling.
We cannot live like this.
The high cost of energy hits the poorest.
In my view, the Commission should establish a social programme for the supply of energy for our poorest citizens.
It is said that without solidarity there will be no Union.
I suggest introducing a barometer to gauge solidarity throughout the EU.
In addition to the results of opinion polls and internal market infringement proceedings, Eurostat and the Commission should publish a wider comparative evaluation of the Member States.
We need to find out openly and simply and in comparative format to what extent countries are fulfilling their promises - in other words, how much solidarity there is between us.
The schemers should be penalised.
Is the publication of a solidarity barometer appropriate and necessary?
What does Commission Vice-President WallstrÃ¶m think?
It might at least help the public understand better what is going on.
It is important that we get the framework programme on research and development through, and certain other programmes as well.
(Applause)
(ES) Madam President, I wished to stress how strange it is that there are no concrete legislative proposals for a common policy such as the Common Fisheries Policy.
The fact that the Commission's document takes a very horizontal view of the priorities cannot be used as an excuse for the lack of commitment to a policy which furthermore is at a crucial moment both internally and internationally.
Fishing management is going to be affected - it already is - by a whole series of measures, programmes and policies that respond to the Union's very diverse commitments within the framework of the Law of the Sea, the Johannesburg Summit, sustainable development, environmental strategies, climate change and biodiversity, amongst other things.
Within this context, the Commission's general attitude to the fisheries policy is marked by a surprising lack of legislative activity, a lack of political impulse and lack of ambitions and commitments in the face of these challenges.
Legislative activity in the field of fisheries is increasingly focussed on routine matters and minor day-to-day modifications, and on the rare occasion when the big outstanding issues are dealt with, they are dealt with by means of mere communications with no legislative weight, as in the case of discarded catches, or which come extremely late, as in the case of eco-labelling, or which are at risk of fading to nothing, like the proposal on the Mediterranean.
This gives the impression that, faced with the challenges I have mentioned, the fisheries policy has chosen to remain at the lowest possible level and allow itself to be led by the priorities of other policies, ignoring the fact that fisheries has a lot to say.
Madam President, in order to deal specifically with certain matters which remain outstanding and which are extremely urgent, we would call upon the Commission to make immediate rigorous and coordinated legislative proposals on undeclared and unregulated illegal fishing.
- Internal affairs
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Madam President, up to now Europe has stuck to developing measures to combat illegal immigration.
It has tried to project the image of 'fortress Europe'.
The Commission is going to make two decisive proposals with regard to the immigration of manual workers and of highly skilled workers.
We are absolutely opposed to accepting undeclared, exploited workers.
We therefore also need to provide legal immigration routes for people looking for work.
The plan is for the European Parliament simply to be consulted, but we would like to obtain commitments, so that we can be fully involved and our voice can be heard in the discussions on these two decisive directives.
We also welcome your proposal to set minimum penalties for employers who exploit immigrants by forcing them to work illegally.
My group recently went to the Puglia region in Italy, where hundreds of immigrants have been reduced to slavery on agricultural holdings.
As we are all aware, this is not just an Italian problem: the enslavement of thousands of people is a problem throughout the European Union.
We are therefore calling for common provisions to protect immigrants' rights in work, for uniform penalties for exploiting illegal labour and for support for employers who regularise the status of their workers.
Thank you.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, two years ago the European Parliament gave Mr Barroso's Commission the green light, but only after he pledged to make fundamental rights a top priority.
However, it seems that Mr Barroso - who unfortunately is no longer here - forgot his pledge the very next day, because fundamental rights have disappeared altogether from the strategic objectives.
The work programme for 2007 lacks vision, ambition and courage in this respect, which is very cynical in the year of equal opportunities.
Better lawmaking is a good thing, but we actually need more action on fundamental rights, not less.
Parliament has repeatedly called for a horizontal directive banning all forms of discrimination.
We called for urgent action against discrimination against homosexuals and against rampant homophobia.
None of this is in the work programme.
Why are human rights not the centrepiece of the Union's external policies?
Security is indeed a priority, but not the selling-out of democracy and civil liberties.
Measures are being taken in backroom deals that are not subject to parliamentary scrutiny or judicial review.
They are neither proportionate nor effective, and citizens are increasingly defenceless against abuse and mistakes by the authorities.
Where are the Commission proposals addressing this issue and aimed at resetting the balance?
Finally, on democracy and transparency, the Commission floated proposals for a European PNR policy and positive profiling at an informal gathering of ministers, so how is it that these proposals do not feature in this official document?
And why is the Commission going along with the Council in informal get-togethers on security policy, such as the ones on 16 August or with the US last week?
I would very much like answers to those questions.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I note that the Commission's strategy has changed: before, we used to have such sound proposals, now, even these have disappeared.
President Barroso's speech leaves us very concerned.
In fact, as regards the Commission's priorities for action in 2007, we feel that there is a lack of drive by the Commission to ensure that a practical common policy on immigration is launched.
Simply acknowledging that we need to marry security and solidarity does not strike me as a positive legislative principle for 2007.
It seems a somewhat empty statement, void of real meaning, which does not contribute to building a genuine policy on legal immigration safeguarding economic immigration and abandoning the current prohibitionist approach that is leading more and more people to their deaths in the Mediterranean or in the Atlantic Ocean, and is encouraging more and more migrants to arrive illegally on our territory and to remain here illegally.
I believe that the Commission should provide real drive, by proposing a policy on legal entry to our territory.
In my opinion, it is not enough to state that security is a priority, although this may well be true: we also need to agree on what security means.
I believe that Europeans should be reassured of the fact that there will be no more illegal flights by the CIA in Europe, that European citizens and asylum seekers will no longer be kidnapped, and that the systematic checks on Europeans will be dropped - I refer to SWIFT, to PNR and to data retention.
Therefore, when discussing security, I believe that, first of all, Europeans should be reassured that their rights are being protected.
I do not think that the Commission's efforts are heading in that direction.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Madam President, looking at the Commission's programme for 2007, I am struck not just by the new areas in which the EU seeks to strip more power away from my country and from the ex-EU slaves and eunuchs who run it, but by the brief mention of the term 'constitutional treaty'.
My submission is that the hidden agenda and programme for 2007 will include a resurrection of the constitution, that slain vampire, after a small blood transfusion.
The nationals of those countries who rejected it will be told to vote again because they did not understand that it was compulsory.
The Commission hopes to obscure the principal issue, namely its quest for legal personality or EU sovereignty.
Yet every year the EU takes more of the powers of nationhood.
I object to the concept that British nationals are assumed to be in favour of all this power theft, without being allowed to vote on the subject.
I also note a proposal from the Council to improve cooperation between EU police and security forces.
This contains a proposal about sharing information at European level, including sharing with Europol.
This has been questioned and resisted before.
It is an infringement of the rights of British nationals, some of whom already have an EU criminal record for plane-spotting.
My countrymen want an honest answer to the question of what the EU thinks it is and what happened to the concept of trade.
(NL) Madam President, I should like to start by congratulating the Commission on its intention to reduce the administrative burden by 25%.
This is a very important objective, and I would advise you to be as practical as possible in pursuing it.
In the Netherlands, we have now managed to bring about a 25% reduction, but communication with businesses and citizens has resulted in continued complaints about far too much bureaucracy.
The citizens and businesses did not feel much of the effects, because the reduction was mainly at macro level.
At micro level, however, bureaucracy persists.
I can think of a very simple way of solving this problem, for example, by raising the bottom threshold in public tenders.
I live in a village of 25 000 people where a new swimming pool is being built that, in accordance with European rules, must be put out to tender, with all the red tape that this involves.
Is this really necessary, or could we not raise the lower limit a little so that it is only really important projects, where real international competition is needed, that fall under this rule?
Turning to impact assessment, we in the European Parliament have repeatedly demanded this, and that it should be comprehensive, including fresh legislation, comitology that affects citizens and businesses, and soft law.
After all, an increasing number of issues are being regulated using soft law, which may trigger an administrative burden of its own.
Secondly, we have repeatedly said that we would like the quality of this impact assessment to be subject to an independent review.
So far, we have seen a great deal from the Commission in this respect, but none of it was satisfactory.
We want this independent review, since this can also generate more transparency.
It is, of course, a step in the right direction that this should under Mr Barroso's presidency, be brought within the Commission's remit, but, since there is no transparency within the Commission, I fear that we will be waging a bureaucratic trench war between the office that falls within Mr Barroso remit and the Commission offices that are required to draw up the impact assessment.
(DE) Madam President, I have taken the liberty of carrying out a brief statistical analysis of the Commission work and legislative programme, and have counted 57 non-legislative acts and only 37 of a legislative nature, so it would appear that the vast majority are non-legislative, and that strikes me as confirming a trend that has made itself clearly visible in recent times, that being that the Commission is more inclined to take refuge in non-legislative acts such as Green Papers, White Papers, communications, and so on, thereby in part circumventing its own legislature.
It is clear to me that soft law instruments appear - at first sight, at any rate - to fit better into the 'better regulation' agenda, but it has to be said that such instruments are neither enforceable nor binding and will end up as sources of even more disappointment for the public and for businesses.
I would like to highlight on the basis of my own working experience a number of things that I find lacking in the work and legislative programme, namely initiatives that the Commission has promised in other contexts, but are not to be found here, such as the standardisation of the consumer protection acquis, the term of protection of copyright, further developments in patent law and the applicability of EU law in sport.
The ECJ has produced a new ruling that fundamentally changes the position in this area and makes for greater legal uncertainty in it.
Together with the first batch of initiatives to be withdrawn, the statute for mutual societies and the statute for a European law governing associations went back as well, and, in the debate at that time, Vice-President Verheugen promised us that this would be reviewed and consideration given to the possibility of improved initiatives in this area, but I cannot see them here; perhaps they are not regarded as having high priority.
It is a matter of complete indifference to me whether they are or not; what matters to us is that we should know whether or not to expect their appearance.
(DE) Madam President, there are two points in this work programme that I want to say something about; one has to do with basic freedoms and the other with civic participation in the European Union.
Reference has frequently been made in this debate to the problem inherent in the lack of any preferences or priorities on the part of the Commission in the field of basic freedoms and third pillar, a problem that we need, firstly, to address as a matter of urgency, before, secondly, establishing the cause of the lack of political will.
Reference has been made to the fact that Mr Barroso, at the beginning of this legislative period, set up a working party made up of Commissioners and tasked with addressing the issue of basic freedoms.
I find myself wondering what this working party has been up to over the last two years, since no report has been forthcoming.
So have they been doing nothing? Drinking coffee?
In all seriousness, though, we must, if we are to take this subject seriously, know what is to be discussed in this context.
What I find worthy of criticism about this work programme is the fact that - in parallel with the efforts by G6 states to do something about legal migration and by the few states gathered around the Federal Republic of Germany that have launched the PrÃŒm Convention - parallel structures are developing into a third pillar outside the third pillar without the Commission - whose role as guardian of treaties is about more than making laws - intervening or making any kind of forthright public comment.
The fact is that, if we are to act on the judicial and police cooperation front, we have to do so within the framework set for us by the Treaties.
Since my time is running out, I will conclude with a brief point, which is that, on page 10 of the programme on civic involvement is written, in English, the following - and I quote:
'This includes a commitment to listen and to deliver.'
(DE) We have done so.
We have handed one million signatures to the Commission and the Council concerning the seat of Parliament.
Two-and-a-half months on, we have yet to receive a reply.
I believe that, as far as 'listen and deliver' is concerned, the ball is now in the Commission's court.
(EL) Madam President, one of the main measures for 2007 is border control.
This will be achieved with the second generation Schengen information system, the VIS, the operation of Frontex, broader use of biometric data and the creation of central databases.
The pretext for all this is the security of citizens and the management of immigrants entering the Union.
In reality, however, a European fortress is being created, emphasis is being given to policies to stop immigrants, protection notwithstanding, and, at the same time, the creation of a police state is being served.
As regards collaboration between the public and private sectors in the field of security, as proposed, the question which arises is who will exercise control of the honest function of private individuals and how.
The possibility of intervention by private individuals - with interests often politically controlled - in the configuration and management of security policies is unsettling.
Furthermore, one of the Commission proposals refers to combating terrorist propaganda and the question we are asking is where are the limits of freedom of opinion set and who will set them, politically and ideologically impartially, when today liberating movements are condemned and political parties are called terrorist organisations.
Madam President, I wish to begin by addressing the question of the internal market.
I think I am out of sequence, because the internal market was discussed earlier by some of my colleagues.
However, I want to welcome the review of the single market strategy on behalf of the members of our group.
I am pleased we are now focusing on the name 'single market' because that describes much more accurately what we are working for.
We will therefore give the Commission a lot of support for that and indeed for other initiatives to make the single market work better.
That leads me onto a broader concern I have on the work programme and the priorities as presented to us.
It is a big improvement on the one we had last year, of which I was very critical and in which there was a very long list of unprioritised proposals.
We still have a long list of proposals.
I think there are 21 initiatives and, as my colleague, Mr Grosch, said, the difference between strategic initiatives and priorities is not entirely clear.
I would again make the point that a list of priorities longer than five is not a list of priorities at all.
However, I want to make the fundamental point that the issue of delivery, which I am pleased to say is included, is picturesquely described as 'delivery a daily task' as if it were a routine issue - we still have daily milk deliveries in England and I am pleased to say in pint bottles.
However, it is not a routine issue but a fundamental one!
I really want to know what resources the Commission is putting behind the implementation of its policies.
On the single market, we know that Mr McCreevy estimates that 90% of the legislation is already in place.
Delivery is fundamental.
Where does it say what resources the Commission is putting behind its initiatives?
Where does it say what resources the Commission is putting behind a transposition plan for the Services Directive we will approve tomorrow, which is a fundamental piece of work?
If the Commission does not put the resources behind it, it will not be delivered.
I should like to ask Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m, whom I understand is responsible for communication, for the next package to be grouped together.
I do not want to see the single market policy scattered throughout this document: I want to see the priority for the single market set out with the actions next to it, the delivery resources next to that and the Commission's simplification plan next to that, and I want all this to be lumped together with the percentage of resources the Commission is putting behind it.
That would be a logical and clear document and clear communication.
Finally, on the Services Directive, I am delighted Mr Schulz is here, because I note from a press release he issued today that the Services Directive is an enormous success for the Socialist Group.
Well, colleagues on this side of the House, it is an enormous success for this Parliament and all of us working together.
I hope people will have the humility to accept that.
However, I notice that he has finally joined our liberal club because the release states that he supports the flexibility necessary to enterprise and the promise of new job creation.
Welcome to the market liberalisation club, Mr Schulz!
(DE) Madam President, 2007 will certainly be an important year in terms of whether citizens are won over to Europe or whether they continue to distance themselves from it.
I should like to make three comments on this.
The first is that the Berlin declaration represents a good opportunity for us to demonstrate the idea of Europe and the European project.
I hope that this declaration concentrates on the future rather than focusing too much on the past.
Europe has its origins in the field of energy, and this same field may also present a vision for the future - if, for example, a large-scale energy project were proposed that met all the criteria we are aiming at.
I am thinking here of the solar-hydrogen economy, which would be a real challenge for this continent and even for the international community.
The second is that we need to make progress with the constitutional process.
This is the responsibility of the Presidencies, of course, but also of the other institutions.
I hope that the Commission does indeed provide input to show citizens what they stand to lose if the Constitution is not ratified, and that it also makes proposals for overcoming the crisis.
The June Summit spoke of 'additional elements' that need to be developed, and I hope that 2007 sees the Commission, too, proffering some thoughts about what that means in practice.
The third, Madam Vice-President, concerns democratic infrastructures.
We have European citizens' initiatives.
One million signatures must not go to waste.
I think that we need a framework for how the institution receives mass petitions such as this.
These are important tasks for 2007.
(PL) Mr President, it was with real pleasure that I welcomed the points of the last two parts of the programme presented, that is to say the part containing strategic initiatives and priority strategies.
It specifically addresses communication, and I would like to thank Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m for preparing this unusually important section, particularly in 2006, as 2007 is to be a crucial year.
In 2007 internal reforms will have to be undertaken, and preparations made for constitutional reforms primarily geared towards the introduction of the European Constitution.
However, I fear that the Commissioner was left without support here, and that the Commission does not attach sufficient attention to this area, and is not giving her sufficient assistance in the preparations needed for reforms, even though they are her own.
I would like to ask the Commission what it has done to enable it to operate under new conditions in 2009, under a new treaty, and will there be a greater number of commissioners or not?
The final matter I would like to raise are the internal affairs of Europe, which should be a better and safer place for all of our citizens to live.
This is the expectation of all citizens of the European Union, but the citizens of the new Member States are in a less favourable situation.
They have fewer rights in many areas and are discriminated against in areas such as cross-border travel, where the SIS and Schengen are concerned, and I would like this element to be eliminated.
If this fact were eliminated, we would no longer be discussing forced labour camps in Europe.
Foreign Affairs
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (NL) Mr President, whilst I should like to thank the Commission warmly for this communication, I have to start with somewhat more worrying observations.
I deeply regret to have to say that a clear development standpoint is what is lacking in the Commission communication.
I should like to remind you of the three objectives of the European Development Policy, as described in the Treaty, namely sustainable development, the fight against poverty and the gradual integration of the developing countries into the global economy.
Although these deserve a special mention in the communication, they are not there.
In addition, I should like to appeal to the Commission to tackle the problem of the relationship between other areas of policy and development policy more effectively.
I am particularly thinking of the relationship with fisheries, trade and migration.
This is an important criterion in order to be able to achieve our own development goals and also to make a meaningful contribution towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals which we all agreed upon.
Finally, I am appealing to the Commission to include in the list of priorities communications in the following areas: the latest with regard to the EU's contribution to the development goals; secondly, any headway made in European development policy with regard to the WTO's development round, and thirdly, the implications of the Commission proposal on more highly educated immigrants on the brain drain in developing countries.
Finally, particularly the absence of the Millennium Development Goals and the fight against poverty are striking and disappointing in the paragraph that describes Europe as a global partner.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Mr President, I would first of all like to congratulate the Commission on having attached a high priority to a communication policy and, in particular, on having already implemented it within Parliament.
I can say that, with regard to foreign affairs, we are now in constant, constructive contact with the Commission.
However, this just adds to the consternation with which we look at the Commission's programme on foreign policy and human rights.
In my view, communications in this regard have been elliptical, and almost subliminal.
There has been radio silence on the Mediterranean.
So, what has happened to the spirit of Barcelona and the concept of an alliance of civilisations?
Little or nothing has been said on policy towards Africa, beyond the development policy, and you have been very tight-lipped regarding Latin America, even at a time when the European Parliament is involved in establishing Eurolat.
Last but not least, there has been absolutely no reference to our human rights policy, even though it is our brand image for the outside world and even though we have just managed to obtain a specific instrument for it.
In this regard, it is worth bearing in mind that the conclusion of the action programmes with Israel, Moldova and Ukraine is going to result in difficult negotiations about which the communication has nothing to say.
Finally, foreign policy, as presented here, seems to be based more on the European Union's bilateral relations with certain countries than on a regional policy or a policy of great communities.
It is all rather lacking in ambition, attractiveness and life, and that is a great shame for the people of Europe.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, 2007 will be the key year for us all to find our own way to escape from the constitutional crisis and I am very pleased to hear from President Barroso that he plans for the Commission to play a central part in that exercise.
The Commission strategy for change across the policy spectrum must be framed inside a constitutional context.
Policy reform will be given practical effect by its connection with the issues of the EU's competences, the instruments, the powers and procedures.
As far as external affairs are concerned, for example, the Union needs its legal personality.
Public opinion supports the EU as a global actor.
We need success on completing the Doha Round for trade and development.
We should be stalwart in persevering with enlargement, despite the problems that we experience at present, some of which at least are clearly foreseen and foreseeable.
The Commission and Parliament must be steadfast to support the deployment of so many European forces, not least at present in South Lebanon, as this exercise surely provides the greatest test for the development of our common foreign security and defence policy.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as foreign and security policy coordinator for the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I should like to make a number of critical remarks.
A few points have been raised.
Mrs De Keyser expressed exactly what I feel when she questioned where we stand.
We can see the arc of crisis over Iraq, Iran, Libya - the Middle East.
Europe, a global player, makes professions yet comes up with a static work programme consisting of, on the one hand, a banal statement of the problems devoid of political substance and, on the other, instruments that - those of them that are actually new - the Commission does not even acknowledge as a quantum leap.
At this point I should like to express our disappointment that the five new external-policy instruments that are due to enter into force as of 1 January, and that will support the Commission's external policy, civil conflict prevention, crisis management and reconstruction work for the first time, are not given due attention, but instead constitute just a single indent in the work programme.
Then there is the Commission's concept of 'neighbourhood policy'.
The Commission must clarify in political terms what it means when people now talk of 'neighbourhood policy light'.
A political definition is no longer being given for this.
Any old words are being used, and I have the impression that a political definition is virtually being avoided.
I should like to finish with a positive comment.
I welcome the fact that the Commission is tackling the defence-equipment market at long last; it is just that what the programme has to say about this it has been saying for years.
Parliament has given the green light, and awaits results at long last.
Consequently, I am afraid we are not satisfied in this regard.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, the European Union has done much to raise its visibility in the world arena in recent years.
In order to enable this process of emancipation to develop, we have to face up to significant problems.
Since the enlargement of 2004 we are neighbours with a very troubled part of Europe to the east, where in recent years we have seen Russia return to a policy of coercion in respect of its neighbours, countries which today are also neighbours of the European Union.
Often these countries - such as Georgia and Ukraine - are included in our neighbourhood policy, which the Commission rightly believes should be strengthened.
However, a successful reform of financial aid instruments is not everything.
In order to play an important role in the world, particularly when we think of the European Union as a 'soft power', takes credibility.
This credibility is a vital test, and we cannot be a global or even regional player if we do not protect Belarus from annexation by Russia, something which may only be a matter of months away.
We will not become a global player if we trade human rights in Russia for gas, or if we close the door to the pro-European, democratic and pro-western policies of Ukraine and Georgia in a cowardly way.
These are key objectives for our instruments in external policy.
If we do not succeed in using them successfully, the world will see a growing gap between our often moralising declarations and the reality.
The world does not need such a European Union, and the world would certainly have little respect for such a European Union.
Mr President, how is 2006 ending?
What is our foreign policy?
We saw it in Finland the other day.
We are cursing Russia and caressing Turkey.
That is the reality.
We are cursing Russia, with whom we have an energy-dependent relationship, and we are caressing Turkey, which says provocatively, 'I am Turkey and can impose whatever I choose on Europe'.
As you see, it is insisting that we talk with it at a time when it does not accept the 25th Member State of the European Union, Cyprus.
That is our policy.
We do not see what is happening in Gaza.
When, at long last, will the European Union see what is happening in this area of the world, where children are being killed every day?
There have been about 500 000 deaths in Iraq.
When will we take an initiative at long last?
When there have been a billion deaths?
So what is Europe?
Europe is on the American car carrier which drives us wherever it wants.
Fine, we have handed them the steering wheel, but let us at least take over the brakes, so that we count for something.
Otherwise we are no more than servants of the foreign policy of America, which drives us where it wants, when it wants.
What are our relations with China?
Do we know?
Are they hostile? Are they friendly?
How do we address this factor?
A Sino-Russian axis is developing.
What will we be?
The ham, the salami in the sandwich which the United States of America wants to fix?
Let us decide on a foreign policy of our own.
Let us draw up our own policy. We cannot see it anywhere.
We cannot see Europe's policy anywhere.
We follow America's policy and I do not think that it leads in the right direction, to proper democratic developments.
(Applause)
Mr President, as coordinator for the PPE-DE Group I would like to stress the following points.
We realise the importance of the external competitiveness aspects of the Lisbon Agenda and the coordination of internal and external actions, and we reiterate our commitment to the multilateral approach in trade policy and support for the WTO as the principal forum for the management of globalisation.
We therefore deplore the suspension of the WTO negotiations and strongly urge the Commission to come forward and fight for a settlement on the Doha Round in 2007.
We welcome the EU communication on global Europe competing in the world.
We stress, however, that bilateral regional agreements should remain supplementary, as I said, to the multilateral trade system.
But here I have real concerns, and I would like to question the Commission on this particular point.
Why have we not made progress with the USA on regulatory issues between the EU and the US by completing the transatlantic single market?
We must make a commitment to that over the next decade.
We cannot have a free-trade agreement with the US; that would undermine multilateralism.
But we can have an agreement on regulatory issues which are outside Article 34.
Finally, something that is particularly close to my own heart: there is grave concern over the growing feeling of protectionism and trying to set goals that are outside the Lisbon Agenda.
Member States are increasingly using protectionist methods.
If we are going to have a settlement, we have to move away from that.
Finally, I have serious concerns about EPAs and economic partnership negotiations, and I support the Commission in its proposal.
We must go ahead with it and push it forward.
It is a real chance, probably the last chance we are going to have, to do something to help those poor countries.
If we can get an agreement on that, it will be a great thing.
I look forward to that in the coming year.
(NL) Mr President, many citizens are sceptical about present-day Europe, and its mission is ambiguous.
Too much money is being spent on the old priorities, such as agriculture, while the new priorities, the Europe of the future, such as education, migration policy and fair trade, are being neglected.
Europe must be social not only inwardly, but a social Europe is needed outwardly too.
Just like soft power, a cohesive, united Europe can make the difference in the world.
We do not need unilateral actions like the invasion in Iraq, but active commitment in Darfur with the help of the Security Council.
No relapse to bilateral trade agreements, but a multilateral trade agreement in the World Trade Organisation that respects national public services such as water, education, social security or public housing.
No export subsidies that bring about unfair competition for Africa.
These hugely distorting agricultural subsidies and dumping must cease before 2013.
The funds that are freed up as a result can be used for the development of regional agricultural markets in Africa.
We must also open our markets for products with value added from those poor countries.
Aid and trade, you are arguing in favour of sound initiatives for more coherence and coordination.
In the areas of migration, agriculture and trade, massive inconsistencies continue to exist.
These inconsistencies could seriously hamper the conclusion of the regional trade agreements that are currently being discussed.
On the subject of migration, you emphasised the suppression of the problem, but an effective solution to prevent the brain drain is absent.
Why not go for a Green Card initiative?
Finally, you have accepted the Development Co-operation Instrument (DCI), but no attempt is being made to streamline the Cotonou Agreement in the same way.
Also, there is no energy or time for the real implementation in 2007.
For national policy documents, this involves consultation over there and over here.
It means working with public documents.
It means creating real ownership in the developing countries with the local NGOs, the parliaments and governments.
Just as the DCI is deployed, our Parliament here must be given real influence and control in the same manner.
2007 will be the year of truth for the Commission.
Will unilateral market thinking at European global level persist or will fair competition and solidarity prevail, and will we Europeans prove to Africa that the Millennium Objectives are achievable after all?
Africa is going downhill.
2007 should be the year of the U-turn.
- Closure of debate
Vice-President of the Commission. Mr President, first of all my warm thanks, on behalf of the whole Commission, for all your important and constructive contributions to the debate on next year's work programme, which I have been listening to since 3 o'clock.
My first comment will be a political one and then I would like to say something about the process.
But what I have heard is really a common call for sustainable development, meaning that a majority of you have mentioned the need to create jobs and growth.
This is the start of the debate, but we have to respect the most important resource we have, people, and make sure that we have a social security and social protection system that reaches out effectively to all citizens.
It has to be sustainable growth, which means we have to take account of natural resources, energy issues and environmental constraints.
That is exactly what sustainable development is all about, making sure that we do it the European way, ensuring that all these three elements are covered by an ambitious policy for jobs and growth in Europe.
I have heard these calls for quality jobs and investment in education and innovation, research and development.
As you know, this has been part of our political agenda from the first day of the Barroso Commission.
We propose to respond to this, because it is totally in line with this Commission's political ambitions, and we propose reforms in this work programme.
We propose social cohesion and I think it is important to mention in that context, since there was also a debate about regional policy, that we now have in place all we need - budgets, regulations, etc. - for a regional policy for 2007 to 2013, and that we are negotiating right now with Member States on the programmes.
We hope for close cooperation with Parliament on implementation.
The urban dimension is taken very seriously by the Commission.
The earmarking takes account of the needs of both more and less advanced regions in Europe, because there have been references to unfair cohesion policy and we say that all three dimensions of cohesion must be taken seriously.
This is also reflected in the new regulations, where partnership is in principle obligatory and 82% of the structural funds goes to poorer regions.
Investment in people is one of the three objectives of the cohesion policy and I think that point should come out in the debate.
We are also proposing security measures.
Security includes making sure we can live free from terrorist threats and crime and from environmental pollution.
We say we need to approach this with a lot of optimism and in partnership with all the stakeholders involved, but engaging with Member States.
This has to do with the issue of soft law.
Many of you have mentioned soft law, compared with other measures and legislative acts.
It is important to mention that this Commission work programme for 2007 contains 34 legislative proposals, representing 36% of the total, 57 non-legislative proposals and one negotiating mandate.
That is more than last year's 24 legislative proposals, 57 non-legislative proposals and five negotiating mandates.
This figure shows that the proportion of legislative initiatives has increased from 27 to 36%.
At the same time, the proportion of non-legislative proposals has slightly decreased.
With a more diverse Europe, we also have to invest more in working with Member States to ensure that we prepare for good and better regulation and legislation that will be implemented.
Therefore we need better consultation and better-prepared proposals in order to see better results, and that also applies to working methods.
Mr Harbour asked about resources.
In some cases, perhaps the Commission should ask the European Parliament to give us the resources we need.
As you know, at the moment we are discussing how we can have enough resources to do everything Parliament has put on its wish-list.
I have heard so many proposals for things that ought to be added to the list and things that you have missed - initiatives or legislative proposals - that should be on this list: energy initiatives, migration initiatives, the single market review, the social reality stocktaking, the emissions trading scheme, a European strategy for social services, a Community framework for efficient health services, etc. These 21 strategic objectives cover exactly the three pillars of sustainable development.
If we are to add more of these initiatives or more work, we also need the resources and we cannot pretend otherwise.
We are concerned about the budget for the Commission.
We have to explain to our auditors, the European Parliament and the other institutions, how we use our money.
However, we can discuss the structure until the cows come home, but in the end we have to choose and we have chosen to make this a more political document and explain the priorities of the Barroso Commission.
The different structure you propose makes a lot of sense, but I think this is the way to ensure we can have a real political debate about priorities.
That has been our wish from the beginning, in engaging with the European Parliament to discuss the work programme.
This reflects the kind of dialogue we have had with the European Parliament for a long time, with contributions from all the individual committees.
I think I am speaking on behalf of all my colleagues when I say that we have welcomed this and have enjoyed that debate and interaction with the European Parliament.
I would also like to say that when several of you ask for things that you feel are missing, that is in a way the tip of the iceberg.
So much is being done all the time in the Commission and our departments.
Here you find the strategic objectives, the strategic initiatives, that we say we will give priority to.
At the same time there are a number of things in the pipeline.
You are right on that point, Mr Harbour: you have to decide to give priority to a number of them.
You will also find a list of communication priorities.
That is in response to some of the very important remarks on human rights and anti-discrimination.
As you know, next year will be the Year of Equal Opportunities.
That is one of our communication priorities, on which we will definitely engage with the other institutions.
Whether or not there should be a directive will be debated constantly with the European Parliament, but we can only present directives when we are ready and the circumstances are right.
That will be debated later with the different committees.
Anti-discrimination and human rights are part of everything we do and clearly a political priority in all our activities.
We welcome your contributions.
I find in your comments support for the high ambitions that the Commission has for 2007 and I also welcome your firm support to work together to achieve them.
We are also committed to listening to citizens and to delivery, to becoming more accountable, transparent and effective.
We thank you for your support in pursuing and strengthening our efforts towards better communication.
Now the Commission will study the content of the resolution you will be adopting in December.
The Commission will respond in the most appropriate and timely manner.
The presentation of the annual policy strategy for 2008 could be the moment when the Commission explains how it intends to take account of the resolution on the work programme.
I should like to reiterate that the Commission attaches the greatest importance to our framework agreement.
It has proved a solid basis for productive working relations between our two institutions.
It should remain our common objective to make the best use of it.
Mr Duff, we meet regularly in discussions about the constitutional treaty and, as you already heard from President Barroso, we have great hopes also for next year.
We shall now start preparing to move the institutional issues and hopefully the constitutional treaty forward next year.
We will have to work with Member States and engage in a dialogue with them as to how we can do this in a balanced and effective manner.
But it is clear that the problems addressed by the Constitution have not gone away.
They are there and accentuated by next year's enlargement.
That is why we have to come back to the issue.
We have to engage in a debate.
However, it has not been a detour to say that we also have to have a period of reflection and that we have to engage with citizens.
That has given us a lot in return.
It has been necessary, because we can see a change of debate and atmosphere in many Member States.
It is important to know that we can mobilise that support in trying to find a solution to the constitutional issue.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place during the December part-session.
(The sitting was suspended at 6.10 p.m. and resumed at 6.30 p.m.)
Commission Question Time
The next item is Question Time (B6-0445/2006).
We will take the questions to the Commission.
Part I
Member of the Commission. Under the principle of subsidiarity every Member State of the European Union retains full responsibility for the content and organisation of educational systems.
I have just come from the Education Council which completed its work today under the Finnish Presidency.
The Commission played and will continue to play a role in building a policy for the modernisation of higher education as part of the implementation of the important Lisbon Strategy, through policy dialogue and mutual learning, in particular through the open method of coordination in education and training as well as in the field of research.
As set out in the Commission communication on delivering a modernisation agenda for universities, measures in higher education are needed, ranging from curriculum reform to governance and funding reforms.
The main responsibility, of course, lies with the Member States' national authorities and universities.
There is also financial support for the modernisation agenda from the Community programmes in education and research.
There is potential for substantial support from the structural funds under both the competitiveness and the convergence objectives.
With regard to university-based research, it should be noted that the forthcoming Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Development substantially widens the opportunities for enhanced university research activities.
As you know, total eligibility for projects is going up from 50% to 75% and programmes in lifelong learning and research for the next seven years will both see a very substantial increase in their budgets for the 2007-2013 period.
I think a very important message is sent out by the European Institute of Technology. That is not something outside the framework of this question.
It is a very important initiative to boost the transfer of knowledge by those who intensify investment in creativity, innovation and the improvement of our competitiveness.
The EIT can improve European competitiveness in all three parts of the knowledge triangle: education, research and innovation.
With regard to ranking, which is an important part of the question put by Mr Mavrommatis, there are indeed several international rankings worldwide.
Each has its own strengths, but also its own weaknesses.
Although they are useful in terms of giving an impression of the competitive position of universities, the diversity of universities' missions means that no single set of criteria can be considered as an objective measure.
Different ranking systems give different weights to various criteria and consequently arrive at different results.
However, provided the criteria are explicit, they can be a useful tool for both policy-makers and managers.
At this stage, to answer the question directly, the Commission is not planning to draw up an official ranking list.
(EL) Madam President, Commissioner, do you believe that many of the higher education institutes in top positions in the general classification of another two new surveys since carried out owe chiefly their progress and progress in their courses and of their students to the fact that they have private education standards and, if so, does the Commission perhaps intend to subsidise Member States which will try such an endeavour, irrespective of the private grants that many of the universities in the world receive?
Member of the Commission. I think that Mr Mavrommatis is right in pointing the finger at the teaching, because when teaching is separated from other activities, namely research or even the transfer of knowledge, via innovation, into real practice and the real economy, then all those aspects become rather weak or average, and we fall in the rankings, moving into a second division.
The best answer is therefore to invest more and better.
The question is slanted towards more investment in teaching and research, whereas better means efficiency and the way we organise ourselves, how we transfer knowledge and how we build partnerships between public and private interests and between academia and society.
All these can be improved in our various policies, and in the EIT, which I mentioned as one of the examples of how these issues could be integrated.
Secondly, there is also a need for more investment.
I would not call this a subsidy from the European Union, but rather support for European cooperation, because we put together monies and distribute them in line with agreed rules, and these rules should lead us to excellence, the transfer of knowledge, and the rewarding or promotion of quality, not just quantity, in our academic institutions.
That is our shared responsibility and common task.
(DE) Madam President, I can follow on seamlessly from where the Commissioner has just left off.
Research is important, but education and teaching of students are undoubtedly another of the lofty objectives of universities.
When I worked as a professor, I was saddened to find that some universities, particularly those that always appear right at the top of the major rankings - for example British elite universities such as Oxford and Cambridge - were extremely reserved when it came to the Erasmus programme, in contrast to many other universities.
Could participation in the Erasmus programme be made one of the criteria?
Madam President, Mr Davies, the Commission attaches great importance to the voluntary commitment on the part of the automobile industry to reduce CO2 emissions from passenger cars.
These commitments have made it possible to achieve considerable reductions in consumption by new passenger cars.
In 2004, average CO2 emissions from new passenger cars were 12.4% lower than in 1995, falling from 186 grams of emissions per kilometre to 163 grams.
It is in the industry's own interests to keep to the commitments it has entered into.
Failure to attain the target value of 140 grams per kilometre would threaten the credibility of voluntary commitments as an alternative to legally binding regulations.
So far, all three industry associations have attained the interim targets that were set as part of their voluntary commitment.
Although they consider the final target very ambitious, they have all reaffirmed their determination to achieve it.
I shall not hide the fact, however, that I am very concerned in this regard.
Since the appearance of the report on the progress achieved by the end of 2004, I have been concerned about the fact that the average annual reduction over the coming years will have to be very much greater than before if the final target is to be achieved.
We do not yet have any final data for 2005, but I expect no greater reduction for that year than for 2004.
If it becomes apparent that the industry is not going to meet its commitments, the Commission - as I have already announced - must step in and propose legal acts to ensure that CO2 emissions are reduced to the level considered necessary.
The Commission is currently reviewing the Community strategy to reduce CO2 emissions from passenger cars.
The CARS 21 High Level Group recommends the future strategy consist of an integrated approach involving all relevant stakeholders and thus a wide palette of measures.
I consider this approach essential for achieving a further reduction in CO2 emissions from passenger cars at reasonable cost.
A Commission decision on the future strategy is to be adopted at the end of the year.
This strategy will certainly require further progress in automotive engineering.
We are also considering laying down mandatory targets for motor-vehicle fuel efficiency, for example, but other aspects, too, have to be taken into account, such as policy measures to promote the use of low-carbon fuels, and changing driving habits.
Incidentally, we should also pay greater attention to the other two main components of the strategy: labelling of and tax concessions for low CO2 emission vehicles.
It must be said, unfortunately, that these two parts of the strategy have had extremely little effect so far, but I do believe that there is potential for improvement in this regard.
I am glad the Commissioner is worried, as indeed he should be, because the car industry has comprehensively broken its agreements with the European Union to meet these reductions.
This was largely for profit reasons, because there is money to be made in four-wheel drive SUVs or 'Chelsea tractors' as they are known in the UK.
Three weeks ago, from the very same seat, Commissioner Dimas said legislation would, of course, be necessary.
Can the Commissioner indicate what the earliest date will be at which legislation can be introduced, once the Commission has carried out its review to be published in December?
I should like to start by responding to Mr Davies' assessment of the European motor-vehicle market.
One of the reasons for the failure to meet the targets - but only one of them - is indeed the fact that European market habits have changed, with one market segment undergoing particularly rapid growth, one that is not exactly helpful with regard to CO2.
This is the segment of SUVs: the large, supposedly off-road vehicles with very heavy fuel consumption.
Astonishingly, these heavy, particularly high-emission vehicles have enjoyed favourable treatment in regulations up to now.
The Commission's proposal for the 'Euro 5' standard plans to put an end to the preferential treatment of these particularly large, particularly polluting vehicles.
That is a very important point. This issue is currently being discussed in Parliament.
As far as the timing is concerned, for reasons of fairness and trustworthiness, the industry has to be given the time we have granted it: that is, until 2008.
If, however, it becomes apparent - as it is doing - that the targets are not being met, the Commission will have to start preparing legislation next year, so that it can be presented in 2008.
(DE) Madam President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, particulate-matter emissions from diesel vehicles are a topical issue.
Parliament, together with the Council, lays down high values for pollution.
What is planned with regard to emissions?
Is there any relevant legislation that relates to diesel vehicles and is aimed at the motor-vehicle industry?
Of course, Mr Rack.
The proposal the Commission presented at the end of last year to introduce a 'Euro 5' standard for vehicles reduces particulate matter from both light commercial vehicles and passenger cars.
Our proposal reduces the limit value for soot-particle emissions from diesel passenger cars to 5 milligrams per kilometre as of 2009.
We cannot set this value any lower as it would then be impossible to measure.
In 2009, therefore, the limit value of 5 milligrams will enter into force, which means that, as of then, diesel vehicles without a particle filter will be a thing of the past.
The situation with nitrogen oxides is more difficult as, for a large majority of vehicles, the relevant technology is not yet available - at least at present.
The Commission's proposal provides for a reduction to 200 milligrams per kilometre and is currently being debated in Parliament.
A second measure also being discussed at the present time is my proposal to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides from diesel vehicles from 200 to 80 milligrams.
This would enter into force in 2014 or 2015.
(DE) Commissioner, these CO2 emissions have a global impact, and of course global CO2 emissions also have an impact on Europe.
For this reason, I should like to ask whether the Commission knows of any figures from other industrial centres as to the situation there regarding the reduction of emissions and, secondly, whether the Commission is attempting to influence this.
Vice-President of the Commission. (DE) I am much obliged to the honourable Member for asking this question, as it gives me the opportunity to dispel a relatively widespread misconception.
Of course we have access to such figures, and it is pleasing - in my view - that levels of emissions from new European passenger cars are far, far below the average for passenger cars in other parts of the world.
They are significantly below those in the oil-producing countries - the USA and Japan included.
It is interesting to note here that such countries with poorer emissions levels than ours have legally binding regulations in place for all fields.
Part II
As they deal with the same subject, the following questions will be taken together.
Subject: Tax on beer
What is the Commission's position on plans to increase tax on beer?
Subject: Method used to calculate an increase in rates of excise duty on alcohol
The EU institutions are currently examining a Commission proposal on increasing rates of excise duty on alcohol.
In order to take into account inflation in the period between 1993, when the current rates of excise duty on alcohol came into force, and 2005, it is proposed that the minimum rates of excise duty be increased by 31%.
However, the new Member States joined the EU on 1 May 2004 and made commitments from that date regarding minimum rates of excise duty on alcoholic drinks.
Under the above-mentioned Commission proposal, the new Member States would be required to increase their rates of excise duty in line with levels of inflation in other countries from before the new Member States joined the EU.
Does the Commission consider this to be fair and logical?
Should a different method be used to calculate rates of excise duty on alcohol in the new Member States?
Member of the Commission. I would like to inform honourable Members that on 8 September 2006 the Commission adopted a proposal to adapt the minimum rates of excise duty on alcohol and alcoholic beverages to take account of inflation since 1993, when the current rates were established.
This proposal was inspired by a call made unanimously by the Council on 12 April 2005.
The proposal provides for the proposed increases to come into force from 1 January 2008.
However, in order to ease the difficulties that some Member States may have in increasing their national rates to meet the revalorised minimum, transitional periods have been proposed until 1 January 2011.
The inflationary increase is 31%, based on Eurostat data and the harmonised index of consumer prices.
For beer this means that the current minimum rate of 74.8 euro cents per hectolitre per degree will rise to 98 euro cents.
In other words, the current minimum duty based on half a litre of beer of an alcoholic strength of 5% will rise from 4.5 euro cents to 6 euro cents, an increase of some 1.5 euro cents.
The majority of Member States are not affected by this proposal, as their national rates are already above the proposed revalorised minimum.
However, the impact on those Member States that are affected will clearly depend on the level of their current national rates.
Germany, for instance, will need to increase its national rate on beer by 24.5% in order to meet the revalorised minimum.
This equates to a duty increase on half a litre of beer of just over 1 euro cent.
Furthermore, under the transition period proposed, Germany will have until 1 January 2011 to make the necessary increase.
Honourable Members will see that the impact of the proposed adaptation to inflation will be rather modest and does not justify the outcry in some Member States.
In response to the specific question asked by Mr Paleckis, the Commission points out that the purpose of the minimum rates is to limit distortions of the internal market through different tax levels being set by Member States.
Therefore, the minimum rate should be the same across the European Union.
In the Commission's view it makes no sense to have different minimum rates depending on the point in time one or the other Member State joined the European Union.
As mentioned above, the Commission's proposal contains appropriate transition periods.
Finally, I would like to add that the proposal is currently the subject of discussions in the Council.
These are proving to be more difficult than one would have expected considering that the proposal sets out a purely mathematical adaptation, which has only a marginal effect in some Member States.
I want to inform honourable Members that on 7 November, just a week ago, when we discussed it for the first time in the Ecofin Council, three Member States - Germany, the Czech Republic and Lithuania - opposed the proposal.
It did not, therefore, gain the unanimous support requested, so we postponed the final decision and debate to the next Ecofin meeting which is due on 28 November.
As honourable Members are certainly aware, it will also be the subject of discussions in Parliament.
(DE) Did the Commissioner know that, when Bavaria joined the German Reich in 1871, it did so only on condition that beer be recognised as a basic foodstuff whose consumption was permitted even during military service?
In Bavaria, therefore, beer is a basic foodstuff.
In addition, should a sharper distinction perhaps be drawn between beer and alcopops - that is to say, between a healthy natural product and a load of rubbish?
My second question for the Commissioner is whether greater account should perhaps be taken of regional and national traditions.
In particular, I should like to ask him whether a better idea might be to reduce VAT and beer taxation for the catering trade, in order to ensure the survival of our high-quality catering establishments - which are essential for health.
The healthier the catering trade, the healthier the people.
Member of the Commission. I do know this concept and I do appreciate it.
I like beer myself.
But this is a position not shared either by the Commission or by the Council.
- (LT) Until now, a minimum excise duty has been applied to the most popular alcoholic beverages such as wine and beer, with zero excise duty being applied to wine but not beer; at the moment, there are efforts to increase the excise duty on beer.
How can the Commission explain such differences in excise duty on different types of alcoholic beverages, especially now, in view of France's negotiation for an exemption on a specific type of wine?
Member of the Commission. Last year, when the increase in excise duty on alcohol and alcoholic drinks was discussed by the Ecofin Council, some Member States raised the issue of the difference between the taxation of beer and the taxation of wine.
As the honourable Members probably know, since 1992, when the current rates were established, there has been no positive excise duty rate on wine.
At that time, it was finally agreed that wine would be zero rated.
Unless there is another decision to re-evaluate the excise duty, zero remains zero, even if increased by a proposed 31%.
I appreciate the views of those who argue there is basically not much difference between wine and beer, and it is also a fact that wine and beer are competing on the consumer market.
However, to change the legislation would require unanimity and, as far as I know, at least ten Member States would certainly veto any positive rates on wine.
- (LT) Unfortunately, due to changes in the order of the Commissioners' presentations, I have missed part of the answer to my question; therefore, I would like to ask the Commissioner once again whether he can give any guarantee that the new members of the European Union will not be discriminated against as regards alcoholic beverages.
Member of the Commission. It was already part of my answer that, according to the Commission, there would be no sense in having two different rates of excise duty for the new and old Member States.
As regards the question of the point of departure, and whether or not this should be the excise duty rates established in 1992 and entering into force in 1993, these can be a point of departure and that is the basis of the current proposal.
Should the Ecofin Council agree, we could find some other starting date, but that is not yet something officially tabled for the next Ecofin meeting, which will take place on 28 November.
The Commission is, of course, trying its best to find a solution that is universal and the same for all Member States, be they new or old, and I do hope that on 28 November we will finally arrive at a solution acceptable to all Member States.
(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, although Europeans traditionally like a drink, alcohol consumption has been declining for years even without taxes and health warnings.
Indeed, the US example demonstrates what happens when the consumption of alcohol is criminalised: young people turn to designer drugs.
Perhaps the Commission would do better to step up the fight against illegal drugs instead of demonising and ever increasing the tax on alcohol, the preferred drug of European culture?
Member of the Commission.
The Commission has certainly not proposed to increase the tax on alcohol, because what we are doing is just revalorising.
The current excise duty rates were established in 1992 and came into effect on 1 January 1993.
Between then and now they have lost 31% of their value.
The proposal simply revalorised the excise duty, but it has not been increased by a single euro cent.
Do you accept, Commissioner, that what we are facing in our single market is a double distortion, a distortion between beer and wine, which is grossly unfair, and the distortion arises that because of grossly different rates of taxation and excise duty between Member States.
This is the cause, in my country, of hundreds of white vans going to Calais, filling up and coming back to Britain to sell on the black market, to the great detriment of the British brewing industry, pubs and retailers.
I am sure it is the same elsewhere.
Member of the Commission. Madam President, in accordance with the principles of institutional and procedural autonomy which underpin the EC Treaty, it is for each Member State to determine which courts are responsible for competition matters.
Most Member States, as you are aware, have specific procedural rules for competition-related issues and these include, for example, referring these cases directly to higher courts, limiting the number or type of competent courts or using specialist courts.
National courts also have at their disposal a number of mechanisms in case of doubt about the application of Article 81 and Article 82 to a proceeding.
In particular, further to Article 15 of Regulation 1/2003, national courts can ask the Commission for its opinion on any question on the interpretation of the EC competition rules raised by the facts of a case.
So far the national courts have done so in some twenty cases.
If a binding interpretation of the rules is sought, the national court can refer to the Court of Justice under the preliminary ruling procedure and a number of Member States also provide for the possibility for the courts to refer awkward questions to the national competition authorities.
The Commission, of course, welcomes all initiatives taken by Member States to increase the expertise of the national judiciary in EC competition law.
The Commission itself has already cofinanced the training of approximately 1900 judges on the application of EC competition laws.
(EL) Madam President, perhaps the overlap between the competences of the national competition authorities and the competences of other regulatory authorities is leading to the fragmentation of competition policy in numerous Member States?
Is it perhaps a source of insecurity of law?
Do you think, Commissioner, that a strong institution merging the regulatory authorities - such as, for example, as in Holland, where the competition authority has taken over the energy regulatory authority and the telecommunications authority - would be a good model for other Member States as well?
Member of the Commission. It might indeed be a possibility to give more information on how the ECN is working in the situation you touched upon.
In our regular contacts with all the authorities concerned we should push to ascertain what would be best in their specific circumstances.
I believe that our formula, if it can be done in the Member State itself, and if linked with our rules and regulations in this area, can be of help.
We should take into account that national courts have only had the right to apply under Articles 81 and 82 in full in actions already commenced.
Coordination between the national authorities and the Commission is intense and on a regular daily basis.
I am fully aware that the dialogue has been fruitful until now, and see no reason to expect any change.
One of the benefits of decentralisation was supposed to be that the Commission would be able to concentrate better on the bigger cases.
May I ask, then, why the Commission, as the world's biggest competition authority, has never effectively tackled one of the world's biggest restrictive practices, namely the De Beers Diamond Company, as regards the so-called supplier of choice system, which is highly restrictive to competition?
Member of the Commission. Let me start by offering my regards to the honourable Member, because he has touched upon a very important issue, starting with the compliment that we are the biggest competition authority.
My colleague, Commissioner FigeÄŸ, replied to a question about ranking, and at the moment our ranking in the competition field is number one.
Being number one is an honour, but it is also a challenge because one wants to retain that position.
You mentioned De Beers and I shall write to you in detail about what we have already done.
As you are aware, we were active in the ALROSA/De Beers case and that was also quite specifically related to the issue you are touching upon.
We have limited resources, but at a certain point, when it is decided to tackle a monopoly or a quasi-monopoly, we take things further.
We will remain alert and follow this case.
(EL) Madam President, I should like to comment on the Commission's position on the merger between competition authorities and regulatory authorities.
I should like to point out in your reply that safeguarding the effectiveness of the regulatory authorities, the competition authorities and transparency come first.
These are the basic principles.
I believe that the regulatory authorities, as selected and decided by the Commission, especially the energy regulatory authorities, play an important role in maintaining their independence from the competition committee.
Member of the Commission. The Commission is currently in discussions with the UK authorities concerning the UK film tax incentive scheme, which has been notified to the Commission under the state aid rules.
The Commission is assessing that case on the basis of the 2001 Cinema Communication, which provides that Member States can grant state aid to film production if the content of the film concerned is cultural, according to verifiable national criteria.
In line with the subsidiarity principle, the Cinema Communication leaves Member States to determine those verifiable national criteria.
Neither Article 151 of the Treaty nor the Cinema Communication exclude the possibility that third-country productions or co-productions can benefit from state aid provided by Member States to support films.
However, the Cinema Communication allows Member States to require that up to 80% of the film production budget be spent in the territory concerned in return for state aid.
The UK scheme contains such a requirement.
Also it was not quite clear, on the basis of the initial notifications of the UK film tax incentive, that European co-productions which meet the conditions of the European Convention on Cinematic Co-production do not need to pass the UK cultural test to benefit under the scheme.
At the Commission's request the UK authorities have clarified that in their published guidance on the scheme.
Therefore, the conditions for European co-productions to benefit from the scheme are in line with commonly used European standards.
In contrast, US productions and US-UK co-productions must pass the UK cultural test to benefit from the tax scheme.
The UK cultural test contains the verifiable national criteria, which are intended to ensure that the aid is being directed towards a cultural product.
That is one of the aspects of the scheme that the Commission is examining.
(DE) I should like to ask the Commissioner whether the drafts that the British Government has presented up to now already contain these cultural criteria for UK-US co-productions or whether they need to be added?
My second question is as follows. What is the situation as regards British co-productions in other EU Member States?
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, on the subject of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), the Commission has been supporting the activities implemented by national and provincial health ministries since 1994.
A number of non-governmental organisations have also received direct aid from the European Reconstruction and Development Programme and/or from the budget heading for poverty-related diseases.
These activities have, by and large, achieved the results targeted by the various projects.
Nevertheless, their sustainability, particularly in the social sectors, is a cause for concern due to the ongoing costs they involve.
Two operations with the health ministries are currently benefiting from funding from the indicative programme.
First, there are the partnerships for the provision of primary health care, including for HIV/AIDS, which have received EUR 25 million: this programme establishes partnerships between the NGOs and five of the nine provincial health ministries.
The NGOs fund scholarships and provide appropriate training to untrained or poorly trained healthcare workers.
These healthcare workers give basic care relating to AIDS treatment to patients who previously did not have access to such care.
There are currently 187 000 patients receiving care from 5000 providers, and these numbers will increase considerably once the new programme, to which EUR 45 million have been allocated, comes into operation in 2007.
The second programme comprises support for the South African Government's Comprehensive HIV/Aids Care Management and Treatment Plan, amounting to EUR 25 million.
This programme was approved by the Commission in December 2004.
It aims to support the implementation of this anti-AIDS plan, particularly with regard to human resources planning, marketing authorisations for drugs, funding for care and health promotion activities.
There is also a programme targeting HIV/AIDS in the field of education - the programme on AIDS in higher education, HEAIDS - which has received EUR 20 million.
This programme follows up on a project funded by the United Kingdom Department for International Development (DfID) and Ireland.
It aims to reduce the spread of HIV/AIDS in an age group that is particularly badly affected and is showing signs of lapsing into old behaviour patterns, as well as in the higher education community in general.
A regional HIV/AIDS awareness and education programme - which has received Community funding of EUR 10 million, in addition to EUR 20 million provided by the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Ireland - was approved by the Commission in 2002.
It is being implemented by Soul City, a South-African NGO.
For the last 14 years, Soul City has been receiving considerable aid from the European Community to develop its 'edutainment' - education and entertainment - approach, which involves the use of TV and radio soaps, backed up by leaflets and other documents in a wide range of languages, providing more detailed information on the subjects covered in the broadcasts.
This programme covers not South Africa, but eight neighbouring countries.
Although its activities in recent years have produced excellent results, it must nevertheless be noted that this programme is facing administrative problems connected to its cross-border nature and to the fact that it is supported by a number of different sources of funding.
Alongside the programmes funded by the regional development programme, six projects funded to the tune of around EUR 10 million by various budget headings are currently being implemented in South Africa.
All of them have objectives relating to the fight against AIDS.
One project worth mentioning is a vaccine research project linking research institutes in South Africa and Europe.
In terms of the use and availability of drugs, the Commission does not have a specific programme in South Africa to promote the use of generic drugs, but it does support the measures taken by the South African health department to rationalise and improve legislation on medicinal products.
It should be remembered that the problem is very often not a lack of availability of anti-retroviral drugs, but the reluctance of patients to be examined and treated, together with lack of access to healthcare equipment and staff, particularly pharmacists to see patients and advise them before they start treatment.
Commissioner, thank you for that comprehensive answer.
I know of your personal commitment to this issue, but I met with Zimbabwean and South African AIDS activists at the weekend and the question they asked me, which was difficult to answer, was whether, in your opinion, in relation to the take-up of anti-retrovirals as well as all the other measures you announced, the EU is making a significant impact on the AIDS pandemic.
Is it actually making a difference?
My worry is that in Zimbabwe we are clearly losing the fight because of the special circumstances there.
But they were also telling me that the situation is still extremely serious in South Africa.
Member of the Commission. (FR) I believe that the fight against this scourge depends primarily on there being far more consistency between the various players.
From that perspective, the Commission has also paid a further significant sum into the Global Fund and it will do so again in the future.
At the refinancing meeting in London, we paid something like an additional EUR 90 million into this Global Fund.
I must say that this Global Fund refinancing meeting was not as successful as we had expected: even though we succeeded in raising a relatively large amount, we did not raise the amount that we wanted.
Next, I believe that the European Union, the Commission, must fund projects and strategies that are effective.
We ourselves have neither the necessary expertise nor the necessary ability to become operators or players in this area.
We must therefore trust those who do have this expertise and who have already shown themselves to be somewhat effective.
This will be a long-term fight.
If we think that we can settle this issue quickly, then in my opinion we are mistaken.
I believe that this action is effective, but that there is still a long way to go.
For example, we cannot, in my opinion, ever do too much to promote the provision of education, if only at primary school level, for all girls in Africa.
Indeed, if we really want to have an effective measure in Africa for fighting against this scourge, then we need to start by sending girls en masse to primary school, and to do so very quickly.
I believe that this will be one of the most effective preventative measures for fighting this scourge.
So, yes, Europe is doing everything it can.
However, you are asking me a question that I have difficulty in answering.
You are asking me whether I think we are being effective.
Yes, I think that we are effective, but we will never be effective enough.
Nor can I answer the question about when we will eradicate this scourge.
We can only bet on the quantity of resources, on the strategy of the experts - of whom there are many, sometimes even very many - and on the strategy and the goodwill of the players - of whom there are many, sometimes even very many.
Personally, I believe that it is in our interest to have coherent strategies, and I am not sure that spreading them, as it were, among all sorts of different players is the right answer.
I am very much in favour of the idea of conducting strategies directly with the governments of the countries concerned because I believe that countries must take ownership of the actions that are carried out.
Countries must get involved.
In Botswana, for example, the government, the State of Botswana is making a real effort; it is really going from door to door.
Its work consists in going into every home and explaining about prevention and treatment.
I believe that there is certainly a systematic approach to be taken in this regard.
To return to the question that you are asking me - it puts me in a predicament.
I cannot tell you whether we are effective, because I would be lying if I said that, yes, we are effective.
I believe that we are effective, but I cannot make a bet on it.
- (LT) Madam President, Commissioner, I have a question concerning HIV/AIDS prevention.
I had an opportunity to discuss this issue in Mozambican rural communities.
All people know perfectly well what this disease is and that it must be combated.
Still, the protection is a problem: it is either unavailable or too costly.
What, then, can we do about preventing this disease?
For any action concerning migration and development to be crowned with success, it must be exhaustive and integrated, and we must use our financial instruments in the short and medium term and embark on an enhanced political dialogue, particularly with our African partners.
The Commission's strategy for helping the countries of West Africa faced with returning migrants is thus based on three additional lines of action. Firstly, it is a question of responding to the urgent nature of the situation by harnessing the instruments available: I am thinking of the B-envelope, and of the rapid reaction mechanism.
Regarding Senegal, for example, the Commission is going to spend EUR 9.6 million on implementing measures for supporting and reintegrating repatriated migrants.
This sum is in fact the remainder of the ninth European Development Fund. These measures will be accompanied by other financial measures funded by the rapid reaction mechanism, amounting to around EUR 1.9 million.
Secondly, we must work on the medium term by taking account of migration-related aspects when implementing our cooperation instruments.
Migration-related issues constitute an important aspect of the tenth European Development Fund programme, in addition to the existing instruments.
We have therefore provided a 'migration' facility with EUR 25 million, taken from the balance of the B-envelope under the 9th EDF.

There are many types of reintegration-related measures that are conceivable in the medium term: to implement effective readmission systems between all of the countries concerned, while respecting people's dignity and fundamental rights; to emphasise training and admission so as to help returning illegal immigrants reintegrate into their countries of origin; to financially support national and regional programmes aimed at reintegrating migrants; and to promote information and awareness-raising campaigns for potential immigrants on the risks of illegal immigration.


However, at the risk of seeming somewhat unrealistic, I should nevertheless like to add that we obviously need to ensure that the support and reintegration measures, whatever they may be, do not appear to favour migrants who return to their countries over those who do not leave.
If they do appear to favour them, you will obviously encourage others to leave, and I think that it is extremely important to monitor this.
Ultimately, in the long term, the real answer, as we know, is to have a policy for training and employing young people, which is one of the policies receiving the backing of the European Community, through its support for economic integration policies and through the negotiation of economic partnership agreements aimed at attracting investment and at increasing economic growth, which are prerequisites for the creation of attractive jobs.
These policies are central to the development priorities and the strategy concerning Africa.
I must tell you that, from this perspective, I am one of those who believe that, while growth does not necessarily lead to a reduction in poverty, there can be no reduction in poverty without growth: we must remember that.
I am therefore convinced that the long-term answer consists in promoting economic partnership agreements and in supporting the emergence of integrated regional markets which, I might add, can go hand in hand with a massive aid effort on the part of the European Union in terms of bringing the qualitative standards of products up to the required level, of technology transfer and of the construction of regional and subregional infrastructure, of infrastructure to improve access, and so on.
To conclude, I am going to take the liberty, Madam President, of digressing in order to make a somewhat personal observation, which deserves to be given some thought.
There are immediate measures, which must necessarily be taken and which are sadly often of a security nature, which is something that I can understand because our citizens are worried, are bothered by the phenomenon, and because we have difficulty in managing migratory flows.
