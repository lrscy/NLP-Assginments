I voted in favour, particularly in light of the testimonies of numerous Turkish human rights defenders, who have confirmed that there have been positive developments in Turkey.
Those developments are not sufficient, of course; there are still political prisoners, there is still torture in prisons and there remains much to do.
Stopping the process of opening negotiations at this time would have terrible consequences for the human rights situation in Turkey.
I voted in favour, although we have not had the opportunity for serious contemplation as to where Europe should extend, and because I do not accept the political and cultural borders of the âChristian Club Europeâ, nor the prophecies of the âclash of civilisationsâ.
I voted in favour, provided that Turkey recognises, without delay, the EU Member State of Cyprus, and withdraws, without delay, from the part of Cyprus that it occupies militarily.
I voted in favour of acknowledging the genocide of the Armenian people by Turkey, as I believe that this is essential for reconciliation with its neighbours and with its history.
Â Â  The June List does not view Turkeyâs geographical position or its Muslim religion as obstacles to its membership of the EU.
We welcome the fact that Turkey is drawing closer to the EU.
We must not, however, close our eyes to the fact that both Turkey and the EU must change before full EU membership is possible.
Turkey must acknowledge the Armenian genocide.
It must give its minorities full human rights.
It must achieve a level of economic development such that its membership does not release tensions that may threaten the internal market.
The EU must also change.
The common agricultural policy must be abolished, and structural policy must be revised before Turkey, large and poor as it is, can be absorbed.
To ensure grass-roots support, membership negotiations should, moreover, only be embarked upon once the issue has been debated in the Member Statesâ election campaigns up until 2008.
Finally, the issue of the EUâs Constitution must be solved before the EU adopts a position on the issue of negotiations concerning Turkish membership.
Â Â  . I voted against this report.
Our fellow citizens are concerned about these future enlargements, and above all about the continuing lack of responses to the crucial question of where Europeâs borders lie.
Turkey does not recognise the Republic of Cyprus, a Member State of the European Union which it has occupied for 30Â years, and it punishes anyone who refers to the Armenian genocide.
Ninety-seven per cent of Turkeyâs territory is outside Europe, and Turkey therefore has no right to join the European Union.
Turkeyâs integration into the EU would be tantamount to rejecting a political Europe straightaway, before it has even come into being, and to perpetuating the image of a Europe subject to blackmail and pressure.
Would this be a sensible course of action?
Those in favour of Turkeyâs accession hide behind the Copenhagen criteria under the pretext that Turkey could one day adhere to them, yet this is a trick.
It is not enough to insist only on adherence to these criteria as an indispensable condition to be met before any new accession, because this would mean that any country in the world which adhered to them could, in its turn, join the European Union.
This is why I hope that the Council will agree to the idea of a privileged partnership put forward by France.
Â Â  . Today this House has finally reached a decision on Turkeyâs membership of the European Union.
This was a vote eagerly awaited by European citizens, who struggle to understand their governmentsâ attitudes on this issue.
I voted against the draft report by MrÂ Eurlings, as it came to the conclusion that âthe European Council [should] open the negotiations with Turkey without undue delayâ, and that âthe objective of the negotiations is Turkish EU membershipâ.
The European project is a well-defined one, the aim of which is to share a number of competences between neighbouring and similar countries in order to build a new political whole.
Integrating Turkey into this whole would be problematic for a number of reasons.
Firstly, Turkey is not part of the European continent in geographical terms, as over 90% of its territory is in Asia, and 90% of its borders are with Asian countries.
Secondly, throughout history Turkey has shared none of our values, with such values ensuring that Europe today is based on a foundation of common traditions kept alive by all of us.
Finally, I should like to advance a weighty argument which directly affects our institutional structure; if Turkey enters the European Union it will have the largest population of any Member State, which will mean âŠ
Â Â  . The European Parliamentary Labour Party strongly welcomes the clear recommendation in this resolution, that EU leaders should announce the opening of accession negotiations with Turkey without delay.
We recognise the sensitivities with regard to issues surrounding Turkey's relations with Armenia, however these will be dealt with during the negotiations process.
The report does not in any way imply that resolution of these issues is a precondition to opening talks.
We also register our opposition to any permanent safeguards affecting free movement of workers.
Turkey should receive equal, fair and proper treatment during the negotiations.
Â Â  â As Chairman of the European Parliamentâs Delegation on the countries of the South Caucasus, I welcome the adoption by a large majority of the Eurlings report on opening accession negotiations with Turkey, and would reiterate how crucial it is for the peoples of Europe and for the stability of an entire continent to open the doors of the European Union to this country.
I regret the fact that the European Union did not make the issue of lifting the blockade and opening the border with Turkeyâs neighbour, Armenia, part of the discussions on Turkeyâs possible accession from the outset, and I regret that Turkey has not taken this historic opportunity to show goodwill by opening its border with Armenia.
Yet using the border issue and the Armenian genocide as reasons to refuse to open up to Turkey, as right-wing French political parties in particular have done, is unacceptable.
They are wrong to brandish this argument so soon before the Council makes its decision on opening negotiations, and their only purpose in so doing is to hide their real reasons for rejecting Turkeyâs integration.
Â Â  â More and more European nations, following the example of the French, Germans, Greeks and Austrians, are showing their opposition to Turkey, an Asian country which is part of the Muslim world, entering Europe.
The leaders of the Europe of Brussels, in particular MrÂ Chirac, are well aware of this.
That is why they are maintaining that opening the accession negotiations would not automatically lead to Turkeyâs accession.
This assertion, repeated in MrÂ Eurlingsâ report, is an untruth: since the first enlargement of 1972, every negotiation process has been followed by the accession of the candidate country.
It will be the same for Turkey, especially as its Islamist leaders have warned us that they will not make any concessions.
If on 17Â December, against the will of the people, the European Council decides to open accession negotiations with the Turkish Government, the referendum on the European Constitution will be Franceâs last opportunity to avoid being swallowed up in a union that is European in name alone, and in which Turkey, the most populous country, will play a prominent part.
Â Â  â I am against any further enlargement until the Union has achieved deeper political integration and created a powerful Europe and a social Europe.
With each enlargement the prospect of a federal Europe fades.
Turkeyâs entry will further dilute the European project, and it is not desirable for it to be integrated into the EU in its present form.
The issue that will arise for everyone has nothing to do with either religion or geography: the European Union has to be a political project.
This project is now under threat because it is being limited to a free-trade area with less and less regulation.
We need to overhaul the architecture of Europe and have a federal core, then a Union of 27 countries and then a zone of enhanced cooperation with neighbouring countries such as Turkey, and also other countries like the Maghreb countries, with which we enjoy close links.
Approving the opening of negotiations makes this a more distant prospect and continues a policy of ongoing enlargement.
Legitimate requirements are made of Turkey, but it goes without saying that if this country meets them it will be impossible to refuse it entry.
Before any possible accession negotiations we need to define the future shape of Europe.
We should reject enlargement and begin a different kind of cooperation with Turkey.
Â Â  . As a Member of this House, I have belonged to the parliamentary friendship group with Turkey for as long as it has existed.
No one, therefore, can accuse me of not being well-disposed towards Turkey.
As things stand, however, I feel I am justified in asking whether all the conditions â especially as regards human rights â have genuinely been fulfilled.
I gladly acknowledge that on the issue of women's rights, for example, more reforms have been introduced since Turkey was granted the prospect of accession than in the decades before.
Nonetheless, they have largely taken place on paper; the reality still lags behind.
I was recently confronted with information alleging that sterilisations of Kurdish women have been carried out in Turkey.
When we signed an Association Agreement with Turkey in 1963, which offered the prospect of membership, the European Union did not exist; at that time, we were still the European Economic Community.
Since a customs union with Turkey has existed since 1996, what we have now is very similar to an economic community in which any remaining trade barriers can be dismantled swiftly.
From this perspective too, and because there is no question that Turkey must remain fully anchored in European structures, the option of a tailor-made special status instead of the discriminatory membership deal proposed by the Commission would appear to be a more accessible and honourable path for Turkey, aside from the fact that there are justified doubts âŠ
Â Â  . â I voted in favour of the report by Mr Îurlings on Turkey's progress towards accession to the European Union, because it is the product of compromise between the various political groups in the European Parliament.
However, I am in no way bound by the phrase in paragraph 38 concerning use of the Annan plan as a basis for efforts to settle the Cyprus question, in that this plan was rejected by 76% of Greek Cypriots and 67% of all Cypriots.
As Article 38 rightly says, a solution can be found on the basis of the principles upon which the EU is founded.
I also have reservations about the exact content of paragraph 39, which I consider to be incompatible with the report by Mrs Mechtild Rothe, which the European Parliament voted in favour of about a month ago (see: Rothe report, Amendment No 2, Recital 4a (new) (4a) page 6/15).
Â Â  . Since the AtatÃŒrk revolution in 1923, Turkey has been a typicallyÂ European country, albeit of the old-fashioned, authoritarian kind, which we no longer want in Europe these days.
The armyâs power is immense; there are political prisoners; parties and newspapers are often banned and an electoral threshold of 10% keeps even most legal parties outside of parliament.
Kurds, Armenians and Assyrians are given the choice between leaving the country or adapting to the language, the culture and religion of the Turkish majority.
Turkey must change a great deal before we can welcome it, not only in its legislation but also in daily life.
After more than 40 years, it is now proposed to open negotiations shortly with a view to full membership of the EU.
That is also what the millions of Europeans of Turkish origin want.
A decision as to whether Turkey may join will be made not before, but during, the negotiations.
There is the risk that the Turkish Government may consider that after three or five yearsâ negotiations, Turkey deserves EU membership, without the problems of democracy, human rights and ethnic minorities having been resolved by then, with the potential for conflicts and an eventual rift.
The Copenhagen criteria must not be replaced by Ankara criteria.
Â Â  . I have voted for Turkey's progress towards accession despite having serious reservations.
I would like to emphasise that my reason for voting Turkey's progress towards accession is because it is a Muslim country and will serve as an important bridge between Europe and the Middle East in particular.
I have concerns, however, that Turkey still has a very large number of human rights abuses.
I also have concerns that a country with such a massive number of people living in poverty will not be able to reach the levels acquired in the , and I fear that the emphasis has been on the market access to Turkey rather than the need for Turkey to conform to the social and environmental standards in the EU.
I am not interested in seeing the enlargement of Europe simply in order to see a larger market.
An equal emphasis must be placed on social and environmental considerations.
Â Â  . â The delegation has voted for the Eurlings report on the opening of the accession procedure for Turkey, a procedure that will take several years.
The opening of the procedure unequivocally heralds a change in the political course steered by the Turkish Government, not only in respect of the Community and the Copenhagen conditions but especially concerning the resolution of the Armenian and the Kurdish questions.
The believes that the Council decision of 17Â December should make it unequivocally clear that the opening of negotiations with Turkey requires the Turkish Governmentâs recognition of the State of Cyprus, a full Member State of the European Union, and consequently the resolution of the Cypriot question, which means the withdrawal of the 35Â 000 Turkish troops which, in occupying Cyprus, are occupying a territory of the European Union.
The will watch to ensure that the guarantees and conditions included in the report are complied with, because a successful conclusion to Turkeyâs journey towards accession will not be possible unless they are complied with.
Â Â  . â Turkeyâs possible accession to the European Union brings with it many benefits and a few risks.
The benefits are more political than economic since, as well as being a member of NATO, Turkey has signed a customs union treaty with the European Union that already permits free trade.
Its accession would not only fulfil the dream of millions of citizens of fully belonging to the secular western world, but it would shift the centre of gravity of political and economic influence towards the Mediterranean basin, confirming Europe as a world power no longer closed in within its geopolitical boundaries.
On the other hand, the risks that should be taken into consideration are, first, the reduced likelihood of seeing the birth of a Europe with its own common foreign policy, as well as the possible difficulty of making two diverse religious and cultural identities coexist.
Can it describe itself yet as a democratic state that respects its ethnic minorities?
Secondly, it would have a negative effect on the allocation of European funds to regions currently considered to be âlagging behind in their developmentâ, such as Sicily, at least in the short term.
Lastly, Turkey should withdraw from that part of Cyprus under military occupation, and it goes without saying that it must declare its willingness to square its account with history by acknowledging the errors it has made over the last hundred years ...
Â Â  â I abstained from the final vote on the Eurlings report.
It would, firstly, be reasonable not to consider any further enlargement before first deciding where Europeâs borders lie.
Pushing back their limits indefinitely risks turning Europe into nothing more than a vast free-trade area.
Such a renouncement is anathema to convinced federalists.
Secondly, experience shows that once negotiations have been opened, accession inevitably follows once the candidate country meets the conditions laid down, and in particular the Copenhagen criteria.
But although we might legitimately hope that Turkey will continue to build on the progress it has made, particularly on democracy and human rights, there is as yet no guarantee that Europe is prepared to provide the resources, not least the budgetary resources, to go ahead with such an enlargement in a mutually satisfactory way.
My abstention is then a warning to the European Summit of 17Â December: no more enlargement without deeper integration!
We have to stop presenting the peoples of Europe with and instructing them to ratify decisions taken in their absence several years earlier by the Heads of State or Government.
Â Â  . This report updates Turkeyâs development as regards its eventual accession to the EU, in common with the report by Mr Oostlander adopted on 1Â April.
As I had the opportunity to write then, I feel that Turkey was perhaps hastily recognised by the Council as a candidate for accession.
In the same way, I believe that the Commission recently repeated the mistake when it deemed that the Copenhagen criteria have already been satisfied, while there are still situations such as those detailed in the motion for a resolution that are blatantly at variance with this position.
I endorse the rapporteurâs position that this must be an open-ended process, without a predetermined outcome, albeit a process that does point towards accession.
I also share his desire to see that, regardless of the outcome, Turkey presses ahead with and firmly establishes the welcome reforms that it has been carrying out.
In so doing it will confirm its credentials as a fully democratic and responsible country and one that respects human rights.
Â Â  â I supported opening accession negotiations with Turkey, and I did so for one reason above all: I want a better world for tomorrow, characterised by stability and security.
No one can see into the future, but I know one thing: sharing this area of peace and democracy on which our Union is founded is a unique opportunity that we cannot allow to slip away.
Yes, we should stand firm in the name of historical truth, which is why I continue, as I have done in the past, to demand that the Turkish authorities acknowledge their part in the Armenian genocide.
One truth and one history: we owe it to that same history also to remember that for 50 years Turkey has played an essential role as a loyal ally at the gates of Europe.
Standing firm means sending out a strong message: the marriage will only take place if further considerable progress is made on respect for minorities and gender equality.
I am pleased that the European Parliament supported my amendment to ParagraphÂ 26 on zero tolerance with regard to crimes of honour.
In conclusion, I would ask that the people have a say in the final decision: referendum or consultations âŠ
Â Â  Â .Â Many advantages could be gained from Turkeyâs accession to the European Union, above all an extension of the common market and a strengthening of transatlantic links.
Yet both these goals can be achieved without Turkey joining the European Union.
The European Economic Area is an excellent example of a platform for good economic cooperation with the EU.
It could also be useful to propose a reform of security policy to Turkey, as the country is one of Europeâs major strategic partners in the field of security.
A privileged partnership of this kind with Turkey would provide us with the chance of avoiding a crisis of agricultural policy and cohesion policy.
If we wish to avoid migration-related conflicts, we should not be instrumental in a Muslim country becoming the European Unionâs largest Member State in the near future.
It is estimated that Turkey will have a population of around 90Â million in 2020.
The development of closer relations with Turkey should also be kept more in proportion to Europeâs policy of openness towards Ukraine.
These are all good reasons why we cannot vote in favour of the Eurlings report.
We consider it to be imprudent, as despite serious grounds for opposition to Turkeyâs membership in the EU it continues to support such a membership.
The ongoing discussion of Turkeyâs chances of joining the European Union will fuel increased resentment in Turkey.
Â Â  . I supported the Eurlings report and should like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work.
I will say this in public since we were unable to demonstrate our position in another way on account of the unfortunate secret ballot.
My vote in favour of opening negotiations certainly does not mean that I cannot wait for them to start.
My group rightly believes that it is actually too soon, and I share that view.
At the same time, though, we would like to remain realistic, because after all, the train was put in motion in 1999 and in 2002.
Moreover, we expect that the European Council will give the negotiations the green light.
What matters to us in the ballot is that the Union should retain its credibility and that we send a clear message about the conditions under which these open-ended negotiations are to proceed.
The conditions in the report are strict, but fair.
We support them wholeheartedly, and that is why I have voted in favour.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of the report before us because I feel that the initiatives concerned, which are intended to adopt a Council decision on vehicle crime with cross-border implications, addresses the concerns that we ought to have as regards combating crime.
Furthermore, despite the fact that conferring direct access to SIS may appear to run counter to the rule that âdata may not be used for administrative purposesâ, the truth is that the necessary safeguards are in place to ensure that this cannot happen in this case.
Â Â  . Vehicle theft makes up a significant proportion of crime and has cross-border implications for the EU, and as such is an issue requiring urgent action.
One must also take into account the fact that this particular form of crime is more often than not only one element of broader criminal activity, encompassing various types of crime spread across an enormous geographical area.
It is therefore crucial that the movement and registration process for vehicles from other Member States and, indeed, third countries is monitored extremely carefully.
The rapporteur was right to observe that the new feature of the Dutch proposal is that of national contact points.
I feel that it will be useful to monitor the effectiveness of their activities and periodically to review the methods and practices adopted.
The Commissionâs White Paper on the subject, as proposed by the rapporteur, will accord this issue a broader scope.
Â Â  . We welcome the amendments to the current recommendation for a second reading on the proposal tabled in April, given that they largely correspond with our proposals, which were as follows: that priority should be given to public health and to protecting the most vulnerable groups such as children and the unborn; that maximum residue levels (MRLs) should be set for products, taking account of the variations in climate and on the basis of the best available agricultural practices; that health risks should be explained to the public; that the risks to consumers should be assessed; that the results of national monitoring of residues should be published on the Internet; that the scope of the proposal should be widened to include imported products; and that civil society might be involved in setting MRLs.
It should be pointed out, however, that there is a long way to go on this issue, especially as regards implementing a common agricultural policy that respects the existing cultural diversity, whereby policies are put in place that promote small and medium-sized farming, in contrast with the current measures in place, which, if they achieve their aims, will sacrifice and penalise farmers with fewer resources.
The creation of MRLs on pesticides in food for ...
Â Â  . I welcome this report and the objectives contained within it.
However, we must remember that having established regulations for maximum residue levels of pesticides in food and feed of plant and animal origin, the main priority must be that it is properly implemented and regulated.
Consumers deserve to be protected and thorough implementation can safe-guard their rights.
Â Â  . I wholeheartedly welcome this report, because I consider that recasting and streamlining Community legislation in this area fosters trade within the internal market and with third countries, and does no harm from a Portuguese perspective.
Â Â  . The proposal before us seeks to recast Community legislation on pesticides by replacing the four directives in force with one single regulation.
The proposal also seeks to safeguard certain key objectives, such as establishing a homogenous level of consumer protection throughout the Community, by defining the role of the European Food Safety Authority, and by increasing the trade in foodstuffs within the EU.
I believe that significant progress has been made between the first and second readings, namely the Councilâs adoption of both the amendments tabled by Parliament and the introduction of amendments to its initiative, which have certainly improved the Commissionâs original proposal.
I feel, however, that there remain aspects that could be clarified, such as the distinction between residues â in the context of maximum residue limits (MRLs) â and pesticides.
I agree with the rapporteur, however, that when MRLs are exceeded, those responsible must be held to account and subgroups that may consume more of a certain type of product must be fully protected.
Â Â  Mr President, I welcome the fact that we have made our position clear to Russia.
Like Turkey, Russia is a country which is only partly European and will never join the EU, but it is an extremely important partner.
However, precisely because it is an important partner, we must steadfastly oppose the systematic dismantling of democracy and the rule of law in Russia and the continuing genocide against the Chechen people in a colonial war.
I therefore wish to send a clear message to President Putin from this House: we regard Russia as an important partner, but the statement which he has made against Ukraine, its liberation movement and the liberation of Central and Eastern Europe is an attack on free Europe.
We are hoping for cooperation here, not for a continuation of this unacceptable confrontation course.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of this motion for a joint resolution because I feel that the question before us â relations between the EU and Russia, which is an important international player and the most important neighbour of many of the countries covered by our neighbourhood policy â is crucially important for the future of the area that we share throughout the European continent, and as regards certain concerns at world level.
Nevertheless, I must point out that, in spite of the reservations that I have expressed, I welcome the concern at Russiaâs interference in countries that were previously part of its sphere of influence.
Â Â  . The strategic relevance of relations between the EU and the Russian Federation is undeniable, and the ongoing initiatives to promote and institutionalise those relations are to be welcomed.
Indeed, common borders and interests combine to create an enlarged area of understanding, given the mutual interest in maintaining permanent dialogue on the fields proposed for the four common spaces, the common economic space; the common space of freedom, security and justice; the common space of cooperation in the field of external security; the common space of research, education and culture.
That is not to overlook the worrying signs in the area of human rights and civil liberties that have come to light in Russia, as regards political processes and procedures and the question of Chechnya.
The same can also be said of Moscowâs disastrous interventions, recently in Ukraine and previously in Georgia and Belarus, which have done nothing to benefit the political processes of those countries.
I note and appreciate the desire shown by Russia to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the Second World War, but I completely reject the manner in which the victory for democracy and freedom is compared with the criminal totalitarian subjugation to which all peoples to the east of the iron curtain were subjected.
Â Â  . The two Commission communications on the common asylum policy are most welcome.
They are intended to raise the standard of application of the current directives in the EU, providing for the possibility of a review and to improve conditions for the vast majority of refugees within the region they are fleeing.
I welcome these Commission proposals intended to improve the assessment process by adopting a single procedure, thereby simplifying the process for both the applicant and the administration.
Improvements are to be introduced to training, in-country assessment and the related information and judicial procedures.
I also welcome the additional measures proposed, which offer the means for managed, legal entry into the EU, not least if they help to reduce trafficking in human beings, along with the intention to develop high-quality protection regimes in receiving countries.
I cannot agree, however, with some of the proposals put forward by Mrs Lambert in her report and shall, therefore, be voting against.
One of the main reasons why I reject the report is that it plans to extend the scope of the Directive on minimum standards for procedures
Â Â  . I supported, spoke in favour and voted in favour of Jean Denise Lambertâs report on asylum procedure and protection in regions of origin (2004/2121(INI)) on Asylum.
The overwhelming majority of the report was positive and in line with my own party policy.
However I have strong reservations about point 19 when it states âConsiders that a decisive common foreign and security policy committing the EU as a matter of priority to the resolution of long terms conflicts and conflict preventionâŠâ
Sinn FÃ©in believes that the EU through its member states must play a greater role in conflict prevention and resolution and in promoting dialogue and negotiation as an alternative to military intervention.
However we are wary of the moves within the EU towards the development of a common foreign and security policy as this would undermine national sovereignty.
The most appropriate vehicle for dealing with such issues is through member state cooperation and under the auspices of the United Nations.
The EU should play a more pro-active role on conflict resolution and prevention within this context.
Â Â  . Whilst we do not accept, and are in fact critical of, certain aspects of this EP initiative report, such as its supranational outlook and its support for the common foreign and security policy, we also appreciate its positive aspects.
We feel that, as part of the current policies pursued at EU level, this resolution criticises very mildly, and does not condemn clearly, the impact of the current EU asylum policy.
It does, however, among other points, highlight this threat to âthe European humanitarian traditionâ and criticises what is termed the âoutsourcingâ of the process of application by sending applicants for refugee status to a third country, and condemns the lengthy processing of asylum claims.
The resolution contains a number of points that we welcome, such as its call for strict compliance with international standards, encompassing the principle that refugees may not be expelled (allowing the asylum seeker to enter the country in which the request was made); the rejection of any funding for detention camps or any other centre restricting asylum seekersâ personal freedom; and an end to the policy of repatriation and readmission aimed at sending immigrants back to their countries of origin, as our group had proposed.
Hence our vote in favour.
Â Â  The report on asylum procedure and protection in regions of origin is part of establishing the first stage of a common European asylum system, and the aim is to apply one and the same procedure to international protection in all the Member States.
The June List does not, however, wish to contribute to any Fortress Europe.
An EU Member State must be able to conduct a generous refugee policy if it wishes to do so.
We cannot therefore support the report.
Â Â  â This report is a further step towards the adoption of a single asylum procedure.
Curiously, it does not apply solely to political refugees, who should nevertheless be the only ones entitled to apply for asylum under the Geneva Convention.
It also applies to all of those who might benefit from âsubsidiary protectionâ, that is those who cannot return home because of the general situation in their country of origin.
The future European asylum application procedure will therefore cover all those who wish to migrate.
It is true that in the borderless Europe of Brussels there is a political tradition of systematically fostering immigration.
Moreover, ParagraphÂ 25 of the report states that we need, âa common asylum procedure within the EU based upon high standards of deliveryâ.
This report on the rights of migrants makes no mention of illegal immigrants, however.
Furthermore, the return policy is strictly defined: the refusal to grant asylum has to be duly reasoned in writing in an âauthenticated documentâ in the applicantâs own language, and it is not possible to use charter flights.
In addition, the report rules out the possibility of setting up detention centres in transit countries.
Â Â  . I wish to congratulate Mrs Lambert on her important and timely report on asylum procedure and protection in regions of origin.
I endorse the report, in particular where it proposes, in addition to the current European common asylum policy, the creation of measures both to develop orderly and better organised entry into the EU of persons in need of international protection and to step up protection capacity in the regions of origin.
The aim is therefore to protect, at an early stage, political asylum seekers and refugees who, given the lengthy processing of asylum claims, especially in crisis situations, may resort to illegal means of travel, which may undermine their personal security.
Statistics show that in 2003 some 70% of the worldâs refugees remained in their region of origin.
It is therefore essential to offer greater protection of better quality in those regions, but to be clear that this is in addition to the EUâs current responsibilities to offer protection under international agreements.
Â Â  . I welcome this report as it stresses the need for a high quality asylum procedure that acts acquiescent and compatible with the Geneva Conventions in addition to other existing international legal instruments.
I am in agreement with this report whereby the speed and administrative efficiency are important in assessing any system but they cannot be the only criteria when peopleâs futures are at risk.
I commend the report for recognizing that although the intention to develop high quality protection regimes in conjunction with receiving countries is to be welcomed but should not become a means to enhance border control with the intent of preventing people moving on or a way of abdicating our own protection responsibilities.
Â Â  . I supported, spoke in favour and voted in favour of Jean Denise Lambert's report on asylum procedure and protection in regions of origin (2004/2121(INI)) on Asylum.
The overwhelming majority of the report was positive and in line with my own party policy.
However I have strong reservations about point 19 when it states 'Considers that a decisive common foreign and security policy committing the EU as a matter of priority to the resolution of long terms conflicts and conflict prevention.........'
Sinn FÃ©in believes that the EU through its member states must play a greater role in conflict prevention and resolution and in promoting dialogue and negotiation as an alternative to military intervention.
However we are wary of the moves within the EU towards the development of a common foreign and security policy as this would undermine national sovereignty.
The most appropriate vehicle for dealing with such issues is through member state cooperation and under the auspices of the United Nations.
The EU should play a more pro-active role on conflict resolution and prevention within this context.
Â Â  . My opinion of this report is based on the following main factors:
On the one hand, I am in favour of some of the essential issues raised, in particular where the report proposes to establish universal standards for applying existing directives, and advocates improving conditions for the vast majority of refugees in the countries of origin.
On the other hand, I disagree on a key point: the application of asylum procedures to other situations of subsidiary protection.
In the end, I voted against the report in light of the vote on certain amendments that I considered fundamental.
Â Â  . The approach to issues relating to the granting of asylum has swung between two extreme perspectives, neither of which has, in practice, proved an effective means of resolving the problem.
The truth is that neither the concept of Fortress Europe nor that of Sanctuary Europe has much to do with reality.
They are both caricatures, distortions of a complex issue that is intrinsically linked to peopleâs rights and expectations and to the need to safeguard collective security and public order.
At a time when the area of freedom, security and justice is being consolidated, I feel that it is appropriate to address this issue and the role of countries of origin and of transit in the problem before us.
Whilst I understand the generosity underpinning the rapporteurâs proposal, I cannot vote in favour of it, because, as regards granting refugee status, the proposal does not only deal with the cases of individuals â it widens the scope to subsidiary protection, and this raises doubts as to the appropriateness and proportionality of the proposal.
Â Â  . â The ÎU wants to remove by all possible means the victims of the intervention policy which it is following together with the USA in a series of countries.
Anti-asylum legislation, the inhumane record numbers of asylum requests refused and mediaeval living conditions in immigration centres were not enough.
Now it also aspires to keep anyone seeking asylum, seeking international protection, outside the ÎU.
Only those who are obedient and organised are accepted as necessary at the altar of the 'competitiveness' of the European monopolies.
The proposed 'Community-wide system of resettlement' is a mantle for public opinion to accept the creation of camps to round up immigrants outside the ÎU.
Finally, the 'protected entry procedures' promote non-entry, in that asylum requests will be completed in a country outside the ÎU.
Within the framework of the 'sharing of responsibilities' between the ÎU and third countries, the burden of keeping immigrants until the deportation decision is formally received is being passed on to them.
The text is teeming with references to human rights, accompanied by proposals and policies which violate them.
Coercive readmission clauses in agreements with third countries are advocated.
There is not a word on combating the causes for the waves of refugees.
A common foreign and security policy is advocated which will pay greater attention to 'conflict prevention'; in other words, which will fan the flames of the fire ignited by imperialism.
Â Â  This report contains proposals and wordings that reflect a liberal attitude towards drugs.
We are thus voting against the proposal.
We are opposed to drugs being classified as âsoftâ or âhardâ and to the fact that drugs described as âsoftâ are not regarded as addictive.
The âalternative policyâ recommended in the report involves a more liberal policy towards drugs, emphasising harm reduction measures against drug use, rather than preventive work.
We are opposed to a common EU drugs policy.
Such a policy would involve countries with a restrictive drugs policy, such as Sweden, being forced to conduct a more lenient and liberal drugs policy.
It is up to each national Parliament in the EU to make decisions concerning their national drugs policies.
Â Â  â Drug consumption is on the increase throughout Europe.
Around 7Â 000 people die of overdoses every year in the European Union, and three times as many die as an indirect result of drug abuse (suicide, violence, AIDS, road accidents, and so on).
It appears that Brussels wishes to tackle this scourge.
Great, except that what it is proposing in the fight against drugs is not to prevent young people from taking drugs or to give drug addicts the means to come clean, but to make drug addiction more hygienic.
For example, it has tabled proposals for recovery rooms, rooms for injecting heroin under supervision and needle exchange programmes.
We cannot accept such a policy.
Prevention is of course essential in the fight against drugs, but so is repression.
We should increase the penalties for drug dealers and introduce court orders for medical follow-ups for users.
Finally, we should not draw a distinction between soft drugs and hard drugs, as neither are harmless.
Moreover, this over-simplistic classification has led to a considerable increase in cannabis consumption.
We must not forget that there is scientific evidence linking the use of these drugs and mental health, with the occurrence of schizophrenia being between 30% and 50% higher in cannabis users.
Â Â  . I take the view that negotiations with Turkey should start as soon as Turkey complies with the political Copenhagen criteria, for example in relation to the protection of human and womenâs rights, the combating of corruption, the punishment of torture and the outlawing of child labour.
Turkey has made impressive progress in these areas, but it is apparent from the reports by non-governmental organisations that it has not yet achieved these objectives.
The negotiations will be commenced with a view to acquiring Member State status, but if the conclusion seems appropriate that membership is not feasible, other forms of cooperation are possible.
Â Â  . This is a commendable attempt to draw attention to the EU's increasing Drug problem and find solutions using a scientific and practical approach.
Steps to combat the drugs trade would threaten one of the most important sources of income for organised crime and terrorist organisations.
For example, according to the Europol report on organised crime, drugs production and trafficking continue to be the main activity pursued by criminal groups in the EU.
No other field of organised crime is quite so profitable.
I welcome the view that a Community project should be launched for the purpose of introducing alternative forms of detention, so that drugs repression ceases to focus exclusively on imprisonment.
The anti-drugs strategy should be regarded as a form of social intervention concentrating on the reasons for social unrest with a view to preventing drugs use by refining a strategy of repression which is currently targeted solely at drug users.
Â Â  . The European Parliamentary Labour Party voted for the Catania report on the EU drugs strategy because we believe it provides a comprehensive approach to tackling the harm done by particular drugs to individuals and to the spiral of crime, violence and trafficking caused by the trade in particular substances.
It addresses harm reduction, addiction and crime.
On Amendment 2 concerning the issue of the distribution of particular substances under controlled circumstances, the EPLP voted against both parts because we do not believe this amendment enhances the report or is in line with the UK Government's drugs strategy, which the EPLP fully supports.
Â Â  . The issue before us is the EUâs anti-drugs strategy that the Council decided to establish in June 2004 and that is set to be adopted at the next European Council.
This report goes against the grain of the EUâs fundamental concepts, as it chooses to take the view that the strategy currently being implemented is not bearing fruit, that in some cases it has violated citizensâ rights and, accordingly, that a different path must be followed; it even suggests that some drugs should be decriminalised.
Furthermore â and this makes sense within the logic of the report â it takes the view that the subsidiarity principle is not very important in this area.
This is not my understanding of what the anti-drugs strategy ought to be.
I therefore voted against.
Â Â  . The fact that this report was passed so narrowly in the committee concerned shows that the rapporteur deviated from the European Strategy against drugs, by proposing a solution that, to my mind, does not solve the problem, but rather exacerbates it.
It is nothing new in this House to see Members try to put liberalisation forward as a solution, to see the notion of damage limitation as the be-all-and-end-all and to speak the language of surrender when it comes to drug trafficking.
This practice already has a notable history, with the common thread being that it is up to the Member States to enforce it â at complete variance with the subsidiarity principle, which must continue to apply to this issue â despite the need to coordinate the fight against drugs.
The slackness and decriminalisation that have been proposed are well known ways of removing responsibility from the public authorities and are a false ally of those whose drive and judgment have been subdued by the effects of drugs, and therefore constitute a deeply flawed message to give to the youngest members of society.
It is ironic that the rapporteur cites fundamental rights and claims to fight against an âideological approachâ to this subject, in order to justify a highly ideological position that, strictly speaking, runs counter to basic fundamental rights.
Â Â  â On 16 and 17Â December, the Council will decide on the new European Union Anti-Drugs Strategy for 2005-2012.
A political agreement has already been reached in the Council, with no transparency or democratic scrutiny by Parliament.
Indeed the Council has been very reluctant to meet our repeated demands for information about the progress of negotiations, even though we were discussing the same issue in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs.
Today I voted in favour of MrÂ Cataniaâs report, because the European Parliament has to show the Council what its vision of the new anti-drugs strategy is for the years to come.
We note that the European strategy has achieved little to date, and at the same time, drug use has increased in Europe.
We therefore want to step up coordination and cooperation at European level so that Europe can bring added value to the fight against the scourge of drugs while respecting the principle of subsidiarity.
We must finally make the protection and health of drug users a priority.
We must therefore step up prevention, provide better care and enhance health policy so as to avoid human tragedies and reduce exclusion.
Â Â  . â The European Parliament recommendation has not taken account of the recent annual report of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addition, which demolishes the so-called Dutch experiment and the argument that cannabis is allegedly harmless.
In the name of a non-existent realism, the recommendation distorts the nature of the problem from a social to a medical problem, something which results in submission and defeatism.
The rapporteur endeavours to achieve the general application of the Dutch experiment through the back door, adopting the dangerous approach of dividing drugs into soft and hard.
He uses the word 'consumers' instead of victims/users and proposes the creation of official drug administration centres.
As a consequence of this dangerous approach, all the proposals which detract from the primary concern â prevention â focus on damage limitation (substitution programmes) and look for solutions in the mechanisms and resources of the ÎU.
The connection between drug trafficking and the funding of so-called terrorism gives arguments to imperialist propaganda and is becoming an alibi before the people.
We do not demonstrate any tolerance of the drug culture.
The reasons for drug addiction cannot be divided into 'hard' and 'soft'.
Preventive and therapeutic measures and measures to reintegrate users are needed, together with a movement which will fight to overturn the social causes and the barbaric policy of capitalism which leads to drugs.
Â Â  That concludes the explanations of vote.
Â Â  The sitting is suspended.
Â Â  Madam President, I would like to make a personal statement pursuant to the provisions of Rule 145.
In view of the fact that a Member of the European Parliament has been grossly insulted, I have submitted a request to the President of the European Parliament to conduct an enquiry into information, which has been deliberately circulated in my country, Latvia, concerning my activities here at the European Parliament.
An employee at the Green Group secretariat has spread this false information.
He has voiced the opinion in mass media publications that my activities aroused such indignation amongst Members of the European Parliament that, in protest against me and my personal views, they left the Chamber.
This person described my accounts of my activities at the European Parliament as lies.
Madam President, none of this information is true.
I therefore request the leadership of the European Parliament to investigate this incident and to reinstate the truth about my European Parliament activities.
A Member of the European Parliamentâs job and duty is to work in the common interests of European democracy, truth and development.
Every employee has these same duties regardless of their political convictions.
Spreading lies or allowing them to be spread not only fails to promote the principle of legality, human rights and justice, but also discredits the European Parliament and its Members.
This cannot be permitted.
I request an investigation of these incidents.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr Kristovskis, for this personal statement.
The parliamentary services will investigate the matter you have raised and ascertain whether it is appropriate to launch an inquiry.
Â Â  â The next item is the report (A6-0065/2004) by Mr Van Orden on Bulgaria's progress towards accession(COM(2004)0657 â C6-0150/2004 â 2004/2183(INI)).
Â Â  . Madam President, it is almost nine years to the day since Bulgaria formally applied for membership of the European Union.
Since then the country has undergone tremendous political and economic changes: it became a member of NATO earlier this year and is now well on course to join the European Union on 1 January 2007.
I see no significant obstacles to this and I trust that the European Council, when it meets at the end of this week, will not only endorse this view but also set a date early in the new year for signature of the Accession Treaty.
Bulgaria must be judged on its own merits and its progress should not necessarily be linked to that of any other candidate country.
That is why a separate Accession Treaty for Bulgaria may be necessary.
Let us look at some of the changes that have taken place in Bulgaria.
On the one hand we can recognise that the accession criteria and deadlines set by the European Commission have provided an external catalyst for change.
However, on the other hand, internal dynamics have greatly altered the political and social landscape in Bulgaria as it cast off its old mantle following the collapse of communism in 1990.
These changes are taking place not just because the European Union is insisting on them, but because they are good for Bulgaria and they are what the Bulgarians themselves want.
Bulgaria is now a fully functioning market economy and has been recognised as such since 2002.
Macroeconomic stability has been maintained, including adequate price stability and sustainable public finances and external accounts.
To take just a couple of key economic indicators, Bulgaria's GDP grew by 6 per cent in the first quarter of 2004, up from 4.3 per cent in 2003, and one of the highest rates among EU candidates and new Member States.
The unemployment rate has consistently fallen since 2002: at 12 per cent it is still too high, but it is falling.
Foreign direct investment is at record levels this year.
Enormous progress has also been made on privatisation: 80 per cent of the economy is now in the private sector.
I strongly support the ongoing reform of Bulgaria's public administration, with the adoption of amendments to the Civil Service law.
Improvements have also been made in the judicial system: there have been positive developments with regard to the recruitment and appointment of judges.
However, more needs to be done, in particular in relation to pre-trial procedures and the position of the Prosecutor General.
However, it is not now just plain sailing.
There are still areas of concern that I have been highlighting since 1999.
Organised crime and corruption are an obstacle to reform in Bulgaria, having knock-on effects in all sectors of the economy and society.
I have drawn particular attention to the need for more human and financial resources to be targeted to bring about major improvements in the welfare of children and in childcare institutions.
I have called for a well-resourced, single government agency, with the power to ensure that child welfare reform happens.
The same strategic approach must be adopted for the integration of the Roma community into Bulgarian society.
Bulgaria, assisted by the European Commission, must make an even more determined effort to expedite the integration of Roma into mainstream society, particularly through educational and employment opportunities, improved living conditions and access to healthcare and family planning.
There is also another side to this problem: the Roma themselves must adapt.
This point may be unpopular in some circles but it is the only way that real change will be brought about on the ground for the Roma.
Over the past four years over EURÂ 160 million of Community funds have been directed at Roma issues.
However, change must happen from the inside as well as on the part of government.
The European Union's enlargement to the east and south-east marks a momentous change in Europe.
We have finally put an end to the hostilities and the divisions of the Cold War.
History is being written as we speak â in Ukraine, for instance â and this morning Parliament gave its green light to the opening of accession negotiations with Turkey.
Great changes are taking place on our continent.
We are in a time of transition and we must all work hard to ensure that the tide of change shifts in the right direction.
Within Europe this means refocusing the nature and objectives of the European Union.
This means the EU doing less but doing it better.
I wish to thank colleagues across Parliament for their support and assistance in my work as rapporteur.
There will be an opportunity for a more comprehensive report on Bulgaria's accession early in the new year.
My report this time is deliberately concise.
Some amendments were included during the committee stage, but I do not feel that I can support any of the amendments now proposed.
Finally, I wish to take this opportunity to highlight the plight of Bulgarian nurses incarcerated in Libya and now under threat of the death penalty.
I urge all Members to sign Written Declaration No 61 calling for their early release.
Bulgaria knows the challenges that lie ahead.
On 17Â December I trust the European Council will formally conclude Bulgaria's negotiations and set the date for signature of the Accession Treaty in spring 2005.
This will be a great achievement, but reform and change must continue both in Bulgaria and in the EU itself.
Â Â  . Madam President, it is a great pleasure to be able to inform you formally that on 13Â December 2004 the General Affairs Council closed the negotiations with Bulgaria.
We will now start the last, very important phase before entering the EU.
The remaining two years should be used to prepare thoroughly for membership.
The EU congratulates Bulgaria on this positive result, which has taken much effort and energy.
It is a new step towards a truly reunited Europe, based on mutually accepted principles of democracy and the rule of law.
The negotiations with Bulgaria closed at the technical level in June 2004. This reflects the progress that the Bulgarian Government has made in recent years, which resulted in strong confidence on the part of all those involved and the ability to assume all membership obligations by January 2007.
Still, as the Committee on Foreign Affairs also states clearly in its motion for an EP resolution on Bulgaria's progress towards accession, we should closely monitor the progress which still has to be made by Bulgaria.
The commitments made in the Justice and Home Affairs chapter might need an amendment of the Constitution, which is a long and difficult process.
Other important areas, as the Committee on Foreign Affairs states, are the quality of border management, the fight against corruption, and the prevention of abuse of powers by State authorities against persons entering or transiting Bulgaria.
The new penal code still has to be approved.
Administrative capacity in a number of areas, including the agencies involved with the use of pre-accession funds, should improve.
Both in Bulgaria and in Romania, improvements in the standard of living should be a priority.
The economic growth that Bulgaria and Romania have seen in recent years has had a positive effect on purchasing power, but the effects at grass-roots level, especially for the elderly, have remained limited.
There are at least two more years to go before accession.
An historic step will be made on 17Â December when the negotiations regarding the fifth enlargement have come to an end.
Monitoring of the last part of the fifth enlargement will continue until 2007, in order to welcome the two new, long-awaited members then ready to join the European Union.
As Mrs Kuneva said in October, she would like to publish the Monitoring Report on a big wall in Sofia in order to keep the process going.
I think Bulgaria has made good progress, which gives us confidence for the numerous tasks still remaining.
The Council looks forward to the finalisation of the Accession Treaty with a view to its signature in spring 2005, after the Treaty has been submitted to the European Parliament.
Â Â  . Madam President, we have come a long way since Bulgaria applied for EU membership in 1995 and opened its negotiations in 2000.
Yesterday the EU finalised the accession negotiations with Bulgaria in the accession conference, with a view to accession on 1 January 2007 and with the signature of the accession Treaty in sight in the spring of next year.
I would like to thank the European Parliament for its constant and balanced support for Bulgaria's ambition to accede to the European Union and I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Van Orden, for the sound and even-handed report he has produced.
In the past few years Bulgaria has made steady progress in all areas in its preparation for accession and for meeting the Copenhagen criteria.
Important and necessary decisions have been taken in this respect.
Four units of the Kozloduy nuclear power plant are being closed on agreed dates for final decommissioning, showing Bulgaria's determination to respect commitments.
Substantial support from the Union is being provided as assistance to these efforts.
Overall, Bulgaria has consolidated and deepened the stability of its institutions.
Continuation on its current reform path should enable the country to cope with competitive pressures and market forces within the European Union.
We will, however, need to keep a close watch on some areas.
Our intention now is to intensify our monitoring of the commitments that have been made and of continuing preparations in general, in order to ensure that progress continues after the closure of negotiations and that Bulgaria will be effectively ready for membership in 2007.
In this regard, solid efforts remain necessary concerning the reform of the judiciary, the fight against organised crime and the fight against corruption.
Bulgaria has made progress in gradually building up its administrative capacity but further efforts remain necessary in this regard in a number of areas.
As from November 2005 the Commission will issue yearly comprehensive monitoring reports for the Council and Parliament following the same methodology as was applied to the new Member States that joined the Union in May 2004.
These reports will focus particularly on public administration, the judiciary and the fight against corruption, as well as the track record in economic reforms.
It is also necessary to take account of a longer period between completion of the negotiations and the effective date of accession than in previous waves of accession.
A specific safeguard was agreed, which allows the Commission to recommend to the Council to decide by unanimity, at any time, to postpone the date of accession by one year to January 2008 if there is clear evidence that Bulgaria is manifestly unprepared.
Let me conclude by saying that I share the conclusions of the report of your rapporteur, Mr Van Orden, which are, by and large, in line with the 2004 regular report.
The Commission will continue to keep the European Parliament informed of Bulgariaâs progress towards accession.
Bulgaria is on track for accession on 1 January 2007.
With the accession of Bulgaria and Romania, the fifth round of EU enlargement will be concluded.
Thus the Black Sea will become a new coastline for an enlarged and unified Europe.
Â Â  . Madam President, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets, I would like to begin by pointing out that the financial pre-accession aid granted to Bulgaria during 2000-2004 has amounted to approximately EUR 178 million per year from the PHARE Programme, SAPARD and the ISPA instrument.
The Committee on Budgets also supports an additional sum from the PHARE Programme of EUR 200 million for 2000-2006 for the closure of the Kozloduy nuclear power station.
It is also pleased that in Spring 2004 a new funding framework was established for Bulgaria and that the Commission has adopted a consistent approach by restricting the aid package to a period of three years from the accession of Bulgaria in 2007 so that we can adapt it to any future reforms of policies which may be necessary as a result of the new financial perspectives.
The Committee on Budgets stresses once again that financial aid will depend on the new financial perspectives, but also on the adaptation of the annual Budget, in accordance with those financial perspectives.
Â Â  . Madam President, unlike Turkey, Bulgaria is quite clearly a European country which has made tremendous progress.
I was in Bulgaria in 1990, when the country first attempted to hold free elections.
There was still some election-rigging, but the democracy movement was impressive.
In many ways, it was reminiscent of the current situation in Ukraine.
Bulgaria has succeeded, step by step, in overcoming these crisis situations, and must now be taken seriously as a very promising candidate for accession to the European Union.
It has a rich culture and exerts a major stabilising influence over the entire Balkan peninsula.
Although there is still a great deal to do â especially on the rule of law, justice and administration, where further reforms are required â Bulgaria is by far the most advanced of all the candidate countries, unless, that is, we forget a country which we should never forget, namely Croatia.
I would like to take this opportunity to appeal also to the President-in-Office of the Council to accept Croatia at the forthcoming summit without any prevarication or special conditions, and to make massive efforts to ensure that the negotiations with Croatia are opened without delay.
Both these countries should become members of the European Union before the decade is out, and Mr Van Orden's excellent report makes a major contribution to this process.
One of Bulgaria's particular achievements is the cross-party cooperation established between Prime Minister Saxe-Coburg-Gotha and the Bulgarian President, which is a prerequisite enabling Bulgaria to bring its progress towards EU membership to a successful conclusion in the coming years.
Bulgaria enjoys democratic stability at domestic level and is remaining resolute despite the crises affecting a number of areas, including the economy.
I would like to say how gratified I am by this development, and that Bulgaria is well on track.
I could sum up my speech in a single word: âyesâ to Bulgaria.
Â Â  . I would like to congratulate Mr van Orden on his outstanding report, which I believe is the fruit of much hard work, and I would like to thank the Commissionâs excellent work done with regard to candidate countries.
Technically, Bulgaria has completed all the accession negotiation chapters and is clearly headed towards becoming a full member of the European Union in January 2007.
According to the report, Bulgaria continues to fulfil the Copenhagen criteria and the measures taken to successfully implement them have been effective.
However, this report also emphasises that there are still deficiencies that will inevitably have to be dealt with.
We believe that Bulgaria is on track for accession and will continue to make efforts to complete successfully the reforms it committed itself to in the near future. These mainly include judicial reform and further increased efforts to counter organised crime and corruption.
The report welcomes positive changes implemented in the field of minority rights, as a result of which the so-called legislation on anti-discrimination was adopted on January 1, 2004.
The report also emphasises the importance of the legislatureâs practical extension, as discrimination against Romany people remains widespread there.
The report acknowledges Bulgaria meeting the economic criteria and notes that it is a functioning market economy and at the time of accession will be able to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the Union.
The European Parliament and the Socialist Group will continue the monitoring system while ensuring that operations are run efficiently and obligations are fulfilled.
Based on Bulgariaâs reform efforts and progress, the Socialist Group hopes that Bulgaria will sign and ratify the accession treaty as soon as possible and will become a member of the European Union in 2007.
Â Â  . Madam President, Commissioner, MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, my group also views Bulgaria's progress towards accession as a success story, albeit with a few necessary caveats on points of detail.
We therefore believe that this House can vote in favour of Bulgaria accession to the European Union in 2007 with a clear conscience.
We support Mr Van Orden's report and speaking personally, I would like to thank him and Mrs Dobolyi from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament for the good cooperation.
As Mr Van Orden himself has said, he has deliberately kept the report brief.
I therefore suggest that we discuss all the other tabled amendments, some of which are very detailed, next year when we deal with the longer report which will then be due.
Bulgaria is well on track to join the European Union in 2007.
I would therefore like to take this opportunity to highlight a fundamental problem, namely that of genuine compliance with the principle of merit.
The Commission and the Council have both stated that each candidate's accession should be based on individual merit.
However, this is incompatible with a situation in which a candidate country which fulfils the criteria is held back by the slower progress made by other countries.
The countries making swifter progress thus accede too late while the candidates making slower progress join too early.
To put it simply, the good performers are being penalised while the laggards are being rewarded.
This situation must change.
The credibility of the Union as a whole is damaged if its practices conflict with the principle of merit.
Commissioner Verheugen amply demonstrated this with the 'big bang' enlargement in May this year, which damaged the Union.
A better option would have been for well-performing candidates, such as Estonia and Slovenia, to have been able to join much earlier.
For this reason alone, namely to preserve the European Union's credibility and not because there is any doubt about the European prospect of either of the two candidates, my group has always been in favour of separate accession treaties for Bulgaria and Romania.
MrÂ Watson reaffirmed this position this morning in this Chamber.
I therefore urge the Commission and the Council, but also my fellow Members in this House, to ensure, during present and future enlargement rounds, that the principle of merit is not just proclaimed with pomp and ceremony, only to be ignored in favour of package deals, but is actually implemented in practice.
In this context, a gratifying sign is the Council's decision to adopt differentiated approaches to Bulgaria and Romania in the chapters on competition and justice.
Simplifying the mechanism to invoke the safeguard clause in the case of Romania will enhance the credibility of the accession process and thus the credibility of the European Union itself.
On a more general note, I believe that we should be conducting this debate not in Strasbourg, but in Brussels.
Â Â  . Madam President, Bulgaria will become a Member State with many unresolved issues.
Old environmental problems, resulting from mining and nuclear waste, are still left unresolved.
Much damage is being done by construction work for new roads through protected scenic areas and by the expansion of the largest airport.
These days, poor maintenance, decay and poverty are noticeable throughout Bulgaria.
The Roma people are still lagging behind and disadvantaged.
EU funding for the benefit of projects for this group of people is divided and spent in a contentious manner.
In the minds of many Bulgarians, the nearby Greek and Roman coasts belong, in fact, to Bulgaria, just as do the greater part of the Republic of Macedonia and a few areas on the border with Serbia.
The fact that the Bulgarian electorate still has not made any steady choices is apparent from the rapid changes within the two main rivalling political parties, and, above all, from the fact that a newcomer to the most recent general elections achieved almost the majority of the votes.
Shortly after the surprising election as Prime Minister of the countryâs former King, the candidate of the Communistsâ successors was elected President.
This instability has, however, produced one positive development in the form of greater involvement in political decision-making of the Turkish minority, which was discriminated against in the past.
Unlike in Romania, the problems in Bulgaria are no bigger than those in a number of the present EU Member States.
That is why it is right to allow Bulgaria full EU membership from 2007.
There is a strong historical and linguistic bond between Bulgaria and the Slavonic-speaking part of Macedonia.
In 1878, last-minute Western European intervention prevented the two from uniting.
It would be useful if the negotiations about Macedoniaâs accession â for which the Committee on Foreign Affairs has appointed me as rapporteur â were to run parallel with Croatia, which also has its roots in former Yugoslavia, so that we can welcome the Bulgarians and Macedonians to the European Union simultaneously.
Â Â  â Â MadamÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I hope MrÂ Posselt will praise me as well shortly.
I am not overly keen on the black-and-white film presented by the European Commission entitled âRomania the bad and Bulgaria the goodâ.
Black-and-white films are not popular either in politics or in real life.
Not everything is as bad in Romania and as good in Bulgaria as would appear from the picture painted by the European Commissionâs amateur artists.
It is true that Bulgaria has made progress and that it should join the European Union on 1Â JanuaryÂ 2007.
At the same time, however, Bulgaria has not done many of the things it should have done.
I should like to refer to a number of specific points.
Firstly, what use is there in Bulgarian legislation complying with EU legislation, if implementation of this legislation continues to lag behind?
Secondly, trade in human beings, in particular in women and children, is still a serious problem.
As a third point, the adoption system and its lack of transparency, as well as the situation in Bulgarian orphanages and special schools, continue to be a cause for concern.
Fourthly, there are also concerns with regard to the situation of adults in psychiatric hospitals, and this is included in Parliamentâs motion for a resolution.
As a fifth point, the continuing lack of reform of the judicial system, which lags a long way behind European standards, is an Achillesâ heel for Sofia.
The sixth point I should like to refer to is the widespread corruption, which is a thorn in Bulgariaâs side as it enters the EU, given that it affects various areas and levels of government and is apparent at every turn.
During the past few weeks I have visited Bulgaria twice, and my remarks are by no means merely quotes from reports, but reflect what is plain for everyone to see.
The seventh point is organised crime.
The Bulgarian Government is acting like the choir in a Chinese opera, where the choir sings âletâs run away, letâs run awayâ for three acts, but stays in the same place the whole time.
The Bulgarian Government constantly repeats that it is taking measures to fight the mafia, but it would appear that it is mainly conducting a war of words.
The mafia continues to be a serious problem.
At the same time, however, the EU also sometimes takes measures that the Bulgarian public finds incomprehensible.
For example, it recently demanded that a power plant in Kozloduj be shut down, even though enormous amounts of Bulgarian taxpayersâ money had been spent on modernising it in recent years.
In conclusion, MadamÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, despite these reservations we should welcome the fact that our European family is to be joined by a nation with a history dating back over 1300Â years.
Bulgariaâs history is longer than many of the present EU Member States.
I should like to bid Bulgaria welcome to somewhere it should have been for many years.
I am sure Bulgaria will feel at home in the EU which is a Union of homelands.
Â Â  â Madam President, I should like by way of introduction to make the members of the European Parliament privy to the hostage-taking in Athens today, to the hijacking of a bus with innocent citizens on their way to work.
I mention this in order to highlight the need to formulate an efficient policy at European level on urban security.
Now to the subject in hand.
Bulgaria made noteworthy progress in converting to a pluralistic democracy and functional market economy in keeping with European instructions at both political and economic level.
The integration of Bulgaria into the European Union in 2007, in conjunction with its recent admission to ÎÎÎ€Î, is a particularly positive development both for Bulgaria itself and for south-eastern Europe as a whole.
I trust that the case of Bulgaria will also set an example for the countries of the Western Balkans as they move towards Europe.
Nonetheless, it should be pointed out that there needs to be a constant and conscious effort on the part of the Bulgarian authorities to adapt pending full integration.
Further efforts should focus on stamping out corruption and efficiently combating organised crime.
I should like at this point to call on the European Commission, within the framework of the Community policy on border regions with candidate countries, to draft a new study on the repercussions which the integration of Bulgaria and Romania will have on the border regions of the Member States.
I would remind you in this context that the European Commission itself, in the person of the competent Commissioner, MrÂ Verheugen, found that regions such as north-eastern Greece, which border on two countries, face by far the most difficult situation at European level.
The policies and actions of the European Union to promote trans-national, trans-regional and cross-border cooperation and to combat the repercussions of enlargement on development and employment in border regions should be continued and reinforced.
Similarly, special care must be taken when distributing resources and preparing programmes for territorial cooperation in the new 2007-2013 programming period.
Â Â  Madam President, it is the case that Bulgariaâs capacity to comply with the Community has increased considerably and is continuing to do so.
Nevertheless, the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy wishes to stress that in the sectors of research and development, energy, industrial policy and telecommunications policy an additional effort is required if we want the incorporation of Bulgaria to be an historic success, since the accession date is now getting very close.
Furthermore, in order correctly to assess the progress made and thereby propose the changes still to be made, we should take account not just of the report of the European Commission, but also of the assessments of the different international bodies and other independent research centres, whose opinion may be of great assistance in analysing and evaluating Bulgariaâs capacity in these areas, with a view to its incorporation into the European Union.
In any event, our current views with regard to each of the sectors which are the responsibility of our committee are as follows: with regard to energy policy, Bulgaria â as has already been said â currently depends on nuclear energy to cover its internal needs, but the reality is that its nuclear power stations are technically obsolete and the dismantling of some of them has been very expensive.
As has also been pointed out, it is now proposed to modernise units 5 and 6 of the Kozloduy power station, and additional funds will be required for this, since the European Unionâs contributions are clearly insufficient.
Funds from international donors are required, though we are not seeing the government prioritise this issue as it should do.
In the telecommunications sector, the independence of the regulatory authority should be guaranteed, and it should have the power to resolve commercial disputes and guarantee the principle of universality, in accordance with Community legislation.
It is also necessary to reformulate industrial and business policy and improve the administrative capacity to facilitate the work of small and medium-sized businesses, which are the true creators of jobs and an extraordinary source of technological innovation.
With regard to the research sector, despite Bulgariaâs participation in the Sixth Framework Programme, its presence has been very limited.
Madam President, this is essentially the content of the amendment our committee is presenting to the report we are debating.
Â Â  â Madam President, Minister, Commissioner, congratulations to the rapporteur and congratulations to Bulgaria as well.
It has closed all the chapters and is an example and an inspiration to all its neighbours.
I repeat, to all its neighbours.
It would be an even better example if it took just one more step in its relationship with its minorities and did the same for the other minorities living in Bulgaria as it has already done for the Turkish minority.
âThe Balkans, that ancient mountain rangeâ, as the Bulgarian national anthem goes, and the word âBalkansâ as a political problem does not apply in the case of Bulgaria.
Bulgaria already belongs to Western Europe and it is the Western Balkans that we will have to deal with in the future.
This is why I feel that it is important that when we are talking about Bulgaria, we should also pay some attention to Macedonia, which has already submitted its application for membership of the European Union and that the European Union itself should also take another step forward.
The USA has recognised Macedonia by the name that it chose for itself.
We still continue to use the name FYROM and it is high time we took another step forward because this would also be a great step towards the Europeanisation of this area.
In an hour and a half's time, Commissioner, you will be meeting a delegation from Serbia and Montenegro.
This is the delegation's first visit to the European Parliament and I believe that the example of Bulgaria should be used as an inspiration for all its neighbours to do more for the future prospects and stability of this part of the world.
Therefore it seems to me that we could all learn more from Bulgaria and that Bulgaria's principal neighbour could learn a lot.
I am talking about Turkey, a country we have supported today in saying âyesâ to the start of negotiations.
Bulgaria is the last country on the road to Turkey and I believe that it is right and proper that all of us who have a task to perform in this respect, should support all of these countries so that they can participate fully both economically and politically and bring about a further enlargement of the European Union.
Â Â  âMadam President, both the resolutions and opinions of the Commission and the Council giving the go-ahead for the integration of Bulgaria and Romania in future years clearly set out the objectives of European capital, which are already being realised, to annex these countries, plunder their wealth and their economy, exploit their workers to an unbelievable degree and convert them to NATO satellites, so that they can serve its aggressive policy.
The resolutions record, to a degree, certain aspects of the wretched and inhumane living conditions of the working classes in these countries and the poor grass-roots classes, but these are the result of the restoration of capitalism, which is eroding all the social rights achieved and, on the other hand, is concentrating wealth in the hands of a new plutocracy and foreign monopolies.
There are in fact two Bulgarias and two Romanias: on the one hand, the countries of luxury for the new plutocrats in Bulgaria and Romania and the foreigners who are literally plundering these countries and, on the other, the countries of two proud nations literally being dragged into misery and humiliation.
The consequences of the integration process and of the humiliating terms accepted by the governments of these countries are already visible.
You spoke to us of successes.
So listen to the successes: in Bulgaria, the minimum wage is EUR 61 and in Romania it is EUR 69, compared with EUR 1Â 173 in France and EUR 605 in Greece.
The rapid increase in imports, in conjunction with plummeting exports, has resulted in increased deficits.
Purchasing power in Romania is 60% of what it was in 1989.
Industry has been destroyed and agricultural production is operating below par.
The objective of the new direction proposed in the resolutions and the new measures is to create better conditions, an institutional framework and infrastructures for the most unaccountable action by capital, the complete selling off of public property and land and the abolition of any social rights achieved.
The workers in these countries, together with the workers in Greece and other countries in Europe, must fight against the policy of the European Union and, more importantly, against the new tensions expected in the area as a result of the serious rivalry which is beginning to manifest itself.
Â Â  Madam President, this debate is, actually, a token of congratulation to Bulgaria, although it goes without saying that it still has many problems, and much remains to be dealt with.
A great deal, of course, still needs to be done in the field of human rights and human trafficking, but they are doing their level best, which was not evident before.
It is for that reason that I believe that Bulgaria should be able to join the European Union in 2007.
They belong among us.
I would also like to see more attention given to a debate about Bulgariaâs accession than to one about Turkeyâs.
After all, Bulgaria is a truly European country, straddling the old and new Europe, and deserves all our attention.
I can foresee some problems with regard to its accession.
While there are, of course, problems in Bulgaria itself, the biggest may well be in the European Union.
The fact is that funding for its accession is not yet completely in place.
After 2007, we will be talking about the financial perspective up to 2013, and I am surprised at the discussion that is being held in the Council and elsewhere, in which it is stated that we might be able to manage on 1% of the gross domestic product.
If you look at all the forecasts that have been made, funding for Bulgariaâs accession is nowhere to be found.
I should also like to address a critical comment to the Commission, which was right in saying that it needs more money than 1%.
If, however, we look at the proposals for agriculture, for example, we notice that those do not include a budget for agriculture in Bulgaria, while the development of the countryside in Bulgaria will play a key role in the development of that country itself.
Anyone who loves the countryside, loves the country itself and actually does something for the future of that country.
I am therefore interested to hear how the Council intends to fund this accession and how we can ensure in a correct and proper manner that Bulgaria becomes a truly European country in 2007.
I should like to finish off with another point.
In the responses by the Confederal Group of the United Left/Nordic Green Left â which does, after all, comprise quite a few former Communists â I was struck by the fact that people have some difficulty with the major political changes in Bulgaria.
To those people, I have this to say. The Bulgarians have a better grasp of politics than your group, and do you know why?
They judge politicians by their actions, which may lead to major shifts.
I am pleased to see that the Bulgarians, in terms of democratic thinking, are further advanced than many Members from the GUE/NGL Group.
Â Â  â Madam President, I should like, now that accession negotiations have been concluded with Bulgaria, for us to start by highlighting and welcoming the huge efforts made by the Bulgarian people and the political forces in the country to push ahead with changes and reforms and incorporate the .
The accession of Bulgaria and Romania will close the circle of enlargement opened with the ten new countries.
It is a development of strategic importance which unites the Balkans and Europe and will contribute to peace, stability, cooperation and development in the area as a whole.
However, I should like to underline a number of crucial points both to the Commission and to the Presidency.
During the next stage, Bulgaria will need to step up its efforts to apply the in four sectors which are of particular importance to the European Union and to Greece:
The first is the sector of environmental protection, nuclear safety, nuclear waste management and the quality of river water.
Reactors 3 and 4 at the Kozloduy nuclear power station must close in 2006, in accordance with the commitment given by the Bulgarian authorities, and modernisation of nuclear installations with Community financing from the PHARE programme and from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development must continue normally.
In the sector of labour relations and labour law, additional reforms are needed for Bulgaria to approach European standards and overturn social exclusion practices which affect Community â and especially Greek â undertakings in border regions, where there is a serious problem with relocations.
Furthermore, deficits are recorded in the three sectors of combating organised crime, trafficking in human beings and controlling external borders and combating illegal immigration.
Finally, I should like to draw particular attention to the fact that more efficient procedures and greater transparency in the sector of public procurement and public works are needed, as is the safeguarding of equal treatment of all Community undertakings, including Greek undertakings.
The European Commission must use the mechanisms provided for, with annual evaluation reports and safeguarding clauses, to monitor closely the efficient application of the and safeguard Community interests, even after the accession of Bulgaria on 1 January 2007.
Â Â  . Madam President, I appreciate the positive remarks from Members of Parliament with regard to the accession of Bulgaria.
Mr Posselt, MrÂ Maat, Mrs Dobolyi and others were clear on that issue.
Members said that there are still a lot of concerns.
That is true.
That is precisely the reason why we have the framework, the procedure, with extra monitoring and an extra benchmark and, if necessary, an extra sanction, an extra safeguard for an extra year before the moment of accession.
With regard to the financial issue raised by Mr Maat and others, I do not think we need to be concerned.
The financial consequences of accession are already covered in the so-called financial package for the years 2007-09. That is irrespective of the new financial perspective.
An important issue that was raised again today is the importance of having an individual approach to different countries.
You know the formal position â one treaty for Romania and Bulgaria.
It is important, and necessary, to differentiate.
That is precisely what we want to do in the wording of the conclusions next Thursday or Friday in the Council, concentrating on the different chapters.
If necessary we can differentiate at the moment of actual accession, because there is the possibility of postponing accession for a maximum of one year.
I thank the rapporteur, Mr Van Orden, for his adequate and balanced report.
I really welcome its conclusions.
Â Â  . Madam President, I promise to speak slowly and unhurriedly.
I wish to say thank you for the pertinent debate and those points of view expressed which, in the main, support the Commissionâs recommendations.
I will respond to just a couple of the most central issues.
I will speak first about the coupling of Romania and Bulgaria.
It is true that a joint Accession Treaty is being drafted for these countries.
On the other hand, as MrÂ NicolaÃ¯ very clearly explained, each is being treated according to a differentiated approach, especially now the process is in its last stages and the monitoring system and safeguard clause are ways of ensuring that each country is assessed according to the extent to which they are able to implement the reforms and commitments that need to be fulfilled before these countries can accede to the Union.
I would also like to emphasise that Bulgaria is not yet ready for membership either: much work is being asked of it, but, at the same time, Bulgaria has all the potential to fulfil its commitments to enable it to accede to the Union on 1 January 2007.
I will speak next about corruption, which has attracted much attention in speeches.
That is quite right and I agree with those views expressed.
Bulgaria has recently drawn up a determined strategy to act against corruption.
It is particularly concerned with improving border controls, developing the work of the traffic police and the institutions in general, and countering corruption in Bulgariaâs administration.
This is in fact the main focus of Sub-Programme 4 under the PHARE programme and it will also become much more obviously the main focus over the coming two years, in 2005 and 2006.
Thirdly and finally, I wish to talk about the status of minorities, and especially that of the Roma.
In Bulgaria, new legislation against discrimination has recently been passed and has entered into force there. It took effect in January of this year and it is presently being implemented in conjunction with an anti-discriminatory action programme to improve the status of minorities.
We are very closely monitoring this new legislation and the implementation of the action programme to support it.
I am also pleased that other European organisations, such as the Council of Europe, in the building next to ours, is giving attention to this issue and working to strengthen the status of the Roma.
We would all certainly have been present at the opening ceremony of the Council of Europeâs Roma Forum at 12 noon today, but at the same time we were debating, and you were voting on, the very important report on Turkey, so, unfortunately, we could not get there.
I wish to thank the European Parliament for its support and counsel, and I congratulate the rapporteur, MrÂ Van Orden, and Bulgaria, which hopefully will become an example to the entire Balkan region.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0061/2004) by MrÂ Moscovici, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on Romaniaâs progress towards accession [2004/2184(INI)].
I should like to invite MrÂ Moscovici to take the floor, and to inform him that he may speak for five minutes.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, the political context in which I am tabling this report has become clearer in recent weeks.
Last week the Commission was able to close accession negotiations with Romania on the last two chapters, namely justice and home affairs, and competition.
Moreover, legislative elections and then presidential elections have also been held in recent weeks, putting a different political party in power under conditions that have been recognised by all of the parties.
This information obviously does not change the philosophy and general thrust of the report.
I wanted to draft and submit a balanced report to the House, that is to say a report that was both rigorous and clear, because Romaniaâs situation poses many problems. Yet I also wanted it to be a friendly report, because we all want Romania and Bulgaria to join and because this country has worked hard to prepare for accession.
On this basis, we are proposing that we both take note of Romaniaâs progress towards accession and also remain aware of its limits and shortcomings, and the extent of the work that remains to be done. These two aspects, the limits and the progress, are actually set out for each of the areas in question.
They are presented first with regard to the political criteria, and it is there without any doubt that the main difficulties lie.
There are limits to the progress made; for example, the reform of the civil service does not go far enough, the use of emergency ordinances is not desirable and quite excessive, and as for legislative procedures, everyone knows that they are not perfect.
But over and above this limited progress, a number of problems, serious problems, remain as far as freedoms are concerned.
I am thinking firstly of the freedom of information and expression, which is denied to a great many journalists.
I am thinking of the judicial system, which despite initial improvements is unquestionably in need of further attention.
I am thinking, of course, of corruption, which is still endemic in Romania, even at high levels.
On all of these problems â freedom of expression, corruption, the judicial and police systems â I believe that the European Parliament has a duty to be absolutely uncompromising.
At the same time, we cannot ignore the fact that progress has undoubtedly been made.
The Commission has recognised that Romania satisfies the Copenhagen political criteria; the country has embarked on public administration reform, and constitutional reform is also underway.
The judicial system, as I have said, is starting to improve and we are also seeing progress on child protection â requested by our own Parliament, incidentally â even though it is possible to go further.
Overall then, I believe that Romania has listened to the recommendations made by the Commission and Parliament, in particular those that were made at the instigation of the previous rapporteur, MrsÂ Nicholson.
We find the same problem with the economic criteria: there are limits to the progress made, macroeconomic stability is not yet guaranteed and poverty remains at quite excessive levels.
At the same time, we have seen progress in the fight against social exclusion, in the fight against poverty and in the adoption of legislation on social protection.
The third and final area is everything to do with the .
As I said at the outset, negotiations on this are complete.
Moreover, I do not believe that it would be wise to reopen them, although I have read that the newly-elected president intends to do so.
For my part, I think that the treaty should first be ratified and signed before it is renegotiated.
We need, however, to implement the legislation that has been adopted, in particular that relating to the free movement of goods and capital, financial control, the environment, industrial production, regional policy and issues of justice and home affairs.
This assessment, which I hope is balanced, is the basis for the conclusions that I am recommending, and they are as follows: as things stand there is nothing to prevent a joint accession treaty â I repeat, a joint treaty â being signed for Romania and Bulgaria at the beginning of 2005 for accession in 2007.
Clearly this is a political decision, but Parliament and the Commission need to keep a close watch on developments through all of the follow-up actions and other reports that we can table here.
A final word on the amendments tabled: we did a good job, in my opinion, in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, which enabled the report to be adopted by a very large majority.
The remaining amendments to the report fall into two categories.
There are those that improve the substance of the report, in particular on social protection, human rights, the disabled, the protection of children and young people, and recommendations on industrial policy, and I am obviously in favour of these.
Then there are other amendments that call into question the existence of a joint accession treaty or which change the nature and balance of the report, which clearly I do not support.
This morning we made the historic decision to open negotiations with Turkey.
I believe that concluding them with Romania and Bulgaria, and with Romania in particular, is, in contrast, a logical decision, and people would not understand if we did not do both of these things together.
Â Â  . Mr President, it is a great pleasure for me to be able to inform you here formally that on 14 December 2004 the General Affairs Council also closed the negotiations with Romania.
As I said when referring to Bulgaria, it is a new step towards a really reunited Europe based on mutually accepted principles of democracy and the rule of law.
I will elaborate briefly on the process of closing the last challenging chapters with Romania and focus on the monitoring system developed to ensure a proper start for Romania within the European Union.
The two remaining chapters, which have been regarded as the most difficult ones â competition policy, and justice and home affairs â were technically closed by the General Affairs Council on 14 December 2004.
I believe we have been able to find appropriate solutions for all the issues raised in those final weeks through close and constructive cooperation between the Commission and the Council.
However, closing these two chapters means that the real work continues for the Romanians.
Over the next two years Romania will have to make real and sustained efforts in order to be truly ready for membership.
Good intentions are not enough: these must be matched by progress on the ground, in particular in the implementation of commitments.
The EU will of course continue to support the preparations at all levels: the Commission will enhance the monitoring of progress commitments undertaken in all areas of the .
We learned from representatives of both governments that monitoring systems helped them very much in continuing, and even intensifying, the reforms needed.
On competition policy, this chapter is at the core of the internal market and European economic integration.
The proper enforcement of EU competition rules is a precondition for creating a reliable business environment and requires appropriate administrative capacity.
This is a long-term process.
It is for those reasons that competition discipline is also a key aspect of the Europe agreement.
Other key aspects are legislative alignment and the institutional and administrative structures in Romania.
What needs to be done to bring all legislation, including secondary legislation, into line with the requirements in the areas of antitrust and State aid, in particular in relation to fiscal aid?
The Romanian Competition Council should be given the powers, resources and the well-trained staff it needs to fulfil its role.
This Council should prohibit any measures which would be in contradiction with the State aid and the Europe agreement.
Let me turn to the steel sector, which is a sensitive sector across the EU.
Romania has asked for a prolongation of the so-called 'grace period' under the Europe agreement for restructuring the steel industry.
Again, we only agreed to this now it is clear that Romania will abide by all the commitments and all the conditions set out in the EU's position.
These commitments include drawing up a national restructuring programme as well as an individual business plan, capacity reduction and dismantling of the installations.
The European Union expects Romania to respect all its commitments and take all the necessary measures within the deadlines laid down in the EU's position.
In this context, I should recall the safeguards we have at our disposal.
In October 2005 the Commission will present to the Council a written report assessing Romania's progress in the area of competition policy.
Any serious shortcomings observed in this report regarding Romania's obligations under the Europe agreement and/or the fulfilment of the commitments can form the basis for a recommendation by the Commission to invoke safeguards, in particular the one postponing Romania's accession by one year.
Here the Council can decide by a qualified majority.
On this understanding, I have come to the conclusion that this chapter does not require further negotiations.
Let me say that it is now in Romania's hands to ensure that it meets all its commitments in this chapter, allowing Romania's smooth integration into the European Union.
Turning to justice and home affairs, this is a chapter which is both extensive and complex.
It is at the heart of our objective of maintaining and developing the European Union as an area of freedom, security and justice.
It has a direct bearing on the lives of every EU citizen, and is therefore a key part of the which must be respected.
Negotiations on this chapter have been long and detailed.
Romania has made a considerable number of firm commitments on all areas of the justice and home affairs .
There are several areas to which particular attention should be paid, such as implementation of the Schengen action plan; ensuring a high level of control and surveillance at the external borders of the Union; implementing the reform of the judiciary; stepping up the fight against corruption to ensure that corruption cases are dealt with in a swift and transparent manner; making considerable progress in filling the large number of vacancies in the police forces; as well as developing and implementing a coherent multiannual anti-crime strategy.
These issues have also been addressed in Mr Moscovici's report on Romania.
The Union will closely monitor Romania's implementation of all its commitments related to justice and home affairs, right up to the moment of accession in order to meet EU standards.
This includes adhering to the planned legislative schedule and taking further measures to develop the institutional and administrative capacity of all Romanian law enforcement authorities and of the judiciary.
We believe that this should be possible if the necessary political effort, as well as the required financial and human resources, are deployed to this end.
If, however, any serious shortcomings are observed in the fulfilment by Romania of its commitments and in particular any of the specific commitments listed in the EU position, this can form the basis for invoking the safeguard clause postponing Romania's accession by one year.
Here again, the Council can decide by qualified majority.
The European Union will continue to monitor closely Romania's preparations and achievements, including the effective implementation of the commitments undertaken in all areas of the and in particular the areas of justice and home affairs, competition and the environment.
To this end, the Commission will continue to submit annual reports on Romania's progress towards accession, together with recommendations if appropriate.
I welcome the statement in the report by Mr Moscovici that the European Parliament will monitor the developments in Romania as well and encourage the new Romanian Government to fulfil all the commitments made during the negotiations.
It is quite clear that the report adopted by the European Parliament in March 2004 has fulfilled its purpose as a wake-up call to the Romanian Government.
That is how the Romanian Government has perceived it; and it has convinced it to intensify the accession strategy and policies.
I was delighted to learn that Parliament, in its latest report about Romania, could subscribe to the recommendations of the regular report of the Commission.
Since then â and I paraphrase the wording of the Commission â we all have made every effort to meet the European Council objectives to bring the negotiations with Bulgaria and Romania to a successful conclusion in 2004, on the basis of its own merits, with a view to signing the Accession Treaty as early as possible in 2005, and we all expect Bulgaria and Romania to fulfil the economic and criteria and to be ready for membership on 1 January 2007.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like first of all to thank MrÂ Moscovici for tabling a report that is both balanced and in-depth.
The Commission has always warmly welcomed the European Parliamentâs constructive engagement in the process of Romaniaâs accession to the European Union.
I should also like to thank the Council for its productive cooperation.
Mr President, your report of March 2004 was a real 'wake-up call' for Romania.
Being tough and very demanding, it finally helped to bring about further progress in the accession negotiations.
It led, with the Commission's impetus, to a series of reforms, which were listed in Romaniaâs famous 'To Do List', under which the Romanian authorities put greater emphasis on improving political and economic governance.
As Mr NicolaÃ¯ said, the Union will now finalise the accession negotiations with Romania on Friday.
However, I underline that concluding the negotiations does not mean the end of the work.
On the contrary, the two-year period to 2007 must be used by Romania to become a full-fledged Member State: plenty of hard work, commitment and especially delivery is needed.
We will carry out an enhanced monitoring of compliance with the commitments entered into and of ongoing preparations in general.
For Romania and Bulgaria, we have agreed a new safeguard clause covering the period between closure of the negotiations and actual accession.
This clause provides for the postponement of accession by one year if there is clear evidence that Romania will be manifestly unprepared to meet the requirements of membership.
The Member States could then activate the suspension clause by unanimity, on the basis of the Commissionâs recommendation.
Let me also point out that in the chapter concerning competition and state aids, the Commission was not able to propose a provisional closure of negotiations.
However, the Council, due to earlier political commitments, chose to close the negotiations by the end of 2004.
Moreover, in regard to justice and home affairs, the Council asked for more reassuring enforcement mechanisms.
Therefore, in close cooperation with the Netherlands presidency, the Commission worked out a proposal for a reinforced monitoring mechanism linked to safeguard clauses in these two areas: justice and home affairs, and competition and state aids.
In these areas, the suspension clause can be activated by a qualified majority of the Member States, which gives it stronger credibility than if it were only activated by unanimity.
I would like to emphasise here that I fully endorse the provisions of this clause.
Should the monitoring by the Commission show that Romania is not properly prepared for membership, we should not hesitate to recommend that the Council invoke this suspension clause.
To be absolutely clear: the aim of this clause is not to penalise Romania, but to protect Romania and the EU Member States from any negative effects that Romaniaâs possible manifest unpreparedness for membership might entail.
Before closing, let me briefly touch upon the political situation in Romania.
I know that Parliament is concerned about alleged irregularities in the parliamentary and presidential elections that recently took place in Romania.
I am also aware of the assessments made by several Romanian NGOs.
However, I would like to recall that the OSCE election assessment team stated that overall the administration of the Romanian elections 'seemed professional and efficiently organised'.
I also note that the OSCE has assessed the overall conduct of the election as satisfactory in the second round.
Moreover, both presidential candidates accepted the final results of the presidential elections.
I trust â and this is important for the European Union as well as for Romania â that the new president-elect and the forthcoming government in formation will be determined to continue with the reforms that are needed for Romania to accede to the European Union.
That is very much in the interest of Romania and Romanians.
Let me conclude by saying that I endorse the conclusions of the report by your rapporteur, MrÂ Moscovici, which are, in general, in line with the 2004 Regular Report.
The Commission will continue to keep Parliament informed of Romaniaâs progress towards accession.
Â Â  . Mr President, the Committee on Budgets would like to point out that the financial pre-accession aid granted to Romania in 2004 has amounted to EUR 825 million, which comes from the national PHARE programme and the SAPARD and ISPA instruments.
I would also like to point out that the total volume of this aid is approximately equivalent to 1.4% of the countryâs GDP.
As in the case of Bulgaria, the Committee on Budgets is pleased about the establishment in spring 2004 of the new funding framework for the accession of Romania. It is also pleased that, as for Bulgaria, the Commission has proposed restricting this package of aid to a period of three years in order that it may be adapted to the future political needs stemming from the new financial perspectives that are going to be approved.
All of the financial aid will depend on these new financial perspectives, but from 2009.
Unlike what happened in the case of the report on Bulgaria, in this case the Committee on Budgets wishes to stress the need to make sustained efforts to enhance Romaniaâs administrative capacity with regard to the essential fields of customs, VAT and statistics on gross domestic product. This means having appropriate capacity to collect and control VAT and customs duties, and to calculate gross domestic product credibly, precisely and exhaustively, in accordance with the SEC 95 rules.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Moscovici, on the excellent work he has done on this report on Romania.
I would also like to thank him for his open attitude and his spirit of compromise.
Mr President, in the last two years, Romania has made very significant progress on its journey towards integration with the European Union.
I naturally welcome this progress.
A decisive step has been the conclusion of the negotiations at the accession conference held yesterday.
The closure of these negotiations is expected to be confirmed at the European Council this week, but it is clear that the work is not over.
In fact, Romania has important work to do before the accession scheduled for 2007 can take place.
I am not only talking about the procedures necessary for full ratification of the Treaty; it must also intensify its efforts in a series of essential areas.
To this end, it must carry out the reforms in the field of public administration, it must improve judicial administration and ensure that it is independent â a field in which it adopted an important legislative package a few months ago; it must enhance the fight against corruption, a serious problem which continues to affect the country.
And efforts are also needed in the field of preserving the environment.
In short, the report which will be presented to plenary tomorrow specifies in detail many areas in which the Romanian authorities must continue to make efforts.
Mr President, my position and the report essentially consists of the following: on the one hand, an open and positive view of Romaniaâs accession to the European Union within the scheduled timescale. On the other hand, a demanding position in relation to the efforts Romania must make, which will require determination and perseverance.
I believe that this is the clear twin message that the Romanian authorities now in office following the elections of recent days must receive.
Through this report, the European Parliament is saying yes to the integration of Romania, but it will be monitoring that countryâs compliance with all of its commitments.
This Parliament must follow the efforts the Romanian authorities must make very closely.
We are also counting on the information that the Commission must send out regularly to us in this regard, as the Commissioner has pointed out.
Finally, on this journey Romania still has to make towards accession, it can count on our vigilance, but, of course, it can also count on our assistance and our impetus.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like first of all to congratulate the rapporteur on a very good and well balanced report.
The report mentions both the positive and the negative aspects, the strong points and the weak points, which Romania will have to address.
On the positive side, the report clearly states that Romania meets the Copenhagen political criteria, that it has strengthened the stability of its institutions that guarantee State democracy and human rights, and that the situation has improved in the field of protection of human and ethnic rights, with regard to both the Hungarian minority and the Roma minority.
On the positive side, Romania also fulfils the criterion of a functioning market economy and, moreover, has implemented and is continuing to implement a programme of structural reforms.
If we look at the economic results, the economic statistics for Romania, we can see that the country has one of the strongest growth rates in the whole of Eastern Europe.
Naturally, Romania still has to make considerable efforts and make significant progress, however, before it can be accepted into the European Union.
Both Mr NicolaÃ¯ and Mr Rehn have referred to certain aspects in detail.
I should like to mention a few of them: the areas of justice and internal affairs, like everywhere in Eastern Europe, the fight against corruption and against organised crime, and also border controls.
Problems also remain in the fields of economic competition, of state support and, of course, of protecting the natural environment.
In spite of everything, however, I believe that Romania is well on the way.
It is up to Romania and Romania alone as to whether it will manage to eliminate all the weak points in the coming months.
If it does succeed, I am of the opinion that the treaty should be signed in 2005 so that Romania, along with Bulgaria, can be accepted into the European Union in 2007.
Â Â  . Mr President, it has been a pleasure to work with Mr Moscovici on this fine report.
Indeed I enjoyed and valued his work in his earlier capacity as a minister.
It is just as much of a pleasure to work with him as a rapporteur.
I thank Mr Moscovici for this fine work.
I believe that President Iliescu â as he retires from his second and final term of office â and his government, as well as Prime Minister Nastase, have concluded their work on a high note.
They should be proud of their successful achievement of the enlargement process for Romania.
It is easy today to damn Romania with faint praise, to say that she has done well but has a huge amount more to do.
That may indeed be true, but let us recall the low position from which she has come and has advanced so rapidly.
None of us would have dreamed five years ago, when the Helsinki Council declared Romania to be one of the 'regatta principle' countries, that she could have completed the chapters so rapidly and indeed so well.
All the chapters are closed.
Of course, implementation must be high on the agenda of the new government and it will have to have very competent people to implement this matter.
They have to apply the properly and respect the deadlines.
A great deal of capacity-building has to happen.
Administrative capacity is vital in applying the as well as ongoing training of staff.
However, let us remember what an enormous amount has been achieved.
One of the ways in which we could help is by trying to stop the brain drain.
Romania needs its young people very badly.
We should do all we can to strengthen the position of higher education in Romania, to help the country offer jobs, training and workshops to young people.
It would be very easy, as Romania comes ever closer to the Union, for us to be a magnet for her young people to leave the country.
That would be a very great pity.
It is those young people who will assist Romania in implementing the correctly and improving the absorption capacity for the funding that the Commission is putting in.
I congratulate the Commission too for the very dedicated work which colleagues and I have seen carried out over the last few years.
I have put forward one amendment, at which I would ask Mr Moscovici and other colleagues to look carefully.
They have acknowledged that I have been concentrating in particular on the issue of children.
While I understood and respected Mr Moscovici's support for Prime Minister Raffarin's request for an international commission to re-examine certain sensitive cases on humanitarian grounds where there have been problems with inter-country adoption, nonetheless, I wonder if colleagues might consider accepting my amendment to paragraph 17.
Mr Moscovici's report requests an international commission. That is one outside the European Union.
My own amendment asks the Commission to take up this matter with the Romanian Government â which is right and proper â and also to report back to the government of Romania and â since I know that colleagues are concerned about this â to the European Parliament as well.
Perhaps Mr Moscovici and I could discuss this.
I am sure he would find that it is more in keeping with the spirit of the Treaty.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let it be clear that this is not a debate between those in favour of Romaniaâs accession to the European Union and those who oppose it.
My group does not have any fundamental objections to Romaniaâs membership either, not even on 1 January 2007.
This is a debate, however, between those who think that, except for a few loose ends, Romania is ready, and those, myself included, who think that it is not, and see that as a reason why we cannot give the go-ahead right now.
I am, in all honesty, surprised at the position of some groups.
The very same Members of this House who rightly attached great importance to human rights during the vote and discussions about Turkey, a country that is on the very threshold of negotiations, are, in the case of Romania, a country that is completing them, prepared to overlook just about anything where the same Copenhagen criteria are concerned.
There are yet other Members in this House whose view of reality has, quite honestly, been somewhat clouded by the fact that members of their parties are probably involved in reprehensible affairs, or because they hope that, after the recent elections in Romania, everything will be very different overnight.
Hope for improvement is fine, but we should not be naive.
The problems in Romania are immense, so much so that there is no doubt in my mind that we cannot give them the green light.
I will give you two examples.
Over the past few years, there has been no improvement in the situation of journalists and the media in Romania; indeed, it has changed for the worse.
The number of attacks on critical journalists has increased and the criticism levelled at them was often connected to cases of corruption.
All NGOs, all the organisations that we always praise so highly â Transparency International, the Open Society Institute, the OECD â all have one message: corruption is still rife in Romania and should not be underestimated.
Of course, everyone here will state that corruption is to be combated, but how seriously can we take a party which has a majority in the Romanian parliament and a member of which â also a former minister â had to step down a few years ago on account of corruption, and is now vice-chairman of that same party and a candidate for the senate?
In my view, this, together with Amnesty Internationalâs reports about the truly abominable treatment of psychiatric patients, can only lead to one conclusion, namely that Romania should wait for a little longer.
That is why I should like to ask the Commission why it should not draft a separate report next spring, for example, on the aspects which everyone, including the rapporteur, worry about, namely freedom of the press, corruption, independence of the judiciary?
The Commission does compile a report on possible problems concerning competition, but refuses to devote a fresh report to human rights problems.
Why should state support be a stumbling block and human rights not?
To those who say â and that is also a comment with regard to the Commission and the presidency â that we still have the suspension clause at our disposal, which enables us to delay Romaniaâs accession by one year, I should like to state clearly that this suspension clause can only be invoked if there is a unanimous vote in favour of it.
In other words, if one country in the Council refuses to cooperate, then it will not happen.
What about qualified majority?
Regrettably, that can only be applied to a number of specific areas, and freedom of the press is not one of them.
In my view, Parliament should not relinquish its power by giving the go-ahead now and, logically, doing the same thing in March.
Parliament must take itself seriously.
I would like to quote from a major Dutch newspaper: 'With friendliness that lacks honesty, Europe may become big, but it is growth without substance, greatness without inner strengthâ.
The strength of the European Union is to be found in principles that apply universally, including to political allies.
Â Â  . Mr President, Romania has a long tradition of authoritarian and undemocratic government, Left-wing and Right-wing alternately.
This tradition goes hand in hand with an intolerant attitude towards its ethnic minorities â Hungarians, Roma and Germans.
A great deal of attention is always paid to major dam projects, enormous factories and monumental buildings, but not to vagrant children menaced by glue sniffing or prostitution, or to serious environmental pollution.
In Rosia Montana, there is still the risk of a gold extraction project going ahead, which will use chemical substances capable of seriously polluting the soil and river water in the long term.
In the cities, the monumental facades hide decay, neglect and poverty.
Freedom of the press and independence of the judiciary do not meet European standards.
In neighbouring Moldavia, which came under Russian rule in 1940, there was initial support for reunification, but, as Romania has little to offer at the moment, that support has now ebbed away.
At present, many Romanians look up to America and the dollar above all, and, to a lesser extent, to Turkey, which is regarded as a major economic partner and an example of a self-assured country.
At international level, Romania is currently, like Turkey, a close ally of the United States, so much so that it is hindering cooperation with the International Criminal Court in The Hague.
Complaints about election fraud were lodged again recently.
I do not expect the careless interpretation of parliamentary democracy to disappear following last weekendâs election of a president from the other side of the political spectrum, who is also likely to determine the composition of a new government.
This new government will probably take the view that the previous government was too meek in its negotiations with the European Union and that it had allowed itself to be humiliated.
In its previous composition, this parliament was extremely critical about the possibility of Romania fulfilling in the short term the current EU criteria in terms of democracy, human rights and the environment.
That is why it seemed certain that Romania would be joining later than Bulgaria, together with Croatia at the very earliest.
I am surprised at the recent U-turn within the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the rejection of a number of critical amendments.
The fear that Romania might be humiliated and the EUâs ambition for speedy territorial expansion now appear more imperative than solving problems.
The Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic GreenÂ Left would like to welcome Romania to the European Union as quickly as possible, provided that, as is the case with Turkey, solutions have been found to the problems in the areas of democracy, human rights and the environment, and this is still a huge obstacle at the moment.
Â Â  . Mr President, as a former shipâs captain, the newly-elected President of Romania, Traian Basescu, knows a thing or two about choppy waters, which gives him a considerable edge, for the ship of state of his native country, where he will be taking the helm, is currently facing rough seas.
Moreover, Basescu will be the first to admit this frankly.
In an interview with the of 26 November, Basescu, who is at present the mayor of Bucharest, gave this explanation of why he is striving to turn his country round politically: âThe problem is corruption which, in this country, has been elevated to a form of governmentâ.
The report by Mr Moscovici is just as clear about Bucharestâs failings as it makes its way to Brussels, and we sincerely appreciate the way in which he has done this, quite rightly tracing Romaniaâs shortcomings in terms of all the accession criteria, including the political conditions.
In the discussion of previous reports of this House about Romania as a candidate country, I asked for attention to be paid to violations of the freedom of the press.
Unfortunately, this report mentions these violations again in Paragraph 8.
It is as plain as day that there is physical aggression against investigative journalists, and that the government exerts pressure on financially weak media.
In his recent book âThreatened journalists, beaten journalistsâ, the author and journalist Malin Bot confirmed this depressing image.
The book is an outright indictment of the prevailing press restraint in Romania.
Mr Basescu and his political sympathisers therefore have their work cut out.
Incidentally, in our regions, in Western Europe, we should take note of what Malin Bot has to say about the dubious role of Western publishers who have bought up many Romanian papers, and who, in his words, âdo not come to Romania to defend democracy, but simply to make moneyâ.
I hope that a new Romanian Government takes the European accession criteria entirely seriously from the word go.
In the final analysis, it is not fair to blame them for the commitments that have not been complied with by the Nastase government.
This list is long and weighty.
Moreover, time goes on; it is fortunate, with the desired accession date of 1 January 2007 in mind, that the incoming President Basescu realises this all too well.
That is why he deserves all our attention and support in this undoubtedly difficult period.
This House expects the Commission to strictly enforce the security mechanism agreed upon with Bucharest.
To finish off, I should like to draw Bucharestâs attention to one paragraph in the Moscovici report: âcalls on it to speed up the restitution of property and adopt legislation on the restitution of churchesâ.
At the same time, I would ask the Council and Commission to closely monitor the implementation of this long drawn-out issue.
The Dutch Presidency has already made a pledge to that effect to its own parliament.
In a fine review in a German quality newspaper yesterday, I read a razor-sharp satire on the political degeneration of Romania under post-Communist rule.
The author aptly parodied the title of Prime Minister Nastaseâs campaign document entitled: âFrom Karl Marx to Coca-Colaâ, claiming that a document entitled âFrom Karl Marx to Al Caponeâ would be just as truthful.
We very much hope that Romania, under President Basescu, will break this persistent political spell.
The surprising outcome of the second round of the presidential elections appears to be an encouraging sign of this.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the New Italian Socialist Party wishes the incoming President Basescu all the best in his work.
The countless young Romanians who have supported him over recent months and are jubilantly filling the squares and streets of Bucharest and the rest of the country are, regardless of their political affiliations, pinning on him their hopes for change and for a different, new and better future.
Mr Basescu has a difficult and yet rather exciting task ahead of him: to steer his country on the new courses of modernisation, anti-corruption measures and full compliance with human and civil rights, as well as the permanent adoption of democratic structures.
We hope â or rather, we are sure â that the end of that journey can only be the total integration of Romania into the political and socioeconomic bloc of the European Union.
While we note with satisfaction the goals that have been achieved, our task over the remaining two years will be to ensure that concrete, real and significant improvements are made in the many areas that still fall short of European standards.
I refer in particular to the qualitative leap that is urgently needed in the field of human rights, especially with regard to the requests of the Roma minority, which often suffers discrimination with the acquiescence of government authorities.
The Roma make up 2.5 million citizens who live on the edges of society in totally unacceptable conditions.
I also refer to the requests and aspirations of the Hungarian minority, which consists of 1.5 million people; the treatment of the disabled; the shameful condition of the health infrastructure, especially those facilities housing patients with mental problems; the violent methods and actual physical abuse practised by the forces of law and order; a judicial system that fails to meet the criteria of efficiency and independence; as well as media that are still not entirely free.
On visiting the country, I was struck and disturbed by the many â too many â children wandering the streets alone.
We must demand a concrete commitment from the government on this issue.
It is a legal and moral obligation, not an option.
Everything possible has to be done, then, to ensure that every child in Romania, as in Europe and the rest of the world, has the right to a peaceful, happy childhood and the right to smile with hope for the future.
Â Â  Mr President, I have been a Romania-watcher for five years now, ever since I took up the case of a London constituent of mine, Prince Carol Mircea.
He demonstrated clearly to me that the Romanian Government, through its Prosecutor General, had repeatedly intervened on one side â allegedly under instructions from President Iliescu â of the civil case against Carol's half brother, ex-King Michael of Romania.
I was therefore particularly delighted at seeing the independence of the Romanian justice system.
Not only has Romania now abolished the Soviet-era right for the state to intervene in civil cases, but recently, when the previous government tried to circumvent the royal palace's property claim dispute by a bill of compensation in the Parliament, the Senate threw it out, citing the fact that it was before the Supreme Court.
So, things are improving in terms of the independence of Romania's justice system.
Clearly, Mr Basescu's victory in the presidential elections shows that Romania is also moving rapidly forward in reform terms.
The surprise result definitely scotched all the allegations that the election would be stolen by cheating by the authorities.
Romania is far from perfect and the fight against corruption and organised crime will be priority number one for the new government.
More work needs to be done on minority rights, including the large Roma population and the Hungarian population.
Also let me make a plea against a rigid imposition of the moratorium against foreign child adoptions, as many families from countries as diverse as Italy and Israel have developed bonds with children in orphanages.
It would be cruel and inhumane to terminate the process arbitrarily at this late stage.
I welcome the Romanian Government's decision to establish an international committee to resolve this delicate issue.
As Vice-President of the Ukraine Delegation, I believe that outstanding disputes such as the issue of territorial claims by Romania over tiny Snake Island in the Black Sea, which is currently under Ukrainian control, need to be resolved before 2007.
Here, the ownership of the exclusive economic interest zone is essential, as oil is believed to be present.
Good relations with Ukraine, which is now establishing itself as a fully-fledged European democracy, are important for the future.
Another issue is the border area of the Danube Delta, where there are concerns that a Ukrainian-built navigable channel is upsetting the surrounding wetlands and hence also the unique local habitat for rare bird species.
More distant is the whole issue of cooperating with and stabilising Moldova and the Transnistria question that goes with it.
Interestingly, if MrÂ Yuschenko comes to power in Kiev on 26 December, the days for the Tiraspol regime of Transnistria are numbered, hence the Russians' desire to deny MrÂ Yuschenko victory.
Has anybody investigated whether the Tiraspol regime may also have had a role to play in the poisoning of Mr Yuschenko?
I believe Romania will be ready to join the European Union by 1 January 2007 with Bulgaria.
I welcome both as EU Member States, although I do not see the two as chronologically coupled automatically.
Lastly, of course, there are the safeguard clauses which allow date slippage if Romania falls short of its requirements under the ; but nevertheless I fully support the Moscovici report and look forward to Romania joining us in the 25 Member States by 2007.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate MrÂ Moscovici on his very objective and well-balanced report.
I fully agree with MrÂ Rehn and MrÂ NicolaÃ¯, who I feel have expressed very objective opinions.
Romaniaâs accession is beneficial to Hungary for two reasons; on the one hand, good neighbourliness, and on the other, the issue of the minority Hungarian community, with more than half a million Hungarians living in Romania.
That is why I can say that it is in our national interest for Romania to accede in two yearsâ time.
Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the Nastase Government, which has done a great deal to bring about the historic reconciliation between Romania and Hungary.
Today we have a strategic partnership.
It is true that in all honesty much remains to be done, but considerable progress has been made over the last ten years.
I should like to stress three key issues that need to be resolved.
The first is genuine decentralisation, and a real devolvement of power to the regions.
The next is the protection of the environment, as clean rivers are a cross-border issue.
Finally, there is the question of the minorities, the Roma and the Hungarians.
I do not wish to make the implementation of different forms of autonomy a prerequisite to Romaniaâs accession, but it would be helpful to open negotiations with the new government, namely tripartite negotiations between the Romanian Government, the Hungarian parliamentary party and the Hungarian Government, as was done in the case of South Tyrol and the Ãland Islands in Finland.
The European Union offers helpful precedents here.
It would therefore be desirable to start the negotiations, and I fully support Romaniaâs accession without delay.
Â Â  It is perhaps Romania that has the worst legacy of all the former communist countries.
Ceaucescu and his associates destroyed the country, ruined its economy, fragmented its society and intimidated its citizens.
The last fifteen years are far from being a success story as the postponement of reforms wasted several valuable years.
I therefore hope that the newly-elected leaders, President and Government of Romania will set about facing the challenges before them with redoubled effort.
There are two tasks that I especially would like to mention.
The first one, where there are considerable deficiencies, is the social integration of the Romanian Romany minority comprising of over two million people, who are in a very difficult situation.
The second one is giving a higher priority to environmental issues, since the state of the environment in Romania is far behind that of the other candidate countries.
Regulations not only have to be adopted, but they have to be implemented as well.
Let me remind you of the very dangerous mining project of Rosia Montana, threatening us with severe environmental disaster.
The road that leads to the completion of negotiations is long and rugged, and I congratulate Romaniaâs leadership on their success.
From now on it should focus on adopting the .
I hope Romania will fulfil the obligations and will become a member state in 2007.
This is in our interest and in Romaniaâs interest.
I therefore think that Mr Basescuâs demand that two chapters should be reopened for negotiations is highly risky.
It jeopardises Romaniaâs accession in 2007, and delay is not in the interest of either Romania, or the European Union.
Romania has made great sacrifices in order to be able to work towards becoming a member of the Union.
I firmly believe that it is in our best interest that Romania joins as soon as 2007, and Romania must realise that several obligations simply must be fulfilled on the way.
This is why I find this topic so crucial and ask the Commissioner and the Commission to continuously monitor Romaniaâs progress in this matter, as it is not only in our best interest but also in the interest of Romanian citizens.
Â Â  MrÂ President, in the environmental sphere, Romania at present lags very far behind in terms of what is required by EU legislation.
In spite of the fact that it has been given very long transitional periods where important environmental regulations are concerned, it has not implemented different legislation.
Where, in a number of areas, such legislation has in actual fact been enacted, it has been so on paper but not in practice.
Last year, we sent a delegation from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety to the Department of the Environment in Bucharest.
The delegation examined quite a few of the more controversial projects, and our view was confirmed: the pace of reform in the environmental sphere needs urgently to be stepped up.
There is a special project I think the Commission should keep a particular eye on over the next few years.
It concerns Rosia Montana, a proposal to construct Europeâs largest gold mine in Romania.
It is a project that will have huge environmental repercussions.
Among other things, large quantities of cyanide will be used in this sensitive area.
The issue is that of whether Romania will comply with current EU legislation, for example the provisions governing environmental impact assessments and the water directive.
The issue is also that of whether Romania will successfully comply with the forthcoming new directive on waste from mines and its environmental repercussions.
I should like to call upon the Commission to examine the Rosia Montana project particularly carefully to see if there really is successful compliance with the EUâs environmental requirements, which I consider to be minimum standards and ones with which compliance is also being demanded by the local population in the area.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I join in with the many positive comments made to the rapporteur, Mr Moscovici, regarding the balance of his report.
While not ignoring any of the critical areas in the process of Romaniaâs preparation to join the European Union, the report shows a clear appreciation of the notable efforts made and the results â albeit still partial â achieved by Romania in that process.
This morning, with great aplomb, this Parliament gave the green light to the procedure for Turkeyâs preparation to join the European Union.
I am in favour of Romaniaâs accession for exactly the same reasons that have led me to express my strong hostility to Turkeyâs entry.
Romania is Europe; Romania has a civil and political society based on values which, despite their undeniable highs and lows, have to be regarded as perfectly comparable to the values on which the European Union is based.
Certain areas in which basic measures are still needed certainly deserve encouragement and support.
They include the multiannual anti-crime strategy, the state aid issue (a subject particularly close to the hearts of us liberalists), the sensitive question of the return of property and churches, as well as the modernisation of a judicial system that does not appear to be compatible with a society such as Europeâs, which is characterised by systems that are not subject to direct influence and control by the state.
I have just listened to the speech by a spokesman for a political party that voted for the accession of Turkey, who repeated the harsh remarks made by NGOs about respect for human rights in Romania.
I should like to have heard the same observations made about Turkey as well: in that case they would have been decidedly more justified.
It is, however, absolutely necessary to call the Romanian authoritiesâ attention to the urgent question of illegal immigration.
One Member has referred to the children, who understandably had an emotional effect on him during a visit to Romania.
I do not need to go to Romania, because you just need to drive around the streets of Turin, Milan, Genoa and Rome to see Romanian children exploited by criminal organisations.
We have to put a stop to illegal immigration, and Romania has to defend its external borders and actively collaborate in stamping out this activity, which does no credit to the civilisation of Eugen Ionescu, Mircea Eliade and the many other great writers and thinkers of a civilisation that we feel is close to us and which we share.
Â Â  Romaniaâs citizens have a place in the European Union, there is no question about it.
One of the reasons why we mutually need each other is because through accession, the underlying principles of the Union, decentralisation and local self-government may help improve prospects for the future of the Hungarian minority there, including one and a half million people.
The question is about fulfilling commitments: will Romania be able to adopt the that all Member States are obliged to fulfil?
The Union seems to be more lenient towards Romania than it was towards those countries that joined in May.
MrÂ Moscoviciâs report critically examines how Romania has met the criteria so far.
I would like to compliment him on his skill at compromise, as he included several of my proposed amendments into his report, making his arguments firmer.
The report examines areas of severe deficit: the independence of judicial proceedings, the discriminatory legislation on election rights and the return of ecclesiastical goods.
Let me take this even a step further and point out some of Romaniaâs deficiencies in fulfilling the Copenhagen criteria, highlighted by the election-related abuse on November 28.
As a Hungarian delegate, I feel obligated to list the temporary exemptions in the field of environmental protection that Romania asked for.
Hungarians are apprehensive about these exemptions, as they would have a direct effect on the quality of water in Hungary and thus have requested that the Hungarian Government reopened chapters of environmental protection, which have just recently been closed.
It is exactly because of the uncertainties of such commitments that I would like to emphasise how important it is to monitor strictly the period between signing the accession treaty and the actual time of accession.
If necessary, the processes of the two candidate countries should be separated and they should receive individual performance-based evaluation.
Regular progress checks are very important, and Parliament must also take part in this process, so that by the time Romania joins the Union, we can feel reassured and confident as to their preparedness.
I belong to those who most sincerely hope that our doubts will be scattered by Romaniaâs positive performance in the near future.
Â Â  Mr President, in my view, last Sunday's presidential elections have indeed demonstrated that democracy in Romania is very vibrant and is also working well.
This has not always been the case, and so we have every reason to be gratified.
Let us hope that the dynamic forces which have now been released will genuinely be channelled into driving forward the reforms and that the political process in Bucharest will not be obstructed.
All we can do is hope.
I was a member of the Delegation to the EU-Romania Joint Parliamentary Committee from 1999 to 2004.
If we compare 1999 and today, the country has obviously made substantial progress.
Notwithstanding all the criticism in specific areas, it must be said that the previous government under Anastase achieved a great deal for Romania.
Major progress has genuinely been made in many areas.
However, we cannot ignore the fact that the Romanians still have a lot to do.
Not enough has been done to achieve the standards that apply throughout the European Union.
I can only repeat what many of my fellow Members have said: an independent judiciary â which means a judiciary which is independent of the executive and individual political forces â is in fact a prerequisite for Romania's cooperation within the EU.
There is still some ground to be made up here.
I also hope that corruption can be combated more effectively.
Corruption is robbery at the expense of Romania's citizens, and the new President has pledged major anti-corruption measures which will hopefully target not only the 'small fry' but also the big fish.
Corruption must be tackled irrespective of position or status, for it is theft from the Romanian people.
In my view, it would be quite wrong for Romania or the EU to create new obstacles at this point in time.
The negotiations should be concluded, and I would like to thank Mr Moscovici, the rapporteur, for presenting such an excellent report.
2007 must be the date when we welcome Romania into the European family, and thus integrate it into European standards as well.
Â Â  Mr President, let me be clear. I am very much in favour of Romania acceding, but all in good time and preferably in accordance with the agreements made.
In order to complete the negotiations, it simply needs to fulfil the prescribed conditions and criteria, so it is quite beyond me why the Commission should, with a straight face, claim that Romania meets the Copenhagen political criteria, while at the same time it reports extensively on the influence the executive power exerts over the outcome of court cases and confirms that corruption is still rife and discrimination â including that against the Roma â is still very much on the agenda.
It appears that this Houseâs rapporteur, too, does not have any problem with stating in the first paragraph of his report that Romania meets the political criteria, while going on, later on in the report â and rightly so â to express his concern about a few crucial points.
The rapporteur goes on to draw the conclusion â which I regard as improbable â that a satisfactory conclusion of the negotiations before the end of 2004 is both desirable and feasible.
My common sense leads me to a completely different conclusion, namely that Romania has not gone that far yet and, consequently, negotiations cannot be concluded satisfactorily before the end of 2004.
We have tabled Amendment No 7 for that purpose.
Our Amendments Nos 6 and 25 are also important; Amendment No 6 underlines that the progress of all candidate countries is dependent on the assessment of their own merits and that it is for this reason that the use of individual accession agreements as a basis for the accession of Romania and Bulgaria is recommended.
Amendment No 25 does the necessary job of bringing paragraph 1 of the report back into line with reality.
I sincerely hope that we can count on your support so that we can get through to the European Council before it is too late, because it has just been confirmed again that the Council has now completed the formal negotiations with Romania.
It follows that this debate and tomorrowâs vote are staged performances, but, before the accession agreement is signed in the spring of 2005, Parliament must give its express approval, and I do not see that as being by any means a .
I would see it as a good thing if this House were to speak out clearly about the premature and artificial closure of the negotiations with Romania, if it were to be able to put a stop to the considerable arbitrariness in the enlargement process and if it were to keep to the agreements made.
The working method that we now see in the process with Romania will, sooner or later, result in the erosion of our community based on the rule of law and in the weakening of the Union.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the June List will welcome Romania and Bulgaria as Members of the European Union, just as we shall welcome Turkey, the countries of the Western Balkans and, in time, Ukraine and, hopefully, Belarus.
At the same time, we wish to warn of the problems that will be faced by the EU if we accept a large number of countries as Member States in the very short term â poor and economically undeveloped countries with limited experience of democracy and the rule of law and with large problems involving corruption.
The EU is constructed for economically developed countries with stable democracies and only moderate problems with corruption.
The enlargement involving ten countries that has just been carried out and of which the June List was a sincere supporter is, already for its part, causing problems.
Accepting poor countries such as Romania into an EU that continues to operate an absurd agricultural policy and a poorly managed structural policy and that is itself wrestling with difficulties in preventing waste and corruption in its own system would be dangerous for the future of the European project.
It might also prove dangerous for Romania.
There would be a significant risk of a brain drain.
Entering the EUâs agricultural system and being locked tightly into an economic structure without a future would also be a big disadvantage.
The election that has just taken place was, however, a big success for democracy in Romania, but both Romania and the EU countries have reasons to wait and see and not to push for premature accession.
It may be in the interests of both parties not to rush into full membership.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank the rapporteur, MrÂ Moscovici, for giving us a balanced report, which points out the advances made by Romania in recent years.
Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne did well to recall the position from which Romania started and the reasons that have made progress so difficult for that country.
Even so, MrÂ Moscovici has also pointed out the limitations and shortcomings that characterise Romaniaâs situation today.
Some Members from countries that joined the European Union on 1Â May this year have called for greater severity.
I should like them to reread what was said in this Chamber before their countries joined, when we were looking at how far they had progressed on their path towards joining the Union.
In all likelihood they still had considerable shortcomings at that stage but, even so, it was thought appropriate that they should be allowed to join at the agreed time.
In the case of Romania, we also have a safeguard clause, which was not provided in the other cases.
I therefore believe it is only fair to give that country the chance to do its utmost over the next two years so that it can be ready when the time comes to actually join our Union.
There is no doubt that there are topics about which our fellow citizens are concerned, the most important of which is the inadequacy of the fight against organised crime.
If we were to ask people in the streets of our countries to say how afraid they often felt of criminal gangs, we would surely be inclined to encourage the Romanian Government to do more in that direction.
As MrÂ Leinen rightly recalled, the fight against corruption is widespread in the countries joining our Union.
I should also like to touch on the topic of children.
This is a subject that I have addressed extensively in recent years, together with Baroness Nicholson.
Child protection issues need to be placed at the heart of our thinking.
I believe, however, that the proposal put forward by the rapporteur of having an international commission is a good solution.
If we want to prevent those children from spending their adolescence and youth on the streets of our cities or shut up in institutions, we have to take into account the dozens of families that have already made contact with them and would love to be able to give them affection.
