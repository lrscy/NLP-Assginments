We are faced today with a proposal to review objectively the question whether the UN Conventions of 1961, 1971, and 1998 relating to drugs are working effectively.
It may be that, after full inquiry, the international community should adopt new approaches in relation to certain problems and anomalies.
Whether this should happen or not depends on the evidence.
We need an inquiry to establish which way the evidence points.
Unilateral departure from the Conventions would, by contrast, be quite unacceptable.
The law must be firmly upheld both nationally and internationally until such time, if any, as it is amended for considered reasons.
On this ground I voted for the Buitenweg Report, and I previously signed Mr Cappato's declaration which provided the occasion for the Report.
As Mr Cappato is well aware, I am not dogmatically pre-committed to the solutions he recommends.
. (FR) The report we are examining today tries to be modern and libertarian.
It requests the reform of the United Nations Conventions on drugs and other narcotics, as they are considered to be too severe and repressive, in particular for cannabis users.
The desired objective is a free, liberalised drug market and decriminalised drug use.
How can we fail to be shocked and horrified by such suggestions?
How can we fail to realise that the damage caused by drug consumption and consumption of other psychotropic substances is increasingly significant in terms of crime, trafficking and death?
How can we fail to accept the fact that drug consumption increases exponentially with tolerance?
In this regard, I would like to congratulate my Finnish colleague, Mrs Matikainen-KallstrÃ¶m, who has bravely taken a stance in favour of a zero tolerance policy with regard to drugs.
This is clearly the only responsible attitude to adopt on this subject.
We must not touch the international conventions that lay down rules and principles relating to the fight against drugs.
Policy on combating drug consumption and trafficking must remain the responsibility of the Member States.
In particular, it is not Europe's role to decree, on the basis of scientific studies, which are only of value until the next studies that contradict them, that smoking cannabis is a good thing.
. (NL) The use of drugs, be they hard or soft, takes people away from useful activities and renders them less healthy.
It would therefore be wonderful if drugs did not exist or if no one had any need of them.
The reality is unfortunately different.
International agreements that oblige states to apply zero tolerance are not going to produce a drugs-free world.
Many young people experience the use of soft drugs as an inalienable freedom and there are also profiteers who happily make people dependent on the use of expensive hard drugs.
A ban on soft drugs simply leads to young people rebelling and eases their move onto the use of hard drugs.
I defend the Dutch system not because I am seeking a high point of individual freedom, but because it helps prevent insoluble problems.
My Group of the European United Left has introduced two extremes to this debate.
Mrs SchrÃ¶der is making herself the mouthpiece of rebellious youth and defending total freedom without any regulation by government.
Mr Alyssandrakis as a traditional Communist can see only dangerous drugs barons who must be mercilessly eliminated.
Both are telling part of the truth, but saying nothing about the rest.
Mrs Buitenweg's report proposes a good middle way, one with which we in the Netherlands have acquired good experience.
I have supported this way thus far and will continue to do so.
.
(PT) Our policy for combating drug addiction has proved to be a failure.
I therefore believe it is important to use the reform of the Conventions on Drugs to: 1 - look into decriminalising the consumption of some drugs and legalising them; 2 - move towards drawing up rational prevention policies based on scientific knowledge of each drug and not on the emotional and radical approach which, by treating all drugs in the same way, ultimately removes credibility from preventive action; 3 - boost the development of a damage reduction policy that takes account of the positive results achieved in the pilot experiments run in Berne and Liverpool, which involved administering, under medical control, opiates to patients with a long history of failed treatment. These results include a fall in the crime rate, in the number of overdoses and in the number of cases of HIV, tuberculosis and hepatitis B and C transmitted.
We Moderates believe it is very important for people to have access to those documents we politicians discuss within the EU.
It is on the basis of their opportunities for keeping track of legislative work that people can evaluate elected representatives and subsequently make decisions in general elections.
The EU institutions can provide information about which decisions are made, and how, but it is the right of the independent mass media to make judgments themselves concerning current affairs and to decide what they are to provide information about.
It is we politicians who must take responsibility for giving out political messages and political information, something that obviously applies both to choosing the points at issue and setting them out before people.
We Moderates believe that people should have access to information.
The EU should not, however, make use of artificial channels such as sports events to put forward political messages.
We Moderates are therefore voting against the above-mentioned report.
. (FR) The aim of this report is to take up the cudgels for a better information and communication strategy for the European Union.
Why not?
If the goal, however, as stated in one paragraph, is to convince all Europeans of the virtues of the European Union in the field of 'security, solidarity, equal opportunities [and] cohesion', this is not a good start.
No communication strategy, for example, can hide the fact that one in every eight workers in the Union is doomed to unemployment, and many to poverty.
If the European Union were to implement a policy opposing mass redundancies, by obliging employers to use current and past profits to ensure that jobs are maintained, and if unemployment were to be reduced as a result, a communication strategy would not be necessary: word of mouth would suffice!
.
(PT) Of course we do not dispute the need for the citizens of the various countries that make up the EU to be better informed about the policies that are promoted in their countries and, it goes without saying, about the consequences of these policies.
In fact, quite the opposite is true. We think, however, that simply 'being informed' is not enough.
We attach high priority to the need for a genuine participatory debate that airs the very different political positions that are held, all the more so because the issues we are currently debating are of key importance to the future of every country.
The report that has just been presented fails to do this and is concerned with raising the EU's popularity through propaganda campaigns when, in our opinion, the key issue concerns the fundamental political choices made at EU level, which are all neoliberal, federalist and militaristic.
First of all, the issue is not 'how best to construct propaganda', using the campaign for the euro as an example for 'enlargement' and for 'Europe's role in the world'.
Furthermore, I must comment on the way in which the Office of the European Commission in Portugal carries out its business, undertaking initiatives on important issues being debated in the EU, whilst discriminating against those who, like us, take a more critical view.
. (FR) The vote on a report proposing measures designed to provide better information for European citizens on the functioning of the European Union should, in theory, be a foregone conclusion.
This is far from the case with this text, which is entirely based on concern over the European Union's popularity deficit and the declining participation in European elections.
It mainly blames the lack of information and approaches that tend to portray the Union as a permanent battlefield between national interests.
By way of solutions, it proposes communication campaigns in order to promote common European values and the practical benefits of Union membership for daily life.
We believe the lack of popularity of the EU is due to the fact that its current priorities are neither democracy nor solidarity, but free trade, jeopardising public services and creating a policed fortress Europe.
The question, therefore, is not how better to organise institutional propaganda that is far removed from reality, but to find ways to present clearly to the citizens the debates on tomorrow's Europe and enable them to make themselves heard at every level.
For this reason, we did not vote in favour of the report.
. (FR) I was nothing short of horrified when I read this report.
This document unabashedly crosses the line between information and misinformation, communication and propaganda.
Propaganda is, indeed, the right word to use when we read, for example, that the European Union's communication strategy should rely on the support of opinion formers, target information to different population groups using attractive media such as sport and formulate messages in such a way that they can easily be included in education systems.
The almost scientific approach, the recruitment of opinion formers to work for the cause, the exploitation of all available resources and the insidious desire to manipulate the weakest minds by using education systems all smack of totalitarian propaganda.
This House should be ashamed to adopt a report which invites the European institutions to pillage public moneys in order to satisfy the desire for power of an oligarchy that wishes to subject reality to its own pipe dreams (citizenship, consciousness, European constitution).
Despite the abundance of means available to the pro-European machine, however, I would like to believe that the people will not allow themselves to be duped by this subliminal federalism.
.
(PT) No one any longer denies that there is an information deficit with regard to the European Union, the way it operates and its usefulness.
One only has to recall that 50% of Europeans is ignorant of, or indifferent to, the Union and that the rate of turnout in elections to the European Parliament fell from 63% in 1979 to 49% in 1999.
This information deficit contributes to creating a veritable gulf between European citizens and Community Institutions.
This is the context that forms the backdrop to the European Commission's strategy for information and communication in the EU.
Access to information is crucial to the full exercise of European citizenship.
For this reason, effective information policy must be based on the 'assertion of its common values' such as democracy, pluralism, cultural diversity, cohesion and solidarity.
More important still is to show, by giving practical examples, the everyday advantages gained from joining the EU, such as the euro, citizenship and freedom of movement.
In order to improve the effectiveness of EU information campaigns, every message must be clear, impartial, accessible and available in every citizen's own language.
Lastly, information campaigns must be coordinated at Community level, by the European institutions, thereby better enabling needs to be identified. At the same time, however, such campaigns must be decentralised to national and regional level.
.
(PT) The rapporteur has ultimately missed an opportunity to take a new, democratic and sensible look at the EU's information and communication policy, with a view to providing a genuine service to the citizens.
He has chosen to stick with the tired old model for providing information, which is founded on clichÃ©s and sacrifices pluralism and practical sense at the confused altar of unrealistic and abstract 'joint visions' and of politically correct banalities.
I have therefore voted against the report.
In fact, the well-known spreading across the European institutions of the single thought on the development of the European model weakens democratic debate, distances many citizens and narrows Europe's horizons.
Impartiality and doctrinal pluralism are the main victims of this propagandist form of 'information', which is clearly discriminatory, frequently confusing electoral propaganda with information about the institutions.
The fact that the citizens have little knowledge of the EU and feel relatively uninvolved with it (according to Eurobarometer) clearly demonstrates the failure of this strategy.
The success of the Euro campaign, by way of contrast, proves that it is practical issues, consistent actions and the dissemination of tangible instruments that promote European integration - not the demand for 'a common cultural basis' or the artificial injection of 'a sense of belonging'.
Along the same practical and effective lines, the report urges the Council to open to the public meetings in which it exercises legislative powers and regrets the fact that the Commission is still not setting an example for respecting linguistic diversity on many websites ...
(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
We are in favour of a common foreign policy in the EU and recommend that the EU put resources into preventive work, mediation and crisis management.
Defence is a national issue.
We cannot therefore support a common military defence, increased defence costs financed from the Community budget or a collective defence clause.
We shall therefore vote against the report.
- (DA) We have voted in favour of the overall motion for a resolution, because it is most promising at a time when it is very necessary to strengthen the EU's defence and security policy.
Where collective defence is concerned, we attach importance to NATO's remaining the indispensable link binding the United States to Europe's security interests, and we continue to attach great importance to the maintenance of good transatlantic relations.
We cannot, however, support the Member States' and the candidate countries' being called upon to apply the principle of Community preference in purchasing arms, in order in that way to guarantee the security of supply.
As liberals, we support in this case too the principle of the open market economy, for that is what will guarantee arms purchases of the highest quality.
We have declined to vote in favour of the desire for a protocol to the Treaty, adding a collective defence clause for those Member States that wish to divide the obligations embedded in Article V of the Brussels Treaty and so bring the Western European Union to an end.
We believe that responsibility for Danish security lies first and foremost with NATO.
. (FR) The Morillon report proposes a new, unitarian, centralised European security and defence architecture, which seems to be both unrealistic and outdated.
In fact, the report is entirely consistent with the Community framework.
It pays no attention to what should be the main principle, the free participation of countries and variable geometry of associations.
There is only one reference to 'constructive abstention', the slight flexibility introduced by the Treaty of Amsterdam to preserve the general centralised framework.
On the other hand, however, great emphasis is placed on the need to develop the competences of the existing European institutions and the inclusion of costs in the Community budget (Paragraphs 40, 56 and 57 of the resolution).
The Iraq crisis has shown the extent to which this organisation was outdated.
In any case, however, this report is not realistic, as it asserts both the competence of the national parliaments with regard to the use of national forces and that of the European Parliament in relation to approving operations.
All that is contradictory.
We have to choose.
The only possible solution is for the nations to have greater authority and for their parliaments to bear the main responsibility.
All the rest should follow on from that.
. (FR) Advocating a common European army, as the report does, is not without its funny side, at a time when the UK army is close behind the US army in a terrible war in Iraq while the other armies, by political choice or lack of capacity, are stating their opposition to the war.
What, therefore, would a united European army have done?
Behind this tragi-comedy, however, is the idea that supra-European militarism should be added to differing national militarisms.
We reject both because these militarisms consist solely of making the people pay, sometimes in blood, but always in taxes, for wars carried out to the benefit of a few large trusts.
Let nobody plead the need to defend their country at national level and continental level!
The French army, for example, has not needed to defend its country since 1945.
It has, on the other hand, waged numerous colonial wars or participated in armed banditry disguised as war all over the world.
We therefore voted against this report.
.
(FR) The current division between the Member States on key foreign policy issues is lamentable. It prevents the Union from becoming a credible player on the international stage.
If we want the Union to become a credible player, however, it must adopt a single stance and speak with a single voice.
If we want the European Union to defend its objectives and its values on the international stage and contribute to peace, freedom and stability in the world, in accordance with the principles of the United Nations and international law, it urgently needs to develop a genuine ESDP as an integral part of the CFSP.
This ESDP must be based on the principle of security, a security that is common to Europe and the rest of the world, a sustainable security based on equality, justice and reciprocity, a security based on respect for human rights, democratic control and international law.
The Union should be a credible player on the international stage but also a free partner of the United States within the Atlantic Alliance. That is the key message of this report, and that is why I shall support it.
. (FR) In order to make its voice better heard, Europe must strengthen its common foreign and security policy, including with regard to military crisis management.
It is only by shouldering its responsibilities more firmly with regard to its own security that the European Union can exist and make its choices count in the essential dialogue with the United States, within a multipolar global framework.
The Treaty on the European Defence Community (EDC) remains a useful source of inspiration.
The European Commission could manage the technological and industrial aspects subject to competition rules.
A Council of Defence Ministers should be created in cooperation with the national parliaments, while the European Parliament should be the democratic body for monitoring and codecision.
Organised in this way, the European Union would have the means to become a global entity - in the political, economic and monetary and social fields and in the fields of external relations and defence.
.
(PT) Even with the considerable differences seen in the positions of the Member State governments on the unjust, illegitimate and illegal preventive war against Iraq, the majority of Members still insist on giving their support to increasing the EU's military capacities and to creating a common foreign, security and defence policy which has all the resources it requires. We reject this approach, both because it represents a clear attack on every country's sovereignty and because of its potential for creating a Europe based on the use of force.
These Members are consequently also calling for closer collaboration with NATO, for a military force that undertakes action independently to be operational with effect from 2004, and for an armaments agency funded from the Community budget, which we also reject.
Consequently, we have voted against the report.
We call for peace and cooperation, not war.
Conflicts must be resolved by diplomatic means, not by the use of force.
The arms race not only involves shifting to this area resources that are essential to development and to fighting poverty and social exclusion, but can also lead to wars and the destruction of humanity. We totally reject this approach.
.
(FR) General Morillon's report specifies the ambitions of a security and defence policy for the European Union.
After recommending certain precautions, such as the need to base this policy on equality, justice, reciprocity, human rights, democratic control and international law, and contribute to freedom, peace, etc., the report sets out its practical bases, with its underlying view of the world in terms of policing: instability caused by terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, trafficking in weapons, drugs and human beings and illegal immigration, caused, in short, by human evil in general, and not by social oppression or North-South inequalities.
The solution proposed is therefore strengthening the military capabilities available to the Union requiring the development of a European security culture, as quickly as possible.
The report even believes that European military force should be capable by 2009 of carrying out an operation of the level and intensity of the Kosovo conflict within European territory.
What a peaceful future!
For these reasons, we tabled a prior amendment calling for a rejection of war as a means of resolving international disputes.
As this was rejected, we voted against the Morillon report.
. (NL) The European Union seems to be developing into a federal superstate.
In federations many powers are in the hands of the individual states, but only the federation decides on foreign policy and defence.
On the other hand the EU Member States have so far retained their own ministers of Foreign Affairs, their own embassies, their separate seats at the United Nations and their armies.
This contrast is causing some Members of this Parliament to start working towards a single EU representative on the Security Council and a single European army, with a view to becoming the second world superpower alongside the United States of America.
Not a superpower opposed to the US, but an ally of equal standing that can intervene in the rest of the world together with the US.
My party, the Socialist Party in the Netherlands, considers this a mistaken development.
The EU will do better to concern itself with the resolution of cross-border problems within Europe and keeping control of large international concerns that take no account of the interests and the democratic rights of the vast majority of people.
In a military context Europe should confine itself to the defence of its own territory, purely humanitarian aid outside Europe and if necessary peacekeeping assistance at the request of all the parties concerned in candidate countries, as is happening now in Macedonia.
Anything that goes beyond this I reject.
.
(PT) In reworking the underhand method of imposing European centralism, the rapporteur has chosen - even though he denies this - to disregard the current historical situation, straying from the divergent interests of the Member States with regard to the ESDP and far exceeding commitments given voluntarily, at the Helsinki European Council of 1999 in particular.
The only way we could have an EU with 'one strong and clear voice' today would be to force most Member States to keep quiet. This would be unacceptable.
In the current context, there are no real grounds for the pressure to justify the trend to communitise the second pillar on the basis of the need to enhance 'the credibility of its foreign policy objectives'.
The constant comparison with the United States of America, a sovereign State and a two-hundred year old nation, betrays the rapporteur's preferred direction for the EU to take, which I clearly cannot support.
Apart from being a structural paradox, reconstructing the European institutional architecture, starting at the very top, is the complete opposite of the model advocated by the Founding Fathers, causing one to fear for the solidity and coherence that are gradually being assembled.
I have therefore voted against the report.
. (FR) What we should retain from this sitting is that we have debated at length a report on European security, whose content is for the most part completely out of date, and that we have refrained, by a great majority, from debating the war in Iraq at a time when its outcome is at stake and its consequences concern our security first and foremost.
We should also remember Parliament's silence on the tripartite summit between France, Germany and Russia, which begins tomorrow in St Petersburg with the Secretary-General of the United Nations.
Is this silence because the summit concerns an intergovernmental initiative and is therefore ideologically unsound?
If Parliament was genuinely concerned, however, as it claims, about seeing Europe exert its own substantial diplomatic influence in the period following the war, it would have to attach greater importance to the St Petersburg Summit than to the next European Council.
Lastly, we should remember doubling financial aid to Turkey, probably in order to thank Ankara for its refusal to end the occupation of Cyprus by its troops.
Aid should not be linked to accession, as Parliament has done, but to a constructive attitude on Turkey's part making it possible to achieve a reunited Cyprus before the entry of Nicosia into the Union.
If we had done this, we would have made a practical contribution towards European security.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
(The sitting was suspended at 1.10 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
The next item is the debate on cases of the violation of human rights, democracy and the rule of law.
The next item is the debate on the following six motions for resolutions on human rights in Guatemala:
B5-0210/2003 by Mr GasÃ²liba i BÃ¶hm and others, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal and Democratic Party, on human rights in Guatemala;
B5-0214/2003 by Mr Kreissl-DÃ¶rfler and Mr van den Berg, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on human rights in Guatemala;
B5-0217/2003 by Mr Liese and Mr Posselt, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, on future cooperation policy in support of food safety and rural development in Guatemala;
B5-0220/2003 by Mr Mayol i Raynal and others, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, on human rights in Guatemala;
B5-0225/2003 by Mrs GonzÃ¡lez Ãlvarez and others, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the United European Left /Nordic Green Left, on Guatemala.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats supports this compromise resolution on the human rights situation in Guatemala.
I am very glad that this issue is on today's agenda.
I worked, for a time, as a doctor in Guatemala, and myself became familiar with the situation in that country.
The greatest problem in Guatemala was then - and still is - the extreme disparity between wealth and poverty.
Being a Christian Democrat, I certainly am not among those who leap to the defence of tax increases.
In Europe and in my own country too, taxes are certainly too high, but the situation in Guatemala is that the rich simply do not see themselves as being under any obligation to contribute to the country's development.
That is why we have incorporated into the Joint Resolution a passage intended to ensure that the necessary adjustments are made, as it is necessary also to draw upon the financial resources of the wealthy in a given country for such purposes as the improvement of its educational systems.
The issue of land and of the way in which it is shared out is without doubt a key to future development in Guatemala and in its neighbouring countries, and, at the end of 2002, MEPs belonging to different groups organised a conference on the subject.
What I learned from this conference was that it is possible to reach the same objective without resorting to inflammatory language, and for that reason, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has not used the term 'agricultural reform', opting instead for an expression that, although rather more unwieldy, has found its way into the Joint Resolution, simply in order to avoid provoking counter-reactions that would then get us no nearer our objective.
Something else that is very important - and I am glad that it has been incorporated into the Joint Resolution - is that any policy must have education and training as one of its basic components.
It is no use simply giving people a plot of land; they also have to know how to cultivate it.
Taken as a whole, the Joint Resolution is an even-handed compromise, and it is out of conviction that we support it.
Mr President, Mr Liese has already referred to the conference that our group organised with him and other fellow MEPs in September last year at which we agreed to submit this resolution to this Parliament and the Commission.
We are after all convinced that the extreme poverty of the rural population that has to make a living from survival agriculture makes this the poorest population in the world.
The rural population, which in Guatemala largely consists of the indigenous population, is unfortunately no exception to this.
That is why it is of the utmost importance that each of the sentences in this resolution is considered very carefully.
We do not have the time to go into each of these aspects in depth, but it is clear that in these circumstances land reform is necessary, even if that word is taboo.
It is the indigenous population that is clearly suffering most and that has no access to healthy food, that has no access to a good education and that has no access to land.
The women are the biggest victims of all because they simply do not count, although in many cases it is they who have to provide alone for very large, extended families.
There is a wave of human rights violations at the moment and people in the country are acting with complete impunity.
In these circumstances there are good reasons to recall the ratification of membership of the International Criminal Court and we would also like to insist on the abolition of the death penalty.
All this to underline that just one of the countries for which we had some hope a few years ago is threatening to slip back into a state of impunity again, the agreements of 1996 remaining a dead letter.
We donate quite a lot of money to cooperation with these countries in Latin America.
Let us ensure that our international agreements, which come down to our aid and our cooperation having first to be for the benefit of the poorest, actually make this possible and that the government is obliged to lend its assistance in this.
Mr President, almost six years have passed since the conclusion of the peace agreements. Nonetheless, MINUGUA, the United Nations Mission to Guatemala admits the agreements are stalled.
Regression has even been noted in some cases.
As Mr Liese rightly pointed out, the House has been addressed by small farmers from Guatemala and by representatives of the institutions in that country. It was stated clearly that some of this regression involved the murder of small farmers or threats against them.
The rights of the indigenous people are again being violated.
The judiciary lacks the means to administer justice. Even the National Coordinator for indigenous peoples and small farmers has denounced the lack of security regarding land.
We were therefore requested to ensure that the peace agreements are put firmly back on track when the next advisory group meeting is held in May of this year. Renewed effort is called for on the part of the European Commission to promote the peace agreements.
This is especially urgent in certain basic areas such as the fight against impunity, appropriate fiscal reform and the fight against poverty. More work is also needed on land distribution, together with a law on registration and land registry information.
These were the main points agreed during the seminar Mr Liese mentioned.
Mr President, on behalf of the one of the authors, Mr Kreissl-DÃ¶rfler, I should like to express the total support of the PSE Group.
It is vital that we remember the victims of the current increase in violence and call on the government to protect their rights: human rights, the right of freedom of association and freedom of belief.
Equally we are concerned at the insecurity of the indigenous peoples and their eviction from the land where they work.
We must also recognise and fight against the discrimination experienced by indigenous and peasant women.
There must be a recognition of their work and their rights on the land and within the country.
Furthermore, this House expresses with one voice its total support for the peace process in Guatemala.
With peace we can rebuild communities and with rebuilt communities we can ensure that fundamental human rights are respected.
Mr President, Guatemala, home to an ancient culture, is a country that has, again and again, suffered grave setbacks.
Recent history shows us that, ever since the murder, in the seventies, of the German ambassador Graf Spreti, who was a diplomat and politician of note, this region of Central America has repeatedly found itself under the spotlight of European and German public opinion and was battered by one crisis after another, to which any response came too late.
We were always too late in responding to the bloody acts of violence, to the revolutions, and to the terrorism.
So I thank Mr Liese and all the others who have taken the initiative in putting forward this masterpiece of pre-emptive diplomacy, a brief resolution which, for the first time, is not a reaction to a crisis of the sort with which we are familiar in our debates on topical and urgent matters - although there is of course an acute crisis going on.
Primarily, though, this is about prevention, and, moreover, prevention through action rather than through words.
It gets right to the core issues, these being the whole area of agriculture and the reforms that it needs.
Secondly, it turns to economic reform and the area of fiscal legislation, which really is bizarre.
The crucial thing is that it also embeds the peace process, to which the European Union can make a substantial contribution by supporting and setting up dialogue, as well, of course, as in the field of economic cooperation and development aid.
I am very grateful for this initiative.
It is my belief that the real task of this House is not always to merely condemn, but to actively endeavour to devise strategies for minimising disasters, or averting them completely.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the people of Guatemala, like all the people of Latin America, have tried foreign intervention by American imperialism and exploitation by the local oligarchy with tragic consequences.
They have been forced to follow the path of armed conflict in order to defend their fundamental rights.
Their tough fight resulted in the peace process and the government which emerged promised to promote certain reforms which would give the descendents of the Maya and other local civilisations some relief.
Now six years on, and still no progress has been made with these reforms; on the contrary, poverty rules, especially among the natives, who make up the majority of the population.
Employment rights are being trampled underfoot, the remnants of feudalism are being maintained, farmers are being turned off the land they cultivate and their leaders are being murdered by the paramilitary, who enjoy impunity.
We condemn the government of Guatemala, the oligarchy and foreign intervention.
We stand by the grass-roots forces of the country and are certain that their fight for democratic and social change will bear fruit.
Mr President, this is an important issue.
The Commission is monitoring very closely the situation in Guatemala, where, as a number of speakers have said this afternoon, mounting infringements of the rule of law and human rights, as well as the deepening polarisation within Guatemalan society, are causing increasing political and social tension on the eve of the 2003 elections.
At the same time, difficult access to food, extreme poverty and social protest are increasingly alarming issues.
Within this unfortunate and unhappy scenario, in line with the resolution on Guatemala that the European Parliament issued in April 2002, the Commission is reinforcing the political dialogue and cooperation initiatives.
Our objective is to encourage the Guatemalan institutions and society to relaunch a national agenda based on the peace accords, good governance and the fight against poverty.
From the point of view of the political dialogue, the Commission and the Member States constantly remind the Guatemalan public institutions of the importance of respecting the dignity and securing the wellbeing of all Guatemalan people on the basis of the principles of democracy, equality, non-discrimination and social justice.
During the last months, the Commission has also participated in various EU actions to transmit to the Supreme Court of Justice and the local authorities our preoccupation about the increasing wave of threats, attacks and violence in that country.
In May 2002 the Commission adopted a strategy for cooperation with Guatemala during the period 2002 to 2006.
That strategy is aimed at sustaining the peace accords and breaking the cycle of poverty and exclusion that affects the country.
The strategy was established with the large-scale participation of the Guatemalan Government, Member States and local and European civil society.
It will focus on three main areas: first, consolidation of the rule of law and protection of human rights; secondly, local and rural development based on participation, inclusion and equity; and thirdly, equitable economic growth and job creation.
The indicative financial resources are EUR 93 million for the period 2002 to 2006.
It is also worth mentioning that Guatemala is a priority country under the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights.
As Members of Parliament will know, there will be a further Consultative Group meeting scheduled in Guatemala City for 13 and 14 May 2003.
At that meeting the Commission and Member States will urge the Guatemalan authorities and society to renew efforts to accelerate the implementation of the Peace Agenda signed in 1996, especially in those areas where unsatisfactory results have been registered so far, such as the justice system, rural development, and the situation of the indigenous people.
We shall also ask for the allocation of adequate budgetary resources for social expenditure.
Finally, the Commission stands ready to support Guatemala in monitoring the next electoral process and guaranteeing a transparent and democratic transfer of power - as it did for the last elections in 1999.
During his visit to Brussels in January 2003 Minister GutiÃ©rrez, asked for the support of the European Union.
The Supreme Electoral Tribunal has also asked for our support.
The Commission and Member States will decide whether to prepare an EU electoral observation mission on the basis of an exploratory mission that will be sent in May 2003.
Thank you, Commissioner Bolkestein.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place following this debate.
The next item is the debate on the following seven motions for resolutions on human rights in Cuba:
B5-0209/2003 by Mr Galeote Quecedo and others, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, on Cuba;
B5-0211/2003 by Mr GasÃ²liba i BÃ¶hm and others, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal and Democratic Party, on the most recent arrests in Cuba and on the suspension of relations between the European Union and Cuba;
B5-0213/2003 by Mr van den Berg and Mr Obiols i GermÃ , on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on Cuba;
B5-0218/2003 by Mr Mayol i Raynal and others, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, on Cuba;
B5-0221/2003 by Mr QueirÃ³ and Mrs Muscardini, on behalf of the Union for a Europe of the Nations Group, on Cuba;
B5-0222/2003 by Mr Belder, on behalf of the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities, on Cuba;
B5-0223/2003 by Mr Wurtz, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the United European Left/Nordic Green Left, on human rights in Cuba.
Mr President, Oswaldo PayÃ¡, winner of the 2002 Sakharov Prize, stated in this very Chamber that thousands of his countrymen and women are fighting for their rights in the midst of persecution. He also stated that hundreds of his fellow citizens had been imprisoned for claiming and defending those rights.
The situation in Cuba remains unchanged.
Amongst those arrested and sentenced in the last wave of repression are human rights defenders and peaceful dissidents. Many of them were members of the Christian Liberation Movement, and involved in the Varela Project.
Independent journalists such as RaÃºl Rivero were also targeted.
This gentleman is 57 years of age and received a 20-year prison sentence. Others sentenced include Omar RodrÃ­guez, a photographer, who received a 27-year sentence and another journalist, VÃ­ctor Rolando Arroyo, sentenced to 26 years in prison.
Mr President, it is no accident that Cuba is the only Latin American country not linked to the European Union by virtue of an association or cooperation agreement.
These regrettable events illustrate why this is so. Sadly, the events took place just as the European Commission opened a representation in Havana, and when our institutions and many Members of this House were favourably disposed towards extending participation in the Cotonou Agreement to include Cuba.
I urge the Commissioner to condemn these events and further, to state the conclusions the Commission intends to draw from them.
For all these reasons, Mr President, I believe Parliament must first reject and strongly condemn these events, as provided for by the joint resolution. Parliament has to stand firm and continue to insist on freedom as a prerequisite.
Secondly, Parliament must express its solidarity with all those fighting for their freedom and dignity inside Cuba. To paraphrase Oswaldo PayÃ¡, they feel no hate in their hearts as they fight, but no fear of their oppressors either.
Fidel Castro is evidently afraid of nothing so much as his own people.
Which is why he is scared to death of democratic reforms and is eliminating opponents.
In the shadow of Iraq, Fidel now sees his opportunity to put more than 75 dissidents and independent journalists behind bars for a villainously long time.
Their only crime is that they disagree with the regime, are open about it and are possibly supported by the Americans.
On my visit to Cuba in December it became clear to me that Cuba wants better relations with the European Union and is keen to accede to the Cotonou Agreement.
To this end the Commission office was recently opened in Havana.
Four days later came the arrests.
What a slap in the face of the European Union!
If the political detainees are not released, the question arises as to what the point is of a political dialogue and of a European Union office.
Nor do any negotiations need to be conducted with regard to the Cotonou Agreement.
I would like to hear what Commissioner Bolkestein has to say on the subject.
As human rights rapporteur I have spoken to many Cuban authorities, including the Vice President and the Minister for Foreign Affairs.
Unfortunately, I have to say now that they wrong-footed me with their evasive answers.
Political processes behind closed doors are old Soviet practices for which there is no longer a place in a civilised world.
The American boycott is ill-advised.
Cuba is crazy about dollars.
That is why a new invasion is needed.
Not of soldiers but of peaceful visitors from America and Cuba.
Democrats of the world unite ... in Cuba and give Castro a fright, by opening not only your wallet but also your mouth.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, the Socialist Group fully and unequivocally supports the motion for a resolution we are now discussing.
The Socialist Group protests with great indignation at the monstrous wave of repression that has crashed down on anyone who dares to dissent, disagree, think differently or create freely in Cuba.
This incredible wave of repression reveals, to anyone still harbouring doubts or illusions, the true nature of the Cuban political regime.
This is a totalitarian regime that could be called Orwellian, in other words, of the type imagined by George Orwell in his masterpiece entitled 'nineteen eighty-four'.
Once Cuban music, symbolised by Compay Segundo, Ibrahim Ferrer and their Buena Vista Social Club, was liberated we thought that we would also see the liberation of the spoken word - poetry -embodied by RaÃºl Rivero, a great poet who has been sentenced to twenty years in prison. And the liberation of political speech, personified by Elizardo Sanchez and Osvaldo PayÃ¡, to whom we awarded the Sakharov Prize.
This is not, however, what has happened.
We were deceived.
The Cuban dictator has had intellectuals, journalists, political dissidents and members of the Varela project arrested and brutally repressed, using the usual pretexts and means employed by any common or garden dictatorship: spying on its citizens, arbitrary imprisonment, court-room farces and absurd sentences.
There are no good or bad dictatorships, Mr President.
All dictatorships are intrinsically evil.
There is no point in grading them on a scale of evilness and calling Fidel Castro's dictatorship 'benign'.
It makes no sense for the left to call Fidel Castro's dictatorship a 'respectable' dictatorship.
I personally wish to protest against this!
The cynical, barefaced and shameless breach of fundamental freedoms and human rights now represents a challenge and a provocation thrown down by Fidel Castro to all citizens and democratic countries.
We must unite our efforts to isolate Cuba politically.
I am not talking about economic isolation, because in fact the US economic embargo has provided the greatest excuse for the Cuban dictatorship.
I am talking about moral and political isolation.
We must support the dissident Cuban socialist Elizardo Sanchez, who has spent eight years in Fidel's prisons and heads the Committee on Human Rights and National Reconciliation, when he demonstrates exemplary courage by stating in an interview with a French newspaper on the subject of this wave of repression, that what is being called into question in Cuba - these are his words - 'is the totalitarian model', which has failed there as elsewhere, and calls it an obscene model, adding that the Cuban regime is in its final throes.
These are troubled times for dictatorships, Mr President.
I fervently hope that democracy will triumph in Cuba and that the admirable Cuban people will regain the freedom of assembly, the freedom of association, the freedom to demonstrate, the freedom of speech, and the freedom to travel beyond their island.
In short, I pray that the Cuban people recover the dreams which underpinned a revolution that I have always supported, but whose most important ideas have been betrayed and negated.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the only thing worse than a dictator is an unrepentant dictator and the only thing worse than an unrepentant dictator is an unrepentant dictator who is also an opportunist.
The Cuban dictator Fidel Castro has carried out this action with shocking cynicism and brutality, taking advantage of the international crisis, in the belief that since the world's attentions are currently focused on another part of the globe - Iraq - international attention would be shifted and would therefore allow him to unleash all his rage and fury on those citizens who disagree with him.
Were this situation not so tragic, we might say, given this proof of Fidel Castro's regime once again showing its true colours; that communism and Stalinism are like riding a bicycle: once you have learned how, you never forget.
We in the UEN Group support the joint motion for a resolution, the compromise resolution that has been tabled and that will certainly be adopted.
I wish, however, to say something further about the action that we feel should be taken.
We believe that we in the European Parliament have a particular responsibility at the moment because last December we awarded the Sakharov Prize to Oswaldo PayÃ¡.
We cannot abandon our Cuban brothers and sisters to their fate and we must show that awarding the Sakharov Prize serves some purpose.
A European Parliament delegation must go to Cuba without delay to meet these detainees and particularly Oswaldo PayÃ¡.
We must once again express our solidarity and once again invite Oswaldo PayÃ¡ to come to Strasbourg for the May part-session.
If he cannot come in May, then in June and if he cannot come in June, then in July, to tell us what is happening in Cuba.
We must act rapidly, to show our solidarity with our Cuban brothers and sisters.
We know that the European Union has already expressed its condemnation.
This is important and is to be welcomed but it is not enough.
We must do more; we must send a clear message to the Cuban dictator that we do not accept this, and that we shall not concede on this matter.
We must put Cuba's application for Cotonou membership on hold, and we must show quite clearly that we are prepared to support the Cuban situation changing to become a regime of freedom, democracy and respect for human rights, but also that we shall not give in to any backsliding and particularly to any renewal of this Stalinist brutality.
Let us call for the immediate release of all detainees.
Mr President, once again the tyrannical regime of Fidel Castro has shown its criminal face.
In the severest wave of repression for ten years the dictator wants to rid himself of dissidents who are disagreeable to him.
Sudden, mass arrests of critics of his regime are followed by quick show trials.
The first so-called 'traitors' were picked up in mid-March.
Last Monday the first draconian punishments had already been fixed in a judicial process that rode roughshod over international legal standards.
Cubans who did nothing other than exercise their right to free speech were charged with subversive activities.
This serious charge gives Castro the chance to impose excessively severe punishments under Law 88.
This violation of the international legal order is unacceptable.
It is precisely now that the United Nations Human Rights Commission, which has been extremely critical of Cuba, is meeting in Geneva.
It is precisely now that the European Union has opened official representation in Havana.
It is precisely now that Castro is attempting to seize his chance in the shadow of the liberation of Iraq.
We must put a stop to this.
In the resolution we argue for the immediate release of all detainees and an end to these dubious detentions.
Only then can the European Union consider the continuation of the political dialogue with Cuba and the accession of that island to the Cotonou Agreement.
To which I would add the Cuban request to accede to the ACP countries.
Mr President, I shall do my best to convey the stance endorsed by the majority of my group if not unanimously.
Firstly, our group has strongly criticised what we consider the unduly harsh sentences handed down to the Cuban dissidents referred to earlier in the House.
Secondly, we state clearly that freedom of expression and assembly must be respected as the fundamental rights they are.
It is important however to take account of the context in which these sentences came about. Firstly, the embargo or blockade, call it what you will, which has had drastic social and economic consequences for Cuba over the last 40 years, and which the international community has condemned at the United Nations year after year.
Secondly, the constant harassment by the representative of the United States in Havana for the last six months. That individual, Mr James Cason, has drawn on substantial financial resources to destabilise Cuban institutions.
The sum of USD 20 million has been mentioned. Thirdly, the incredible leniency shown by the United States to those who hijacked two aircraft and a vessel during the last month, putting hundreds of lives at risk.
Fourthly, the imprisonment of five Cuban citizens sentenced in the United States without guarantees. This was simply for attempting to prevent the terrorist attacks that took place a few months ago in tourist establishments.
They caused serious damage, injury, and the death of an Italian holidaymaker. It was because the situation on the island had not been taken into account that we decided not to sign this joint resolution.
Mr President, I should like to conclude by expressing a personal view.
I believe it is regrettable that the majority of Members who are being so severe on Cuba today should have voted last year against the resolution calling for diplomatic relations with Israel to be broken. This was because of the repeated killing of Palestinians, many of whom were children.
Thirty-four Palestinians have been murdered over the last three days. I also believe the vote against any proposal or amendment to condemn or stop the illegal, immoral and unjust war against Iraq during the last mini-session was most regrettable.
Mr President, I do not know what to make of these double standards. Such an attitude is unfair above all to the victims.
These run into the hundreds in Palestine. We may never know the number of victims in Iraq, as history tends to be written by the victors.
Mr President, the repressive process set in train with impunity against Cuban citizens in Cuba has shown up the Castro dictatorship in its true colours once again. All these individuals had done was to attempt to exercise their right to rights, as Oswaldo PayÃ¡ explained in his address to this House.
This amounts to a flagrant violation of fundamental rights and freedoms.
In a sense too, it is a response to the Varela Project. The House is honour bound to respond with strong condemnation of the actions of the Castro regime and that caricature of justice subservient to the dictatorship.
The House must call for all those imprisoned to be released. It must also speak out against what Oswaldo PayÃ¡ described as the fallacy or myth that Cubans have to live without rights to sustain the independence and sovereignty of their country.
Fundamental rights are not negotiable and their infringement can never be justified.
We are called on to assure those fighting for the rights of all Cubans that we stand shoulder to shoulder with them and that their fight is our fight also. Indeed, it is our moral and political duty to do so.
We should also assure those who have found the courage to support the Varela Project that we support their efforts to re-empower the people of Cuba by constitutional means.
We must do more than simply condemn, however. I therefore call on the Commissioner to reject Cuba's request to participate in the Cotonou Agreement if by the time the request comes up for consideration repression still persists and those detained have not been released.
I would call on the Council to act in this way too, if the Council were represented here today. Article 9(2) of the aforementioned agreement requires Cuba to make a commitment to human rights.
In no way can such a commitment be compatible with the repression currently endured by so many Cuban citizens merely because of their love of freedom.
Mr President, a great deal has already been said.
I believe we must express clear condemnation of the Fidel Castro regime, but we must also attempt to help the Cuban people, who are currently both suffering from the effects of an embargo and the victims of oppression.
We must not make the mistake of failing to understand the tragedy of this people and we - including the Commission - must strive to intervene in the Cuban situation in such a way as to isolate the Cuban regime while upholding the fundamental and economic rights of the Cuban people.
I was one of those who - while realising that these few minutes will not allow an in-depth analysis of the situation in Cuba - upheld the need for a resolution to be adopted now on the arrests and, in particular, on the sentences, which are not just excessive but groundless. The incredible thing is that we are talking about detentions and even death sentences.
The incredible thing is that the regime is actually in earnest, given that sentences as long as 26 years have already been inflicted.
I would also like to point out to the Members that political persuasion is no guarantee of safety here, for countless Social Democrats have seen the inside of Fidel Castro's prisons.
I too, therefore, consider that we in turn must send out a clear message, and we await the reaction of the Commission.
Mr President, I too of course am greatly concerned by the arrest of more than 70 dissidents, among them journalists and leaders of the illegal opposition parties, including the leaders of our two sister liberal parties in Cuba, which are also members of Liberal International, and the excessively long custodial sentences given to them in legal proceedings held away from the public gaze.
I myself visited Cuba a few years ago on behalf of Liberal International.
That has to be one of the most incredible experiences I have ever had anywhere in the world.
How those people resist what Castro is doing to them!
I am therefore puzzled by the remarks of Mrs GonzÃ¡lez, who ventures to say that what is happening in Cuba is a good thing, because she does not think much of the United States as a country, because she disapproves of the war in Iraq and because the situation in Israel is unsatisfactory.
Try telling that to these people in Cuba, Madam!
Try telling these people who are locked up in Cuba that it is okay, that it is absolutely fine that they are locked up, because you do not think much of the situation in other parts of the world!
That is a betrayal of democracy that you are committing, Madam!
Mr President, I have until now sincerely supported all the UN resolutions demanding that the economic sanctions introduced by the United States against Cuba should be lifted.
I have looked forward to its being possible for Cuba to become the 78th member of the ACP group, have been delighted about the political dialogue with the EU and hoped for a rapid Cuban accession to the Cotonou Agreement.
I therefore deeply regret the fact that I must on this occasion most vigorously condemn Cuba, and I would call upon that country immediately to release all the detainees.
At the same time, I would also call upon the EU to decide at its June summit to postpone any signature of the Cotonou Agreement with Cuba until these people have been released.
The EU would be sending out a very poor signal if we were to sign an agreement with a country that, at the same time, is infringing its people's fundamental human rights.
The EU should, moreover, also take steps, on precisely the same grounds, to suspend the trade agreements with Israel.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I will abstain on this resolution.
I see the arrests made in recent weeks as a thank you for our support for Cuba's entry into the ACP, a thank you for Commissioner Nielson's visit two or three weeks ago and for the opening of a Commission office in Cuba.
The dictator, Fidel Castro, has shown us his appreciation.
This resolution, which expresses clear condemnation, does not, however, say what we should do - and Mr Ribeiro e Castro mentioned this - it does not say what the European Union ought to do to put an end to this dictatorship.
It does not suggest suspending the aid provided by the Member States as well as that provided by the Commission or suspending any negotiations on the Cotonou agreements: no specific measure is proposed for putting pressure on the Cuban Government.
It follows that, should the dictator, Fidel Castro, release a prisoner in the coming weeks, it might well be appropriate to produce a resolution to show our appreciation.
In my opinion, we are playing the dictator's game, albeit unintentionally, I realise.
The regime is on its way out, and the large number of detentions is a sign that Fidel Castro has lost control of the situation.
The time has come to give him a shove to help him on his way, proposing to this vile character - for he is truly vile - that he go into exile, so that the country can, at last, be governed by those fighting for democracy.
Mr President, Castro's Cuba has tried to present itself to the world as a model of anti-colonialism and social justice.
In reality hundreds of people died in Cuban prisons in the early years of the revolution, and many more have been imprisoned or had their lives ruined for daring to speak the truth.
Certainly the revolution has had achievements, but the economic, as well as the political, costs have been very high.
The Cuban economy is bankrupt, not because of American sanctions, but because of communism.
What is the advantage of good doctors if there are inadequate medical facilities and resources?
Fidel Castro has failed to understand that the world has changed, and few of us were prepared for the recent crackdown on 33 dissidents, the rushed secret trials and the outrageous call for the death penalty for a Christian Democratic leader.
This is a dramatic step which reduces the chances of Cuba becoming part of Cotonou.
Fidel Castro must learn to respect human rights and introduce democracy.
There is no room for tyrants in Latin America any more.
- (ES) Mr President, we cannot endorse the arrests and trials taking place in Cuba. We certainly condemn them.
Nonetheless, we feel it is wrong to take these events out of the current context within that country. It is unfair and often perverse to do so.
Cuba is the victim of aggression by the United States.
This aggression has been condemned by the international community more times than any other. The blockade has recently acquired a new dimension in the context of President Bush's foreign policy.
The Cuban authorities could well be justified in anticipating the danger of a qualitative change in the aggression they have been subjected to. Given the philosophy of pre-emptive wars which is now the official doctrine of the White House, a military invasion could take place.
It is therefore understandable that the Cuban Government and of course a large part of the Cuban population should respond with defence mechanisms appropriate to a war situation.
We are not surprised these responses are sometimes disproportionate or unjust. We are however saddened by them.
It will be difficult to convince Cubans that they are not justified in acting as they do. The virtual state of war Cuba has been in for years has suddenly become all too real.
It is every bit as real as the Iraq war.
It will be even more difficult to convince Cubans to change if the increasing provocation instigated by Mr Cason, who is in charge of the interests of the United States in Cuba, is not condemned whilst Cubans are criticised.
Piracy and terrorism must be condemned too. I refer to the recent hijacking of two aircraft and a passenger vessel.
We consider ourselves friends of the Cuban people.
We understand them and are in solidarity with them.
We therefore feel we are in a position to appeal to them for moderation and generosity.
At the same time we would denounce the situation outlined earlier, and commit the European Union to developing cooperation with Cuba.
Regarding the resolution before us, I agree in general with the little it does say. Nonetheless, I disagree with all it does not say.
I also believe it contains serious untruths.
These detract from its credibility.
For instance, there are statements concerning requests for the death penalty. In my view, this is a text ridden with errors and omissions.
It is unbalanced and therefore not useful. These are the reasons why I shall not vote in its favour, Mr President.
Mr President, I wish to begin my reply, on behalf of the Commission, by saying that the Commission is seriously concerned about the recent detentions and trials of journalists and opposition supporters by the Cuban authorities.
The European Union has made a declaration strongly condemning those measures.
That was followed by a dÃ©marche of the troika in Havana on 26 March 2003 in which the Commission participated.
The grave concern which was felt was highlighted in the European Union's statement on human rights in the world at the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva last week.
The statement called for the prompt release of those whom the Union considers to be prisoners of opinion.
The human rights situation is and will remain an important aspect of our relationship with Cuba.
The European Commission believes that a policy of dialogue is the most effective way to help bring about a positive evolution in this respect.
In order to facilitate a peaceful transition, the European Union follows, under the common position, a policy of 'constructive engagement' with Cuba.
The EU common position distances itself from the use of coercive measures which might increase the hardship of the people of Cuba.
Instead, it gives priority to a constructive dialogue with the Cuban authorities and civil society.
In a nutshell: the European Union is of the firm conviction that a policy of constructive dialogue has more chance of success than one of isolation and embargoes.
As far as Cuba's request for accession to the Cotonou Agreement is concerned, that could provide a good framework to continue and deepen a meaningful dialogue with the Cuban authorities, in particular in the field of human rights.
Respect for human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law are essential elements of that agreement.
The Commission is therefore preparing a communication on that subject, in which it will present a full assessment of the situation, including an assessment of the most propitious timing for Cuban accession to the Cotonou Agreement.
This is my response on behalf of the Commission, and, in particular, of my colleague Mr Nielson.
Mr President, I should like to say that I am very unhappy with the Commission's reply.
A number of questions were raised, yet we have not even heard the Commission call for those detained to be released. This is what most if not all the political groups in the House would wish.
I would remind the Commissioner that politically, the Commission is not answerable to the Council. It is in fact answerable to this House.
Mr President, I am afraid the Commission does not share the opinion which has been expressed by the honourable Member.
Indeed, the grave concern which the Commission feels was highlighted in the European Union statement on human rights in the world at the United Nations meeting in Geneva last week.
That statement calls for the prompt release of those whom the European Union considers to be prisoners of opinion.
It goes without saying that a prompt release excludes the death penalty or any other kind of penalty.
That is feeling of the Commission and Mr Nielson, in particular.
Thank you, Commissioner Bolkestein.
We are unable to take many supplementary questions today, and so that is the last I shall be allowing today.
By way of clarification, does the Commission consider it conceivable that the European Union will allow Cuba to accede to the Cotonou Agreement as long as the political detainees now sentenced remain in detention?
Mr President, I wish to make a point of order.
I know that Commissioner Bolkestein is not the commissioner responsible for this dossier and I do not, therefore, expect him to give me a definitive answer.
I wish to ask the Commissioner to convey to the Commission and to Commissioner Nielson, in particular, my, indeed our, deep surprise at the explanation that we have been given here.
We are familiar with the policy that had just been drawn up for Cuba.
We are familiar with the policy and our attitude towards Cuba was one of goodwill.
But the dictator Fidel Castro has betrayed this!
He has actually changed the situation and this policy must therefore be changed.
We cannot continue to pursue a policy as if the facts remained the same when they have suddenly changed.
Commissioner Nielson must come before Parliament at his earliest convenience to give an answer on this matter.
Mr President, may I assure Members present this afternoon that I will certainly apprise my colleague, Mr Nielson, of the sentiments which have been expressed by the vast majority of this Parliament.
I will tell him that Parliament takes a very serious view of what is happening in Cuba.
However, may I repeat, my colleague, and the Commission as a whole, shares those views.
The main point at issue at the moment appears to be the matter of the participation of Cuba in the Cotonou Agreement.
Mr van den Bos referred to that possibility and asked whether its participation in the Cotonou Agreement would be possible should serious infringements of human rights in Cuba continue.
As far as the Commission is concerned, it would be difficult to square participation in the Cotonou Agreement with a continuation of the present situation in Cuba.
Therefore, I agree with Mr van den Bos that those two situations are difficult to reconcile.
However, once again, I should like to be allowed sufficient time to hold further discussions with my colleague, Mr Nielson, in order to give a more definite reply.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place following this debate.
WRITTEN EXPLANATION (RULE 120)
While the invaders are slaughtering the Iraqi people, the European Parliament is concerned with 'violations' of human rights in Cuba.
We know how the European Parliament and the European Union interpret human rights from Yugoslavia and elsewhere.
They cite them to achieve political objectives, as is abundantly clear from the resolution on Cuba, the purpose of which is to slander the socialist system of the country, which has given its people the highest standard of living in Latin America.
The motion abides by the 'common position' of the European Union, which makes cooperation with Cuba dependent on changes to the country's political system.
At the same time, the European Parliament turns a blind eye to decades of subversive activity by the USA and the criminal embargo.
It also denies the Cuban people the right to defend their revolution, while openly defending foreign agents and criminals.
We condemn the hypocrisy of the European imperialists and their partners but we understand their concern.
Socialist Cuba is a thorn in their side.
However, we cannot but condemn certain 'lefties' who have no hesitation in joining forces with the reactionaries, so that they do not appear to be lagging behind in supposedly defending human rights.
The next item is the debate on the following five motions for resolutions:
B5-0212/2003 by Baroness Ludford and others, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal and Democratic Party, on human rights violations in Egypt;
B5-0215/2003 by Mr Cashman and others, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on human rights violations in Egypt;
B5-0216/2003 by Mr SacrÃ©deus and Mr Posselt, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, on human rights in Egypt;
B5-0219/2003 by Mrs Boumediene-Thiery and Mrs Flautre, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/Free European Alliance, on human rights in Egypt;
B5-0224/2003 by Mr Vinci and others, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the United European Left/Nordic Green Left, on human rights violations in Egypt.
Mr President, last month 21 homosexual Egyptians were sentenced to three years' imprisonment and forced labour because of their sexual inclination.
They were part of a group of 52 homosexuals arrested in Cairo last year.
On 16 January of this year Wissam Toufic Abyad was arrested and later sentenced to 15 months' imprisonment for 'repeated licentious behaviour'.
These events are no isolated incidents.
They are part of a growing and above all alarming trend that is characterised by an increase in reports of discrimination, arrests, mistreatment and wrongful convictions of homosexuals.
This trend is all the more disturbing because homosexuality is not illegal in Egypt.
At the same time the Euro-Mediterranean Treaty between the European Union and Egypt is on the point of ratification by both parties.
Article 2 of this treaty requires respect for human rights and democratic principles.
Everything suggests that Egypt is not respecting these principles.
My group in the Parliament has always argued for the promotion of tolerance in the Mediterranean Sea area.
We also recognise the importance of good relations between Egypt and the European Union for the stability and the development of this area.
I therefore very much regret that these relations are coming under pressure because of the repeated violations of human rights by the Egyptian authorities.
I am however delighted by the release of human rights activist Saad Eddin Ibrahim, but wish to add immediately that things cannot stop at this individual case.
The Egyptian authorities must keep working on greater respect for human rights in their country, the persecution of homosexuals because of their sexual inclination must come to an end and their individual freedoms must be protected.
I therefore make an urgent appeal to the Council and the Commission to develop programmes in the framework of the European initiative for democracy and human rights that are aimed at strengthening democracy in Egypt.
I urge our fellow MEPs in the Delegation for relations with the Mashreq countries to broach the human rights issue in Egypt at their next meeting with Egyptian parliamentarians and also to involve representatives of the social midfield in this process.
Should these steps prove to be of no avail, Mr President, then I would plead for a postponement of the ratification of the Euro-Mediterranean Treaty.
Mr President, in relation to the previous debate I am not interested in clear replies from the Commission.
I want clear replies from the governments who are actually indicted in these resolutions before this House this afternoon.
If these governments, including the Egyptian Government, do not take human rights seriously then we must take further action, if necessary suspending any agreements that we have with them.
The appalling onslaught against minorities in Egypt is terrifying to behold.
People are being entrapped on the Internet because of their homosexuality.
Let me refer to one individual, because this is what human rights are about: the rights of individuals.
We in this House standing here, talking, debating, take everything for granted, yet these people, because of their difference, have everything robbed from them.
Do we listen?
No.
Some of us talk on, whilst others call for tolerance.
A young man, Wissam Abyad, was entrapped on the Internet.
He went with a friend to meet a supposed gay man.
He was arrested, along with his friend.
He is now in prison.
He is awaiting appeal.
I call for his sentence to be suspended immediately, because that is this man's only way out.
The cases of two more men out of the 52 who were arrested over a year ago were not reviewed.
They are undergoing not forced labour, but hard labour.
As to the three British men awaiting trial in Egypt and the allegations of torture that they have made, have their cases been independently investigated?
Of course not.
I say this to Egypt, and I say it as a friend: the litmus test of any civilised society is how it treats its minorities.
It is for Egypt to show us here in this House, that it takes the rights of their minorities seriously, to call for an end to discrimination against those minorities and to release from prison and end immediately the investigations and the arrests of gay men throughout Egypt which worry us here in this House.
Mr President, we Christian Democrats really wish to emphasise the importance of Egypt and of relations between Egypt and the EU for stability and development in the Mediterranean region.
Like previous speakers, we wish to emphasise respect for human rights, especially freedom of information, expression and association.
These are fundamental values included in the association agreement between the EU and Egypt.
What is happening in Egypt at present is therefore beyond the pale.
We believe it is time to stop persecuting people because of their sexual orientation.
People must, moreover, be able freely to express their opinions and values in demonstrations.
We are also concerned here with the status of religious freedom in a country in which 12% to 15% of the population belongs to the Christian Coptic minority.
The common resolution from all our political groups demands that the minority Coptic Christian group be fully respected and represented in Egyptian society.
Allow me to quote some examples of the ways in which they are not so respected and represented. Different regulations apply to restoring and constructing churches as distinct from mosques.
The regulations governing churches are very complicated and long-winded.
Coptic Christians are not represented at all within the police, higher education and the security service.
School books still use terms such as 'unbelievers' to describe both Jews and Christians.
Other examples are the murders of two Christians in 1998 in the El-Kosheh community - crimes which the local Christian population does not consider to have been solved equitably.
Relations with Egypt are fundamental to the Mediterranean region and the EU, but they must be based upon respect for human rights.
Mr President, I think that this afternoon's debates suggest a very important responsibility to us.
Egypt is a densely populated and important country in the Arab world and we want to conclude an association agreement with Egypt.
Yet Article 2 of that association agreement expressly includes a clause requiring the observance of human rights and democratic principles.
We ought to develop tools that can be used to promote the implementation of this Article in practice.
After all, there is an atmosphere of all or nothing prevailing here and that is not of course the right way to promote a good dialogue.
Let us not forget that Charles Dickens too was imprisoned for homosexuality in nineteenth-century England.
Evolution is possible therefore.
But here we clearly have a case of three kinds of human rights violations.
First of all, I would like to associate myself with the protest against the human rights violations in respect of homosexuals, because the free consent of adults in their sexual relations with one another cannot be prosecuted in any civilised country and is even permitted by the Egyptians by law.
Why should these drastic charges be brought over and over again? Making intimidation attempts with the use of private information by way of telephone, Internet, etc.?
A second series of violations concerns those in respect of the Coptic church, one of the oldest cultural communities and a minority in Egypt.
And thirdly I would like to underline that we have all been witness to the serious violations of human rights during the marches for peace in Iraq.
We were amazed at the violent way in which the police opposed them.
I therefore ask the European Commission to consider carefully how use can be made of that Article 2 on the signing of the association agreement not only to denounce the practices condemned here, but also to bring about their cessation.
Mr President, the international agreement on civil and political rights is very clear regarding relationships between adults. Relationships may be of whatever kind they deem appropriate.
We are therefore distressed that fifteen homosexuals have received three-year prison sentences in Egypt. Another 29 individuals were effectively cleared, however.
In addition, under the provisions of the state of emergency, many people have been arrested recently in connection with anti-war demonstrations.
Kostas Kastanias, the Greek citizen, is still in poor health. I remember the Spanish Presidency called for him at least to be transferred to Greece.
There is one piece of good news, however. This is the decision by the Egyptian Appeal Court to annul the judgment on Saad Eddin Ibrahim and exonerate him.
We had already referred to this individual in the House. He is a human rights defender.
Mr President, in view of the Association Agreement with Egypt, I believe the European Commission and the European Union should bring pressure to bear to ensure there is no repetition of such incidents.
Mr President, 'Egypt: where everyone wears a smile' is the slogan advertising Egypt to the world.
There are no smiles on the faces of the gay men and boys of Egypt who have been harassed and their homes raided, and who have been entrapped via the Internet on trumped-up charges.
There is no smile on the face of Wissam Abyad, in prison and badly treated since January, after just one meeting.
There is no smile on the face of Zaki 'Abd al-Malak.
There is no smile on the faces of the 21 Egyptians from the infamous 'Queen's Boat' discotheque trial, whose sentences have been increased on appeal to three years' imprisonment and forced labour.
There is no smile on the faces of those anti-war demonstrators who were arrested on 20 March in Cairo and reportedly tortured.
There is no smile, as we have heard, on the members of Coptic Church in Egypt persecuted for their faith.
Egypt has contributed so much to our civilisation, we must urge it now to follow a civilised path on these issues.
You do not have to agree with other people's beliefs, their political opinions, and their sexual preferences.
You do, if you believe in the fundamental principles of democracy, have to defend their right to believe, their right to hold opinions, their right to choose their personal lifestyles.
Those are the principles this Parliament must uphold.
Mr President, yet another resolution on Egypt.
Do you think that this time our voice will reach the ears of its rulers?
Because so far they have made a point of ignoring us.
The second trial of 50 men accused of homosexuality on 15 March and the sentencing of 21 of them to even harsher punishment demonstrates in the most dramatic fashion that this country has absolutely no respect for fundamental freedoms, for human rights or for privacy.
The prisoners include a Greek citizen, Kostas Kastanias, who has serious health problems.
Unfortunately, the Egyptian Government is refusing to move him to Greece.
Finally, Egypt has no respect either for international conventions or for agreements with the European Union or even for its own laws, under which homosexuality is not a crime.
It makes one wonder who is ruling Egypt?
Does the rule of law exist or is the unofficial Islamic fundamentalist government in charge?
Who does the European Union ultimately conclude agreements with, Commissioner?
Do you have plans to finally do something about these matters?
How do you intend to use the force and influence of the European Union to make Egypt respect fundamental freedoms and immediately release these people who have been wrongly imprisoned?
Mr President, I would like to start by thanking the European Commission for its work, which has led to an improvement in the situation of Professor Saad Eddin Ibrahim, whose release Parliament had called for.
Thanks precisely to the intervention of the European Commission, this goal has been achieved.
We hope that the same patience and drive will be invested in the resolution of this case too.
Almost everything has already been said, but perhaps there is something we have overlooked: it is completely unacceptable for the democratic clause laid down in the various agreements with third countries not to be observed to the letter.
I would like to make it clear to the House and to the Commission that the increasing use of European taxpayers' money to serve the interests of dictatorships and finance violations of human rights, at the same time erasing any hope these countries might have of freedom and democracy, is totally unacceptable.
This is the acid test: we have to decide whether these debates are destined never to have any effect outside our archives or whether we want, once and for all, to take that leap forwards and make a clear, definitive political decision.
Mr President, I thank you once more for the fact that you have given me the floor on this important subject.
The draft resolutions to be discussed today seem largely prompted by the recent reconviction of 21 Egyptian men for 'debauchery'.
It is therefore with this issue that I shall start.
The Commission has followed the 'Queen Boat' affair since the arrest in May 2001 of 52 men under laws to control prostitution.
We were concerned by the nature of the charges; the use of security courts and national security legislation; the allegations of police harassment and entrapment; and the severe sentences that were meted out.
The inflammatory language at the trial and in the media undermine Egyptian claims that the men were not charged for their sexual orientation.
We were encouraged when President Mubarak subsequently ruled that the case should be retried in a misdemeanour court.
But the conduct and outcome of the second trial were unexpected since the 21 men previously sentenced were re-sentenced to the maximum sentence of 3 years.
The 21 men have appealed and an appeal verdict is provisionally expected on 4 June.
Homosexuality remains a sensitive issue for Egyptian society.
But that does not mean that the Commission will condone the harassment and prosecution of people for their sexual orientation, or any measures that deprive them of their normal rights.
The Commission will continue to monitor this and other similar prosecutions and has frequently communicated its concerns to the Egyptian authorities.
I will now pass to other issues raised.
We welcome the release of democracy activist Saad Ibrahim and share the satisfaction of all true friends of Egypt that this long-running saga is over.
Justice in the best Egyptian judicial traditions has now been done, and has been seen to be done.
We note allegations of excessive force used against Egyptian anti-Iraq war demonstrators, but emotions and tempers at such events run high and the Egyptian Government has a legitimate concern to preserve public order at such a sensitive time.
It is a rapidly evolving situation.
But public order should not be maintained at the expense of freedom of expression or of peaceful assembly.
The European Parliament has expressed concern for the Egyptian Copts on several occasions and will know that the Commission continues to monitor the judicial aftermath of the events in el Khosheh in 1998 and in 1999/2000.
Many commentators regret the recent extension of the state of emergency that has been in continuous effect since the early 1980s.
The European Union is concerned at its use at times, and for cases that are difficult to justify.
But we are encouraged that the ruling NDP party has recently proposed radically to limit the scope of the state of emergency and the system of state security courts associated with it.
There are several provisions in the Association Agreement for fundamental breaches by either side of essential elements, one of which is respect for democratic principles and human rights as set out in the Universal Declaration on Human Rights (Article 2).
More importantly, the Association Agreement provides for constructive political dialogue on human rights and related issues.
In conclusion I should like to say to Parliament that Commissioner Patten told the European Parliament at the debate on the EU-Egypt Association Agreement that the Commission shares the European Parliament's concerns but also notes encouraging developments notably: new social legislation on the rights of women; the supervision of elections by the courts; ruling party proposals for ending the state security court system, and rulings by the courts on the constitutionality of contentious legislation.
The Commission continuously monitors Egypt's respect for human rights.
When the Association Agreement comes into force any human rights issue may be raised, and hopefully resolved, by either side at the appropriate Association Council or committee.
The Agreement, ratified here first and ratified on Monday by the Egyptian People's Assembly, will provide both sides with important safeguards and an additional forum to extend human and democratic rights.
Individual cases, such as the 'Queen Boat' case, are considered on a case-by-case basis and in close collaboration with Member States.
The Commission does not hesitate to make its views known to the Egyptian authorities through normal channels or public statements as appropriate.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place now.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Mr President, I wish to make a request to the Bureau.
The resolution on Cuba must be sent to the Sakharov prize winner, Oswaldo PayÃ¡. My request is for the president not simply to transmit a bureaucratic communication, but to send a heartfelt message from the European Parliament to Oswaldo PayÃ¡, conveying all the expressions of solidarity with the victims of Cuban repression that have been heard here in plenary.
That brings the day's business to an end.
I declare this session of the European Parliament adjourned.
(The sitting was closed at 4.30 p.m.)
Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 10 April 2003.
Colleagues, it was with great regret that I learned that Dr Pierre Pradier had died at his home in Biarritz on Friday 29 April at the age of 69.
Dr Bradier was a Member of this Parliament from 1994 to 1998, in the Group of the European Radical Alliance.
As a co-founder and honorary president of MÃ©decins du Monde, this exceptional physician always fought to uphold and represent the values of humanism.
I invite you to rise and observe a minute's silence in memory of our departed colleague.
(The House rose and observed a minute's silence)
Mr President, I would just like to say that there will be a commemoration of the life of Dr Pierre Pradier tomorrow at 3 p.m. in the room reserved for the Verts/ALE Group.
I have been notified by the appropriate authorities in the accession States of the names of 159 observers appointed to the European Parliament.
That full list will be published in the Minutes of today's sitting.
I should like, on behalf of Parliament, to offer a very warm word of welcome to all our observers here today.
On our behalf the political decision to begin our engagements after the signing of the Accession Treaties in Athens is an act of political pre-integration.
I wish you well in your time and your work here in Parliament.
I believe that, both for you and for this House, it provides a very useful learning opportunity through 'learning by doing' with regard to our respective preferences and political interests.
We have here with us today observers from Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia.
This is a moment that we in Parliament have anticipated and worked towards for a long time.
I want to place on record my own gratitude for the active support and assistance of the leaders of all the political groups, and of the Vice-Presidents of Parliament through the work of the Bureau, in bringing us to this point here today.
I also want this afternoon to express our joy in the European Parliament at the result of the most recent of the referendum campaigns held - namely that in Lithuania - where the turnout was exceptional and where the positive vote was exceptionally strong.
That is another powerful reminder, as we work through the referendum campaigns in each State, of the extent of the commitment and the appetite to build one Europe together.
I want to say to the observers that through your work here - especially through the political groups and in the committees - you will now have the opportunity to engage in active discussion on the results of the European Convention; on the debate on emerging common foreign and security policy, including the emergence of defence policy; on future regional and cohesion policies and on agricultural policy.
It is an important opportunity and an exchange from which we can all benefit.
We look forward to working with the observers here and we wish all of you success in your time here with us.
Mr President, regarding Tuesday's agenda, I wanted to make a request, both on behalf of a large number of Members present in the House and on behalf of Aquitaine, Brittany and the Spanish coastal regions, concerning the attitude of IOPCF and the frankly laughable compensation which it has proposed to award us following the Prestige disaster.
Would it be possible to ask the Commission to state its opinion and position on the matter in the context of the debate on the Manders report, which is to take place on Tuesday at 10 a.m?
In answer to your question of whether it is possible to ask the Commission, yes it is.
Let me make that request of the Commission to see whether, in addition to the debate on the Manders report, it could respond to your question by way of a statement.
Mr President, I should like to point out that I share Mr BÃ©bÃ©ar's indignation.
The FIPOL amounts are, indeed, clearly inadequate, as has been shown in this case.
Tomorrow, it will be my colleague, Mrs WallstrÃ¶m, who will be responsible for replying to you.
I would nonetheless point out to you that we are working within the International Maritime Organisation to increase the figure concerned, which at present is absolutely ridiculous, to EUR 1 000 million.
Tomorrow, my colleague, Mrs WallstrÃ¶m, will reply to you in more detail, however.
Mr President, as you have just announced, the Conference of Presidents has not complied with the request that we made of it.
I would like to use this opportunity to again briefly explain to the plenary why it is, in our opinion, that we should not have a debate without Parliament's opinion being expressed.
Now that the hostilities are over, it is clear how things stand in Iraq, and this makes it possible for this House not only to have a debate on the situation there, but also to frame a resolution stating the position this House takes in the light of what is actually happening in Iraq.
The Conference of Presidents gave me the impression that there is some degree of fear, particularly among the members of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, that Parliament could again end up in the position it was in last time and be unable to adopt a resolution.
I do not want to enlarge on the reasons for this, as I would then have to address a certain person to my right, but perhaps, given a little goodwill on the part of all the groups involved, we now have the chance to put together a resolution that would indeed express not only the consensus in this House, but also the stance of the European Union, or could define Parliament's demand that the European Union's position be expressed through a Common Foreign and Security Policy, which is again possible and necessary.
Our group therefore asks that the debate be accompanied by the text of a resolution.
Mr President, the Conference of Presidents decided, by means of a vote, that this debate would not be followed by a resolution. The reasons for this are very clear.
Following the dismal role played by the European Union in the Iraq crisis, we think that this is not the moment either to deepen divisions or to ascribe blame to anyone. Instead, it is a time for finding a common will and forging a consensus in order to enable the European project to move forward following the pitiful spectacle offered by this Parliament at its last plenary session when we were incapable of agreeing upon a resolution.
We are very keen in Parliament on beavering away at putting the world to rights and demanding of the Council of Ministers that it have the ability to speak with a single voice on the international stage, but we are incapable of agreeing upon a resolution.
My group is therefore in favour of a debate and of statements by the Council and the Commission, but not in favour of a resolution, at least until such time as this Parliament is capable of agreeing upon a resolution.
Mr President, this is about Wednesday. I cannot find on Wednesday's agenda any vote on the calendar of part-sessions.
In the last part-session, we had a vote on an illegal calendar, and I wanted to ask you why this vote is not being repeated.
It is the case that a number of Members are considering appealing against this decision.
As we have a deadline to keep to, I wanted to ask when a lawful vote on our calendar of part-sessions is to take place.
Mr President, in connection with the question submitted on postal services, I should like to say on behalf of the European People's Party that we are opposed to the inclusion of this question on the agenda for the following reason: the arrangement which the Commission promised to put in place, by which I mean the division between reserve and non-reserve activities in the same legal entity, basically concerns one Member State and the two existing directives therefore contain an authorisation in relation to postal services.
No legislative procedure is therefore required.
This is a question of compliance by just one Member State with existing postal arrangements.
Procedure 86.3, which the honourable Members criticise, is in our view perfectly legal.
We therefore consider the question to be superfluous.
Mr President, I would like to inform the House that the Conference of Presidents unanimously decided to include Mr Herman Schmid's report on employment guidelines in the agenda for Thursday morning, provided, of course, that it is adopted by the relevant committee this evening.
Let me confirm that is so, pending its adoption by the committee.
Mr President, thank you for allowing me to speak briefly on the subject of your statement on Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen's mandate. Mr Le Pen has been a Member of this House for almost 20 years.
I have to say, Mr President, that I regret the decision you have taken, for a number of reasons.
Firstly, the judgment you referred to is not final - as you said, moreover - it is likely to be appealed against, indeed it was appealed against last Friday, and I therefore feel that it might have been better for Parliament not to act immediately on a judgment of the Court of First Instance which is not final.
Secondly, as is clear from your own statement, Mr President, and nobody would dispute this, Jean-Marie Le Pen was a Member of the European Parliament until 10 April 2003 pursuant to a judgment of the President of the Court of First Instance of the European Communities.
For him no longer to be a Member of the European Parliament, it is necessary to reestablish the disqualification from holding office imposed by the French Government, a disqualification based on ineligibility for office which came to an end two and a half years ago.
Since 24 November 2000, Mr Le Pen has enjoyed full civic rights once again, as, moreover, was shown by his candidacy for the French Presidential elections, to which there was no objection.
I therefore believe that, in this judicial proceeding, Parliament should not be opposed to Jean-Marie Le Pen but stand by him, whatever one might think of his political views, for, in the future, any Member might fall victim to persecution from a government and might be forced to relinquish their office by a mere government decision.
I am surprised that even minimal evaluation by Parliament of these decisions is not possible.
For these reasons, Mr President, and for others relating to the breach of provisions of internal French law, specifically the French penal code, and to the application of older texts, specifically the 1977 act, which, in my opinion, is completely inapplicable in this case since it relates to a period when Members of the European Parliament were not elected by direct universal suffrage but were members of national parliaments, I believe that this complex issue should have been, and still ought to be, referred to the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, which is the only committee currently competent in matters of verification of credentials, pursuant to Rule 7 of the Rules of Procedure.
Mr Gollnisch, it was important to give you the opportunity to place on the record your point of view, with which I am indeed familiar in the light of earlier exchanges of views.
As President of the House I have a duty to individual Members.
Having your view on the record today I hope will show that various interpretations are possible: you have offered one.
I also feel I have a duty to the institution.
I am advised that in law, and in complying with the ruling, I am acting in the correct way.
I wish to assure you that should it be the case, in the light of appeals, that the courts instruct Parliament to act in any particular way, we will, in law, always respect what is required of us.
Mr President, as steps are being taken in the Middle East with the road map towards peace, I would like to draw the attention of the House to the welcome steps being made towards the same process in Kashmir and the recent steps taken by the governments of India and Pakistan in this regard.
Noting, though, the visit of Richard Armitage, the US Deputy Secretary of State, to that area, I would like to call on you to urge the institutions of the Union to become involved in this process too, just as we are in the Middle East through the quartet - perhaps we can invent something of a similar kind for Kashmir.
Above all, the Kashmiri people should be involved in this process.
Lastly I would like to draw your attention to the fact that this issue was addressed in the Conference of Presidents a few months ago when, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, it was suggested that an ad hoc delegation should go to Afghanistan.
That suggestion was approved, but no delegation was approved for Kashmir.
Could I ask you please to put that back on the agenda of the Conference of Presidents this week, so that we can take a decision and also have an ad hoc delegation to Kashmir.
Mr Elles, it might also be useful to invite your group and the other groups to assist in putting the item on the agenda for the Conference of Presidents.
Mr President, in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, two tribes, the Lendu and the Hema, are in conflict with each other.
Hundreds have already been killed, and thousands are fleeing.
Since the Ugandan army left the region, the MONUC is on the scene, but its combat forces number scarcely 625 troops as against 25 000 combatants.
There are not enough MONUC soldiers.
In addition, even Mr Mbeki is of the opinion that their mandate must be strengthened, because they do not have a mandate that permits them to use force to stop the violence.
Thus the violence continues to increase.
The Security Council should now speak out about this.
It is not even possible to help those who have fallen victim to this mass slaughter, as the security conditions do not permit this; and the international organisations have had to withdraw.
I would ask that you, in your role as President of the European Parliament, urge the Security Council to do what is necessary in order that we do not see the same thing happening here as we did in Rwanda, with genocide taking place before the eyes of the UN simply because we do not have a mandate and because we are not providing the necessary means to stop the violence.
Mr President, I want to draw attention to the fact that there are 25 000 people in the European Union dying every year from a disease which, if it is caught in time, is largely curable.
I am talking about breast cancer.
I would like to welcome the Commission's initiative to urge Member States to introduce best practice with regard to breast-cancer screening.
It is a matter of some regret to me that the death rate in Ireland is something over two and a half times the EU average per thousand of population.
Less than half of the population in Ireland has public breast-screening services available.
I am sure Ireland is not alone in this.
I would urge the Commission to include in the recommendation targets for Member States to meet and also annual reports on the meeting of those targets.
At the very least, we should name and shame those States that are failing to invest in health services that can save lives if they are properly applied.
Mr President, last week, the former governor of the Colombian province of Antioquia, Mr Gaviria, and his peace adviser, Mr Echeverri, with both of whom a delegation from this Parliament had met, were, together with eight other people belonging to the army and the state security services, shamefully assassinated by the guerrilla forces of the Colombian FARC who had been holding them prisoner under cruel conditions.
These events, which have caused an upheaval in the country, again make clear the true criminal character of this organisation - which is still holding the presidential candidate, Ãngrid Betancourt, captive - and make it abundantly clear how wise it was to decide to include it on the European Union's list of terrorist organisations.
I would, for all these reasons, ask you, on behalf of this Assembly, to convey to Colombia's legitimate authorities our solidarity with the victims' families and our active commitment to the cause of peace in that country.
Mr President, I am glad to be able to raise this matter in the presence of the Commissioner for Transport, Mrs de Palacio, because it is scandalous that the French Government obliges us to come to Strasbourg and has exercised political and emotional pressure - some would say blackmail - to keep us here, but fails both to get a TGV line built and, even as owner of Air France, to ensure decent air services to this beautiful but inconveniently located city.
Mr President, I commend you for recently taking up the question of Air France services to Strasbourg from London, as reflected in today's Financial Times.
Thank you.
We face the prospect of cancellation of the direct flights from London Gatwick to Strasbourg from next month by the Air France subsidiary Britair.
I understand Britair is going to court over subsidies to the new competitor Ryanair, which appear to breach state aid rules.
There is a similar case going on in Belgium over Charleroi.
Will you please keep up all possible pressure, perhaps in conjunction with Commissioner de Palacio, to ensure a decent air service as long as we have to remain in Strasbourg once a month, which I hope will not be for very much longer.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I rise to speak on the subject of Cuba.
During the previous part-session, we approved a vote rejecting the wave of repression that the Cuban dictator has unleashed on his people, having imprisoned scores of intellectuals, writers and artists.
The Cuban dictatorship, however, then summarily sentenced three young men to death for having hijacked a boat - an undeniably serious act - in a trial that was summary and harsh, and which provided no guarantees.
This House cannot remain unmoved by this behaviour by the Cuban dictatorship.
This House, which has condemned the existence of the death penalty in various countries across the world and which has condemned all countries enforcing the death penalty, cannot remain unmoved by this irrational and barbaric behaviour by the Cuban dictatorship.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it was on 8 May 1945 that Germany was at last obliged to capitulate.
For six years, Germans had laid waste most of Europe, where millions of people were robbed, imprisoned, transported, starved and killed, and, in the extermination camps, murdered millions of Jews.
We owe the tremendous defeat of the Germans not to the troops of the Western Allies alone, but primarily to the people of the Soviet Union.
The Second World War claimed the lives of 20 million Soviet citizens, who served with the Red Army, starved in the siege of Leningrad, and were forced to labour as slaves.
It was the Red Army that liberated the extermination camps.
Today we are denying their grandchildren access to Europe, and Kaliningrad, intended as territorial compensation for the German internecine war, is separated from Russia.
That is disgusting and shameful.
I would ask you to remember with a minute's silence all those people who died in the war against Fascism, especially the soldiers of the Red Army and hence all those who made today's Europe possible in the first place.
Mr President, this morning the press tells us that you complained that you had to get up at 4 a.m. in order to get to Strasbourg to do business here.
I do hope you think it is worthwhile getting up that early.
I would like to know on behalf of my colleagues who have just taken the memorial last flight from London Gatwick to Strasbourg what you are doing about this situation?
Baroness Ludford has already raised this matter.
You have no doubt been in touch with the mayor of Strasbourg; many of us have written to the Mayor of Strasbourg.
If Strasbourg is to be taken seriously as a place where the European Parliament does business, and welcomes not only Members from that Parliament and new Members but also business people and the press of the world, then it has to do something about the flights to Strasbourg from London.
What is happening?
Will we in fact find ourselves on the memorial last flight from Strasbourg to London on Thursday?
If so, that is very sad, not least for Strasbourg itself, which has absolutely no hope of getting the backing of any British Members in its future role as one of the places where the European Parliament meets.
Regarding my own departure times, the answer to your question is: yes, if I am doing my duty it is always worth getting up on time.
Regarding your question on correspondence, immediately on learning of the prospect that the service to which you refer would eventually be cancelled I wrote to the French authorities in appropriate terms and I am awaiting a response.
That is all I can tell you.
I can tell you the facts of the matter.
You are welcome to have a copy of my correspondence and indeed a copy of any response that I eventually receive.
Mr President, recently, along with other passengers, I was kept on board a flight from London to Brussels for two hours after landing at Brussels, because of the presence on that flight of a Chinese gentleman travelling from Toronto who was quite clearly rather ill and was suspected of having SARS.
During our two hours on board, it was clear to us that neither the Belgian health authorities nor the airline concerned, British Midland, had the faintest idea what to do in such an eventuality.
I am glad to be able to tell you the person tested negative.
However, I would be grateful, in case similar incidents should occur, which they undoubtedly will, if you could contact both the Commission and the Council of Ministers, representing the Member States, so that appropriate measures can be put in place and so that both airlines and national health authorities know what to do if someone they suspect of being gravely ill is on board one of their planes.
I should like to remind the House that a debate on this issue is scheduled for tomorrow and will perhaps afford an opportunity for the House and for colleagues to make that point.
Mr President, a fortnight ago our only national institution, Udalbitza, was banned and eight of its leaders imprisoned.
Last Saturday, the day before yesterday, tens of thousands of people were in the streets of Bilbao, taking part in a march that was also forbidden, to back Udalbitza's efforts to develop a democratic process grounded on the free will of the Basque people.
Udalbitza has enhanced the national construction of our country, favouring local representatives' joint action in fields such as culture, the environment, social welfare, economic development, land organisation, sports and, of course, the promotion of the Basque language.
More than eighty thousand people have given their signatures to guarantee the presence of those local candidates and the growth of self-determination in the elections this month.
The Spanish judiciary has banned them too.
Can anyone say what the European Union is waiting for before it reacts?
Mr President, Mr Gorostiaga insists on blaming the Spanish Government for making his party illegal.
It would appear that internal documents even go so far as also to hold Members of the European Parliament, including myself, responsible when this was a decision taken unanimously by the Spanish Supreme Court.
Those who maintain this either misunderstand the nature of the constitutional State, one of whose basic principles is the separation of powers, are ignorant of it or, at best, simply reject it.
I would take the liberty of reading out a paragraph from a document that I shall forward to the Members of this Parliament, that has been signed by a range of European intellectuals and that concludes with words to the effect that, even if there is a frequent temptation to ignore what is happening, European citizens are asked, on 25 May - the date of the Spanish local elections - generally to declare their mood of anger in memory of the victims who have died for freedom in the Basque Country and in honour of those who, this very day, defend it with a courage that, in the not too distant future, will stir Europe.
This document has been signed by, amongst others, Nadine Gordimer, GÃŒnter Grass, Bernard-Henri LÃ©vy, Paul Preston, Mario Vargas Llosa and our fellow MEP, Mr Vattimo.
In short, dangerous right-wing extremists, as Mr Gorostiaga would say.
Mr President, I too should like to express my deepest satisfaction that observers from the new Member States of the European Parliament will be participating in plenary as of today.
Allow me, however, as chairman of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, to express my deepest disappointment as to the composition of these representations from the gender point of view.
Women are underrepresented and, as can be seen from the list you have distributed to us, there are two countries - Estonia and Slovenia - which have not included a single woman in their representations.
I consider that this is an insult to women, who are not represented in the representations of the Member States, and shows disdain for the policy of gender equality which the European Union has been promoting for 50 years.
I only hope that this will not happen at the next European elections and that the representations will be balanced from the gender point of view.
As I know, Mr President, that you support this policy, I should like you to take an initiative and bring this to the attention of your counterparts in the parliaments of these countries.
The only requirement that Parliament stated in its invitation to send observers was that the numbers sent should reasonably reflect the balance within the national parliaments themselves.
There were no other conditions.
I note the point you make, but I should like to point out that a week ago in Brussels we had a meeting of the speakers of the national parliaments: the speaker from Estonia is a woman and the Estonian Foreign Minister is also a woman, so the gender balance may be better than it appears on the list of observers submitted.
Mr President, the multinational Siser has announced that it is to shut its factory in Athens immediately, throwing into the street 500 workers who, for years, have worked in inhumane conditions securing it fat profits.
It is doing so in order to move its factory to Bulgaria or Asia, so that it can be more competitive and more productive.
However, this factory increased its profits by 83% in 2002, compared with 2001, and received a fat subsidy from the Greek Government.
The decision by this multinational comes on top of similar decisions by other multinationals, which have closed down production units in Greece in order to locate to countries with much lower wage costs and conditions in general which allow for more intensive exploitation of the workers.
Not only does the European Union do nothing to prevent decisions and actions such as these by big business; on the contrary, they are encouraged and funded from national and Community resources.
This is blatant proof that this European Union policy, however embellished with proclamations of Community sensitivity, holds only one thing sacred: to safeguard maximum possible profits for big business and, of course, to achieve them through acute exploitation of the workers.
We condemn the stated policy of economic and political penetration of the European Union, which is causing the redundancy of thousands of workers in the Member States of the European Union and the overexploitation of the workers in the countries to which these businesses relocate.
I hope you will join with myself and James Elles and the other members of the all-party Kashmir Group in welcoming the renewed dialogue between India and Pakistan over the disputed territory of Kashmir.
As everyone in this House knows, relations between India and Pakistan have been very difficult over the last few months, and since both countries are nuclear powers it is very important for this dialogue to be successful.
I would reiterate the points made by James Elles as regards the Kashmiri people being involved in this dialogue at the earliest possible convenience and as regards ensuring that the European Union continues to offer its services as an honest broker, as agreed under the common foreign and security policy - if, that is, both India and Pakistan feel it necessary to take advantage of that offer.
Mr President, I should like to draw attention to the way in which the Danish Government and a number of Danish parties are at present genuinely trying to harass Development Commissioner Poul Nilsson.
This is happening in the light of the fact that, after having visited Iraq, he has set out a number of facts, namely that Iraq is an occupied country, that this situation will be untenable if the occupying power is not replaced by a UN force and that the United States has, to all appearances, appropriated the Iraqi people's oil.
I should like to ask you, Commissioner, whether or not you share my admiration for a man who dares to call a spade a spade and who has the courage of his convictions. Do you not think that this attempt to muzzle the Commissioner is unacceptable?
Mr President, since Parliament has, unfortunately, rejected our proposal to include an item on Guinea-Bissau in the topical and urgent debate, I wish to take this opportunity simply to draw my fellow Members' attention to the deterioration of the situation in that country, which is undergoing an almost total breakdown, and to call on Parliament - which I know has been assessing the situation with regard to the elections planned for 6 July - to continue closely to follow these elections and send a mission of observers.
This is extremely important in order to ensure that the people of Guinea-Bissau are given the means to find a democratic solution to the appalling crisis affecting their country.
I should just like to point out that any observer mission in that regard should be based on a proposal from the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy to the Conference of Presidents.
Then it can be dealt with in the usual way.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, last Friday, Parliament was closed on account of the holiday celebrating the day in 1950 when Robert Schuman made his declaration on the establishment of the European Coal and Steel Community.
This is only right, but the fact passes unnoticed in the Union, especially in my country, and I think that something should be done about this.
The best way of increasing citizens' sense of belonging to the Union is to introduce a paid public holiday on that day throughout the Union.
I think that we should make a commitment to a genuine Europe-wide public holiday.
It would be good if this were in place as early as next year, including in the new countries set to join.
Perhaps Parliament - and you, Mr President - could take the initiative on this, by pointing out to the Council that this is an important example of how to get citizens closely involved in the Union.
I point out in that regard that Parliament, in Brussels, had an open day on the weekend before - not on the day itself, but fifteen thousand people visited the premises on that particular day.
However, I know that you are making a wider point.
Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to return to the subject of Columbia.
I believe that we must not hide our extreme concern, for the hostages are currently in a situation of dire peril.
The attempt to retrieve the hostages launched on 5 May by the Columbian President, Mr Uribe, shows that life is no longer worth anything in that part of the world.
The European Parliament has on many occasions displayed its support for and taken steps to help people fighting for human rights and democracy.
In this context, and in order to show that we are not a fickle Parliament but that we are endeavouring to be faithful to our democratic commitments and to the protection of individuals throughout the world, would it be possible to make representations to the government, reminding it that a hard line cannot be the general rule where people's lives are at stake and there are prices to be paid, and that it is therefore appropriate in this case first and foremost to respect the demands of the families, who do not want the government to take a hard line so that it can give a display of its power some time in the future.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as you may be aware, I am the Chairman of the Delegation to the EU-Russia Parliamentary Cooperation Committee.
Over the last year, we have spoken about the situation in Russia on a number of occasions.
In doing so, we have also very specifically spoken about the situation in Chechnya.
We have always approached that situation from a very critical angle.
We have also always said, however, that the conflict in Chechnya must be solved peacefully.
I heard today that there was another attack this morning in the north of Chechnya, when a suicide squad drove a truck into a government building.
More than thirty people are reported dead.
Mr President, I should like to ask you, in your role as President of the European Parliament, to express our condolences to the families of the deceased, and also to the local authorities, whilst emphasising strongly that this House deplores the use of any kind of violence to solve the conflict in Chechnya, and that we wish to take the path of negotiation.
I will be happy to do so, Mr Staes.
(Protests from Mr Ortuondo Larrea)
I am very sorry, but we have exceeded our time limit.
I am not a magician!
You will have to speak tomorrow.
The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0131/2003) by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the Council common position with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council decision on adopting a multiannual programme for action in the field of energy: 'Intelligent Energy - Europe' Programme (2003-2006) (15547/3/2003 - C5-0037/2003 - 2002/0082(COD)) (Rapporteur: Eryl Margaret McNally).
. As rapporteur for the Intelligent Energy for Europe Programme, I would like to thank all three institutions for their cooperation in enabling us to reach successfully a second reading: the European Commission, of course, for coming forward with the proposals, the Council of Ministers and the three presidencies involved in this - the Spanish, Danish and above all the Greek presidencies - and especially the Members of the European Parliament and the staff of the European Parliament.
I am pleased we have been able to find a compromise at second reading between the Parliament and the Council of Ministers by working very quickly and in fact by foregoing the normal full procedure for codecision matters.
This is frankly not the best way to work, and I am sorry that the Council of Ministers is beginning to expect accelerated procedures as the norm.
They are less transparent and less democratic and often lead to temporary misunderstandings, especially when negotiations are conducted - as they inevitably are - in only one language.
The title of this programme is self-explanatory.
We need only imagine the contents of a programme called 'stupid' energy.
In such a programme we would use fossil fuels, which we know to be finite and which emit CO2, as quickly as possible and would burn them just as inefficiently and profligately, in a way which the United States could teach us.
'Stupid' energy would use electricity and gas to heat the air outside buildings rather than insulating the buildings.
It would encourage us to drive more and larger cars at high speeds so that we use more fossil fuels, preferably with only one occupant in each car.
Despite its high economic costs, its failure to deal with radioactive waste and the need for very high safety and security standards, 'stupid' energy would insist on the promulgation of nuclear power, even in countries at very high risk of nuclear weapons proliferation.
Enough about 'stupid' energy.
We currently do some of those things, which makes the current programme even more topical and even more useful.
It is actually a modest programme, with EUR 200 million allocated for four years, which is frankly still inadequate.
I hope that further funding will be made available during the programme, in particular when new Member States join.
The programme has four objectives, all of which are indeed intelligent: the promotion of renewable energy sources, of energy efficiency, of clean transport and of all these three things in developing countries.
All four objectives are important and I congratulate the European Commission on its intention to establish coordinating measures.
I look forward to hearing the Commissioner's declaration, which is a declaration that I made clear was essential if we were to find agreement.
Parliament's amendments to the Council of Ministers' common position encompass the budget - we insisted on an increase to EUR 200 million with a review clause - and numerous clarifications.
I am pleased to say that 22 of Parliament's amendments were accepted in the common position and others have been accepted in subsequent negotiations.
There is an unfortunate omission as regards the need for a strategic agency in the field of energy.
Parliament will pursue that idea in other ways.
The Commission has done well to come forward with this programme.
Its measures will help with protection of the environment, security of supply and with our industrial competitiveness.
It will complement efforts by Member States and will encourage the laggardly Member States to do more.
I will not name them to spare people's blushes.
I am particularly pleased that the COOPENER Programme, which is itself modest, will serve as leverage for much better-funded programmes such as those foreseen in Johannesburg.
Over 2 billion people in the world have no access to electricity.
This programme will help.
One worrying aspect is the difficulty the Commission apparently has with the lead times for its proposals.
These proposals were published so late that it is not going to be possible to commit money to projects until February 2004.
I hope that the Commissioner will undertake a review of the timescale for preparing legislation to prevent problems of this sort, which I am sure are as disappointing to her as they are to us.
Nevertheless, the Intelligent Energy for Europe Programme will be of very real value and I look forward to its adoption following the Commissioner's declaration, and to a vote tomorrow which I hope will be very well supported by a European Parliament that will follow the programme with great interest.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to thank Mrs McNally for her work as rapporteur on this Decision.
I am aware that she has worked intensely with all our colleagues in Parliament and the Council to reach the position we are now dealing with.
I believe it is extremely important that today, and tomorrow at the vote, we can conclude the approval of this programme once and for all.
The present proposal for a European Parliament and Council Decision relates to a multi-annual action programme in the energy sector, to cover the period 2003-2006, and hence the urgency of concluding this debate.
We have four specific fields: the rational use of energy, the management of demand, which previously fell within the SAVE programme; new and renewable energy sources, previously known as ALTENER; transport aspects relating to energy: STEER; and the promotion at international level of renewable energy sources and energy efficiency, known as COOPENER.
Before discussing the amendments, I would like to make a brief comment on an issue which I have noted causes concern in Parliament: the coordination of the programme and its relationship with other Community policies with an energy dimension, particularly in the field covered by the programme.
This has just been pointed out by Mrs McNally, who wishes it to be made absolutely clear.
I would therefore like to say that I share the honourable Members' concern - in particular that of the rapporteur, Mrs McNally - and, in this regard, I believe that the inter-service consultations and cooperation are of great importance and should be common practice.
I have committed myself fully to increasing and improving these interrelationships with regard to the management of our programme.
I am convinced that in this way the execution of actions in the field of energy will be carried out in a way which is coherent with the different Community instruments.
To this end, Mrs McNally, I therefore propose to establish an interservices group, consisting of all those Commission services whose policies and programmes relate to the present programme.
I am essentially talking about the services responsible for development cooperation, agriculture, regional development, the environment and technological research and development.
With regard to the amendments presented by the European Parliament, I am pleased to note that, following the recent discussions with the Council, a compromise has been reached with regard to the amendments which were still awaiting agreement.
I would like to affirm and confirm the Commission's total support for the new text presented by Parliament.
Please allow me therefore, ladies and gentlemen, to congratulate you on behalf of the Commission on the agreement reached with the Council, particularly with regard to the budget for the programme, that is, the famous EUR 200 million, which represent a considerable effort.
As we know, Mrs McNally possibly wanted more.
So did we, but I believe 200 million is a significant sum, which, over four years, represents a very considerable increase in the budgets when compared to what we have been using in the past.
I trust that you will approve the vote recommended by the rapporteur and that a speedy approval of the programme will allow it to be launched without wasting the funds corresponding to 2003; and that there will be a global approval at the end of the year, since we will have made sufficient progress in this regard, and that they will therefore be able to be used, including the funds corresponding to 2003.
I would like to thank Mrs McNally once again for her wonderful work and the honourable Members for their attention.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like at the very outset to join in expressing thanks to Mrs McNally, who, in the Committee on Industry, has handled this topic with a very great deal of prudence.
The discussions with the Committee on Budgets were of particular importance to us, as this is an area where the Committee on Industry considers it very important that programmes such as these should be adequately funded, and I also want to express my gratitude to Commissioner de Palacio for making it possible to include 2003 in these considerations and get these programmes up and running as soon as possible.
We are all aware that the international energy crisis, in particular, means that action is urgently needed.
Europe is dependent on energy imports to a very great degree, with, at present, some 50% of its energy being imported, and we will very soon have to face rates of increase that we find utterly unjustifiable.
That is why it is important that this programme should receive special emphasis.
This multi-annual programme will enable us - or so I hope - to start to turn European energy policy around, and, in particular, the use of energy - a subject on which we have adopted many framework directives already - must be one of our priorities for the future.
It is of course not only the benchmarks - which have recently been constantly improving - that help us to implement this at the national level, but primarily the models of best practice, and this is where the multi-annual programme is an extremely important gauge, enabling us to see in which countries, with which technologies and with which processes, we are achieving the greatest successes.
I therefore believe that this programme sees us taking a great step forward in European energy policy, and so I thank you in advance for your good cooperation.
Thank you very much, Mr President.
Mrs McNally has come up with an interesting idea.
She mentioned intelligent energy, in contrast to stupid energy, which, at times like these, reminds me of oil and of 'stupid white men', the title of a book by an author of whom some of us think very highly and who has won an Oscar.
On the one hand, then, there are the stupid white men following a very definite principle of energy use - old and conservative - and we have an intelligent white woman, Europe and something else.
Of course, there is a lot more to it than this.
I believe that programmes such as this one give us a chance to make progress in formulating what is meant by the European way.
I also think it smart to set up a European Intelligent Energy Agency, which has a chance of becoming what the USA's Environmental Protection Agency was in the early 1970s in the eyes of the rest of the world.
At that time, when there were as yet no Greens and our environmental awareness in Europe was underdeveloped, it was access to information and the EPA's pilot schemes that made the development of exemplary projects possible.
That is something this agency could do here.
Certainly, though, it is also smart to take on board the point that we should not be giving this agency yet another new bureaucratic superstructure, but finding a place for it where capacity already exists.
I believe that intelligent energy also includes intelligent transparency about the use of resources.
This new agency could set an example by really showing how it manages the funds allocated to it, and by the absence of what is a cause of justifiable criticism of the European institutions, by which I mean lack of transparency in the way funds are spent and used, in the knowledge that without transparency, there is no democracy.
Mr President, I would also like to lend my support to those who have signalled their congratulations to Eryl McNally for doing an excellent job in piloting this through Parliament and of course in conducting negotiations on our behalf with the other institutions.
The rapporteur has already covered the main issues of substance, with all of which my group and I entirely agree.
I only wish to make two additional wider points at this stage.
Firstly, Intelligent Europe is not and should not be the title for this programme but, as the rapporteur herself suggested, should of course be the umbrella title for everything we do in the energy policy environment.
As many colleagues know, we are facing a glut of legislation in the energy field today, this week and next week, ranging from combined heat and power through to trans-European networks and to the all-important electricity and gas liberalisation package.
Collectively we hope all of those measures together represent a real, intelligent policy.
If you will forgive me for using this ghastly phrase, they represent a 'joined-up policy, joined-up government'.
To that end the Commissioner's declaration today is very important and much to be welcomed.
The second point is about the budget.
We warmly support the rapporteur's success in raising the overall budget, but it is worth noting that the EUR 200m, which is of course a great deal of money to you and me, is actually extremely little when compared to the enormous range of tasks which the Intelligent Energy programme is supposed to tackle.
EUR 200m could easily be absorbed in any one of the four titles and for that reason alone - and of course this is something we have seen in other areas as well, the trans-European networks for instance - the seed money being put forward by the European Union is massively dwarfed by the tasks to be performed.
For that reason, we really do hope that procedures will be as efficient as possible, will avoid duplication, will avoid unnecessary administrative and bureaucratic checks and will give the taxpayers the right bang for their bucks.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have already had the opportunity - at first reading - to express my views on this important subject and I am therefore pleased to be able to speak again this evening.
I would like to start by personally thanking my friend and colleague, Mrs McNally, for the high quality of her report and for the way she has conducted negotiations with the Council.
I have known her for a long time and I would like to pay tribute to her for her hard work, although I sometimes, or often, rather, disagree with the liberal lines taken by some of her friends.
Also on a personal note, I would like to tell Mrs de Palacio that, although she has never replied to my question on what I consider to be a contradiction between free competition seeking to force prices down and the undeniable need to save energy, I appreciate her work as Commissioner responsible for energy, her indisputable abilities and her willingness to listen.
To turn to the content now, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, I would point out that the 'Intelligent Energy for Europe' programme, covering the period 2003 to 2006, replaces a programme which expired on 31 December 2002. That explains the urgent need for us to come to an agreement and find the best possible compromise.
It is no surprise that the most heated debates were on the question of the budget.
I want once again to lament the fact that, all too often at European level, in very many fields, we are unable to provide ourselves with funding which is commensurate to our goals.
I have said it time and time again in this House and elsewhere.
In this case, it is all the more regrettable in that a mid-term assessment of the current programme has revealed that the current specific programmes have suffered from a serious lack of resources.
In the end, after a number of tripartite meetings, the Council and Parliament succeeded in achieving a compromise of the sum of EUR 200 million, although the Council had been holding out for a sum of EUR 190 million.
It is too little, even though it is better than nothing.
As has been said, the sum will be divided between four specific programmes: energy efficiency, the promotion of renewable energy sources, energy aspects of transport, and the promotion of renewable energies and energy efficiency in the developing countries.
I endorse these headings and I stress the need for action in these areas.
Again with regard to the content, the Council has accepted most of Parliament's amendments: the inclusion of the candidate countries, the dissemination of the programmes and access thereto and the setting of transparent criteria for selecting participants.
We welcome this.
However, the Council has not accepted the creation of a European Intelligent Energy Agency.
I for my part, like the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, regret this.
I think it would have helped us.
Nor has the Council accepted the establishment of a task force within the Commission to coordinate the different areas, but Mrs de Palacio has given us a certain amount of reassurance on that point.
I will end by stressing once again that energy is not just another commodity.
It involves heavy, ongoing investment.
It is in many respects a public service which must be protected zealously in the interest of all citizens in all senses of the word.
In the future, we must save, diversify, increase security of supply and assess costs and benefits, and not just short-term costs and benefits.
We must look far into the future.
Demand will grow and fossil energies will decline.
Public opinion is opposed to fission and so we must develop renewable energies and save energy.
Lastly, and this is my last point, Mr President, we must implement what I personally consider to be the viable energy of the future, fusion, and thus launch very quickly indeed the ITER programme, very quickly indeed, Mr President.
Mr President, the previous energy framework programme terminated at the end of last year.
As the Intelligent Energy for Europe programme that is to replace it is only just now being discussed, we cannot accuse the Commission and the Council of acting too hastily.
The previous programme, however, was a lot later in making its appearance, so there has been some progress, albeit slight.
The new programme includes fewer separate programmes, so that is good.
In fact, resources for the previous framework programme had been chopped up into excessively small bits, and it has not been easy to achieve any visible results.
The administrative costs of having many programmes, the consultants' fees and the various seminars, of which there is no shortage in Europe, eat up resources, with the result that there are fewer left for concrete action.
In the new programme resources are being increased, the overall sums involved will increase and the fact that a five-year programme is being replaced by one lasting four years will mean that additional cash is available each year.
The energy industry, however, is such a capital-intensive sector of production that not even additional funds will solve the problems EU countries have with regard to adequate supplies of energy, the security of supply or energy saving and environmental protection.
The common objectives that have been set, for example regarding the use of renewable forms of energy, are so ambitious that achieving them depends crucially on the Member States.
We cannot leave it just to the ALTENER programme to achieve these goals.
It is being proposed that a new special Agency should be set up to coordinate cooperation in the energy sector.
Experience has shown, however, that agencies do not always reduce bureaucracy - they tend rather to do the opposite - and special agencies are always harder for Parliament to monitor than the Commission is.
Setting up new agencies does not increase administrative transparency.
With regard to the work the rapporteur has done, I would like to join my colleague, Mr Caudron, in expressing my thanks to her on behalf of our group.
I want to thank you for your speeches, ladies and gentlemen, and say that, indeed, the attempt must be made to avoid the 'stupid' energy, to which Mrs McNally and other speakers referred earlier.
Mrs McNally knows that I too subscribe to the theory that the European Agency would have provided a method of administration and would very likely have had many positive features.
I believe, however, that, by means of this intergroup system, or system of organisation within the Commission incorporating all the various services affected, we can overcome your worries.
I also wish briefly to add that I fully concur with what Mr Caudron has said about the launch, as soon as possible, of the ITER initiative, as well as other initiatives.
With regard to the EUR 200 million, I am thinking, for example, of the COOPENER programme through which the most appropriate technologies, including clean carbon technologies, together with energy efficiency and technological development, would be spread throughout the developing countries.
We shall have to return to this subject one day when we talk about Kyoto, because Kyoto does not only affect Europe but addresses a global problem.
If we imagine that developing countries will not make use of coal, we are mistaken. They will in fact make use of coal if that is what is most readily available to them.
That is clear, and that is the direction in which we must move.
I also want to invite you, as a thought for the future, to remember that the Community budget, set this year in anticipation of next year, will involve 0.99% of GDP, there being 25 Member States.
In addition to having just 0.99% of GDP, we shall perform the miracle of being 25 Member States, with 500 more officials.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon.
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0138/2003) by Mr Glante, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the promotion of cogeneration based on a useful heat demand in the internal energy market.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, even the title of this directive indicates that this topic is a relatively complex one.
I just want to try and do something I have done in the past, which is to explain what this is in very simple terms and for the benefit of those not involved in these matters. What we are talking about is the production, by the traditional means of steam, of electricity, which is then supplied for efficient use in industry or for heating.
The promotion of this technology can be seen as being consonant with the objectives - the Kyoto commitments - that we, and many other countries, have set ourselves.
It will help to save energy, to use it efficiently, and to reduce emissions of CO2.
Implementing this technology can also make supplies more secure.
My primary concern, when engaging in these discussions, when voting, and when tabling amendments, has been to shape a directive that will be applicable throughout Europe, at the same level, and with the same ground rules.
This consideration applies in particular to the reference values to be used to define energy savings.
We call upon the Commission to draw up, within an appropriate timeframe, a package of European reference values to facilitate comparisons of implementation in the various Member States.
I saw it as important that there should be greater legal certainty within the European Union, and that the Member States should, on the basis of this directive - assuming that it enters into force after second reading and, perhaps, after a conciliation procedure - have legal certainty and be able to promote this technology.
The report is a highly technical one, and discussing it was a relatively complicated business.
Our discussions were lively, but also very fair, and we were very fair-minded in our dealings with each other.
There was no confrontation between Left and Right of the sort I have previously described, but rather a confrontation between North and South, each being convinced that one method or another was better.
I believe that the compromise we have reached is a sound one.
All of us - myself included - have had to moderate our demands to some extent.
I was not happy with all the compromises, but I accepted them as being what this is all about. At the end of the day, this result, at least in the committee, where there were 32 votes in favour, none against, and 11 abstentions - let me mention at this point that I am to this day unsure how the 11 abstentions came about - has shown that we have come to a sensible compromise.
Including those in my report, we started out with 240 amendments.
Tomorrow, there will be 11 amendments on the table for us to vote on.
I think that is a very fine achievement.
We have done good work, and I can tell you that one or other of the eleven amendments will not get my vote, but, on the whole, what comes out of first reading stage will look very good.
I just hope that the Council will match this by putting a proper political position on the table in May, or by June at the latest. What the Council is currently discussing differs to quite a large extent from what we have been discussing here, so the second reading is guaranteed to be, once more, exciting and highly contentious.
I hope that tomorrow's vote will go well and that we will adopt the report; then I will already be looking forward to the discussions in the course of second reading.
If we all work together properly on that, and if the Council is well disposed, we will manage to get this report adopted by the end of this Parliamentary term - I think, at second reading stage or perhaps after a conciliation procedure - and then legal certainty will have been created.
To that extent, I think, we have been able to improve the Commission proposal by making it more precise, specific and exact, and I hope it will meet with general approval tomorrow.
Mr President, the proposal for a Directive on the promotion of cogeneration, as the rapporteur, Mr Glante, has pointed out, is a truly complex issue.
Furthermore, the debates in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy have demonstrated how diverse the positions are, as have the meetings, hearings and seminars held in recent months in this Parliament, demonstrating the interest which this initiative has awoken in the different sectors of society.
I would like to congratulate the rapporteur because he has been able to bring together and agree a solution with the various Members involved which in the end means that we are only talking about eleven amendments.
Ladies and gentlemen, the creation of a European framework for cogeneration is a great challenge.
I am happy to say that, in my opinion, the proposal for a Directive on the promotion of cogeneration, which we are discussing, conforms to the requirements and furthermore it provides a response at a time when we are talking about integration of the European energy market and in particular the electricity market.
As the rapporteur has pointed out, cogeneration can be an efficient way to produce heat and electricity jointly in a single process, its correct and appropriate use increases the security of supply, it leads to undeniable energy savings and a resulting reduction in greenhouse gases.
But we know that we are facing problems relating to the energy market, since its advantages are not reflected in an equal fashion within the sector.
No legal instrument resolves this problem and the directive creates the framework necessary to guarantee a stable environment for the initiatives to promote cogeneration.
Within that framework, it falls to the States to make a greater effort to promote this process and to increase production, by means of specific measures, in the form of economic support programmes.
They can also facilitate new investment, guarantee more equitable conditions and eliminate administrative and other types of obstacles, but all within an integrated European market.
In accordance with our proposal, the Member States, by means of an analysis of high-efficiency cogeneration potential, are obliged to estimate the expected heat demand in their territory, which is likely to be used appropriately, by means of cogeneration techniques.
This is the first step, which must facilitate future initiatives and monitoring in this field.
