These issues were examined at the IGC meetings which took place in the first half of October.
The Ministerial Meeting of 27Â October expanded the range of the discussion to include matters not addressed, or addressed only marginally, at previous meetings.
In particular, the meeting considered the following themes: the presidency of the Council configurations, the extension of qualified-majority voting, and non-institutional matters, with particular reference to economic and financial provisions.
The debate confirmed that Member States have differing positions and that the proposals in the draft Constitutional Treaty approved by the Convention are essentially well-balanced.
It also became apparent that reopening debate on specific aspects of the draft treaty leads only to the reiteration of conflicting positions, and not to the emergence of new consensus.
The following conclusions may be drawn from the outcome of the meeting.
Firstly, views are gradually converging regarding the future presidency of council formations, although the matter has to be reviewed in the context of a comprehensive proposal covering all the institutional structures of the future enlarged European Union.
The vast majority of the Member States oppose the establishment of a Legislative Council.
The Italian Presidency has taken due note of this opposition, but will to do everything in its power to ensure that the Legislative Council is preserved in the Treaty, at least as an option for the future and thus as a possible development of the Council system.
Secondly, it confirms that Member States still have divergent positions in respect of the scope of qualified majority voting.
In light of this, the Presidency will consider what tools it should adopt to achieve consensus particularly in sensitive, crucial areas such as taxation, own resources, cooperation on criminal justice and police cooperation. In any event, the Conventionâs draft will remain the main basis on which to build a balanced, ambitious agreement.
Thirdly, the obviously excessive number of non-institutional matters raised by Member States was clearly incompatible with the time constraints of the IGC schedule established in Thessaloniki and confirmed in Brussels by the Heads of State or Government.
Accordingly, the Presidency will examine this set of issues using a selective approach, and identify those areas around which a consensus seems to be forming which is different from the line taken in the Conventionâs draft, and the areas which require technical and editorial clarification.
It will then be up to Member States to decide whether to insist on specific, minority points, and, if necessary, to bring them to the attention of Heads of State or Government.
On the basis of the Conventionâs draft and on the work of the Foreign Ministers, the Presidency will draw up a comprehensive proposal centred on the institutional package and the question of defence. The proposal will attempt to consider the demands of both acceding and candidate states.
The point of departure for the proposal, however, will still be the Conventionâs draft, and it will seek to achieve compromises that are at least as ambitious and worthy as those put forward by the Convention.
We are willing to consider possible adjustments but remain resolutely opposed to undermining and retreat.
In all probability, the future of the European Constitution depends on the outcome of these negotiations.
Therefore, and in view of the high stakes, all parties should adopt a flexible approach to the task of laying the foundations for the European Union of the twenty-first century.
We must abandon parochial concerns and move away from the idea of getting a fair return, whereby every single concession must be matched by a gain of equal import.
This approach is or rather, would be contrary to the very concept of European integration, and, if applied systematically, would be in danger of undermining the foundations of the Union.
Although fairness is a prerequisite for any constitutional agreement, no one must stop the current process of integration.
Those who decide to act in this way will have to be prepared to be judged by history, by their European partners and, above all, by their citizens.
The approval of the new Constitution will be a success for everyone or a failure for the Union.
There can be no substantial conflict between national and European interests.
Â Â  . Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, in this debate entitled âprogress reportâ on the Intergovernmental ConferenceÂ âÂ with the emphasis on the word âprogressâÂ âÂ I have to say, quite frankly, that the Commission is concerned.
On 24 September 2003, I expressed the hope before this House that the Conference would bring progress, that it would be able to adjust and enhance some points, clarify others and evaluate the draft Constitution on which we have all workedÂ âÂ and worked well, I feelÂ âÂ in the context of the Convention.
I want to tell you that the evaluation process is making headway under the guidance of Mr Jean-Claude Piris in the Council, with the participation of Parliamentâs and the Commissionâs legal services.
On the political side of things, quite frankly, the proceedings of the Intergovernmental Conference have not, however, to date brought any progress at all.
On the contrary, today, my impression, the impression of my friend and colleague, Mr Vitorino, and, doubtless, the impression of your own representatives, Mr HÃ€nsch and Mr Mendez de Vigo, is that this Intergovernmental Conference could lead to climbdowns.
Ladies and gentlemen, henceforth, we must put a stop to the excuses some countries are already starting to produce.
There is no question mark over the method: it was necessary to give the national governments the time to debate the outcome of the Convention together.
After that, the time comes for them to decide.
There is no suggestion that the Italian Presidency is to blame.
I can witness to the fact that it has unceasingly and tirelessly endeavoured to generate debate and encourage convergence.
It has consistently and firmly taken the result of the Convention as a basis.
MrAntonione made a point just now relating to the Legislative Council, on which we have noticed a general climbdown.
On this point, you have all, like me, heard the proof of what I said about the Italian PresidencyÂ -Â its determination to preserve the outcome of the Convention, to enhance it and to prevent it falling apart, as far as is humanly possible.
I would, therefore, like to pay tribute, in particular, to the presidency of the Council of Ministers, in the person of Mr Frattini, and its dedicated efforts.
There is no question mark over the Conventionâs work.
As we know, not only has it been useful but it is also fully usable.
The Convention has discharged its mandate and even gone beyond it, providing the Heads of Government with a complete, coherent text on the table.
Lastly, there is no question mark over the roles played by the Commission and Parliament.
In the Intergovernmental Conference today, as in the Convention yesterday, we are working together and, very often, more often than not, there is agreement.
In any case, there has always been genuine dialogue between us.
I will be frank, then: what is to be called into question in the current situation of stasis in the Intergovernmental Conference is the approach of certain governments which want to act as if there had been no 18-month long Convention, which want to reopen all the Pandoraâs boxes, one after the other, which refuse now to agree to what they often endorsed, themselves, yesterday in the Convention, as regards economic governance, for example, or as regards the role of the European Parliament in the Unionâs budgetary procedure.
If this approach were to continue, it would lead to a deadlock.
I will give you just two examples.
Firstly, qualified majority voting.
All the cards are on the table.
All the positions are known.
We all know that if the unanimity requirement is preserved for a subject, we are, without a doubt, all condemned to collective impotence.
There is only one solution to this situation given that there are so many of us round the tableÂ âÂ there will soon be 25 of us and, one day, 30Â âÂ and that is a shift to qualified majority voting for the majority of subjects.
We have to decide here and now and certainly notÂ âÂ on no accountÂ âÂ go back on the not inconsiderable progress made with the Conventionâs text.
The second example is the updating of the common policies in the third part of the Constitution.
It is inconceivable that we should manage to produce a perfect, definitive text that will never need to be changed in a few more weeks of Intergovernmental Conference.
The important thing â for times are going to change, for European and world society are going to change â is the ability to adapt these policies to the Unionâs needs, to the needs of society as they change.
The important thing, therefore, is to make the mechanism for revising the third part rather more flexible, at least in some areas.
Ladies and gentlemen, I want to reiterate here, on behalf of the Commission, that the only way we will have any chance of a short, decisive Intergovernmental Conference is if the governments observe the broad balance of the Constitution drawn up by the Convention.
As for the rest, we expect the national governments to shoulder their responsibilities: the responsibility to resolve without delay, as you said, Minister, a small number of issues which have been debated at length; the responsibility to build in the flexibility and safeguards which will allow the Constitution to move with the times.
We have reached the point where all the cards are on the table.
Now we need to have a discussion and take a decision, which is different from aligning national positions.
As far as the Commission is concerned, it is ready to do that, under the same conditions as I outlined a month ago: to enhance the draft Constitution with regard to a limited number of points, without jeopardising its overall balance; to make all the provisions clearer in order to avoid misunderstandings or confusion when the text is ratified; to carry out what I would call the legal fine-tuning exercise entrusted to it by the Convention.
Ladies and gentlemen, I feel that the credibility of this Intergovernmental Conference method is on the line for the last time.
I say this because I have already taken part in three Intergovernmental Conferences since Amsterdam.
Each year, the method proves less capable of taking the Union forward.
The Maastricht Conference revealed a shared goal.
The Amsterdam Conference produced a useful but incomplete result.
After laborious negotiations, the Nice Conference managed, in the end, to reach a complex temporary compromise on the leftovers of Amsterdam.
Then here we are today with the danger of a deadlock in this Intergovernmental Conference, despite the fact that the Convention is well on the way to a major, high-quality achievement.
Ladies and gentlemen, when the draft Constitution was adopted, some people waxed lyrical on the subject of what they called the âspirit of the Conventionâ.
In actual fact, for those who took part in the Convention and continue to be proud of having done soÂ âÂ including many of youÂ âÂ the spirit presiding over the work was, quite simply, European rather than international.
All I want at this juncture is to see some of this European spirit hovering once again over the work of the Intergovernmental Conference.
Speaking of a conquered people, Cicero said â.
Literally, that means, âThey acted wisely but too lateâ.
There will, and would be, absolutely no point in the governments of a finally reunified Europe acting wisely after this Intergovernmental Conference is over.
Â Â  Mr President, I believe it is highly symbolic that after the debate on enlargement, on the political reunification of the continent, we should hold this debate on the political reorganisation of the continent, which must end with the approval of the European Constitution; I believe that the two things are united and, as the Italian Presidency has quite rightly said, this must be the case so that we can go into the 2004 elections on the basis of a European Constitution.
I said the other day, Mr President, that I believed that so far the debates in the Intergovernmental Conference have produced a degree of frustration, and I explained this, like KlausÂ HÃ€nsch, by saying that the debates we were seeing were a repetition of those we had held during the Convention.
There was nothing new and as MichelÂ Barnier has already said very correctly all that was being produced was a reduction of what had been obtained.
I must also say that we should find cause for satisfaction in it, because it ultimately means that the Convention did good work and if the governments present back to us what they presented to us then, that means that what we supported then was the solution which achieved the greatest consensus.
I would like to refer to an issue which has been the subject of the last meeting at ministerial level and which has been the cause of great concern to the representatives of Parliament.
I am referring to the intention of the ECOFIN Council of Ministers to make a series of proposals which, at the end of the day, meant entirely undoing the compromise achieved by the Convention on TitleÂ VII of the Constitution on the Union's finances.
This was a compromise which was mulled over at length, involving four working groups chaired by Mr Amato, MrÂ HÃ€nsch, Mr Christophersen and Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo.
This compromise was based on three key ideas, which have been this Parliamentâs banner over the last ten years: achieving greater democracy, achieving greater efficiency and achieving greater transparency.
That compromise was also based on two ideas: the first was that, with regard to revenue, the governments should have the final word, since, at the end of the day, it is provided by the citizens of the Union; and secondly, with regard to spending, the European Parliament should have the final word, since it represents those same Union citizens.

Consequently, on the basis of the work of these four working groups, we proposed this compromise with three legs; the first one relates to own resources: own resources will be decided by the governments and subject to ratification by national parliaments; the second is the financial perspectives: the Inter-institutional Agreement is incorporated into the Constitution and they will be approved as from those of 2006 by a qualified majority in the Council and with the approval of the European Parliament; and, thirdly, the budget: Parliament will have the final word with regard to the spending chapter, the distinction, which has always seemed to us to be bizarre, between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure having disappeared, but this is an approval subject to brakes and obstacles, since in order to have the final word, this Parliament must have a majority of 3/5.
By all this I mean, Mr President, that we are dealing with an agreement on three legs, and this Parliament as my fellow Members well know naturally believes that ratification by national parliaments of own resources is something which belongs to the past and also that the multi-annual financial framework should be something subject to the ordinary legislative procedure.
This means that we, for the sake of compromise, have given ground because we believed that the principle according to which âthe governments have the final word on revenue and Parliament has the final word on spendingâ makes sense.
I would like to make it very clear that this Parliament has given ground for the sake of compromise and, therefore, I believe that at the moment the fact that this compromise, which is one of the key elements of the constitutional text, should be called into question and there should be an attempt to blur some of the elements of these three legs, makes no sense.
So much so that I believe that, from this Parliamentâs political point of view, and I would like to make this very clear, it will be totally unacceptable.
It will be a red line for us.
And we said this at the last meeting of the Intergovernmental Conference, and it has been accepted by the Italian Presidency as well and, while I was preparing this speech, Mr President, I received a note from the Ansa agency in which Mr Tremonti, President-in-Office of ECOFIN, says, and I will read in Italian: [We believe it is essential that the text prepared by the Convention should be approved just as it is].
Well, let us take notice of Mr Tremonti and let us maintain the compromise on the issue of finances.
Â Â  Mr President, I have listened carefully to the statements of the President-in-Office of the Council, which outlined general approaches which I feel I can support, but I would prefer to focus on a number of practical issues, not least because Mr Antonione called for the European Parliamentâs support.
To obtain this support, which we are, moreover, quite willing to give, he must enter into dialogue with the positions of the European Parliament.
On 21 October, there was a meeting of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs in which the Italian Foreign Minister took part, representing the President-in-Office.
I would like to draw the attention of Mr Antonione and the House to two points once again.
We are firmly in favour of keeping the reference to the Legislative Council, the concentration of the European Parliamentâs legislative function in the Council, which is an important point, a major innovation of the draft Convention.
Now, Mr Antonione tells us that he has taken note of the fact that the majority is opposed to this.
I would express my doubts once again regarding this approach: one cannot take decisions just by counting the numbers for and against.
Sometimes, I even have the impression that the views of 28 governments are part of the equation, whereas only 25 are entitled to give an opinion, for three are mere observers.
In the Convention, there were analyses, exchange of opinions, a search for solutions, a debate on the points for and against each solution, and, lastly, compromise.
We cannot accept that the Intergovernmental Conference should do no more than tot up the fors and againsts.
Mr Antonione has made a commitmentÂ âÂ and I appreciate the significance of thisÂ âÂ to keep the matter open.
I do not know exactly what the outcome of this will be, but we call strongly for this point not to be deleted.
The second point concerns the procedure for revising the Treaties.
Mr Antonione did not mention it today, but MrÂ Frattini undertook before our committee to look into drawing up an Italian proposal to go beyond the text, which was not agreed in the Convention and is not, therefore, binding for any party.
We are in danger of creating an absurd situation where we go back to square one on issues already resolved in the Convention with a compromise but we are unable to discuss issues which were not the subject of an agreement in the Convention, such as, precisely, the revision procedure.
I do not know whether the Italian Presidency intends to include this matter in the comprehensive proposal planned for the third week in November too, but we reiterate our firm commitment to fight for this to be included.
Lastly, Mr Antonione did not mention the issue raised by Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo: it is unacceptable for sectoral configurations of the Council of Ministers to produce amendments to the Conventionâs text.
Â Â  Mr President, the performance of the Council of Economic and Finance Ministers causes me great concern too.
Yesterday, one of its principal members, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, attacked the proposals from the Convention as threatening to bring about a federal state with centralised fiscal policy.
This is a grossly false accusation displaying a regrettable prejudice against the work of the Convention.
Then Ecofin tries to subvert the package on the financial system.
Its reactionary proposals appear to want to move away from QMV to permanent unanimity on the financial perspectives, and also to remove Parliamentâs right of assent.
They want to retreat from the ordinary law towards Council law and to remove Parliamentâs last word on the budget.
One certain consequence of this would be an increase in the overall expenditure of the budget.
Without being able to out-vote troublesome and perhaps greedy Member States, the Union will be obliged to have protracted and public rows ending in costly concessions.
In effect, the Finance Ministers are seeking to suppress this Parliamentâs role as a partner in the budgetary authority.
They are imposing treasury autocracy upon parliamentary democracy.
The power of the purse is a core function, a most central and long-standing power of the parliaments in all our Member States.
Should the proposals of the Ecofin Council be allowed to prosper at the IGC, this Parliament will be reduced to a pale mockery.
The autocrats will have won out over the democrats.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, as a former member of the Convention I must say that I am extremely surprised at what is going on in the Intergovernmental Conference.
You only need to pick up the note from the Presidency, document 37.
What you read isÂ âÂ I findÂ âÂ unbelievable.
Just the list of desired amendments to the Convention text is 20 pages long.
When I see that, then I cannot help having the impression that some governments clearly did not take the Convention seriously, since what else would explain why these same governments that supported the Convention consensus are now calling for this plethora of amendments?
I am sorry to say that only the contentious issues regarding institutional matters are widely reported to the public: the number of Commissioners or the issue of Council majorities.
These are, without a doubt, important issuesÂ âÂ in this respect we must not, I believe, go back to Nice.
Furthermore I would also like to clearly state that I expect the Intergovernmental Conference to follow the Convention in rejecting any attempts to include a reference to God in the Constitutional Treaty.
ArticleÂ 10 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights fully guarantees everyoneâs right to freedom of religion.
That is right and proper, but to divide the people of the European Union into religious and irreligious by way of the ConstitutionÂ âÂ no, that cannot be allowed to happen under any circumstances.
Any retrograde steps regarding the rights of Parliament would also be unacceptable, in particular given the budgetary powers of this House.
I believe that those who want to wield the axe here are demonstrating a certain degree of disconnection from a democratic Europe.
In the Convention, I endeavoured to make the EU more social, since a social Europe is what the public rightly expect.
It is precisely in this respect that I think that the EU still has a long way to go.
I am amazed when important politicians in my country claim that the Conventionâs draft is dangerous from a regulatory point of view or when it is announced by those at the Deutsche Bank that the predominance of social objectives in the Conventionâs draft threatens the EUâs economic structure.
I ask myself what the Intergovernmental Conference is actually doing in this area.
Will it reject such attacks on the draftâs progress?
How will the discrepancies between PartÂ III and PartÂ I be dealt with?
Politically and legally speaking it is imperative that the provisions on economic and monetary policy of PartÂ III are aligned with the basic provisions of PartÂ I. I guarantee that no one will understand and certainly not approve if there are two economic philosophies in the Constitution text: social market economy, balanced economic growth and full employment on the one hand and an open market economy with free competition and merely a high level of employment on the other hand.
Parliament has to pay considerably more attention to all these issues.
In saying this, I am also addressing my comments to my own government.
Instead of abstaining on amendments, it should stand up in the Intergovernmental Conference so that the social objectives set down in PartÂ I clearly and unmistakably also apply to PartÂ III of the Constitution Treaty.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the Intergovernmental Conference, having only just been opened, paints a picture of a bundle of banknotes being thrown into the crowd in a pedestrian zone. Everyone is jostling to get hold of a note; the Convention draft is being dealt with as if a piece of game were being hunted to death so that everyone can pull out a piece for themselves.
At this point I wonder who is actually the source of Europeâs constitution.
The citizens?
Their directly elected representativesÂ âÂ the parliamentsÂ âÂ or even the cabinet offices and national governments?
One day we will have to answer this question before history and the people of Europe.
The Intergovernmental Conference gives its own answer, that they are the source of Europeâs constitution.
In Thessaloniki they claimed that they would not open Pandoraâs box.
Pandoraâs box is open and you can see how the old diseases of Europe are spreading, national egoism and aspirations of unilateralism in the individual institutions.
From where else might they come, these diseases and this evil that we are seeing?
In its first meeting, the Legislative Council thus removed the separation of powers element and the public nature of legislation, without debate.
The Finance Ministers agree: fewer rights for Parliament, less publicity, fewer rights for the Commission.
They are the sole legislators.
They â they alone â have budget sovereignty behind closed doors.
Qualified majority votingÂ âÂ a considerable step in the draft ConstitutionÂ âÂ is being challenged in many areas.
Dual majority in the Council, one of the Conventionâs best principles: a law is passed with the majority of the States and the majority of the citizens.
That is understandable, that is legitimate.
It is attacked for not fitting in with their power game.
Another step forward: Euratom.
A great opening towards reform of this obsolete treaty will be blocked.
The European Central Bank, which is bound by the Convention on European values and objectives, will be exempt from these values because of solidarity.
I could go on.
The attacks are fierce.
The principle is: more power to governments, less democracy, fewer rights for citizens, and less knowledge for the public.
We need to respond to this, and if the parliaments do not do so, then Europeâs Constitution will be a bad one.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, MrÂ Antonione, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the news from the Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) paints a picture of disagreements and difficulties.
To any disinterested, objective observer, that comes as no surprise.
Only those who promote the false idea that a supposed consensus was obtained within the Convention can feign astonishment.
We all know that the results of the Convention would not be accepted as a democratic consensus anywhere where the principles of democracy are known and respected, where votes are taken.
We now have harsh proof of the contrary, found in the character of the IGC itself, the only institution complying with the Treaties and wielding the democratic and legal legitimacy to make decisions.
Those who sought to diminish the IGC, who still insist on doing so, are therefore on the wrong track.
I salute the Italian Presidency and the dedicated fashion in which it has performed its work.
It is crystal clear here today that the blame for any potential failures will lie not with this Presidency but with those who persist in forcing the issue, in riding roughshod over the legitimate rights of the Member States and in weakening democracy and the Rule of Law.
Of all of these, I would point to JacquesÂ Chiracâs most unfortunate opening speech, which was followed inauspiciously by GerhardÂ Schroeder, attempting to use financial blackmail to stifle debates in the IGC and using Community funds to threaten some Member States.
That was the worst possible start to the conference, as it set a highly negative tone, far indeed from the positive efforts and goodwill of the Italian Presidency.
I do not know if anyone felt intimidated, but the whole thing deserves to be roundly condemned.
This is not the way!
On the other hand, the German Chancellor appears to be softening his dogmatic initial positions, having indicated during a visit to Bratislava some days ago that he might be prepared to accept the loud calls for the Commission to be appointed on the basis of one Commissioner per Member State, with equal rights.
I welcome these signals â they are sparks of hope and promising gestures.
That is the way.
I hope that these signals will prove genuine and will extend to other items on our agenda: respect for the principle of subsidiarity, express guarantees of respect for the primacy of national constitutional law, transparency in the Councilâs legislative operations, recognition in the preamble of our Christian heritage, retaining the rotating Presidency or finding a satisfactory solution to the various problems caused by the unsuitable duration of each term, the elimination of terminological flights of fancy such as âMinister for Foreign Affairsâ or âConstitution for Europeâ, the deletion or strict rationing of flexibility or clauses so as not to cheat the system for revising the Treaties, and so on.
The further away we move from the dictates of a Cabinet, even if it calls itself a Praesidium,the more successful the IGC will be.
The IGC will only fail if the inflexibility of certain so-called âbig gunsâ makes them âsmallâ, makes them want to overturn equilibriums that are essential to the unselfish quest for European integration.
The more the IGC respects and pushes forward with the sacred founding principle of equality between Member States, the more it attends prudently and realistically to the actual state of public opinion on national identity and European identity, the broader the support it will garner.
It would help to remind the French President that the result of his diplomacy, of his European Presidency, was the Treaty of Nice itself.
That fact may help him and others to calm the excessive nerves they so often display.
Nice is the Treaty in force.
More than that, it is a Treaty which is not even completely in force yet.
There is no hurry, therefore, no drama, no cause for despair or distress.
Nice is that alternative consensus which so many people invoke; it is also, for now, the only real consensus, the Treaty we prepared in readiness for the main challenge facing us now: enlargement.
Let us not, therefore, put the timetable ahead of the crux of the matter.
The reform of the Treaties must be a good reform, a lasting reform, one which allows everybody time to speak and be heard, to form real consensuses, to build and entrench authentic, lasting unanimity.
This must not be a reform done in a hurry, destined to fall at the first hurdle, as the text of the Convention is currently doing.
We believe that the European Union cannot fail.
The European Union must not fail.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the results of the EU Convention have now been printed in a number of splendid, blue-backed books, but they are completely unreadable.
There is no glossary.
Who in the Council is responsible for sending out thick books in all the languages without glossaries which would have enabled people to locate those places in which they were particularly interested?
As taxpaying citizens, we pay billions to the EUâs numerous information offices which then, however, use the money for propaganda rather than for providing genuine information.
It is bizarre that it is in my office, rather than in the institutions, that we are to produce the reader-friendly editions of the draft Constitution which people, including politicians, have a chance of being able to understand.
We have annotated the margins with many cross-references so that there is no need to jump backwards and forwards to see whether unanimity or a qualified majority is required.
We have underlined all the key words so that the draft Constitution might quickly be skimmed through, and we have prepared a comprehensive alphabetical glossary so that words such as âsubsidiarityâ, âreligionâ and âdefenceâ can be looked up and the places quickly found where they are mentioned.
We have, moreover, made our work available on the Internet free of charge in all the languages.
Not everything is ready in all the languages, but the most important parts are there and can be downloaded quite freely from my homepage with the address âbonde.comâ.
We have also prepared approximately 1Â 000 definitions with relevant links to the website âeuabc.comâ, and anyone can freely download them to their own computer and have future changes sent to them completely automatically via e-mail.
This is a task that the Council should have carried out.
Instead, they have broken an agreement made with us in Democracy Forum and printed the draft Constitution without attaching the minority statement.
We had a crystal-clear agreement with Giscard d'Estaing and John Kerr.
We signed the document describing the overall outcome in return for having the minority statement printed, so that EU citizens might be able freely to choose between the majorityâs and the minorityâs visions of Europe.
I wish now to call upon the Council to ensure that the minority statement is printed together with the draft Constitution, and I am pleased to make our reader-friendly editions available to the Council free of charge.
It is strange that we who are opposed to the draft Constitution are to pay for its publication so that it can also be read.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner Barnier has painted a bleak picture of the situation, expressing the Commissionâs concern, shared by many, at the way the work is proceeding.
He told us that it is not the Commissionâs fault, it is certainly not the Italian Presidencyâs fault, it is certainly not the fault of the Convention, still less the fault of Parliament.
Well then, I would like to know whose fault it is.
Is it Estoniaâs fault?
Polandâs?
The fault of Mr Aznar, who would rather have the Nice method than that proposed by the Convention?
Commissioner Barnier, might it not be that we are all a little to blame for having approached this issue with so little drive that, of course, once the gates were opened, once it became possible to say that the Convention had got this or that wrongÂ âÂ starting with the CommissionÂ âÂ everyone rushed to follow the Commissionâs example with regard to a text which, in all probability, being the lowest common denominator, was certainly going to be in danger, once the gates had been opened, of everyone rushing to try and amend it for the worse?
The truth is that we missed our chance at Nice, we missed our chance at Amsterdam and, in my view, we missed our chance at Maastricht; we missed the chanceÂ âÂ which Parliament had once demanded but then forgot aboutÂ âÂ to stress that we needed, first, to go deeperÂ âÂ do you remember the famous concept of going deeper before enlarging?Â âÂ and todayâs debate shows how far we are from achieving the intentions expressed at the start of the Italian Presidency, which Parliament was still expressing in September.
I now wonder whether, given the way things are progressing, it might not be appropriate for the Italian Presidency to take stock of the situation properly.
It is true that you have made a number of commitments, but one of them was to take the moratorium to the United Nations, whereas we were told yesterday that no such thing is going to happen.
You undertook to round off the six months with the commitment on the Convention, but the Italian PresidencyÂ âÂ Italy, a founder countryÂ âÂ has a duty to itself, to its history.
If it were to come to a watered-down text, in my opinion, the least that the Italian Presidency should do is avoid concluding with a hotpotch text, a text that would do more harm to the Unionâs interests than failing to come to a conclusion.
Since this is the way things are, since we do not have a worthy, powerful draft capable of withstanding great resistance, a federalist draft along the lines of that proposed to this House by Altiero Spinelli almost 20 years ago, since we do not have a powerful vision to inspire us, then it is no surprise that everyone is digging in their heels over minor issues.
We Radicals are going to hold a convention on 13 and 14 November 2003 on this subject, in the hope that, on the basis of a reflection in which many can take part, both here and elsewhere, we might be able to achieve a position to the effect that Parliament can reject a text if the negotiations should really go very badly.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we can only look at the Intergovernmental Conferenceâs work so far with disquiet and concern.
Imagine, a Convention that makes people smile â at any rate one that is not taken very seriously â manages, despite all political and geographical boundaries and the most disparate institutions from which it is drawn, to produce a convincing, well rounded draft constitution without having to take a vote on even one thing, and now we find that the Intergovernmental Conference tears that very same draft to shreds, unpicks it without giving the slightest hint about how it intends to reach a positive outcome.
It is quite remarkable that none of the proposals discussed in the Intergovernmental Conference mark any step forward, but are all retrograde when compared with the Conventionâs draft.
The Intergovernmental Conference is in reverse gear.
The Heads of State or Government are in the brakemanâs cab of the European Union. We are back in Nice again!
The most astonishing statement came in fact from the finance ministers.
They simply want to âgovernmentaliseâ this Parliamentâs budgetary powers.
They want to deny Parliament any part in budget decisions.
To which school did they go to learn the basics of democracy?
Do they not know that parliamentarianism is the pillar of democracy and that Parliamentâs budgetary powers are the pillar of parliamentarianism?
Not for the sake of its membersâ powers, but for the sake of the democratic control that Parliament clearly must exercise.
In making this proposal, the finance ministers are betraying a pre-democratic understanding of parliamentarianism.
Incidentally, in this European Union the most costly favours have always been dispensed in ministerial meetings behind closed doors, not in this Parliamentâs public budget debate.
That is why Parliament must keep its budgetary powers.
I want to set out just a few expectations that we have of the Intergovernmental Conference and address them to the Council Presidency, whose work up until now, which has certainly been very positive, we want to endorse.
Firstly, we expect agreement to be reached by the end of this year.
That is technically possible.
There are not a vast number of articles to argue about, only a few key institutional issues.
Secondly, the Intergovernmental Conference must put Nice behind it.
The Heads of State or Government who took this Union down the blind alley of Nice must now bring it out again.
Thirdly, a balance must be achieved between sometimes small-minded but basically legitimate national interests and the well-being of the European Community; in other words the Heads of State or Government must not only seek the good of their Member States, but they must also have and demonstrate a sense of responsibility for the unification of Europe, because what the Council devised in Nice is not only indefensible in democratic terms, but incomprehensible by any rational person.
A new Treaty must be easy to understand; that is the only way to achieve the transparency and proximity to the citizens for which we are striving.
Â Â  Mr President, this Parliament has warned time and time again against the danger of unravelling the Treaty by taking away one bit, then another, then another.
We warned even the Commission against putting forward its quite reasonable proposals, on the grounds that if you start to undo one bit of the draft Constitution, then another bit will unravel and that will be the excuse for somebody else to come up with another proposal, and so on.
At the last debate, we warned against the Spanish and Polish Governmentsâ proposal to revert to the Nice formula for voting in the Council quite a selfish proposal if I might say so.
And now we see that things have gone a stage further, when a sectoral council suddenly wakes up after months of negotiations and discussions on these very subjects and after the Convention has finished and halfway through the IGC wants to wade in and rewrite the draft Constitution.
And it wants to revert, not even to what is currently in the Treaty, but to something that is worse than the current Treaties as regards the powers of the European Parliament.
Frankly, that is unacceptable.
Furthermore, I would submit that the points they have raised are ones that in many cases have not even been flagged up by their own governments at the start of the IGC as issues on which they wished to have some discussion in that forum.
They are new points, and therefore we have a problem in that our governments would appear - at least in some cases - to be divided on this issue.
In those circumstances I would invite the presidency to resist the demands of this sectoral council.
I would invite all colleagues in this House to engage, back home with their own governments, in the debates that are no doubt taking place as we speak on these subjects.
I would encourage them to bring some sense to the positions of their own governments and to bring us back to the more sensible negotiating line that most governments at least those of the original six Member States and the United Kingdom seem to be taking at the beginning of the IGC, in allowing this draft Constitution go through intact, albeit with a few technical adjustments.
That is what we should aim for.
Â Â  Mr President, neither the celebrations nor the word 'constitution' can conceal the anti-grass roots essence of the new Treaty, which adds yet another link to the chain binding the peoples post Maastricht, Amsterdam and Nice.
A new Treaty, which comes to safeguard the anti-grass roots, pro-monopoly, imperialist policy of the European Union, which redistributes power in favour of those who are already strong, which intensifies the inequalities between the Member States, which institutionalises neo-liberalism and subjugation to the market, which supplements repressive mechanisms and which promotes the militarisation of the European Union, to the point at which it adopts the doctrine of preventive military action on the pretext of terrorism.
Any opposing views expounded at the Intergovernmental Conference are secondary, in that no one disputes militarisation or repression or the handover of sovereignty.
The disagreements are confined to about how exactly to redistribute the power.
The people do not need a European constitution.
They hardly even need a European Union.
We are certain that they will react both through referenda, where they are held, because the Greek people have never been asked, nor will they be asked now, and in their daily fight.
Â Â  Mr President, I share the opinion already expressed by many in this House.
I have to say that during the Convention, in which I was proud to take part as an alternate member, I respected - though I did not always agree with - the positions taken by the United Kingdom Government representatives.
They made their position clear, they sometimes took an unpopular stand, but on the whole they stood on a given ground and we reached a conclusion and compromises.
Sometimes I would have liked them to have taken a different line, for example, a stronger line in relation to the unsatisfactorily readjusted sections on fisheries in parts I and III.
As Mr Corbett bravely pointed out, although governments could have voiced reservations or come forward with different views on matters that were central to the discussion at the Convention, nothing was said.
Both Mr Duff and Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo made the point that these matters were extensively, not inadequately, discussed at the Convention.
Now, suddenly, on the core issue of the budget, the ECOFIN Council and, I am afraid, the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer with it, says that the Convention's entire proposal makes no sense and that a completely new order needs to be brought about.
That, surely, is about the most unsatisfactory way of conducting things that can be imagined.
I criticise the UK Government it is not the only government at fault but we should all be calling upon all governments involved to get their acts together and get this thing finished reasonably quickly and on the basis of the Convention.
Â Â  Mr President, we all agree that decision-making procedures within the EU institutions need to be streamlined to take account of the ten new countries which are joining the Union next May.
We need to reform the way in which we take decisions in a broader European Community, but we also need to ensure that, in the context of putting in place a new European Union Treaty, vital national interests are protected.
For example, from an Irish perspective, I have some concerns relating to a number of issues.
First, the retention of effective national control over taxation policy is a matter to which the Irish Government and other European governments have consistently attached the highest importance.
Negotiations which took place at the Nice Summit with regard to this issue guaranteed that unanimity was retained for decisions on all taxation questions at EU level.
I believe that taxation issues are best controlled by national governments and local authorities as opposed to a centralised European Union.
Second, while enhancing the effectiveness of the fight against cross-border crime, I am concerned at a proposal to extend qualified majority voting to issues relating to criminal law.
I believe that this is an ineffective proposal because it does not take account of the different legal traditions in the various Member States.
Third, in the area of security and defence, it is important that no new obligations are imposed on Ireland which threaten our traditional policy of military neutrality.
The Irish Government and other EU governments must also retain discretion at a national level over the participation in any future military operations.
And last but not least, I would strongly request that smaller Member States should retain the right to appoint one Member to the European Commission.
Â Â  Mr President, theÂ President-in-OfficeÂ ofÂ theÂ Council began his speech just now by saying that the Conventionâs proposals must not be weakened by the IGC, because they had been achieved by a democratic method.
I do not know what kind of democracy that could be, because the Convention did not have a democratic mandate to draft a Constitution, it was not representative of the various shades of public opinion and, what is more, it did not hold any votes.
It must be a new kind of democracy served up in a European sauce.
In actual fact, the latest meetings of the IGC have shown that a certain number of national delegations are starting to ask themselves some legitimate questions.
First of all, the extension of majority voting to cover essential matters such as border controls, taxation, financial perspectives, criminal law, services of general economic interest etc. ought not to be possible, or at least should only be possible in exchange for a safety net, for example a right of veto for each national democracy, exercised by its national parliament or by a referendum.
I am talking here about a feasible right of veto, and not a disproportionate right, such as the right to secede, which is obviously not feasible in the day-to-day debates of the Union.
Moreover, we cannot allow, as they stand, bridging clauses which make it possible to turn procedures requiring a unanimous decision into procedures requiring a majority decision without going through the process of an official revision, in other words without the need to ask for solemn ratification at national level.
That sort of provision is tailor-made to encourage the introduction of a Europe governed by self-styled elites who grow fat on the backs of the nations.
If these bridging clauses were to be adopted â and there are a great many of them in the draft Convention â then the next revision of the Treaties would probably be the last.
After that the only thing that would be needed would be the opinion of the European Council, and not the opinion of the nations.
That is definitely unacceptable.
Â Â  â Mr President, the Intergovernmental Conference has not just been a forum for rubber-stamping the Convention, as was feared among governments at the start and was very much hoped for here in Parliament, and this IGC seems to have developed into a real IGC.
It is nevertheless important that the Conventionâs fundamental ideas are not discarded during the work of the IGC.
What is most important about the IGC is how good the results are and not at all whether the timetable is adhered to.
At present it is obvious that there are practical problems with the timetable.
The IGC only has approximately five weeks more to go and things have not been moving along at the required pace.
The issues on which consensus has been achieved are mainly inferior versions of the balanced proposals put forward by the Convention.
I am referring here, for example, to the Legislative Council getting buried.
The Conventionâs proposal regarding the weighting of votes must be held on to.
It is, to my mind, a fair compromise for both the big and the small countries.
It is necessary to abandon the complicated system regarding the weighting of votes under the Treaty of Nice so that decision-making in the EU does not become immobilised.
We have to remember that the Member States that are big in terms of their population were met halfway at the Convention with the agreement that a decision needed the backing of three fifths of the citizens of the EU.
At the same time, however, there was a guarantee that the qualified minority needed to block decisions could not be achieved by a few big Member States, such as the Mediterranean bloc, by forming an alliance.
It is imperative that the proposals by Spain and Poland to alter the balance of power between the governments of the Member States should be rejected.
If a compromise over a Convention proposal has to made in some direction, this should be done by going in another direction, which is to say the 50-50 model, where half the Member States and half the population are needed for a decision to be supported.
In the future it will probably come about that every Member State will be guaranteed its own Commissioner with voting rights.
Horrifying images and theories about an overly large and stagnant Commission and idle Commissioners were greatly exaggerated.
I am sure jobs and meaningful subject areas can be found for 25 Commissioners.
Besides, organising work and tasks rationally and making possible a hierarchy of different ranks based on a rotating system organised fairly will have an effect on the practical way in which things get done, if that is required.
Â Â  . Mr President, Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo telephoned me last week to inform me of Ecofinâs proposals, and Mr HÃ€nsch came to our committee on Monday of this week.
On both occasions, I was absolutely dumbfounded as to what they told us.
I cannot believe that the Council is taking on board the proposals from Ecofin in the budgetary area.
As a Brit, I can say that, on the issue of own resources, I understand why it is doing this.
Whether it is right is a different issue.
On the other two issues of the financial perspectives and the budgetary procedure, it really is a step too far.
To take such action would neuter this Parliament.
There would be no need for a Budgets Committee if this were agreed at the IGC.
Quite frankly, we would be castrated with a pair of rusty scissors.
We do not need this type of so-called 'dominance' from the Council.
Parliament has given a lot in trying to get an agreement at the Convention and the Council also claims that it has done the same.
But the one thing we have given is the acceptance of the financial perspectives enshrined in the Treaty.
Right now, if we break the Interinstitutional Agreement, we go back to the Treaty, which gives Parliament a lot more power and a lot more authority.
We have sacrificed this in order to get an agreement, which is a more cooperative approach and would mean that we work together in cooperation.
However, what we have here is not cooperation but coercion from the Council.
This cannot be allowed to go ahead and every effort must be made to ensure that it is prevented.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, allow me to say first of all that, as a citizen of the Spanish State, I am utterly opposed to all the positions adopted by JosÃ©Â MarÃ­aÂ Aznar during the voting in the Council.
Secondly, allow me to mention three concrete problems.
Solving them would help improve the text of the draft Constitution, emphasising important aspects of the Unionâs political, cultural and institutional nature, without altering the basic orientation of the Conventionâs work.
The first problem is the need explicitly to reinstate the actual circumstances of our peoples into the definition of the Union, defining it as a union of states, peoples and citizens.
At the end of the draft text, the destiny and well-being of the peoples of Europe are mentioned as objectives of the European Union.
The second problem is recognition in the Constitution of the existence within the Union of constitutional nationalities, federated states, and so on, with executive and legislative powers: state powers, in fact.
The third problem is to affirm clearly and precisely that the Union is a social union.
In any case, I hope that the Constitution of the Union will some day come to recognise the stateless nations of Europe, such as Galicia, Scotland and others, so that they are not forced to fight in order to lay claim to their own states, that being the only practical way for them to be represented as nations in the European Union.
Â Â  â Mr President, the draft constitution rightly contains the constitutionalisation of the Lisbon process, and it really was an achievement for this European Parliament to try and give the European Union a profile that combines economic reform, growth, full employment and social cohesion, and the draft treatyâs underlying values are also evidence of this objective.
Regrettably, however, the instruments for achieving these objectives of the European Union are extremely weak.
Coordination is mentioned, and rightly so, but precisely because ours is not only a monetary union but also an economic union and a political union, we have given far too little thought to the need to keep in mind not only the interdependence of national economies, but also the social circumstances of our citizens.
I very much regret that we find very little in all these areas about how political decisions are to be given democratic legitimacy or that treats this as a priority.
That itself is something of a failing in the Convention treaty.
But when I hear that the finance ministers are calling on the Intergovernmental Conference to do even less than is contained in the draft, then that is a retrograde step that we in this House cannot allow.
And there is something else we must not allow.
As the European Parliament, we are quite willing to grant that Parliament does not need to have a say in every technological innovation in areas covered by the codecision procedure, and we are prepared to allow secondary legislation, but only on condition that in this Union committees of experts are not able to cover up and change everything behind closed doors, and for that reason the whole of Article 35 must also be included in the constitutional treaty as it comes out of the Intergovernmental Conference.
That is also part of the democratisation of economic and monetary policy.
Â Â  Commissioner, permit me to put your comments in a context less formal than this one.
You have told us that it is not necessary to ask the turkey to prepare for Christmas, and that is what we are in the process of verifying.
The IGC has reached the limits of its powers.
For this Parliament, the essential thing now is to preserve the balance that has been achieved within the Convention.
I prefer the word âbalanceâ rather than âcompromiseâ.
It seems to me that if there is a Convention spirit, a European spirit reigning over this IGC, I would hope that it is that spirit which enables us to identify the listening phase that we are passing through now as being the phase that allows us to confirm the fact that, if we all pursue our individual arguments to their logical conclusion, our collective decision-making process will reach an impasse.
If that is the case, and if this listening phase is simply there so that we can all pursue our arguments to their logical conclusion in order to confirm the fact that we are moving towards an impasse, then there is still some hope for us.
On the other hand, I am afraid that, if we do not manage to take that step, we shall risk slipping backwards.
You know that in my country the debate is becoming heated.
In my party, some people have already decided to say yes, while others have already decided to say no, and some people prefer to wait and see.
In the final analysis there could be a move away, not just from the text of the Convention, but also from the Treaty of Nice, as regards qualified majority voting, the powers of Parliament on budgetary matters or the introduction of a threshold of 66% of the population as the definition of a qualified majority.
Quite frankly, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, what we want is for this IGC to concentrate on the issues that really are on the agenda, and those subjects, as Mr Napolitano has reminded us, are the subjects which the Convention has not dealt with, in other words the fourth part.
On this point, I am very fearful of the status quo.
There seems to be a certain degree of audacity, and it lies precisely in the balance of the proposed Convention. That audacity is to use the bridging clause as a revision clause.
What I would suggest to both of you is that you should examine the option of inserting a third subparagraph into Article IV-7.3, which would be worded â at least in spirit, though the legal form would have to be confirmed â as follows, âThe European Council, on its own initiative or at the request of the European Parliament, may decide unanimously to authorise the Intergovernmental Conference to adopt the amendments to be made to the Treaty establishing the Constitution by a super-qualified majority and to make provision for its ratification under the same conditionsâ.
Â Â  â Mr President, the Intergovernmental Conference is destroying the Conventionâs success.
That was almost to be expected because this method of national and sectoral egotisms is in fact something quite different from the work of the Convention, which has tried to find the European interest.
It is now very striking that the governments are starting to attack the European Parliament and its rights.
The loss of the legislative council is the loss of a partner for this Parliament in making legislation.
Law making will be weakened as a result.
The reduction in this Parliamentâs budgetary powers is an attack on the very legitimacy of parliaments.
Parliaments were created to exercise democratic control over public finances, and anyone who disputes those rights, the European Parliamentâs budgetary rights, is attacking democracy in the European Union, and not only the European Parliament but all our colleagues in the national parliaments, too, should make a stand against that.
The sectoral councils actually have no part to play in the Intergovernmental Conference, and the Ecofin Councilâs attempt is directed not only against the Convention but also against the Thessaloniki summit.
In Thessaloniki it was said that the heads and the foreign ministers negotiate, not the sectoral councils, and I can only call on the Italian Presidency to resist these attempts.
They should not allow it and should really pay no more attention to the sectoral councils than they do to political proposals made by the legal services.
Technical proposals, yes, but I see political proposals being made here, even in the area of defence policy, for example to throw out the mutual assistance clause, to throw out structured cooperation.
That is all a change in the substance.
The Convention created a good atmosphere.
The Intergovernmental Conference is spreading a bad atmosphere and we can do without that in such an important year as 2004.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, only with a sense of irony or with a sense of humour â since, as Rabelais said that what distinguishes man is his capacity to laugh â can we talk about progress in the work of the Intergovernmental Conference.
It would be more accurate to talk about steps backward than progress.
Nevertheless, the failure of the Intergovernmental Conference to give the European Union a Constitution worthy of the name would certainly be a major disappointment for Europeâs citizens, who would clearly feel let down.
In fact, the overwhelming majority of Europeans have accepted the idea of the Constitution because of its symbolic importance and because of its capacity to mobilise people.
By way of example, a recent survey conducted in Portugal shows that 69% of the Portuguese people are in favour of the Constitution and only 9% are against and the view from other European countries is more or less the same.
The Constitution is nevertheless within reach and can easily be approved by 5Â December and signed in Rome, the Eternal City.
All the Member States have to do is simply accept the project that came out of the Convention and give up on the damaging idea of rewriting it or of pulling it apart.
Some States actually appear to want to be negative about Europe; countries that are obsessed with the fact that they are big or, conversely, that they are small.
Some countries appear to demand only rights and make no mention of duties and others are more concerned about creating blocking minorities than working majorities.
If this happens and if national self-interest prevails, what will be the fate of the European spirit and of the historical idealism associated with European integration?
This would sound their death-knell and would scupper them for good.
I, like many European citizens, also wish to have a Constitution that is more federal, more socially minded, and which encompasses a genuine common foreign and defence policy.
This Constitution must then be given legitimacy, as a constitutional text must be, by the citizens, by means of a referendum.
I do, however, accept and support the current text, which represents enormous progress, in both form and content, and which heralds a new era of European constitutionalism.
I therefore say âLong live the Constitutionâ!
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to start by thanking all the Members who have spoken for their valuable contribution to the process of drawing up the new Constitutional Treaty.
It is quite clear that we who, as the Presidency in office, are presiding over the work of the Intergovernmental Conference can only be helped in our task by these contributions, however critical.
However, I would like to attempt to reassure you over what may appear to be a deadlock, to be problems between the IGC and the European Parliament.
I am not trying to say that there are no problemsÂ âÂ I highlighted some in my introductory speechÂ -Â but we also have to realise that, in this phase of debate in the IGC, the countries are, of necessity, trying to stick to certain positions in the negotiations, not least for strategic reasons.
Quite frankly, I believe that each one of us, and we have some small experience of negotiations, knows that this bargaining, typical of negotiations, means that positions can often appear to be far apart right up to the last moment.
I am sure that even the esteemed Members of the European Parliament who are attending the IGC can confirm that everyone has expressed the intention in the IGC at least to succeed in finding a solution which observes the time frames laid down by the Thessaloniki European Council, allowing the new Constitutional Treaty to be signed before the forthcoming European Parliament elections, and they all want it genuinely not to be a watered-down solution.
In this sense, I can confirm the Italian Presidencyâs commitment to ensuring that situations do not actually develop which could ultimately lead to an unsatisfactory result.
Moreover, in the democratic process which, although questionableÂ âÂ in the sense that many have called it into questionÂ âÂ will be subject to scrutiny in that, as we all know, the end product of the Intergovernmental Conference will be assessed by the national parliaments, the European Parliament and, in some cases, even by the citizens in referendums, that will be the real, definitive assessment of the work of the IGC.
Therefore, to predict failure at this stage, saying that no progress is being made and that things are essentially at a standstill, would be both inaccurate and, quite frankly, unhelpful.
It would be inaccurate for the reasons I have just given: these are times of strategic manoeuvres which must be seen as such and could not, I feel, be seen any differently, for the simple reason that the idea is not to resolve one point at a timeÂ âÂ for then we would be able to say at each stage: âThis has been discussed and resolvedâÂ âÂ the idea is to realise that, when such a complex undertaking is embarked upon, we can only look at the overall picture, and therefore, at the end of the proceedings, we will be able to balance out the proposal we are going to make as Presidents-in-Office, which we hope will be accepted as widely as possible and to the greatest possible extent.
I would still, very briefly, like to focus on a number of points, those which have received most attention, for I do not have time to respond to everyone, of course.
As regards the Legislative Council, which was one of the issues most frequently raised by the speakers, as Presidents-in-Office, at the request of the European Parliament, with the commitment given by Mr Frattini, as Mr Napolitano pointed out, at the hearing of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, we brought it to the attention of the initial meeting in Rome on 4 October, and then proposed it again at the last IGC meeting of Foreign Ministers despite the fact that we had identified clear, widespread political opposition.
We were not rewarded by success, but we have kept the debate open on this matter, considering that the work of the Convention, on the one hand, and the demands of the European Parliament, on the other, are sufficient for the issue to be given a place in the final proposal.
It is a commitment which Mr Frattini made at the very end of the proceedings of the last Intergovernmental Conference meeting.
As regards the procedures for revising the Constitutional TreatyÂ âÂ a point which was not addressed by the ConventionÂ âÂ those taking part in the IGC are quite aware that the Italian Presidency has proposed to open a debate on this issue too, that, in this case too, there are times when conducting the work is a difficult task, as regards both formÂ âÂ because the item was not originally on the agendaÂ âÂ and content, for an in-depth analysis has been launched which is of no mean importance: it opens a debate on whether what we are working on is genuinely a Constitution.
Some countries have started to say that, if it is a Constitution, then that is a completely different question and that they have never given anyone a mandate to discuss a Constitution.
You understand, therefore, that all this is not exactly the simplest of processes to manage, but Mr Frattini, who is presiding over the work of the IGC, has kept the debate on this issue open too, saying that he hopes there can be a reflection on the matter across the board in an attempt to understand that the more effective the process we use to find a solution, the easier it will be to amend the agreements signed when the time comes.
We have undertaken to return to this matter too.
Lastly, as regards the matter you have said may be a priority, which is certainly extremely important, the Ecofin contribution, I can only reiterate what Mr Frattini said, to the effect that the Italian Presidency does not accept any kind of proposal made by any Council configuration, not even Ecofin.
It does not accept such proposals because they are unacceptable in substance, and I therefore support all the Members who have agreed that they are unacceptable on the basis that we have fully espoused this principle.
In this regard, of course, if, as happened in the context of the Conventionâs proceedings, someone proposes points which are also mentioned in the press as having been discussed by Ecofin, we are under obligation to address them and discuss them.
However, I can assure you that, as far as the Italian Presidency is concerned, it is our express intention to safeguard the rights of parliaments, and not just the European Parliament but parliaments in general.
We are talking about the new Constitution or Constitutional TreatyÂ âÂ call it what you will but that is the spirit in which we are presiding over the proceedings of the Intergovernmental ConferenceÂ âÂ and it is quite clear that, if the part played by the European Parliament and the national parliaments is lacking or even just diminished, not only would we be doing a disservice to the future Constitutional Treaty but we would also be doing a disservice to the citizens of Europe.
Therefore, on this, I feel I can commit the Italian Presidency to endeavouring to safeguard rights which we believe must be upheld at all costs, while taking into account the wishes of others at the same time.
Â Â  That concludes the debate.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A5-0312/2003) by Marieke Sanders-ten Holte, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation concerning Community cooperation with Asian and Latin American countries and amending Council Regulation (EC) No 2258/96 (COM(2002) 340 â C5-0368/2002 â 2002/0139(COD)).
Â Â  . â There are certain parts of the world where the fact that this House is a co-legislator is sometimes forgotten.
The current ALA Regulation was adopted ten years ago as a regulation for the Asian and Latin American countries.
Since then, although Parliament has expressly requested two separate regulations for two very different regions, the Commission has yet again tabled one proposal by means of which it wants to update the existing regulation and intends, at the same, to incorporate the regulation on aid to uprooted populations, which will lapse at the end of next year.
Anyone would think that this parliamentary resolution had never existed.
The Committee on Development and Cooperation therefore proposes, via amendments, to split the regulation into two separate regulations, and, as rapporteur, I set great store by passing on to you its message.
Needless to say, although there will have to be extensive consultation with the Council on this matter, it is clear to everyone that a distinction must be drawn.
I should now like to focus on content.
The Commission wants a 'lightweight legislative framework' for its actions in the area of development cooperation in both regions.
As it happens, it has become a very lightweight framework indeed.
As the Millennium Development Goals, in fact, stated, the key goal of development cooperation is the fight against poverty and its ultimate eradication.
I fail to find this spelled out clearly in the Commission proposal, and nor does it contain other objectives, such as education, health care, environment and democratisation.
My first point, therefore, is that 35% of expenditure should be set aside for social infrastructure, something we have included in the budget on a regular basis since 2001.
At least 20% of this should be spent on basic health care and basic education, for these Millennium Goals have had a very raw deal to date.
Secondly, education, in particular, is a very important instrument in the fight against poverty.
Everyone is entitled to it and must have access to all forms of education, irrespective of their origin, gender or age.
A disproportionately large number of the poor in developing countries are women, but they are often the very people who are denied this right.
They are the water carriers.
I would therefore emphatically call for gender mainstreaming, and even for extra attention for women and girls, not only in education and health care, but also in social, economic and especially political spheres.
As full members of society, they should be able to play a part in the way it functions.
Another important point is participation.
The abortive negotiations of the WTO in CancÃºn clearly underlined once again that the developing countries demand full participation.
They do not have it, either at governmental level, or at the levels below.
It is therefore of crucial importance that all interested parties be consulted when the strategic documents, the annual indicative programmes and the annual action plans for development cooperation are drafted.
By this I mean not only the government bodies at national, regional and local level, but also the members of parliament in those countries, the NGOs, the private sector and also all other actors involved in civil society.
They know their own requirements like no other and can therefore give a clear indication of what is needed.
This was also a key request made to us by people in the field.
Only in this way can a form of ownership be established of the different areas of policy and actions in development cooperation for people at every level.
It is important that this House should be, both now and in the future, involved as co-legislator in European development policy.
The Commission must therefore put before Parliament the strategic documents to which I have referred.
It seems obvious to me that, in this context, not only should a description be given of the sectoral and inter-sectoral priorities, as well as the specific objectives, but also of the expected results on the basis of adequate performance indicators.
As a Dutchwoman and a Liberal, I attach great value to the useful and effective spending of taxpayers' money.
This can only be verified if clear objectives and performance indicators are established.
Finally, I should like to underline here once again that the European Union's cooperation with Asia and Latin America requires a modern legislative framework, in which both the fight against poverty and that against inequality have their own dynamism.
I should like to warmly thank my fellow MEPs for their cooperation.
We have had excellent discussions, and, while these have not always led to agreement, I think that the discussion on this subject should be regarded as of exceptionally great value in the light of our common goal.
Â Â  . Mr President, the Commission has presented a proposal for a regulation on cooperation with the countries of Asia and Latin America.
The duration is for an indefinite period, although the Financial Framework is defined for the period 2003-2006.
This proposal provides for a general increase in cooperation with these regions and emphasises common rules and procedures to be followed, such as implementing procedures and decision-making processes.
This is a text that gives the Commission a high degree of flexibility because it does not contain political or operational guidelines.
As regards available funds, the Commission suggests a financial framework for 2003 to 2006, which would be divided up at a ratio of 60% for Asia and 40% for Latin America, totalling EURÂ 3.793Â billion.
As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets, I tabled some amendments that I believe are crucial.
Despite the fact that the budgetâs headingÂ IV âExternal and Development Policyâ faces great financial constraint, I believe that the sums put forward by the Commission are compatible with the financial limit.
I nevertheless made a point of insisting on the necessary improvement in implementing cooperation, specifically in translating the promised appropriations into actual payments for these regions.
For these two regions, the problem of outstanding commitments (RAL) stands at EURÂ 3.45Â billion.
I also proposed rounding up the total amount to EURÂ 3.8Â billion in order to take account of the fact that the 2003 budget was in the meantime adopted at a level higher than that proposed by the Commission.
Lastly, I suggested that, from the budgetary point of view, it would be preferable not to introduce sub-limits for the two regions, which limits flexibility.
Instead, the regulation should have an overall financial framework.
It is, therefore, crucial that the European Union contributes to eradicating poverty, to promoting sustainable development and to ensuring respect for human rights, minority rights and the rights of indigenous people, and contributes to democracy, good governance and to combating inequalities.
I also wish to state that the Committee on Budgets voted in favour of setting up a solidarity fund for this region, which I believe will prove to be an extremely positive initiative.
Â Â  Mr President, the rules which regulate cooperation between the Union and the countries of Asia and Latin America date from ten years ago.
In ten years, there have been certain changes in the world.
In Asia, certain countries have made progress in terms of consolidating their democracies and their development has been given momentum.
Unfortunately, in other Asian countries, the situation has deteriorated in all areas of political, economic and social activity.
In Latin America, following a decade of democratic progress, the 1980s, and another decade of economic reforms, the societies of all countries, with certain notable exceptions, are experiencing a profound economic and social crisis.
In both regions the fight against poverty has not only failed to achieve any notable success, but rather, on the contrary, in Bangladesh and in Haiti, in Afghanistan and in Bolivia, poverty is engulfing more and more social groups.
In some cities now tragically renowned for their precariousness, such as Calcutta, there is no room for optimism, but in others, such as in TucumÃ¡n, in Argentina no less, poverty and hunger chronic hunger amongst children are things we have never seen until now.
We therefore believe to be timely, and we welcome, the proposal the Commission is making with this Regulation, which amends and updates those which have been in force up until now.
This Parliament, in paragraph 61 of its resolution of 15 November 2001, declared itself in favour of a separation of the Commissionâs initial proposal, one applicable to Asia and another to Latin America.
This our only objection to the proposal we are debating today, which is no small objective certainly, but I would like to stress that in terms of the fundamentals of the issue we support the Commissionâs proposal.
We agree with the objectives which take up our commitment to the fight to eradicate poverty, not only in terms of the financing and co-financing of projects to promote development, but prioritising education, health and strengthening civil society in order to strengthen democracy, transparency and good governance, without which democracy will not be strengthened and the desired development will not achieve its objectives.
We agree with the financial framework, with the increasingly prominent role given to the countries receiving our cooperation, as well as the steps being taken in the process of decoupling aid in the manner intended by recently approved directives.
All of this is what we wish to achieve through our amendments.
We disagree on a formal question which we cannot abandon out of coherence with our philosophy and our view of a European policy for such priority areas as Asia and Latin America.
It is not a question of political prestige, Mr Patten, nor of prioritising one region over another, as one of our fellow Members has said during this sitting.
Throughout these long months of parliamentary negotiation we have held talks with numerous governments involved, with their ambassadors here in Brussels, and with many, many NGOs which work both in Asia and Latin America.
All of them, I repeat, all of them, without exception, without a single exception, have said that they prefer two regulations: one for Asia and another for Latin America.
If we say, and the Commission also says, that we want to adopt the principle of co-participation in our cooperation from the moment programmes are established and not just in the management and implementation phase of a project, it does not appear coherent now to do the opposite.
Today, tomorrow with the vote, a codecision procedure can begin in which Parliament does not wish to, and cannot, renounce its prerogatives and in which we believe there is margin for negotiation with the Council.
I will end by congratulating the rapporteur, my colleague and friend MrsÂ Sanders-ten Holte, who has worked very well, who has tried everything, who has done so very well and I thank you, MrÂ Patten, for your willingness to hold the dialogue in which I hope we will be able to continue to make progress in the coming months.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, when in 1988 the European Parliament, acting as a budgetary authority, managed to have the funds intended for cooperation with Latin American and Asia allocated to separate budget lines, a decisive step was taken in the regionalisation of Community external relations; an approach which has been consolidated as the one most in line with the idea of functionality and specificity which governs Community policy and as the most effective in terms of development.
Now, in accordance with its legislative competences, it falls to this Parliament to gives its opinion on the modification of the ALA Regulation which covers cooperation with both regions jointly.
In accordance with this approach, an example of which is Parliament's unanimous vote for the Salafranca report on a global partnership with Latin America, in the Committee on Development and Cooperation, in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy and in the delegations for Central America and Mercosur, we have given our support by a huge majority in favour of the existence of two differentiated regulations: one for Asia and another for Latin America.
Tomorrow there will be a vote which is as historic and significant to both regions and Europe as the one which led to the division of the budget lines.
The Socialist Group supports the existence of two differentiated regulations out of coherence with a long journey which is now culminating; because we believe that Latin America and Asia deserve to be treated at least equally with the other developing regions and, in this regard, both political representatives and representatives of civil society of the two regions have demonstrated to us their desire for their own regulations and programmes; because we are convinced that the benefits for the populations of both regions, the ultimate objective of the regulations, will be much greater than the administrative difficulties the Commission is afraid of at the end of the day, these difficulties will be limited to a healthy division into two of the current ALA Committee and a reallocation of staff; and finally, because we profoundly respect our own legislative capacity.


The political message we are sending to the populations of Asia and Latin America by means of these two regulations is particularly encouraging at this time of enlargement, of European expansion towards the East and of reduction of cooperation funds in order to deal with other situations, which are perhaps more urgent but no more necessary.
Finally, Mr President, I would like to point out that the amendments to the content of the regulations, on which I warmly congratulate MrsÂ Sanders-ten Holte and the secretariat of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, will considerably improve the quality of our contribution to the fight against poverty and will consolidate the political messages sent in regions between the European Union and Latin America and the importance of strengthening the European Union's actions on the continent of Asia.
Â Â  Mr President, the revision of this regulation has given us plenty to think about.
First of all, we had the proposed cooperation agreement which, it has to be said, looked more like a free-trade agreement than a development programme.
That did not surprise us unduly, because it formed part of the current European policy which is leading to a change in the thinking behind the Communityâs development policy.
Within that regulation, however, we succeeded in reinserting sustainable development, accompanied by social and environmental objectives.
In particular, 10% of the budget for this programme is to be allocated to the conservation and sustainable management of natural resources, and 35% to social and health infrastructures.
Human rights, and especially womenâs rights, the rights of minorities and of indigenous peoples and the removal of inequalities are also the guiding principles of European cooperation policy in these regions.
Finally, we have ensured that civil society will participate in the definition of the multi-annual development plans.
Reducing poverty will therefore have to be the first goal of the national programmes which will be negotiated between each country and the Commission.
Since Parliament will not be consulted, it was necessary to insert some guidelines at an early stage, and that is what we did in the Committee on Development and Cooperation.
I beg you, ladies and gentlemen, not to call into question, for institutional reasons, a text which has finally been given a political content.
Why ask for two regulations, one for Asia and the other for Latin America, rather than a single regulation divided into several chapters?
We would do better to campaign for an overall increase in aid rather than wanting to know which continent will get most.
As far as I am concerned, it is irrelevant whether the money is allocated to Asia or to Latin America, provided that it goes to the poorest people.
It is for that reason that we want to have parliamentary control.
Unfortunately we have used up a great deal of energy and wasted a great deal of time on a dispute which seems to me to be trivial, given the size of the challenges we have to meet in Asia and in Latin America.
I believe that the essential thing is to fight for the content of these regulations, the content of these chapters, the content that we are giving them today, because that is what the people of both Asia and Latin America expect of us today.
Â Â  â Although I applaud the way in which the rapporteur has clarified the goal of the regulation for Asia and Latin America, the question concerning the fight against poverty is this: where is the added value compared to national development cooperation?
In the fight against poverty, there is the risk of Member States duplicating their efforts.
The regulation's purpose could therefore be indicated more clearly.
In terms of developing trading capacity, the complementary aspect is clear.
It is complementary to development cooperation and related to European trade policy.
Secondly, the Biregional Solidarity Fund proposed in the report is undesirable.
A fund must have well-defined objectives.
Solidarity suggests a sense of involvement among people that takes shape within social contexts, close to the citizen and based on an internal conscience: think of the charity taught by Christ.
However, in an inter-continental context, this charitableness finds expression via specific policy actions and co-financing organisations.
A solidarity fund is not appropriate here.
I would, by the way, thank the rapporteur, my compatriot, for her efforts for a good cause.
Â Â  Mr President, I believe that Commissioner Patten is aware of the commitment and support I have always tried to bring into my actions in favour of the Commission.
I am not one of those Members who believe that the Commission is a gathering of stateless bureaucrats, but quite the contrary, I believe it is a key institution in the project of European construction.
The Commission is also aware, however, that that support and that commitment cannot be seen as a blank cheque.
Parliament has the right to its opinion, and I believe that it would not be a Parliament worthy of that name if it did not exercise, responsibly of course, its competences, democratically controlling the Commission, investing it and acting as a Parliament which debates, which rejects, which ratifies and rectifies.
That is precisely the exercise we are involved in at the moment, an exercise in which Parliament carries out its duties confidently within the framework of the competences attributed to it by the Treaties and, above all, in a field in which we are acting in accordance with the principle of codecision.
It is difficult, Mr President, to think of a report on which there has been greater consensus in this House, a consensus which is expressed through a proposal which calls for one regulation for Asia and another for Latin America, in the belief that the specific characteristics of these two regions would be better addressed by means of a separate regulation for each one.
As MrsÂ Sauquillo said, in order to be coherent with the existing budgetary requirements and also in order to give Latin America and Asia the same treatment as other regions and, therefore, to prevent any form of discrimination.
I have said that there has been a consensus which will be difficult to reproduce in this Parliament, because this opinion has been issued by the plenum of Parliament, it has been issued by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, it has been issued by the competent delegations and it has been issued, in the same way, by the committee responsible, which is the Committee on Development and Cooperation, and not by a tight margin, but by 26 in favour and two abstentions, one of them by the rapporteur.
I would like to say that the other aspect which the rapporteurâs group calls into question â by means of the amendments â is the creation of a bi-regional solidarity fund.
And it is surprising, Mr President, because it is an initiative which has already been endorsed in plenary by all the political groups, including the rapporteur's group; an initiative, Mr President, which has been endorsed from a regulatory point of view, which does not imply any additional money, which has been approved by the Committee on Budgets in the 2004 budget, which is an initiative which falls within the context of the priorities of the next European Union-Latin America summit, to be held in Mexico next year, for which we have no great proposals to put on the table.
Above all, Mr President, it is surprising because it is an initiative which is intended to prevent the progress that has been made in the fields of co-existence and democratisation being jeopardised as a result of social fragility, as the case of Bolivia recently demonstrated.
What is most surprising, Mr President, is that one of the arguments used and which is used as an authority to reject this proposal is the position of the Council of Ministers, as if the European Commission had to respond to the Council of Ministers and take its positions more seriously than those of the European Parliament.
Mr President, we are dealing with a very significant case in which this Parliament is gambling some of its credibility, some of its prestige and some of its reputation as an institution.
Therefore, Commissioner, if the House ratifies the proposal as approved by the Committee on Development, I would urge the Commission to accept it, not as a demonstration of high-handedness, but as a demonstration of coherence, nor as a way of undermining the Commissionâs authority, but simply in the normal exercise of the competences attributed to this Parliament in accordance with the institutional balance laid down in the Treaties.
Â Â  â Mr President, I would like to add my voice to the many congratulations addressed to the rapporteur.
She has presented a very good and a very clear report today.
I think the report by the Committee on Development and Cooperation shapes the content of the regulation â or, as we would all prefer, regulations â better.
Mrs Sanders-ten Holteâs report clearly shows that the issue is not simply to incorporate trade into the development strategies for future cooperation with these two parts of the world, but that it must be clearly stated that the aim is to combat extreme poverty and if we are serious about these development strategies we must include civil society in the countries concerned.
The measures called for by the Committee on Development and Cooperation, whatever distinction is drawn as regards whether they are intended for Asia or Latin America, make it quite clear that it is necessary to have two regulations here in the future.
You do not have to be an expert on the countries listed in the Annexes, which will benefit from these regulations or the projects that are supported, to see the enormous, the tremendous differences between the two regions and therefore the need for two regulations.
I would also like to thank the rapporteur, who has actually always shared this opinion, for taking such a clear stance here.
From my experience in other areas and other negotiations with the Commission, I believe that if we get a convincing majority for two regulations here in Parliament tomorrow, that will be a good starting point for negotiations with the Commission and the Commission will move on this important question.
Â Â  MrÂ President, firstly, I wish to say that I think there are a number of good points about the Commissionâs proposal.
At the same time, I want to emphasise that the rapporteur, MrsÂ Sanders-ten Holte, has done a very good job.
Under her leadership, we have been able, during the committee reading, to agree upon a number of additions and changes that make the legislation both more focused and concentrated more upon poverty issues.
I am especially pleased about the target of approximately ten per cent for efforts within the environmental area.
Environmental issues are all too often hidden away in development work.
We have a long list of problems, especially in Asia, that have to be tackled when it comes both to pollution and to safeguarding basic natural resources.
A majority of the poor in rural areas are in actual fact more dependent upon what we might call the âgross biomass productâ, that is to say what is produced by nature, than upon the âgross domestic productâ,that is to say what is produced by the economy.
We then have the controversy as to whether there should be one or two regulations for Asia and Latin America.
I am conscious of the fact that Parliament wanted two regulations, but I think that the Commission has very strong arguments in favour of its proposal.
In recent years, a number of measures have been implemented to make the organisation of development cooperation more efficient, and it would be strange if we were now to complicate this with two regulations and, as it were, to obstruct the simplification of the procedures otherwise under way.
I think MrsÂ Sanders-tenÂ Holte had an excellent proposal for a regulation divided into two separate chapters.
I am not convinced by the argument that the countries are, apparently, so different.
We have a single framework for ACP cooperation, and it operates quite admirably.
MrÂ SalafrancaÂ SÃ¡nchez-Neyra may talk about his 26 votes in favour compared with zero votes against but, if he were to listen in the corridors, he would hear that a very great many of his fellow MEPs are now deeply concerned about our getting into a conflict over this.
I should therefore like to urge my fellow MEPs, irrespective of what is said by the leaders of the political groups, to vote against the amendments aimed at our having two different regulations.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to thank the Commission and, again, the rapporteur for the excellent and often very difficult task that she has undertaken.
I believe that it has to be the task of this Parliament to be in favour of simpler rules and procedures and also to ensure that we have an understanding of the need for timely and effective decision-making in programming.
That has to be at the heart of the whole reform process that we keep challenging and asking for.
And yet, in this debate, we hear over and over again calls for us to complicate and make more difficult the procedures, programmes and issues the Commission has to deal with.
In addition, as far as I am concerned, it makes absolutely no sense, when we are dealing with a technical and legal regulation, to be suggesting that it should be doing the work of country strategy papers in the countries that we work with or the work of the national indicative programmes that we work with.
That, again, is a total contradiction of what a regulation that has a financial and a legal basis is meant to be doing.
In my opinion, to create two separate regulations simply does not make sense and would undermine the efforts that we are making to streamline and clarify our programmes.
Mr Salafranca talked about credibility, and our credibility as a Parliament is at stake here if we do not understand the issues that we are dealing with.
Our strategy has to be to work well with Latin America and with Asia and apply the same principles which are at the heart of our development programme.
There is no justification either for any argument in favour of transferring funds from Asia to Latin America, especially when we know about the desperate poverty of 800 million people in Asia.
The Commission's communication on development policy in 2000 called for us to refocus on poverty eradication.
Therefore, it is totally inappropriate for us now, in 2003, to call for a regulation which will just separate two parts which work very well together and we will duplicate, replicate and complicate our efforts to eradicate poverty.
I urge Parliament to be realistic and constructive so that our essential work in both these regions can continue and can grow.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to start by congratulating my Spanish colleagues of all political persuasions on their enthusiasm for the subjects of their former colonies.
However, I wish my country would sometimes stand up for its national interests in the way my Spanish colleagues seem to, irrespective of politics.
Having said that, we heard Mr Rod ask why we should not have two regulations so that we can send the money where the poor are.
Well, they are in Asia.
And there are 800 million of them.
If the two regulations are supposed to send the money where the poor are, why are we sending EUR 247 million from Asia to Latin America?
I know that the European Parliament is famous for standing on its head but it is an extraordinary example of how we have done so again.
We need simple legislation that we can understand, that our voters can understand, so that we can connect with our electorate.
Creating two duplicate regulations, going through the entire process, the enormous amount of bureaucracy and, at the same time asking the Commission to simplify its procedures, to decentralise and so on, is such a contradiction.
Why are we even considering this?
Forgive me for saying this, but are we considering this to be nice to the Spanish?
I have to say that I am very nice to the Spanish most of the time but on this occasion I shall not be.
Â Â  . Mr President, the Commission proposal, as the House knows, aims at replacing the current Asia and Latin America Regulation with a new, simple and modern legal framework, consistent with the principles underpinning the reform of external aid.
This has already been done for other regions.
It is now time for our partner countries in Asia and Latin America to benefit from the advantages of this reform.
From the beginning, it has been clear that some misgivings were developing in Parliament with regard to the premise and to the very nature of the new regulation.
I have spent more time discussing those misgivings and this piece of legislation than any other for which I have been responsible since I have been a Commissioner.
I do not think I have had more meetings, more discussions in the Commission or more conversations in Parliament.
I very much respect those of my interlocutors who have not agreed with me.
The honourable gentleman MrÂ Salafranca knows a huge amount about the subject, but my sympathies and my intellect on this occasion are with some of those who spoke in the later stages of the debate, who also know a huge amount about development assistance: the honourable lady MrsÂ Kinnock, the honourable gentleman Mr Whitehead, and the honourable gentleman and my honourable friend, Mr Deva.
Let me just touch on some of the principal arguments.
First, there has been a strong call in certain quarters of this House for two regulations instead of one.
Second, as the many amendments which have been tabled illustrate, there is also a strong wish for a more detailed regulation.
I should like to respond to both these issues, and to reiterate the Commissionâs position on the form of the regulation.
The Commission attaches great importance to having a and a regulation.
Why a simple regulation?
So as to comply with the basic principles of the reform of external assistance, which requires flexibility in order to adapt cooperation to the specific needs of our partners by means of country strategy papers.
That is the policy which Parliament has enthusiastically endorsed.
Why a single regulation?
So as to avoid the proliferation of legal instruments and the multiplication of procedures and committees; in short, to be more effective.
Also, to comply with the Interinstitutional Agreement on better lawmaking which calls for simplifying and reducing the volume of legislation.
I have yet to hear a single argument as to why the rules and the objectives being the same for both regions two separate regulations would be better than one.
As I have said on a number of occasions, I find it difficult to believe that if we were to follow the views of some in this Parliament and support two regulations, there would be dancing in the streets in La Paz or dancing in the streets even around the Latin American embassies in Brussels.
References to other regions with their âownâ regulation Tacis and CARDS, for example are, in my judgment, hardly convincing, since the objectives of these regulations are not those of development policy as set out in Article 177 of the Treaty and which apply equally to Asia and Latin America.
Nor do the differences between the two regions justify two regulations, as the similarity, and even uniformity, of the amendments proposed for each region tend to prove.
But let us now turn to the substance of the amendments, and to the four most important issues on which, in my view, our further discussions should focus.
First, there is the overall objective of poverty reduction and eradication.
Some of the amendments aim at stressing poverty alleviation and eradication as an overriding objective.
I could not agree more.
However, there must also be room for the broad support for overall Community relations with Asia and Latin America, including support for capacity-building to help our partners in their fight against terrorism, illegal migration, trafficking in human beings and international crime.
Second, a subject which has been touched on in, for example, technical terms by my honourable friend, MrÂ Deva: the question of allocation of financial resources between Latin America and Asia The Commission proposal seeks to respect, for the period 2000-2006, the broad 60/40 balance of appropriations for Asia and Latin America which has prevailed during the previous financial perspectives.
This balance was slightly disrupted by events in Afghanistan and international pledges made there by the European Union.
However, it must be borne in mind that Asia still has by far the largest amount of poverty in the world - around 800 million people, or about two thirds of the worldâs poor, live on less than one dollar a day.
It is also important to bear in mind that assistance from the Community budget per capita in Asia amounts to EURÂ 0.15, compared to EUR 0.45 for Latin America.
On this basis, I would find shifting resources from Asia to Latin America hard to defend.
Of course, if the budgetary authority was to give us more money for external assistance for Asia and Latin America, I would be delighted to propose to Parliament ways of spending it, but I do not think that Christmas is going to come early this year.
Third, there is the question of a Solidarity Fund for Latin America.
Supporting sectoral programmes linked to health, education and poverty alleviation in Latin Americaâs poorest countries and regions could be achieved by means of the programming and implementation instruments which we have at our disposal.
Setting up a fund, seeking the participation of other financial institutions and agreeing on the rules governing the fund and its management would not only be wasteful but would also be a complicated and cumbersome process.
The Commission does not have the human resources for this task.
Fourth, and finally, is the question of sectoral targets and benchmarks.
Parliament proposes to introduce a number of sectoral targets in the regulation: 35% for social infrastructure and, within this figure, 20% for basic education and health; another 10% for the environment and up to 15% for Civil Society.
All this adds up to nearly 60% of appropriations which would be 'pre-programmed'.
As members of the Committee on Development and Cooperation know, the current agreement on a benchmark of 35% for social infrastructure was reached two years ago after long discussions, in which I myself took part, between representatives of the Commission and the Development Committee.
I do not intend to re-open those discussions, and indeed it is the Commissionâs intention to remain absolutely faithful to that agreement.
However, I would like to stress that it will not be in line with this agreement to add new conditions, in particular the 20% for basic education.
Furthermore, this contradicts the principle of country ownership and the very essence of the reform which entails that programming cannot be pre-defined by means of a regulation.
The problem â at least that of the proposed 35% for social infrastructure is rather theoretical, since in current country strategy papers for Asia and Latin America, 50% and 46% respectively have already been earmarked for social infrastructure.
In conclusion, I should like to thank very warmly the rapporteur, Mrs Sanders-ten Holte, for her very valiant efforts to bridge gaps.
She has made a really wonderful effort, and there must have been times when she wished she had been reporting on a different regulation.
I would like to invite Parliament to support the Commission proposals.
Informal discussions with the Council I just throw this in for information have shown firm support for the Commission proposal, and a great willingness to move ahead along those lines.
Above all, the interests of populations in need in Asia and Latin America should encourage us to do our utmost for the speedy adoption of a high-quality new legal framework for cooperation.
Â Â  Mr President, I have requested the floor as a result of personal comments in accordance with Rule 122 of the Rules of Procedure.
I wanted to refer to the comment made by MrÂ Wijkman with regard to the votes by means of which the Committee on Development and Cooperationâs proposal was approved, which were 26 in favour and 2 abstentions.
Mr Wijkman has not questioned these results, but has referred to the opinion in the corridors probably being different.
I would like to say, Mr President, that I have the greatest respect for everybodyâs opinions, but that in a democracy it is votes that count.
With regard to the Commissioner, who has also referred to this humble Member of Parliament and who has said that he has heard no argument to convince him of the need for two regulations, I would like to say to MrPatten who is a good friend of mine that I believe that he has not properly understood the position here.
I believe it is not the Commission who has to be convinced of the validity of the arguments, but Parliament, because, Commissioner, I would remind you that it is the Commission that answers politically to this Parliament, and not Parliament to the Commission, and that we are involved in a codecision procedure in which it is assumed that Parliament has something to say.
Â Â  Mr President, I was extremely distressed by what MrÂ Deva said, since he insinuated that we were not fighting to eradicate poverty, but that we Spaniards had other kinds of interest.
The truth is that I felt bad, and I would also feel bad if I did not say this here, since we are working together with the Committee on Development to eradicate poverty: to eradicate poverty in Asia and in Latin America.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate:
- on the report (A5-0358/2003) by Mrs Prets, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council decision establishing a Community action programme to promote bodies active at European level in the field of youth (COM(2003) 272 C5-0257/2003 2003/0113(COD)).
- on the report (A5-0357/2003) by Mrs Pack, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council decision establishing a Community action programme to promote bodies active at European level and support for specific activities in the field of education and training (COM(2003) 273 C5-0255/2003 2003/0114(COD)).
- on the report (A5-0359/2003) by Mrs Iivari, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council decision establishing a Community action programme to promote bodies active at European level in the field of culture (COM(2003) 275 C5-0262/2003 2003/0115(COD)).
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in 2002 the three European institutions worked together in order to draw up a new financial regulation, and this now gives us a clear framework for the subsidies by means of which we support a large number of excellent European organisations in the fields of culture, youth and education.
From now on, any funding decision will have to derive its justification from a legal base.
This obligation is imposed, in particular, on those subsidies which, up to now, have been financed from headings which, because of their position in the budgetary nomenclature, tended to be treated as administrative expenditure and so could be paid without a legal base.
The changes in budgetary nomenclature introduced by the new financial regulation mean that such subsidies can no longer be treated as administrative expenditure and so the subsidies in question require a legal base.
It was this new obligation which led the Commission, in the spring of this year, to submit seven proposals for new legal bases.
Those seven proposals, covering seven different areas, were accompanied by a communication from Mrs Schreyer setting out the common context which justified their presentation and the essential elements used to ensure a similar response, between one proposal and another, to the common problems facing these sectors of activity.
Mr President, todayâs vote is concerned with three of those seven legal bases. They need to be dealt with as a matter of urgency, particularly since the texts in question are being adopted by the codecision procedure.
I am grateful to Mr Rocard for having realised just how urgent they are and for ensuring that the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, which he chairs, was able to examine the Commissionâs proposals rapidly.
The switch from one budgetary approach to another may, however, cause serious financial difficulties, the consequences of which could prove to be drastic for the Europe of culture, youth and education if the joint legislators do not reach an agreement as soon as possible.
The proposals which the Commission has submitted to you are aimed at ensuring a smooth and uninterrupted transition from the old system to the new one, and we have tried very hard to draft texts which broadly reproduce the 2003 detailed implementing rules, with the aim of ensuring that essential continuity and losing none of the advantages to be gained, in terms of the proper management of public funds by taking this new financial regulation into account.
From this point of view, the proposed legal bases should be perceived as a technical adjustment, though there is a strong temptation to take this opportunity to embellish them with innovations and improvements.
In this case, however, the best is the enemy of the good, especially if those additions compromise the whole thing in the eyes of the Council.
With this in mind, the Commissionâs proposals are soberly worded, with the essential objective of preserving the , while giving it a legal structure which complies with the new financial regulation.
I should like to ask you not to move too far away from the Commissionâs proposals and to do everything to ensure that these legal bases can be adopted as quickly as possible.
In the case of the âcultureâ legal base, there is even less scope for flexibility, because the Council has to take a unanimous decision, but we must retain some flexibility, not only on culture, but also on youth and on education, because it has to be said that these three areas are essential to the development of Europe.
All possible means of reaching a compromise must be explored if they could enable us to bring these procedures to a speedy conclusion.
With effect from 1 January 2004, in fact, if there are no legal bases, it will quite simply become impossible for us to give our financial support to all those bodies which contribute to the creative, cultural and intellectual vigour of Europe.
In other words, an agreement at first reading is essential if those bodies are to be paid in January 2004.
In all three cases, the Commissionâs proposal has followed the stipulations of the financial regulation, and it is on that basis that I should like to explain the Commissionâs position on the amendments contained in the three reports.
I should like to thank Mrs Iivari, MrsÂ Prets and Mrs Pack for the considerable amount of work that they have carried out on these measures, the vital nature of which they are well aware of.
We note that the length of the programmes â five years for culture and education, and three years for youth â has met with mixed reactions.
We willingly accept Amendment 16 on culture, which proposes to shorten the length of the proposed programme to three years if that will enable a rapprochement to be achieved between the various institutions involved, so that the proceedings can be completed.
We reject, however, Amendment 8 on youth, and insist that 2006 should be the deadline, because by 2007 we would like to set up a new youth programme which will give preferential treatment to participation by European youth organisations.
There is a link between the issues of duration and budget in all three cases.
Amendment 17 on culture, which reduces the budget, would be acceptable if Amendment 16, reducing the duration of the programme, were adopted.
Moreover, if the duration is not amended, Amendment 11 on youth, which proposes an increase in the budget, is acceptable in order to cope with the challenges posed by enlargement.
On the education side, we can accept in part, or in spirit, a group of amendments, namely Amendments 4, 6, 8, 9, 10 and 11, which seek to amend, by making amendments as part of the 2004 budgetary process, the total amount of funding and the maximum and minimum percentages of that funding reserved for each activity in the programme.
According to the thinking behind the financial regulation, the long-term objective is to issue invitations, open to everyone, to submit proposals, with the famous âearmarkingâ, the method sometimes used now for allocating subsidies, being the exception.
In order to facilitate the transition towards the approach contained in the financial regulation, the Commission has encouraged a mixed system, consisting of invitations to submit proposals and budgetary earmarking for Part 2 of the culture base.
Therefore, we accept Amendment 18 on culture, but we are obliged to reject the culture Amendments 5, 15, 19, 20 and 23, which move too far away from the situation that we are trying to rectify.
From this point of view, the criteria should be clear, or clarified further.
We therefore agree with Amendment 10 on youth, but we disagree with Amendment 1 on culture, which strays too far away from the financial regulation in the way it redefines organisations pursuing aims of general European interest.
In this respect, we cannot accept Amendment 5 on education, which is concerned with the International Federation of Europe Houses (FIME), and which seeks to add it to the list of bodies covered by Action 1, because, on the one hand, FIME plays the role of an intermediary in the redistribution of subsidies, which excludes it from the sphere of action defined by the financial regulation, and on the other hand, an audit of the activities subsidised by the Commission in recent years has been launched in the light of past experience.
I should like, however, to explain to you that the Commission has already begun to phase out preferential collaboration activities with independent networks such as FIME.
Moreover, FIME, like the Europe Houses that are affiliated to it, has been invited to respond to the invitations to submit proposals issued by the Commission, either at central level or at national level, via the appropriate representatives.
Any invitation to submit proposals requires a jury of experts composed, depending on individual cases, of external experts or Commission officials, so as to guarantee its objectivity and transparency.
A certain number of amendments have this in mind, and want Parliament to be informed in advance about the content of any invitations to submit proposals, before they are published by the Commission, or about the principle, the detailed implementing rules, or the composition of a jury.
Mr President, while supporting these principles, the Commission cannot accept these amendments, which do not correspond to provisions concerning relations between the institutions established in the comitology decision, or which interfere with the executive powers of the Commission.
These are as follows: on culture, Amendments 11, 21 and 22, on education, Amendments 13, 14 and 15, and on youth, Amendments 15, 22 and 23.
However, we agree to Amendment 17 on youth, which proposes that Parliament should be informed every year about the annual implementation of our youth programme.
Naturally the Commission imposes an obligation on those people who have received a European subsidy to publicise the fact adequately.
While sharing Parliamentâs opinion on this point, it seems to us to be more appropriate to put this publicity obligation in the annex.
That is why the Commission accepts Amendment 12 on culture, but cannot accept Amendment 3.
The same situation means that, on youth, we accept Amendment 20 but reject Amendment 6, and, on education, we accept Amendment 12 but reject Amendment 2.
It is a rule of the financial regulation that a gradual reduction should be applied to operating grants renewed annually.
This gradual reduction is not always properly understood, and attempts have been made, in various places, to derogate from it.
We cannot accept Amendments 13 and 14 on culture, which seek to abolish the annual reduction.
The only exception recognised by the financial regulation involves cases where the beneficiaries have the characteristics of a body pursuing aims of general European interest within the meaning of that regulation.
Three amendments on youth, namely Amendments 5, 18 and 19, seek to restrict the programme to youth organisations possessing such characteristics, and this is something we accept.
On the other hand, other amendments go much further in the opposite direction, and we cannot accept either Amendment 24 on youth or Amendment 24 on culture, both of which propose a substantial increase in the rate of the gradual reduction.
Mr President, I shall pass rapidly over those amendments which the Commission agrees with and which seek to either clarify or simplify the text, or to strengthen it along the lines proposed by the Commission. These are, on culture, Amendments 2, 4 and 8; on education, Amendments 1, 3 and 7; and on youth, Amendments 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12, 13 and 16.
In addition, the Commission sees itself in the role of cultural ambassador, as proposed in Amendment 9 on culture.
I have limited myself â and please excuse me for having spoken for such a long time â to mentioning the most sensitive amendments proposed in the three reports.
I should now like to invite you to do everything you can to ensure that the support which the Union gives to the Europe of culture, education and youth does not experience an eclipse.
An agreement between the joint legislators, at this stage in the proceedings, is vital if the system is to get back on the road at the beginning of 2004.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, you were right to say that time is short and that we must make an effort so that the projects can start and those concerned can get their funding.
That was also my first point of criticism, because the time that has been left us is very, very short.
If we are to do our work thoroughly and well, we need time, otherwise things catch up with and overtake us and that is when we fall back on makeshift solutions with which ultimately nobody agrees and which nobody likes.
I would like to ask you that in future such matters and such important decisions be given a suitable time frame, because what we have here now is people breathing down our necks and the result is that we have to give way because we want the organisations to get their funding and their subsidies, even though there is still a lot with which we do not entirely agree.
The fact that the legal act is not yet available is regrettable and is already having repercussions.
There is already a shortage of funds, for twinning schemes, for example, where the first tranche cannot be paid out; information campaigns, too, in the Member States are having to rein in their resources a great deal.
At a time when we are on the verge of enlargement and we need more information than ever, I think such repercussions are definitely out of place.
I therefore believe there is an urgent need to offer transitional solutions so that programmes can continue if there are difficulties, so that Europeâs citizens are not hindered in their planned activities and the confidence which is in any case so very difficult to build up is not undermined at the same time.
As regards the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Medica and Sportâs three reports, which are up for discussion, I think they can easily be discussed and dealt with together, but they differ completely in content and we cannot therefore strike a deal on them simultaneously.
For example, the intention behind the proposal to harmonise action programmes as regards the proportion of cofinancing, the principle of degressivity and, not least, the alignment of their running time to 2008 is a good one, but there is no way it will work in practice.
I am also against having a uniform cofinancing rate of 20% for all three areas.
Many organisations, most especially in education, receive such minimal support that any further reduction would actually disqualify them altogether and it will not be worth picking up a pencil to make an application.
A 20% rate for youth organisations is the maximum because lack of sponsorship makes it very difficult for organisations to carry on their activities as it is.
Regarding the principle of degressivity, which is set at 2.5% from the third year, with the money saved being fed specially into new projects for the new Member States, I think that is also a mere drop in the ocean.
I am convinced it is right to integrate the youth action programme into the new youth programme from 2007, since that will certainly bring great advantages to young people and youth organisations.
The aims of supporting youth organisations that operate on a European scale include promoting international dialogue among young people, getting information on relevant topics to as wide a public as possible and offering informal educational opportunities.
EU support for organisations will offer young people not only a chance to cooperate in matters that affect them and their interests, it will offer them everything, the whole broad spectrum of European politics and the related dimension.
I believe they should be included in all discussion phases.
So far as the geographical applicability is concerned, I think the principle of the wider Europe must also be applied to youth organisations.
I support the involvement of youth organisations from the European Union, the Member States, the EFTA and EEA countries, the Balkan countries and certain countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States.
But I do not think that the activities of organisations working with partners outside those countries should in any way be restricted provided they are supported by their own governments and organisations.
In order to take some of the sting out of administrative decisions, the Commission should give applicants the opportunity to correct formal errors within a set period from submitting the application.
All organisations that have received funding from the EU budget should also indicate this on their home pages or mention it in their annual reports.
That applies for all three programmes, both to give an overview of the organisationsâ activities and to make the European added value visible.
Education, youth and culture should be paid greater attention; they should not simply be mentioned or serve as padding for speech making.
Europeâs future lies in an open-minded youth, given an opportunity through strengthened educational institutions and organisations to build a Europe of common social prosperity, the foundation of which will be acceptance of cultural diversity and dialogue with art and culture.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we need to have basic legal acts that allow the Commission to proceed according to clearly defined principles when approving and managing grants.
The authorising officer, in other words, the Commission, needs such guidelines in order to comply with both the Financial Regulation and the wishes of the budgetary authority, namely Parliament.
I very much regret, however, Commissioner, the time pressure we are under, for which we are not responsible.
The Commission adopted this act at the end of May and we were unable to examine it earlier, and I find we are yet again in difficulties under such pressure of time.
There was no need for it, because it was clear, even before the Financial Regulation was adopted, that the present grants from Part A have to be replaced by multiannual programmes and it is therefore impossible to understand why the proposal came so late.
We are being made to bear the consequences of something that is not our fault.
Whose fault will it be if beneficiaries do not get any subsidies early next year?
The Commission will point its finger at us, the Council probably will too.
But it is not our fault.
We like to work carefully.
This time, again, we were not able to.
We really must do our best to ensure that it does not happen again, but we say that every time and I am having to say it again now.
We have three reports, which Mrs Prets has already mentioned, and I agree with much of what she said.
All three reports contain institutions and associations which are active as cultural ambassadors for Europe in the widest sense and which promote and foster the common cultural heritage in Europe.
This House has for years supported all these organisations; it even founded some of them.
Those that have been formed recently do not know that, of course, like the Youth Orchestra, the College of Europe, the University Institute in Florence, the Law Academy in Trier, the European Bureau for Lesser-Used Languages, the Mercator Network of Information and Documentation Centres, or the European Youth Forum.
Up until now these organisations really have done their job of providing information and working for the integration of Europe.
This also includes something that we have not created, but for whose existence I am grateful and for which you all really should be grateful: the FIME network, which has been working for European integration for 50 years in 118 houses in 32 European countries.
That is why I am unable to understand what you unfortunately found it necessary to say â I assume you were forced to do so by those who today briefed you with completely incorrect information.
In my opinion, we must say that the FIME is working well, that the FIME had an excellent audit early this year, that the FIME underwent an audit again three weeks ago, which consisted only in being asked to get all its files â 300 of them â to Brussels so they can be inspected there.
The FIME has offered to allow everything in it to be looked at properly, as laid down in an agreement with the Commission.
The result of that was that DG Press said that none of it was in order.
I can only say that what they reported was not in order.
We promised the FIME EUR 2.2 million in the last financial year.
It got none of that money this year, nothing, simply because one of the FIMEâs houses, Avignon, was guilty of a EUR 200Â 000 fraud.
Those EUR 200Â 000 could easily have been deducted from the 2.4 million and then the FIME would have been able to work.
If the Commission applied to itself the standards it applied to the FIME in this case, it would have been out of office long ago.
I had to say that because I am simply furious.
Unfortunately, my adversary is now Mrs Reding who cannot do anything about it.
She repeated what she had been given to say and I can only say that what she was given to say is not in accordance with the facts. And it can be checked by the courts.
The opinion of our group on the subject of earmarking: We are in favour of earmarking.
We will vote in favour of it.
We are against degressivity.
We will therefore also vote accordingly.
I would like to say once again in connection with earmarking here that I am glad the Commission has proposed retaining earmarking.
No doubt it did so because it knows that we as Members of the European Parliament are closer to the citizens than the officials sitting here in Brussels, and they know that we know what may be politically and also culturally relevant in these individual cases.
The Financial Regulation cannot rate higher than a basic act or than this budgetary authority.
That cannot be and I therefore believe, as our legal service has also said, that earmarking is right.
I hope that together we will get it through because I believe it will bring us closer to our common desire of bringing the citizens to Europe, of really finding the soul of Europe, than will what others have proposed here.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, unfortunately I cannot really defend my report on support for networks at European level in the field of culture.
My main proposals were narrowly defeated in the committee vote.
I hope that Parliament will be able to correct the situation in tomorrowâs vote, especially as the committeeâs proposal to continue the practice of earmarking in the funding of cultural organisations is clearly in contravention of the Financial Regulation, according to an opinion of Parliamentâs legal department.
I am appalled that even the Committee on Budgets is so obviously determined to act in contravention of the Financial Regulation.
Up till now I have defended the work of the Union to citizens in many contexts, because it is based on law and not on the power of the strongest.
Now I do not know what to say.
The Commission proposal for a Community action programme to promote organisations active in the field of culture was born of necessity: switching to an activity-based budget has made it unavoidable.
European cultural organisations formerly financed from Section A relating to administrative expenditure need a legal basis for funding to be able to continue.
The change will give us a unique opportunity to create an action programme for networks active at European level in the field of culture, where funding criteria can be determined and EU support for the networks can be organised in the way set out in Title 6 of the Financial Regulation, which emphasises the importance of the principles of transparency and equal treatment.
The Commission proposal under discussion covers not only cultural organisations active at European level funded under former budget line A-3042, but also the European Bureau of Lesser-Used Languages and the Mercator network centres funded under budget line A-3015 as well as grants under budget line A-3035 awarded for the preservation of Nazi concentration camps as historical monuments.
In this connection it should be stressed that the problems with the report do not concern these points: what is most essential for the funding of the European Bureau of Lesser-Used Languages and concentration camp memorials is that the legal basis should be brought into force from the beginning of the year.
We spoke here of haste, but I think that if we want to we can obtain some results quite quickly.
Differences of opinion regarding the funding of organisations active in the field of culture are connected with three points.
Firstly, the application process and Parliamentâs practice of earmarking are at odds with one another.
Secondly, there is the matter of how long the programme is to last.
As the Council on Education, Youth and Culture, which must decide unanimously on the issue, is, according to my information, definitely of the opinion that the programme should last until 2006, and not 2008, I have tabled an amendment on the matter.
I think it would be a very good idea to make the funding of cultural organisations part of the new culture programme in preparation.
The third problem is linked to degressivity with regard to amounts for grants.
On that point too I disagree with the majority on the committee.
A small and gradual fall is, I think, acceptable, to be able to make room too for new organisations.
We have to bear in mind such matters as EU enlargement.
Furthermore, the amendments I tabled contain the suggestion that, owing to a lack of time, the list the Committee on Budgets has decided upon, could be finalised next year.
This way the continuity, which is necessary, is guaranteed.
The application procedure for 2005 could then be commenced in good time at the start of the year.
I also propose that multiannual funding be made a possibility and that an addition be made to the funding criteria that safeguards the financing of, , European orchestras.
These proposals were overturned in the committee vote, although they are clearly in the interests of cultural organisations.
Thus far the debate on the Commission proposal has been in many ways a mind-broadening, though not entirely elevating, experience.
As I have stood for an open application procedure, I have wanted to make the present arbitrary and haphazard practice an open one based on clear rules.
At present there are organisations on our list which in fact no longer even exist.
We also have to bear in mind the interinstitutional division of labour.
The Commission puts forward a proposal and implements the will of the legislator.
Parliament is the legislator and in my view it should not try to wield any executive power.
As the draft EU constitution makes Parliament the primary legislator, Parliament must itself respect that role.
Â Â  . Mr President, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets for the three proposals we are dealing with today, I would firstly like to express the extent to which I believe the application of Rule 162(a) of the European Parliamentâs Rules of Procedures â enhanced cooperation between committees â has once again been emptied of any meaning.
Nobody questions that the aspects of co-financing and degressivity fall within the competence of the Committee on Budgets.
Nevertheless, the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport voted on and rejected the amendments by the Committee on Budgets on these two aspects, using the argument that it contradicted the other elements of the report.
This is the crux of the matter, and not only with regard to the three reports we are dealing with today, but with regard to enhanced cooperation in general.
This procedure is intended to facilitate cooperation between the competent committees and strengthen the role of the committee asked for an opinion.
But if, from the outset, there is not enough time to facilitate this cooperation and if, furthermore, it is sufficient for a single amendment to be presented in the committee responsible which contradicts what has been presented by the committee asked for an opinion, Rule 162(a) is automatically negated.
This is precisely what has happened in the Committee on Culture in relation to the opinion delivered by the Committee on Budgets.
In other words, that after Rule 162(a), we automatically moved on to apply Rule 162, that is, to deliver a normal opinion.
I am convinced that it is Rule 162(a) itself that contains the catch, and, in its current wording, all it does is create unnecessary conflicts between committees rather than promoting cooperation between them.
I therefore believe that it is essential that, with a view to the future, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs examine this rule, either with a view to revising it, or with a view to completely removing it.
Returning to substance of the proposals, I would like to focus on two aspects: co-financing and degressivity, which are the issues that have raised most problems.
I am talking about two fundamental aspects of the general system for awarding grants because they allow for the co-responsibility of the beneficiary for the correct use of grants and also ensure that the organisations do not depend solely and exclusively on Community grants in order to operate, thereby promoting their establishment in the future.
Furthermore, degressivity allows money recovered in this way to be able, in this case, to be used to subsidise new associations, particularly those in the enlargement countries.
The Commissionâs proposals therefore provide for co-financing and degressivity in the award of all these grants.
Nevertheless, I must express my surprise at the fact that the Commission has applied different percentages in these three proposals, which are the responsibility of the same Directorate-General, both for co-financing and for degressivity.
Since Article 109 of the Financial Regulation states that equal treatment must be one of the principles for the award of grants, it is not justifiable that associations with the same objective but which act in different fields should be subject to differing treatment.
The amendment approved by the Committee on Budgets called for all associations receiving a grant under any of the seven programmes â in accordance with the various groups of associations identified â should have the same rights and obligations in the aspects of co-financing and degressivity.
Furthermore, in the case of co-financing, it was not a question of establishing fixed percentages, but of establishing minimums that would then allow the executive authority to apply percentages in accordance with the real needs or possibilities of each association.
I would like to stress that it was not a question of seeking harmonisation, but of applying that principle of equal treatment.
For its part, the Committee on Culture eliminates degressivity in its three proposals, believing that all associations likely to receive a grant are of general European interest, within the meaning of the exception provided for in Article 113(2) of the Financial Regulation.
I believe that this is too broad an interpretation and I would question whether all these associations are genuinely of European general interest.
The Committee on Culture appears to have interpreted the maintenance of degressivity on the part of the Committee on Budgets as a kind of punishment of these associations when in reality it promotes â together with co-financing, as I said earlier â their establishment in the future, since nowhere is it written that these grants should be awarded
Otherwise, when the day comes that, for one reason or another, this source of funding runs out, all the associations could find themselves under serious pressure.
Finally - as I pointed out in my speech on grants during the last plenary session â lack of time has had a terrible effect on the whole of this procedure.
The Commission was under time pressure in presenting its proposals and Parliament has also been under time pressure with regard to the amended proposals we are presenting today.
Anybody who has studied them will have realised that they contain more than one contradiction.
I imagine that we are all guilty as well as victims in relation to this problem, but what worries me most is the extent to which the European Parliament's position will have been strengthened following tomorrow's vote, because what we have ahead of us, jointly, is a difficult conciliation with the Council, since the latter does not appear to be prepared to give ground on those points which it considers fundamental, such as pre-allocation, co-financing and degressivity, or the programmesâ financial framework.
Â Â  â First of all, I should like to thank the rapporteurs for the sound work that they have done.
Although they are not present right now, they will be able to read this in the Minutes.
As a Liberal, I am pleased about the fact that the Commission has tabled the proposal to provide a legal framework for support in the fields of culture, education, training and youth.
The procedures followed to date have not always been a guarantee for transparency and quality, and these are, after all, two requirements if Europe wants to become the world's most dynamic and competitive knowledge economy.
It is important for the Commission to keep this in mind when it makes the different calls for proposals to be submitted.
We need clear criteria for the awarding of subsidies to organisations and projects, and these must be clearly publicised, so that the applicants know where they stand.
The selection of organisations and projects must be done very carefully and must not be left to the Commission itself.
This is why I have started to argue in favour of involving independent experts.
In the Netherlands, we have a Council for culture.
This is an advisory council that issues well-founded advice to the minister, who acts upon this advice, unless there are very good reasons not to.
I can imagine that this could also be set up for the selection of organisations that are culturally active at European level.
This is a far purer procedure than the way we are operating at the moment. However, the question now at issue is whether or not to earmark.
Traditionally, my group has not been in favour of earmarking, but the selected organisations should be able to rely on a certain degree of continuity.
I have also spoken in favour of this within my group.
To my mind, the option of concluding multi-annual framework partner agreements is a good way of getting round this, but we must beware of these subsidies being maintained until the end of time.
Consequently, my group argues in favour of introducing the degressivity principle, which should kick-in in the third year.
According to my calculations, with an annual degressivity of 2.5%, as proposed by the Commission, the organisations can be supported for another forty years or so.
That, though, is quite a commitment for us, and even for our grandchildren.
This is why we, the Liberals, propose 10%.
In that way, the organisations can rely on thirteen years of support from us.
The possibility is thus created also to support new organisations, which, in the light of enlargement, should definitely not be overlooked.
Continuity, combined with room for innovation, that is my motto.
Unfortunately, we are facing a problem next year, in that the action programmes are expected to go ahead on 1Â January 2004, which is only a few weeks away, and nothing has yet been organised.
The organisations that have hitherto received subsidies run the risk of being left in the cold in 2004.
The Liberals want to prevent this from happening, and that is why a transitional arrangement should be put in place.
As a final point, I should like to indicate briefly that not only must the allocation procedures be transparent, but that matters should also be dealt with swiftly and efficiently.
I have mentioned this before and I should like to repeat it here: this is important and it applies to all three action programmes.
Â Â  Mr President, first I want to congratulate the three rapporteurs, especially Mrs Pack, because just before our sitting commenced, she proved that behind her harsh political voice there hides a sweet, melodic voice, and that is something very, very important.
I want to say that this reform, with the addition of the legal terms, was needed, is important and results in a better working order.
Nonetheless, I want to express a number of concerns.
These concerns relate both to certain permanent agencies receiving Community funds and to the procedure for selecting the agencies which are not permanent.
I fear that we are in danger of creating certain agencies that will eat up the Community budget and of complicating work which could be carried out through them.
On the other hand, by leaving an important area of the decision concerning these agencies to the Budget Authority, which are not permanent, I think that we reduce transparency and the proper criteria for selecting beneficiaries.
I want to express particular concern about the Youth programme.
I fear that the European Youth Forum is very detached from the new generation and from agencies which relate to the real world of youth.
I also fear that the criteria for the selected agencies, according to which, for example, an agency which pursues an objective of general European interest in the field of youth or an objective which forms part of the policy of the European Union can be selected, result in our castrating young people.
We should accept and encourage contestation and questions concerning the policies of the European Union.
Â Â  Mr President, I appreciate very much that the Commissioner is tiptoeing through a minefield, walking on egg shells and is certainly trying to do her best to see that we rescue something from the first-class programmes we have organised over many years.
We all know in this Chamber and in the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport that the work of the European Union must be carried out not only inside the institutions but also by people outside.
Fortunately, there are many worthy, hardworking organisations doing a great deal to promote European Union and cooperation.
In particular, the European Councils, the European Youth Orchestra, the European Youth Parliament and the Model Youth Parliament.
These organisations have been backed and supported by the European Union and the Parliament over many years by grants voted by Parliament.
It just seems incredible that in the year of enlargement and of the adoption of a new Constitution not to mention the European elections we should even be thinking about reducing or dropping funding for these emblematic institutions.
I would say to Mrs DÃŒhrkhop that we can always find ways of spending money on bureaucracies, jurors, and administrative procedures.
We need to find a way of getting the money to the people who are actually going to do some good with it.
To organise an orchestra which draws its players from the top conservatories across Europe requires a great deal of organisation and forward planning.
How can you book concert halls if you do not know that you are going to have the money?
Some of these procedures are simply going to cancel that effort altogether.
If the European Union cannot organise itself to give assistance, or simply will not, why should any other organisation be thinking of doing so?
As for the policy of digressivity, I normally agree with Mrs Sanders-ten Holte, but digressivity simply shows the lack of vision of the people who dreamt up that policy - a total lack of vision, in stark contrast to the vision of the founding fathers of Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to apologise for the absence of two other Members from my Group, Mrs Ahern and Mrs Echerer, who are not able to be present this evening.
I wish to express my thanks and gratitude to Mrs Sanders-Ten Holte, but my main thanks go to Mrs Prets, even though she is not present, for her excellent work on this report, which shows a great understanding for the needs and objectives of youth NGOs.
In an increasingly individualistic society, the role that youth NGOs play in engaging young people in civil society is crucial.
As said in its recent policy paper, youth NGOs are social agents that empower young people; they are environments for non-formal learning and are specifically suitable, therefore, for young people to learn democratic decision-making, intercultural understanding, self-motivation, project-management, conflict-resolution, organisation of skills and more.
Youth NGO activities are heavily reliant, of course, on grants.
That is why I welcome that all kinds of youth organisations, including and other international non-governmental youth NGOs, are excluded from the principle of digressivity which would mean a reduction of 2.5% in their funds from the third year onwards.
Guaranteeing a regular budget for these NGOs is the best way to support their activities and increase their effectiveness and efforts in creating a generation of young people that will become more socially involved.
I also support the proposal to improve the user-friendliness of the grant application process.
At the moment it is far too complicated.
Therefore, I completely endorse Mrs Pack's Amendment 16, which gives applicants the opportunity to correct errors after submitting their applications.
This should reduce the number of applications that are rejected for technical reasons.
I also very much hope that Mrs Pack's excellent report will be endorsed by a substantial majority to guarantee a legal basis to effectively fund international youth NGOs.
Â Â  Mr President, the action programme for education and training reflects the need to establish a proper legal basis for providing grants for organisations engaged at European level in the education and training fields.
I would like to see the programme supporting efforts to increase young people's awareness of the political system and indeed the promotion and the development of civics as well, although I know schools are not included in these particular programmes.
I would like to hear the Commissioner's views in relation to the importance of highlighting this aspect, which is particularly important in Irish society today.
The multiannual programme is to cover the period 2004 - 2008, and is valued, as we know, at EUR 129.62 million.
Would a shorter period be more beneficial to allow for an earlier review and to take into account developments arising from enlargement?
I strongly support efforts to bring this issue to a satisfactory conclusion so that the new programme is not delayed any further.
The Commission only adopted the proposals in May 2003, and therefore we cannot realistically expect the first grants to be available before late summer 2004.
I share the rapporteur's view about transparency.
I believe any beneficiary of EU funding should be obliged to indicate in a prominent place such as websites, annual reports and even on headed paper the fact that they are in receipt of EU grants.
Â Â  Mr President, I do not want to repeat what other Members have said, especially my colleague, Mrs DÃŒhrkop, but I should just like to give a warning in relation to two of the reports you have in front of you.
Later this month the Committee on Budgets will have a conciliation meeting with the Council on a variety of issues and one of those issues will be to get an across-the-board agreement on those areas where we have codecision.
There are seven areas in total, three of which are on the plenary agenda for this week.
We in the Budgets Committee especially through the work of Mrs DÃŒhrkop, who has worked in a very assiduous way have tried to seek an agreement on these reports.
We now find, however, that two of the reports are giving us serious problems.
If Amendments 19 to the Prets report and 14 to the Ilvari report are carried, we will have real problems when it comes to the conciliation.
In fact I am sure the Council and the Commission will say that the reports actually violate the Financial Regulation.
If Parliament were to reject those two amendments it would make life a lot easier.
I need to give warning now that, if those two amendments are carried, I, as Chairman of the Budgets Committee, would consider that to be a breach of Rule 63a.
In other words, we will taking into account the Financial Regulation and the budgetary consequences.
I will stand up during the vote to ask Parliament to support an oral amendment to ensure that both these reports fall into in line with the Financial Regulation.
Hopefully, when we come to conciliation, we can get a consensus on all the reports and not just five out of seven.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, I would also like to congratulate the three rapporteurs, MrsÂ Pack, MrsÂ Prets and MrsÂ Iivari, on the reports we are debating tonight.
I will refer firstly to the report on the youth programme and I would like to say that I believe it to be very positive because it proposes, amongst other things, bringing the European Union's institutions closer to young people, and I believe that this is absolutely correct because we must not forget that they are the future of Europe and it is they who must know us best.
Furthermore, it is very important that the opinions of these young people can be communicated to all the Members of this House and other people in the European institutions, because when it comes to making decisions it is very important to be aware of those opinions.
And providing youth programmes with stability and continuity, provided that the principle of subsidiarity is respected of course, is essential to their smooth operation.
With regard to the report on education and training, I would like to say that I completely agree with the constant quest for quality in teaching and education, and I believe it to be wonderful that this is being promoted at European level.
But I would like to add, in relation to the three reports in general, that we must attach more importance to education, youth and culture, because although we always say here that they are extremely important issues, the reality is that this view is not then reflected in the European Union's budgets.
And if they are not reflected in the budgets, it is very unlikely that our voters will believe us when we say it.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the subject which we are examining appears at first sight to be technical, yet it conceals behind it a very serious political dimension, in that it concerns the funding of organisations which, according to the wording repeated in the explanatory statements of all three reports, 'reinforce the European message' and operate in three crucial areas: youth, education and culture.
But why spend around EUR 40 million a year over five years in order to reinforce the so-called European message?
Because it would appear that the advertising and promotions carried out both by the services of the European Union and by the Member States in order to convince the peoples of the benefits of Europe are not enough.
Nor are the funds in these three sectors of educational exchanges and special programmes for youth and culture enough.
The daily experiences of the workers, unemployment, hardship, the attack on their rights and the commercialisation of everything prove exactly the opposite.
A multisided mechanism is therefore being constructed which even wants to involve and buy off independent organisations and foundations.
Without wanting to belittle the work of some of these organisations, we cannot but identify certain typical cases of funding, such as that of the European Youth Forum, which are an attempt at direct intervention in the youth movement in a bid to prevent the radicalisation of young people.
Of the action in the field of education, we single out funding for teaching about European integration in universities, the funding of foundations which promote the policy of the European Union, even training of national judges in Community law.
The Communist Party of Greece is categorically opposed to the erection of propaganda mechanisms which aim to conceal the anti-grass roots character of the European Union.
That is why we shall vote against all three proposals, without entering into the debate on the details.
Â Â  â Mr President, I, too, would like to thank the rapporteurs and I would like to concentrate on one question, in fact on the area of culture and Mrs Packâs report.
It goes without saying that we are emphatically in favour of a transparent and secure legal basis, but we must ask ourselves the question here as to what extent a common European cultural policy will in fact still be possible with this procedure, or are we concentrating exclusively on a procedure and the citizens are no longer so important?
Take the action programme to promote bodies active at European level in the field of culture, for example.
There are two funding structures, two sets of rules, one for so-called permanent organisations and one for the second area, which operates by calls.
There is no question but that we want to promote as many new initiatives as possible from the existing budget allocations. But the way proposed here and which was in particular decided by the Council at the first reading makes it impossible any longer to include European initiatives that actually deserve such support as permanent bodies.
As the report mentions, there is the European Bureau for Lesser-Used Languages, which is supposed to be one of these permanent bodies, but it cannot be the only one in the whole of Europe to have the right to be a permanent body of this kind.
The European Youth Orchestra, the Institute in Florence, the Institute in Trier, the College in Bruges: what sort of a proposal are they supposed to make?
How many European Youth Orchestras must there be to ensure sufficient support?
If there is any doubt, we must join with the Commission in entering into litigation with the Council to really make support for these possible.
Â Â  Mr President, I have listened very patiently to what has been said.
However, I should like to return to the realities.
What are those realities?
A new financial regulation has been decided on, by a vote in the European Parliament.
That new financial regulation has consequences.
Parliament was aware, when it voted in favour of the new financial regulation, that it would have consequences.
Now one of those consequences is that it is impossible to go on funding certain bodies in the way they have been funded in the past.
That is the problem.
Therefore we had to find a solution.
The easiest solution would have been to say that we shall just apply the financial regulation, then close the door and that would be the end of it.
The Commission, however, because it cares about bodies involved in youth, education and culture, did not choose the easy way out. It chose the difficult way.
In other words, despite the new financial regulation we are trying to ensure that we can continue to fund those bodies, and we have done so, because the proposal which is on the table now allows us to continue to finance the College of Europe in Bruges, the European University Institute in Florence, the Academy of European Law in Trier, the European Institute of Public Administration in Maastricht, the Human Rights Centre in Venice, the Jean Monnet Chairs etc. It also allows us to finance â and I shall not read the whole list, Mr President â the orchestras, the Chorale Academy, Europa Cantate, the Yehudi Menuhin Foundation, the Youth Academy Foundation, Europa Nostra, the Artistsâ Villages, Europalia, Euroballet, the Pegasus Foundation, the Boniface Memorial Foundation, and so on.
There are dozens of them, Mr President.
It also enables us to continue to provide funding for the Youth Forums and the youth organisations.
I am sorry, but when I hear that all these things will no longer be funded, I wonder what I have been doing for the last few months in trying to continue the funding despite a financial regulation which no longer permits that funding.
I think it is very disagreeable of Parliament to tell us that it received the proposal too late.
Parliament received the proposal in May, and we are now in November.
Why did Parliament not receive the proposal until May? It could have received it a month or two earlier.
It did not receive it then because, during those months, the Commission was achieving the impossible in order to safeguard cultural bodies, educational bodies and youth bodies, and in order to proceed in the direction desired by the European Parliament, in order to give assistance to those beneficiaries which Parliament had selected, quite rightly, so that they could switch from one system to the other without any interruption.
That is what we were doing during the months before May.
What remains to be done now, then?
What remains to be done is for Parliament to come to an agreement with the Council, because all our legal services have told us that earmarking, for example, which was Parliamentâs idea, would not be possible.
It was thanks to the Commission, to its assiduousness, and the way it forged ahead in order to find an intermediate solution, that it was possible to safeguard Parliamentâs earmarking.
The new financial regulation makes no provision for earmarking.
Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, let us keep both feet firmly on the ground.
If we took so long, it was because we needed to find solutions to an impossible situation, solutions that would be in the interests of our cultural, educational and youth bodies.
Parliament now has to vote on the amendments.
The Chairman of the Committee on Budgets has made it very clear: either Parliament votes in favour of those amendments which are likely, in the codecision procedure, to meet with the Councilâs agreement, in which case from January onwards, all those bodies to which we are committed will receive their money, or it votes in favour of amendments which will never receive agreement from anybody, in which case, come January, the bodies that I have just referred to, and there are dozens and dozens of them, will not receive any money at all.
I have done everything I can, Mr President, to make a solution possible.
I hope Parliament and the Council, for their part, will also do everything they can to ensure that the solution can be implemented with effect from January 2004.
Â Â  Mr President, would you allow a question to the Commission, although it does not strictly speaking conform to the Rules of Procedure?
Â Â  As an exception, I will give you fifteen seconds in which to ask your question.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, the Commissionâs proposal provides for transitional measures for the three proposals we are discussing.
Therefore, even if an agreement is not reached with the Council, could you explain to me how it is that there is a risk of certain organisations not having funding?
Â Â  Mr President, the risk is clear.
I should like to say to the honourable Member that if there is no agreement in the codecision procedure, if there is a delay, if we have to start discussing all the details again from the beginning, then no decision will be taken before the January 2004 deadline.
We may perhaps reach a decision in spring, or in summer.
I do not know, but I do know that throughout that time it will not be possible to pay the bodies in question, because without legal bases nobody will provide a signature so that a payment can be made.
That much is very clear. It would be illegal, and no one is going to accept the responsibility for doing something illegal.
Â Â  The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0279/2003) by Mrs Karamanou, on behalf of the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Equal Opportunities, on women in the new information society (2003/2047(INI)).
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, you certainly know that the lack of access to new technologies and digital illiteracy are increasingly developing into new forms of social exclusion which directly endanger women.
Evidence to date has revealed huge differences between the two sexes both in education and in the labour market.
The report which I have drafted on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights starts by listing the reasons, such as social stereotyping and cultural preconceptions, which restrict the options of girls and raise barriers to their careers, resulting in general negative consequences in the economy as a result of the non-rational use of human resources.
Over the last decade, we know that three million new jobs have been created, of which 1 600 000 have been taken up by women.
However, it should be noted that over 60% of the new jobs created are in the high technology sector, where women are underrepresented, especially at the higher levels of technical specialisation and at the decision-making level.
Hence, economic development in the field of modern technologies under present circumstances is exacerbating structural weaknesses and widening the gender gap.
The labour market is still divided by gender, with the men dominating in new technologies and women in lower paid jobs which call for less specialisation and offer less security.
In the field of research and science, women are not only seriously underrepresented, they are present in just a few scientific fields and completely absent from others, while they are markedly unequally represented throughout the scientific hierarchy and have less opportunity to secure funding for research.
Of the 500 000 researchers working in industry in Europe, only 50 000 are women.
In the public sector, universities and research centres, the percentage fluctuates between one quarter and one third, but in higher positions of responsibility the percentage is less than 12% for women.
In industrial research, the situation is even worse, and the new technology sector appears to be the worst of all.
Better access for women to research would certainly help to enrich scientific methods, themes and subject matters.
Similarly, in the field of the media, there is no representation of or participation by women journalists in positions of administrative responsibility, while no attention is paid to the issue of discrimination against women and images of women are often projected in the media which have nothing to do with reality.
