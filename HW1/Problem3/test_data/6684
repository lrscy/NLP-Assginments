Lastly, MrÂ President, we need to consider the importance of stability.
We shall see whether the outcome of the recent elections in Bucharest will lead to political stability.
I believe that that is what we all wish for, because only with stability can there be any hope of seeing Romania ready to meet its commitments.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, MrÂ NicolaÃ¯, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to congratulate MrÂ Moscovici on his excellent report, which is indeed, as he said, both honest and clear and does not ignore the shortcomings and failings that we can all still see in the case of Romania, like those associated with the freedom of the press, which is seriously deficient â and I am choosing my words carefully â the delays in ensuring that the judicial and police systems function independently and the corruption which is still all too prevalent.
Ladies and gentlemen, I started my career as a teacher of modern languages, and when I was marking exams or homework I realised that I would become increasingly harsh as I went on, and that I would be much tougher on the last papers than I had been on the first â to such a point that I would take another look at the first ones to make sure that I had been sufficiently fair.
Listening to this debate and hearing what some Members have to say, and also recalling this morningâs debate, I wonder whether we are not experiencing something similar here, because it seems to me that we are becoming increasingly harsh with each enlargement.
Is this to say that there are no problems?
Of course not.
I mentioned them and our rapporteur has clearly indicated where they lie, and said that considerable improvements are essential.
Ladies and gentlemen, I am fairly well acquainted with Romania and have had the opportunity on several occasions to urge those in positions of authority from all political sides to speed up work on implementing the reforms and transposing the necessary legislation and regulation.
Like the majority of the members of my group, I will be voting in favour of the recommendations in the Moscovici report.
I will be doing so not only because of my feelings for Romania, where I have many excellent friends, but also because, having visited the country as long ago as February 1990 and seen fresh evidence of the violence of the end of the previous year, I can fully appreciate how far it has already come.
We owe our friends understanding and friendship, but not weak or almost indifferent indulgence.
This has always been my attitude towards Romania, and it remains my attitude today.
My positive attitude remains fundamentally an attitude of vigilant friendship.
I hope that Parliament will adopt the same approach.
Â Â  Mr President, MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that more honesty is called for.
I am most grateful to Mr Lagendijk for his demand in this respect, even though we have arrived at different conclusions for Turkey.
He is absolutely right: we must demand honesty in relation to Romania as well.
In my view, this obviously means that we must dispense with a few of our dogmas.
The first is that deadlines which have been mooted at some point in the past are now regarded as more sacred than the progress made or the realities of the situation.
Let me be blunt.
We will not do ourselves any favours if we abide by 1 January 2007 as a date for Romania's accession.
Secondly â and Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I am directing these remarks specifically to you, as we had the pleasure of discussing the budget, among other things, with you â we are talking about a period for which we still have no budget, as we have yet to adopt a new Financial Perspective to cover the period from 1Â January 2007.
If you cling to your second dogma, namely the figure of 1%, we will be unable to cope with this financial burden.
We cannot argue that Europe is continually expanding and its agenda is becoming longer, while money is becoming increasingly tight.
Please be honest and make it clear that there is no funding.
We need to negotiate the Financial Perspective first, and then we will see whether everything adds up.
Thirdly â and again, let me be blunt â I have heard every speaker talk about the problems which we still have to overcome, not us, that is, but Romania, namely corruption, democracy and the rule of law.
Just what do we mean when we talk about membership of the European Union?
Is this not the precondition, as we learned today at noon?
According to the majority of Members of this House, this is not the precondition for the opening of negotiations.
I take a different view.
Ultimately, however, before we are handed an accession treaty â and we have been told that this will be available within the next six months â everything has to be in place.
We are deceiving ourselves if we proceed on the basis that monitoring processes and clauses which are built in but will never come into force because they require unanimity in the Council are enough to justify our confidence and convince us that everything will work out just fine.
That is why I am appealing to you, MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council, in relation to the drafting of the presidency conclusions on Friday.
I realise that you have a problem in that you have little to show for your presidency.
However, no one is reproaching you: during the six months in which you held the presidency, Europe was operating below par.
We had the European elections, and then it took some time for the Commission to be appointed and confirmed in office.
No one can blame the presidency for this.
However, you are responsible for ensuring that we do not deceive ourselves every six months.
That means that we should not claim, in Council documents, that significant progress has been made and improvements have yet again been achieved when this is not the case.
I therefore appeal to you to be honest when you draw up the presidency conclusions on Friday.
I appeal to the House as well: let us take an honest vote on this issue tomorrow.
Â Â  Mr President, we like to talk about a Europe of values.
How does this fit with the decision to admit Romania to the European Union in just two years time unless by some chance there should be a deferral of just 12 months, which hardly seems likely given that we have heard today that the Council has overridden the Commission's concerns in closing chapters, a deplorable example of over principle of which the Dutch presidency should be ashamed.
One of my colleagues said that we are being too severe on Romania.
How soft does she want us to be?
On the Commission's own admission, Romania suffers from serious and widespread corruption; it has a judiciary which is neither efficient nor independent; it does not possess genuine media freedom; it cannot implement the at local and regional level; it fails to prevent money laundering; it permits the ill-treatment of prisoners in custody; it fails to enforce laws against child and sexual trafficking.
Yet this is a country apparently now so close to meeting EU values that we are putting it on a certain course to accession.
It is not surprising that the EU may stand accused of being unable to say 'no' to anyone when it sets its sights so low.
The Commissioner says, and I quote from his recent parliamentary answer: 'It seems likely that Romania's future progress will be accelerated by its accession to the EU'.
However, neither he nor any of us know whether that will prove true.
So far we have been lucky: membership of the European Union has tended to make bad apples wholesome but perhaps we will reach the point where the bad apples infect the rest.
You only have to look at Lithuania, near the top of the world league for corruption, or to the United Kingdom, locking up people without charge or trial, to realise that Europe can very easily allow its values to be betrayed from within.
We do not have in place an effective mechanism for dealing with existing Member States that quietly reject the principles of good governance.
Perhaps the Commissioner can take a lead in building such a mechanism.
I wish the new Romanian Government well.
The results of last Sunday's election give hope for reform, although the result was no thanks either to the Commission or the Council, both of which played right into the hands of the former cynical government.
Romania's problems run deep.
Once applicants are allowed through the EU door, the Commission is deprived of its best weapons to secure change.
Instead of using the opportunity to apply maximum pressure to gain reform, we seem determined to set it on a conveyor belt to automatic accession.
Romania should join the European Union, but it should do when it meets the values of the EU.
It would be a grave mistake to set a date for accession now.
Â Â  â Mr President, maybe Bulgaria and Romania are being wronged by our debating Turkey's accession prospects over the last few days in the European Parliament â and shall also be doing so in the European Union, at the European Council, in a few days' time.
I believe that forecasts on the subject of Turkey are overshadowing both the expression and the weighting of our political word.
I should like to start by referring to a topical matter, the finalisation yesterday of the results of the elections in Romania.
The new President has been named and the results of the election have been accepted by his fellow candidate, putting an end to any disputes relating to the electoral process.
Nonetheless, the new President will have to achieve the strong backing of parliament if he is to honour immediately the commitments which Romania has given to the European Union.
Given the almost balanced presence of the main political forces in the Romanian parliament, cooperation amongst everyone and serious joint efforts will be needed for the successful continuation of European integration.
Ladies and gentlemen, by my reading, Romania has made significant progress, especially in such a short space of time, in coming into line with political and economic accession criteria.
Nonetheless, we should not overlook the need for further radical reform, focusing on the efficient combating of corruption and changes in the public administration and in the judicial system, in the aim of securing truly independent justice.
In addition, further measures need to be taken in the sectors of border controls, asylum and immigration policy and more drastic action to combat organised crime and corruption.
At economic level, it is considered necessary, , to safeguard macro-economic stability, rationalise the role of the state in the economy and introduce efficient regional and rural development policies and policies for greater regional integration and cooperation with the countries of south-eastern Europe.
My personal appraisal is that, with the support of the European Commission and with the precondition, of course, of more intense effort, it is feasible that Romania will be able to comply more fully with the criteria and the values and principles of the Union and sign an accession agreement at the same time as Bulgaria.
Â Â  Mr President, firstly I wish to thank my colleague, MrÂ Moscovici, for an excellent report, and one that takes account of different points of view.
Candidate countries must be treated equally and fairly.
Romania must fulfil the conditions imposed on it, just as the others did when they acceded to the Union.
We are not striving for perfection here: none of the present Member States of the Union is perfect.
Problems have been mentioned here today relating to Romaniaâs home affairs and issues of justice.
MrÂ Basescu, winner of the Romanian presidential elections, promised the Romanians in his victory speech an unsullied administration and an independent civil service.
This promise must be taken seriously and must be fulfilled.
We have to encourage Romania to bring about reforms.
I wish to emphasise the importance of promoting human rights in the future.
Attention should not just be paid to the viability of public administration: human rights issues are at least as important, if not more so.
Trafficking in human beings is something for which there must be zero tolerance, both in Romania and elsewhere in Europe.
Unfortunately, even the credibility of the present Member States suffers on this issue.
We cannot establish a margin of tolerance for trafficking in human beings: it has to be completely prohibited.
Romania also needs support in its implementation of the new law on child protection.
Finally, I wish to express my thanks to Commissioner Rehn, as he has promised to keep Parliament very well informed.
In my opinion, that is a very important point.
Romania should be ready for membership, but the current Member States should also be ready to accept Romania as a member, and dialogue between the Commission and Parliament can only further that endeavour.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, the Romanian people have just voted a different political party into power for the second time since the revolution.
Does this not prove that democracy is working in this country, which has suffered under both dictatorship and communism?
That is why Romania cannot be compared to other countries, because the after-effects of this twofold oppression are still being felt.
It will take several more generations before the insane decisions of a dictator and a secret police, the , cease to affect how people behave.
Our report does not mention the issue of the , which nevertheless presents a significant problem in terms of human resources.
In fact, Romania has not yet emerged from this difficult period.
MrÂ President, have we considered that the young people who were born after the dictatorship have not yet reached the age of majority?
Where is this nation to find untainted, independent staff, who have not been close to the dictator, who have not belonged to the communist or been part of the to fill posts in these administrations and thus ensure that they are independent, which is what we require?
The progress made towards accession to the European Union should be considered from two different viewpoints: the desire of the political classes for change and the ability to achieve it in practice.
The proposal to delay Romaniaâs accession that has been made by the very same people who were in favour of Turkey this morning is something with which I have difficulty, and I actually find it extremely arrogant.
It is only 15Â years since the revolution in Romania, which could just as easily have led to a civil war.
We must therefore hope that President Basescu succeeds in forming a coalition that has the national interest at heart, rather than the profile of the different political parties.
Although President Iliescu and President Constantinescu, a one-time member of this European Peopleâs Party, have not managed to put in place all of the necessary reforms, we must nevertheless acknowledge that they have brought relative institutional stability to the country.
Let us then, rather than playing the schoolmaster, have some respect for the efforts already made and accurately assess what remains to be done.
MrÂ President, 2007 will in any case be a great year for Romania because in 2007 a Romanian city, Sibiu, will share the title of European Capital of Culture with Luxembourg.
This proposal was made by the Luxembourg Government, and was the subject of a joint decision by the Council of Ministers and the Commission.
The rich multicultural and multiethnic Romanian heritage will certainly enrich the culture of Europe, and Romania should also be seen from the point of view of its cultural riches and the potential of its population, which has been badly bruised by the madness of a dictator and the damaging effects of a totalitarian ideology.
MrÂ President, this morning I voted in favour of starting negotiations with Turkey.
I am also in favour of Romaniaâs accession, and will seek to ensure that we do all we can to make this a reality.
I believe that our rapporteur has drawn the right conclusions in his report, and I am grateful to him.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank Mr Moscovici for his excellent report.
With the accession of Romania and Bulgaria, the fifth round of enlargement will have been implemented, creating a larger, democratic Europe, which will take its place on the world political stage as a place of great promise and profound concerns, distinguished by being the Europe of citizenship.
Europe is thus not just a free-market and free trade area with a single currency, but above all it has the ability and desire to peacefully export the model consisting of the rule of law, protection of minorities and human rights, sustainable development, as well as an economy and finances that are efficient and designed to promote cohesion.
That is what the spirit and the letter of the Constitutional Treaty and the Nice Charter affirm.
We therefore welcome the successes and steady improvement that Romania has achieved in meeting the Copenhagen criteria in the various fields, as MrÂ Moscovici has indicated, emphasising, , its respect for its minorities, both Hungarian and Roma.
Romania must, however, make rapid progress to fulfil all the accession commitments, especially in the area of the Community .
Structural measures are not enough to combat poverty.
Corruption also needs to be fought through preventive measures and all laws need to be enforced.
Lastly, we feel that the improvement of legislation on child protection and international adoptions is a positive step.
Regarding the latter area, I would call on the Romanian authorities to find an immediate solution to the problem of adoptions hit by delays, which are depriving children of the families to which they are entitled.
In the name of that universal right, which is one of the strong points of the Constitutional Treaty, and in addition to the creation of an international commission to start work straight away, I call on the newly-elected Romanian authorities not to waste precious time and, for Christmas, to give those children the parents that already love them and with whom they can build a better future in a peaceful Europe.
Â Â  . Mr President, I will be brief.
I have heard many positive remarks, most of which I agree with.
Of course, there were also many concerns expressed, many of which I also agree with.
There were some critical remarks, with which I do not agree, from MrÂ Ferber, Mr Lagendijk and others, that Romania is not ready to close the negotiations.
I emphasise that we, as a presidency and as a Council, base our position on the assessment of the European Commission.
Romania is not ready for accession, which is why we feel it is important to have two more years to achieve the whole framework for the negotiations, as we discussed before, with extra guarantees and extra safeguards.
In response to Mr Lagendijk's remarks, we do not need unanimity in the Council for using this extra safeguard clause â the possibility of postponing the accession for a maximum of a year.
No, precisely in the area of justice and home affairs which he mentions â as many members did â and also in the sensitive area of competition, we only need a qualified majority for using the extra safeguard clause.
The rapporteur, Mr Moscovici, Mr Meijer and others made some remarks about signals from Romania that the president-elect wants to renegotiate the results.
The president-elect seems to have noticed critical remarks about the idea of reopening some chapters.
We learned from Bucharest that MrÂ Basescu is emphasising the efforts to be made before January 2007, which leave no room for reopening the final results of the negotiations.
In a short reply to Mr Ferber about the financial consequences of accession, I repeat what I said about Bulgaria.
The financial consequences are already arranged in the financial package for 2007-2009, irrespective of the new financial perspective.
Let me conclude with my compliments to Mr Moscovici.
His report addresses all the important areas in a constructive and even-handed way.
Â Â  . Mr President, I wish to join the President-in-office of the Council in thanking MrÂ Moscovici, and I would like to make one or two comments and reply to those questions that have been raised in this debate.
Firstly, MrÂ Tabajdi said he appreciated the Commissionâs objectivity and impartiality.
I thank him for this and I wish to stress that in future this should be a guiding principle in all enlargement policy.
My view is that after last yearâs major setback we shall now be proceeding gradually and steadily in terms of the enlargement of the European area of peace and democracy.
Our negotiations with the candidate countries will be gradual, steady, careful and thorough.
In this regard, I understand in general the views expressed by MrÂ Ferber.
It is a pity he did not have time to hear my reply.
As MrÂ Ferber demanded honesty of the EU, that is to say ourselves, I agree that we should assess the effects of all decisions taken on enlargement and that we need to adhere to the criteria.
It is for that very reason that we have proposed a safeguard clause in the chapters relating to justice and home affairs and competition.
This safeguard clause may be adopted by qualified majority, which makes it credible, and it will encourage Romania to work and strive to achieve results.
Several speakers have also quite rightly given attention to the challenges that lie ahead for Romania, including improving the environment and the status of minorities as well as promoting the fight against corruption and crime.
These are areas we continually monitor and will return to in detail when the Monitoring Report comes out next autumn. It is then that we shall evaluate the progress that has been made over the months to come.
Romaniaâs new government will have a golden opportunity to demonstrate that it can genuinely fulfil its commitments and reform the countryâs society and institutions.
MrÂ Davies and MrsÂ JÃ€Ã€tteenmÃ€ki pointed out that the current Member States also have much to do to develop the rule of law.
One can only agree with this.
These issues, however, do not fall within the competence of the Commissioner for Enlargement.
Rather, it would be better to address these problems via the infringement procedure or present a case using the machinery of the European Court of Human Rights.
In conclusion, I wish to thank the rapporteur, MrÂ Moscovici.
I agree with the view expressed by both him and MrÂ Szent-IvÃ¡ny that it is in the interests of both the European Union and Romania that Romania is ready by 2007.
This in the first instance depends on Romaniaâs willingness and ability to reform the country and its society.
The Commission, for its part, will give all the support it can to ensure that Romania strengthens its efforts so as to pre-empt the use of the safeguard clauses referred to just now.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will be at 11.30 a.m. tomorrow.
Â Â  The next item is questions to the Council (B6-0136/2004).
We shall consider a number of questions.
I should first like to clarify the following: according to our Rules of Procedure, when a Member who is scheduled to ask a question cannot be here, he or she must personally request a replacement to speak on his or her behalf.
Accordingly, the Bureau cannot accept replacements by third parties, such as political group secretaries-general.
The requests for replacement by the Members who asked Questions Nos 4 and 7, MrÂ Aylward and Mr Ryan, are therefore not accepted, and if at the time of the questions concerned those Members are not here, the questions will be deemed to have lapsed.
Before you answer the first question, Mr NicolaÃ¯, I should in any case like to remind the House what MrÂ Vidal-Quadras told us this morning â that this sitting must finish today at 6.30 p.m., due to commitments that the Councilâs representative cannot postpone.
Â Â  . The Council would refer the honourable Member to the answer it gave to question H-0399/04, by Ryszard Czarnecki, during Question Time on 17 November 2004, in which it suggested that the honourable Member should put his question to the Commission.
Â Â  â Mr President, MrÂ NicolaÃ¯, I should like to inform you that I put my question to the European Commission, but regrettably I did not receive a satisfactory answer.
With your permission, I should like to make known my dissatisfaction at the alarming muddle that exists with regard to this issue, as well as the bureaucratic hurdles, which may well be intentional.
It is no easy task to identify exactly which body is competent to take decisions regarding aluminium imports from Russia and the countries belonging to the Commonwealth of Independent States.
Poland has repeatedly applied to the European Commission for these customs duties to be reduced, yet unfortunately its applications have been rejected without adducing any clear or material reasons.
This is why, MrÂ NicolaÃ¯, I am appealing to you and asking you to take action on this issue, so as to help both Polish entrepreneurs and entrepreneurs from other countries.
Â Â  . This issue, I repeat, is really the exclusive competence of the Commission, so I cannot answer the question.
Â Â  . The Council recalls that Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999, laying down general provisions on the structural funds, sets out the Community initiatives as one of the instruments of regional policy within the framework of the structural funds.
In the current programming period of 2000-2006 there are four Community initiatives.
One of them is Interreg. This covers cross-border transnational and interregional cooperation intended to encourage a harmonious, balanced and sustainable development of the whole of the Community area.
Interreg III has three sections dealing respectively with cross-border cooperation: the promotion of integrated regional development between bordering regions; cross-national cooperation, contributing to an integrated and harmonious territory across the European Union; and interregional cooperation to improve the policies and techniques of interregional economic development.
Therefore, the Pyrenees/Mediterranean Euroregion could benefit from the support of this Community initiative, subject to the procedures established by the Commission.
The Council also recalls that the Commission has proposed the creation of an instrument called 'European groupings of cross-border cooperation'.
This would be given a legal personality to overcome the obstacles hindering cross-border cooperation.
This proposal is currently being examined by the preparatory bodies within the Council and also has to be considered by the European Parliament within the framework of the codecision procedure.
Â Â  I would like to point out that there are more than a hundred Euroregions in Europe and that, in fact, through the impetus of INTERREG, the Community initiative which is right now going also to become an objective, they are of particular interest.
I would like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council whether he believes that Euroregions such as the Pyrenees-Mediterranean are fundamental, both in terms of promoting the disappearance of the borders which represent barriers to economic and social development, and in terms of giving substance to the principle of territorial cohesion, which is now enshrined in the European Constitution, which has been signed by the 25 representatives of the Governments of the Member States, and which therefore deserves every possible support from the Union?
Â Â  Mr President, we have, on occasions, received complaints from the European regions that it is the Governments of the States that distribute the Cohesion Funds and also the regional element of the Structural Funds, and on occasions those regions of the same political colour as the Government of the State receive favourable treatment.
Mr Barnier, then Commissioner responsible for Regional Policy, announced to us an instrument which the regions could access directly without having to go through the Governments of the States.
I do not know whether the initiative on European cross-border cooperation groupings, which is on the table in the Council and will also come to Parliament, is the instrument Mr Barnier was referring to.
Would the Council agree that the regions should have the possibility of accessing the funds directly without having to go through the Governments of the States?
Â Â  .
I tried to be comprehensive in my initial remarks, but I will add that Member States and regional and local authorities have experienced major difficulties in carrying out managing actions of cross-border cooperation, transnational cooperation and interregional cooperation within the framework of differing national laws and procedures.
That calls for appropriate measures at EU/Community level in order to reduce the difficulties.
Harmonious development of the entire Community territory and reinforced economic, social and territorial cohesion imply enhanced cross-border cooperation and the adoption of measures to improve the implementation conditions for cross-border cooperation.
Â Â  . In reply to the honourable Member the Council stresses that it has not altered its position following the US decision to recognise the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia under its constitutional name.
At the first meeting of the Stabilisation and Association Council between the EU and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia of September 2004, the Council noted that the differences over the name of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia persisted and encouraged the search for a mutually acceptable solution, within the framework of United Nations Security Council Resolutions 817/93 and 845/93, by Greece and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
Indeed, in a joint press statement of the EU-Western Balkans Forum of November 2004, the foreign ministers of both the EU and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia recalled the need for all participants to agree on finding mutually acceptable solutions and concluding agreements on outstanding issues with neighbouring countries.
Â Â  â Minister, allow me to respond with a supplementary question: does the Council consider that this long-outstanding issue of the name might create problems in the desirable further of this country towards the European institutions?
What further action does the Council intend to take in order to persuade the government of the FYROM to maintain during talks in New York a more constructive stand in the negotiations to find a mutually acceptable solution?
Â Â  . That is more or less another question and I have nothing to add to what I have just said.
Â Â  As the author is not present, Question No 4 lapses.
Could the Council indicate what efforts the European Union will make in the coming months to lobby the American Administration so that it complies fully with the political obligations of the Kyoto Protocol?
Can the Council indicate clearly what international efforts will be undertaken by the European Union to ensure that all countries in the world comply with the clear and unequivocal commitments of the Kyoto Protocol?
If the European Union is to become more competitive, access to new technologies must be available to all communities in Europe.
The European Union is committed to implementing what is called the IDABC Programme, which is designed to promote the use of the Internet in public and government services.
This is part of the pan-European eGovernment Services Initiative.
Can the European Council indicate what progress has been made in implementing this programme, which is such a central component to improving the availability of information technologies in Europe?
Â Â  . The Council would like to inform the honourable Member that the implementation of the IDABC Programme falls within the remit of the Commission, which is assisted in this by the pan-European eGovernment Services Committee.
The Council would also like to remind the honourable Member that the IDABC Programme decision will only enter into force on 1 January 2005 and thus the implementation of the programme as such has not yet started.
The Council invites the honourable Member to refer this matter to the Commission for more details regarding the preparation of the programme.
The Council is aware of two studies launched by the Commission under the IDA Programme.
One study aims to establish the needs and benefits to businesses and citizens of pan-European eGovernment Services in order to reinforce a properly oriented approach to the delivery of a pan-European service.
The second one aims to identify future infrastructure services needed to support the pan-European eGovernment Services.
Likewise, in the preparation of the IDABC Programme, the Council also acknowledges the organisation of by Commission of a conference due to take place in Brussels on 17 and 18 February 2005, which will focus on the requirements for pan-European eGovernment Services for citizens and businesses and on the factors needed to implement them.
Â Â  I thank the President-in-Office for his response.
The reason I put the question to him was because when this was originally discussed as a programme, it came from the Council, and the Netherlands Government was one of the governments, together with the Irish Government, the Luxembourg Government and the Italian Government, which were putting it forward as a proposal that should be pushed at Commission level.
Following on from what you have said and what you know that the Commission is undertaking, are there any particular initiatives that the presidency wants to see carried forward from its presidency to the Luxembourg presidency to ensure that the role of this programme is fully implemented?
Â Â  . Apart from these major actions, the IDA Unit is preparing to launch the programme fully during the first half of 2005.
To that end, anticipated activities are being analysed and formats for work programme entries, project implementation plans, etc. are being developed.
Â Â  . As the Council has repeatedly said, safety and security lie at the heart of the European Union maritime policy.
Measures to improve them, as well as to protect the marine environment, represent the bulk of legislation adopted in this area in the five years since the disaster.
In its response to this and other similar incidents, the Council has consistently supported a dual approach: on the one hand, incorporating the provisions of international conventions into Community law and thus ensuring stricter compliance with the highest global standards and, on the other hand, adopting specific Community provisions wherever IMO standards are lacking or insufficient.
In this way a comprehensive body of maritime safety legislation has been built up and is continuing to expand.
Amongst the specific measures adopted in the intermediate aftermath of the disaster, were firstly those under the Erika I package aimed at enhanced port state control to combat substandard shipping; stricter monitoring of the classification companies use to conduct safety checks on ships; and the accelerated phasing-out of single-hull oil tankers.
Secondly, there were those under the Erika II package aimed at the establishment of a Community vessel traffic monitoring and information system and the creation of a European Maritime Safety Agency whose main role is to monitor the effectiveness of the EU maritime safety rules in general.
Other measures include those designed to improve the safety of ships other than oil tankers, such as passenger vessels, to ensure a minimum level of seafarers' training and to reduce pollution from ships.
For improving security in the wake of a number of terrorist outrages, a regulation on enhancing ship and port facilities security was adopted earlier this year, incorporating the SOLAS ISPS measures into EU legislation and expanding them to include domestic traffic.
Currently under consideration by the Council are measures to implement the IMO International Safety Management Code within the Community, so penalties can be imposed for certain pollution offences and port security enhanced.
Finally, looking ahead, a new package of maritime safety measures is expected to be submitted for examination by the Council in spring 2005.
Â Â  I would like to thank the President-in-Office for his reply.
Could he give assurances therefore that in the future, depending on the financial perspectives, there will be provision for maritime safety measures from the Union in the coming years?
Â Â  â Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the proposal for a directive to impose sanctions for marine pollution remained pending during the Dutch Presidency because certain countries expressed disagreement, including Greece.
I am aware of the fact that Greece proposed certain amendments in order to accept this directive.
Can the Council describe to us the content of these amendments which were tabled by the Greek Government?
Â Â  . The last question was a more or less new question.
This first question is also on another issue.
We will be having many discussions on the financial perspectives and this is one of the many issues we will discuss.
As you know, the Council has not decided anything on the new financial perspectives.
We have only taken an overview of the so-called building blocks and these building blocks reflect the different positions of the Member States to the Commission's proposals.
Â Â  As the author is not present, Question No 7 lapses.
Can the Council indicate what funds have been disbursed by the European Union with a view to halting the cultivation of drugs in Afghanistan for the year 2004 and what funds the European Council envisages that it will disburse in this specific policy area over the next two years?
Following the adoption by the Council of the Regulation on Administrative and Legal Cooperation for Consumer Protection, does the Council have any plans to coordinate progress on Member State cooperation on stamping out cross-border fraud and rogue traders operating dishonest prize draws, misleading marketing and similar cross-border crime?
Â Â  . Mr President, the adoption of the regulation of the European Parliament and the Council on cooperation between national authorities responsible for the enforcement of consumer protection laws â the so-called Regulation on Consumer Protection Cooperation â does not, as such, have any bearing on law enforcement cooperation between Member States.
Member States' police and judicial authorities are already actively cooperating in the fight against all types of crime.
The Council has adopted various instruments on cross-border cooperation in the fight against crime, notably in the context of mutual recognition and enforcement.
These instruments, in principle, have a general scope and are not limited to specific types of crime.
Â Â  That answer illustrates why I asked the question.
This kind of crime affects citizens from across the European Union; it is an accelerating form of crime.
Members in this House will know of people who have been scammed, very often vulnerable European citizens â the elderly, for instance.
Will the presidency recognise that there are certain forms of crime which are naturally cross-border issues?
For example, I represent London, where much of this crime takes place, but people are being scammed across the EU.
I should like to ask the Council to take seriously a form of crime that is not being dealt with across borders.
There is too little cooperation between Member States on this kind of growing crime and we know that our European citizens expect us, as parliamentarians, to question you on how effective you can be in solving this kind of cross-border issue.
Â Â  I want to reinforce the points just made by my colleague.
As an MEP I receive many letters from concerned constituents who have been defrauded by people operating in other Member States of the European Union, particularly through fraud through fax machines, sending false contracts and falsely announcing prize-draw winners.
A lot of these are based in Luxembourg, which will hold the next presidency of the EU.
Frankly it brings the EU into disrepute when we are told that there is nothing that can be done about this situation.
If citizens are to gain any advantage from EU cooperation, it should be precisely in tackling these sorts of problems.
Â Â  .
We understand the problem and I take note of your remarks. Unfortunately I have nothing to add to what I said before.
Â Â  . From its outset, at the beginning of the year, the Darfur crisis has been one of the absolute priorities on the EU agenda.
Throughout the year the European Union has been at the forefront of international efforts to contain and resolve the conflict in Darfur, to stop the massive human rights violations taking place there and to prevent an already very serious humanitarian situation from deteriorating further.
Member States and the Community have contributed to the humanitarian relief efforts with more than EUR 325Â million.
The Union has also strongly supported the African Union's leading role in addressing the crisis.
The EU has thus played a key role in support of an AU-led ceasefire monitoring mission and is now actively supporting the deployment of the expanded mission.
Almost 60 per cent of the total cost of the expanded AU mission is financed by a contribution of some EUR 80 million from the peace facility, and several Member States are providing additional financial and logistical support for the mission as well as planners and military observers.
The Council has repeatedly, most recently on the occasion of its meeting on 22 November, confirmed its readiness to continue to provide support for the deployment of the mission in terms of financing, logistics and material, as well as personnel if requested.
The Council considers that the deployment of the expanded AU mission in Darfur, together with the EU-led negotiations between the parties to find a political solution for Darfur, offers an opportunity for a comprehensive solution to the Darfur conflict.
In parallel to these efforts, the EU has contributed to the pressure from the international community on all parties to guarantee free and unconditional access for humanitarian aid and to ensure the security of the civilian population.
The Council is closely monitoring compliance by all parties with the demands expressed by the EU and the rest of the international community and the commitments it has undertaken with the UN.
To this end, the EU collaborates closely with the UN Secretary-General's Special Representative for the Sudan and actively takes part in the work of the Joint Implementation Mechanism that evaluates the implementation of the joint communiquÃ© which consists of the commitments of both the Sudanese Government and the United Nations.
In line with Resolutions 1556 and 1564 of the UN Security Council, the Council has also on several occasions reiterated its willingness to take appropriate measures, including sanctions, if no progress is achieved on the commitments made by the Sudanese Government.
Â Â  Mr President, I thank you for your outline of the situation in the Sudan.
Just today we have had news from the relief agencies operating out of Ireland that the situation is worse, not better.
I should like to ask you to indicate when we might actually implement sanctions, as opposed to just threatening them.
Over half a million people are now in dire circumstances in the Sudan.
It may have gone from the headlines, but the problem is still there.
Â Â  . I agree.
As you may know, last Monday the Council also discussed the situation in Sudan and we are seriously concerned about the deterioration of the security and humanitarian situation in Darfur.
The Council therefore called on all parties to abide in full by their commitments.
We also encouraged them to conclude the negotiations between the Government of Sudan and the SPLMA before the end of the year.
The Council will continue to monitor the situation in Darfur and will consider taking appropriate measures, which could include sanctions in accordance with UN Security Council Resolutions 1556 and 1565 if no tangible progress is achieved in this respect.
Hence the situation is and remains high on the agenda of the European Union.
Â Â  . The Council would like to point out that, from a general point of view, in the conclusions that the Council adopted after its meetings of 4 and 5 April 2001 on a recommendation from the European Commission on the maximum permitted blood-alcohol content for drivers of motorised vehicles, the Council encouraged the Commission to monitor closely and evaluate the effects of its recommendation for a period of three years, paying specific attention to the proposals in the recommendation on legal blood-alcohol content and, if appropriate, submit new legislation in that respect.
Up until now, the Council has not been informed of the outcome of such an evaluation.
That being so, the Council underlines that these conclusions do not call specifically for the introduction of a maximum permitted blood-alcohol content of 0.2Â mg for professional drivers.
Furthermore, the Council would like to inform the honourable Member that it does not have any information on how many Member States have introduced the aforementioned BAC levels so far.
However, the Council would like to draw the honourable Member's attention to the Commission recommendation of 6 April 2004 on enforcement in the field of road safety, which, in Recommendation 6, calls for an intensified application of random breath testing with an alcohol screening device as a leading principle for surveillance of drink driving.
The Council wants to ensure the honourable Member of its strong and ongoing commitment to improving road safety and to tackling all potential sources of road accident fatalities.
In this context it refers to the Council conclusions on road safety from June and December last year, both of which explicitly refer to stricter enforcement, in particular seatbelt use, speeding and drink driving.
In the light of this ongoing commitment the Council had an exchange of views during its meeting on 9 and 10 December 2004 and adopted the Council conclusions on road safety, in which it agreed on the need to focus road safety policies in four important areas, namely enforcement and best practices, vehicle safety, improving safety on European roads and funding road safety.
In this context the Council underlined that, with regard to road safety enforcement, priority should be given, notably, to driver behaviour that causes high accident risks or could have severe consequences such as driving under the influence of alcohol.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I wish to thank the Council for its answer, but I am clearly unhappy to hear that the issue is falling into a black hole between the Commission and the Council.
There is every opportunity in this case for the Council to take the initiative.
We know that approximately 10Â 000 people die on the roads each year because of driving under the influence of alcohol.
We also know that commercial driving is an important area when it comes to getting to grips with drink-driving.
That is why this recommendation is important, and I see no reasons why the Member States should not take these initiatives.
The conclusions also include a paragraph about follow-up, which would permit further discussions about enabling alcohol screening devices to be introduced into cars.
This is a technical invention with which industry too works.
I should like to hear whether discussions are being conducted in the Council about the possibility of introducing alcohol screening devices into vehicles.
Â Â  . I am sorry my answer did not satisfy the honourable Member.
I thought I had explained the many actions and things we, as a Council, have done to show our commitment to this issue.
We have to put our formal position into effect, as well as the formal position of the Council towards individual Member States.
As I tried to explain before, the matter is now in the hands of the Commission and we await its evaluation and proposals.
Â Â  . The Council notes that increasing overall expenditure on research is indeed a central element in the Lisbon strategy and one of the keys to making the EU more competitive in the global economy.
The Council and Member States have repeatedly committed themselves to achieving average research and development expenditure of 3% of GDP by 2010.
The recent Kok report once again highlighted the need to make good the under-performance in relation to this target.
Notwithstanding this general statement, the Council does not share the honourable Member's view that it is the Stability and Growth Pact which is preventing Member States from achieving the Lisbon objective.
Perhaps more fundamentally, the Stability and Growth Pact should be used as a tool to encourage national expenditure on individual budget components over and above others.
Firstly, it is clearly possible to fund research while respecting the Pact.
This is a very important point that leads on to the second point that the Pact is not the factor limiting investment in research.
Research funding is rather a matter of national priorities.
Thirdly, I would note that the level of R[amp]D expenditure is not solely dependent on public finance.
The target covers privately-funded R[amp]D as well, which can be encouraged by a number of means in addition to public expenditure.
The key to reaching the 3% target is the two thirds of R[amp]D spending that should be privately funded, not the one third that should come from public funds.
Finally, I would like to recall that the Pact is a framework for the management of budgetary policies at global level, with a view to ensuring the sustainability of public finances over the longer term.
All expenditure has to be paid for, even if in the longer run we would hope that investment would have positive returns.
When the Ecofin Council discussed the Pact on 16 November 2004 and this precise issue was raised, there was a broad majority of Member States against pursing the possibility suggested by the Member and excluding certain categories of expenditure from deficit calculations.
In the analytical assessment of the reasons for an excessive deficit, the Council will always take into account the type of expenditure and the likely long-term impact.
But the Council does not share the honourable Member's assessment regarding the exclusion of R[amp]D expenditure from deficit calculations.
Â Â  â Mr President, I might have agreed with everything Mr NicolaÃ¯ said if I did not believe that we cannot achieve the Lisbon objectives unless research makes a great deal of progress.
Thus, if the reply concerned any other subject, I would agree with you.
However, I regret that I must disagree because research is the cornerstone of Lisbon.
Â Â  . Only two EU Member States have already reached the Lisbon goal of 3% of GDP spent on R[amp]D â Finland and Sweden.
They have achieved this by running budgetary surpluses.
It is clearly possible to fund research while respecting the Pact.
That is an important point.
Second, even Germany and France with their well-known budgetary problems have already achieved rates of 2.5% and 2.2% respectively.
Again, it appears that the Pact is not the factor limiting investment in research.
It would appear to be a matter of national priorities.
Â Â  That brings us to the end of Question Time.
We are also coming the end of the Dutch Presidency.
I believe that this is the last time that you will be with us for questions to the Council, Mr NikolaÃ¯, and I should like to offer you my best wishes and thanks for your work with Parliament during your Presidency.
I wish you every success at the end of this period, particularly during the next few days, which, I have no doubt, will be extremely demanding.
Questions Nos 12 to 31 will be answered in writing.
Â Â  Firstly, I must inform you that, following the invitations for the presentation of the candidatures for the post of European Ombudsman, the deadline for which was 30 September of this year, four candidatures have been presented, of which two will be put forward, namely, those of Mr Nikiforos Diamandouros and Mr Giuseppe Fortunato.
The candidates appeared before the competent committee on 29 November and the election will take place on 11 January next year, according to the procedure laid down in our Rules of Procedure.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report by Mr McMillan-Scott on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 976/1999 laying down the requirements for the implementation of Community operations, other than those of development cooperation,which, within the framework of Community cooperation policy, contribute to the general objective of developing and consolidating democracy and the rule of law and to that of respecting human rights and fundamental freedoms in third countries.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at my hearing before the European Parliament some weeks ago, I spoke out in favour of developing the closest possible working relations between the Commission and the European Parliament on human rights and democratisation.
I would like to renew this voluntary commitment wholeheartedly today.
The European Parliament is an extremely important partner for the Commission in this area of work, and so I am keen to follow in the footsteps of my predecessor, MrÂ Patten, in pursuing a comprehensive and regular dialogue with you on shared issues and concerns.
The purpose of today's decision is to safeguard the legal basis for the continued existence of the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights beyond the end of the year.
This necessitates what I hope will be Parliament's positive vote on the Commission's longstanding proposal to extend Regulation (EC) No 976/1999 for a further two years.
There are just two weeks to go before the Regulation expires, creating the risk that no funding will be available for projects and programmes under the European Initiative in the coming year.
It will only be possible for the Council to adopt a positive decision before the Regulation expires if the European Parliament votes in favour of the draft resolution proposed by the Committee on Foreign Affairs today.
In my view, this is in everyone's enlightened interest; it is also in the political interests of the three institutions involved in the legislative process, and, above all, it is in the practical interests of those whom the projects supported by the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights are intended to benefit, namely civil societies and citizens in numerous countries around the world.
The European Initiative is a well-functioning instrument: this is borne out by the statistics on the use of its budget funds as well as by almost all the human rights organisations which pay tribute to the Initiative and its valuable work.
It is widely regarded as a successful instrument which provides direct support for civil society in many third countries where human rights violations and, above all, a lack of democratic development are endemic.
The Initiative supports numerous innovative and relevant projects, such as the abolition of the death penalty, torture prevention and rehabilitation of torture victims, the advancement of the rights of women â an issue which is especially dear to me â as well as campaigning for the rights and interests of children, indigenous people and other marginalised groups, and strengthening international law.
This focuses, for example, on the International Criminal Court. It also aims to foster freedom of expression and promote democratic development through election observation missions.
I believe that the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights is a vibrant expression of our shared values and, above all, the European Union's identity in the world.
I agree with the House, Mr President, that the Initiative must be effective and well-managed.
The Commission will therefore scrutinise with attention and interest all the proposals put forward by this House which aim to achieve greater efficiency, the simplification of procedures and the effective use of resources.
To this end, let me give you my assurances that a meaningful, open and, above all, regular dialogue will take place between Parliament and the Commission.
I believe that this dialogue will offer us the opportunity for joint discussion of the political and objective priorities of the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights.
After all, Parliament's and the Commission's priorities are largely identical; they include, for example, the need to support the European Union's Neighbourhood Policy via the Initiative or to reinforce democratic development in a number of countries.
It is therefore important, in my view â and this applies both to my own and the working level â for us to focus on the same priorities, examine the needs arising in our Neighbourhood Policy together, and set the best possible priorities on a joint basis.
As parliamentarians, you have acquired particular expertise which I would like to draw on.
Your support for the democracy movement in Ukraine or the forthcoming EU Election Observer Mission to Palestine, the West Bank and Gaza are eloquent examples, and all I can say is that I believe we will work well together here.
Let me conclude, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, by expressing my hope that Parliament and the Commission will agree on the modalities for this further dialogue as swiftly as possible in order to develop genuinely fruitful cooperation in this field in everyone's interest.
I look forward to our positive cooperation, and I gladly put my services at your disposal.
Â Â  . Mr President, I thank the Commissioner for her opening remarks.
I am very pleased to see in the Chamber MrsÂ Morgantini, the chairman of the Committee on Development, Mrs Flautre, the chairman of the Subcommittee on Human Rights, the shadow rapporteur and my co-rapporteur on the Committee on Development, Mr FernÃ¡ndez MartÃ­n.
There were two regulations, one of which has already been adopted by this House. The one we are dealing with now is that covering third countries.
Twelve years ago I was rapporteur and, as Mr Patten has described me, 'father' of the European initiative for democracy and human rights, which proved to be instrumental in helping the transitional ex-Soviet bloc countries.
It was considered by many as the European Union's flagship scheme for democracy promotion. It gave meaning to the preamble to the Maastricht Treaty concerning the EU's foreign policy priorities.
In its initial phase it was administered by a small foundation based in Brussels, with both the European Parliament and the Commission playing an active role in the allocation and supervision of projects.
At its height in 1997, the initiative was financing and administering around 1 200 projects.
In 1999 I visited some of them in Belgrade, including key pro-democracy media, such as Radio B92.
The same year the initiative was taken in-house by the Commission.
I have been concerned for a long time that the initiative has become bureaucratic and safe and that the European Parliament, as the only democratically elected institution, should once again play a greater role.
Although the initiative currently has a budget of some EUR 137 million, it lacks visibility and effectiveness.
I am all the more convinced of this following meetings on the ground and discussions with more than 30 organisations.
Most recently, I spoke to the Association of Belarusian Journalists â currently here to receive the Sakharov Prize â as well as the Eurasia Director of a US pro-democracy agency.
They were not even aware of the existence of the European democracy initiative.
This is a very valuable programme and one that needs to be made more effective.
An important point to make is that unlike routine EU assistance, the European initiative does not require the host government's consent.
In a country such as Belarus, not to speak of Tunisia or Iran, in which operating through government channels is difficult and often impossible, this cannot be underestimated.
In a paper on the EU security strategy in 2003, Javier Solana outlined the importance and sensitivity of Europe's new neighbourhood.
The resulting policy invites our neighbours to the east and south to share in the peace, stability and prosperity that we enjoy in the European Union.
It aims to create a 'ring of friends' around the borders of the new enlarged European Union.
Sadly, the only visibility of the EU's democracy activities in the new neighbourhood seems to be short observation missions by Members of the European Parliament, such as those undertaken recently in Ukraine.
I believe that all significant elections in the new neighbourhood should be the subject of full EU observation missions.
There is a feeling in Brussels that democracy cannot be exported and that change must come from within.
However, the United States National Endowment for Democracy has shown since 1982 that the two can be combined.
It operates as an independent expert agency, using NGOs on the ground, and is much respected for its programmes and methodology.
As well as the United States activities, the Westminster Foundation, for example, or the German and other NGOs have higher visibility and much less bureaucracy than the European initiative.
I recently put together a document detailing the European Parliament's pro-democracy activities, both within the EU and externally.
As Members, we participate in a myriad of interparliamentary delegations, consultation committees and informal groups.
Valuable work is being done, but the work is fragmented.
The same can be said about the European initiative.
To my mind, our involvement should be coordinated in a democracy centre, based in this House, mandated to act as a research unit, an oversight body on all the EU's pro-democracy activities.
To take an example, the website of the State Department's Bureau for Democracy, Human Rights and Labor boasts that the United States has overseen the transition of 87Â countries to democratic states.
Is this a statistic that the EU wishes to leave in the hands of the United States alone?
Last weekend's G8 Conference in Rabat â and I am delighted that the Commissioner was present â co-financed by the European Union, further developed plans for the Forum for the Future, first introduced at the Sea Island Summit in June 2004, to promote democracy in the Middle East and North Africa.
Despite the financial contribution of the European Union to such an important event, it is the Americans rather than the European Union who are leading this activity.
We recognise that the United States programme essentially echoes the principles of the Barcelona process and now the European Neighbourhood Policy.
In 2005, the United Kingdom will take over the presidency of both the G8 and the European Union.
I sincerely hope that there will be a greater focus on the 250Â million Arabs who want democracy, as illustrated by the 2002 United Nations Development Report, as well as the manifestly failing countries to our east.
Lastly, while I do not propose that the European Parliament should reject the regulation or the associated budget lines for any longer than strictly necessary, I find the response from the Commission â the letter from the Commissioner relating to the new arrangements on this programme, which does not reference working level contacts â and the Council â which is still using a working party consisting of development ministers â to the concerns I and others expressed about the democracy initiative to be lacking in substance and completely unfitted to the needs of our time and the needs of millions of unfree people on our doorstep.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to welcome you on the occasion of your first speech in a debate on human rights.
You will always be welcome.
Mr McMillan-Scott has gone over this Regulation, a regulation that clearly demonstrates all our virtues â our many virtues â and also many of our problems.
It is a modest regulation in terms of its budget, but very ambitious in terms of its objectives; we all agree on the need to approve it but, nevertheless, we have spent a year and a half â perhaps much more â dealing with procedural and bureaucratic issues which have nothing to do with the fundamental issue, which is to approve it on time and properly so that the Commission may have an instrument allowing it to maintain the Regulation.
It has been a very complex process.
At the end of the last term in office we approved a regulation similar to this, by means of co-decision, relating to third countries.
And now we are approaching the entry into force of the necessary extension, which begins on 1 January and ends at the end of 2006.
The Commission and the Council are well aware that this regulation is highly valued by Parliament.
I would point out that the budget line that provides for its funding â as Mr McMillan-Scott has just said â under the heading âEuropean Initiative for Democracy and Human Rightsâ, was created on the initiative of this Parliament â many of us who were present at that time are still here â and the Commission points out in its explanatory statement the full validity and the proper application endorsed by the impact assessment, which stresses the positive results concerning the development of the capacity of the NGOs specialising in human rights and concerning civil society organisations.
The rapporteur has considered it appropriate to restrict himself to producing a report that expresses support for the Commissionâs proposal, modified by the Council with the clarifications and explanations it has thought it appropriate to include, but I would point out that a Regulation, with the same content and an identical purpose, for which I myself was rapporteur, was approved at first reading by means of co-decision and that we in the Committee on Development were entirely flexible and raised certain reasonable and simple issues so that it could be approved at the end of the last term in office.

What we have reiterated now in the amendments that in the end have not been voted for are very simple things which at that time we found it difficult to make understood.
Parliament wishes to be informed and to know the results and the progress of the application of this project and wants these programmes to provide funding, as the Commissioner has pointed out, for peace missions and missions of electoral observers.
Furthermore, it would like the Commission to present, on an annual basis or at intervals it considers appropriate, an analysis of the progress and results of the application of this project.
I suspect that the agreement reached at the end of the last term in office by means of co-decision, with the Committee on Development responsible for the main report, has been modified unilaterally.
I hope that this will now be corrected, on the basis of the application of the Regulation, which provides the Commission with the funds necessary for the application of an effective instrument, as this one is, for promoting democracy and human rights.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, promoting democracy and human rights in the world should be one of the priorities of the EUâs external relations.
We feel empowered by our own, widely-held understanding of the concept of the human race and of every human being, and also by the knowledge that the democratic world is also a freer world, a world that can be fairer, a world capable of building justice in freedom and, consequently, a more peaceful and safer world.
By firmly committing ourselves to the European initiative on democracy and human rights, we are promoting democracy, peace, the human race and security, all at the same time.
We must never lose sight of this, as we fine-tune the instruments that we establish and as we administer the resources that we allocate directly to this action area.
After a number of yearsâ experience, I should like to make some observations.
Firstly, Parliament should be more involved in programmes specifically developed and supported in this field.
The amendments that have been proposed to the regulation will address this question sufficiently, provided, of course, the Commission accepts them in the right spirit and makes a broad and extensive interpretation of the new guidelines, thereby taking relations with Parliament to a more open and closer level.
This is what we are calling for.
It is also necessary, however, to express our opinion on other issues that concern us more.
Firstly, are we going to dilute these instruments into more and more areas, more lines and more themes, or are we first going to set out a clear strategy, and then concentrate on a guideline that drives us forward and on fundamental priorities?
I believe that the latter is the right way.
The concept of human rights is increasingly broad and also sometimes more vague.
There is also the temptation to use those instruments for anything and everything.
This to my mind would be the wrong way; it would reduce the effectiveness of what we do and lead to a waste of scant resources, or to the duplication of instruments.
There are many other instruments for policies on cooperation and development with third countries, but these instruments of the European initiative for democracy and human rights are highly political and should be focused primarily on promoting democracy and that fundamental nucleus of civic and political rights, freedom of conscience and religion, freedom of expression and debate, the separation of powers and the rule of law, freedom of organisation and activity of political parties and civil society, the opportunity to hold free and fair elections and the vitality of open and plural societies.
We must also be capable, however, of setting out priorities as regards the regions of the world or countries with particular strategic impact on the actions that we support, for various reasons: firstly, because the country concerned is our immediate neighbour and therefore our most immediate security is at stake; secondly, because these are situations that can have a positive snowball effect at local level, in terms of establishing democracy and stability; thirdly, because in those areas of the world with particularly knotty problems we can find the weak spot that can be unravelled into democratic transformation; fourthly, because there are special historical links and cultural ties that bring us together; and fifthly, because our help can make all the difference in the short term and can have an instantly positive impact.
To conclude, we must also ask ourselves if we are going to take the path of increasing bureaucracy and officialdom in carrying out these policies, or will we be able to make those instruments more agile?
This, more than anything, is what I ask of the Commission; that it be capable of taking risks and that it set out the most adventurous, most daring and most incisive lines of action.
Bureaucracy and officialdom would lead to those instruments being totally unused for one simple and intuitive reason.
We cannot rely on dictators to encourage and promote democracy in their countries.
We must therefore be more agile and must know how to take our help to exactly where it is needed, exactly where it is lacking and exactly where it will make a difference.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to welcome the Commissioner on behalf of our group.
Let me come straight to the point.
This evening Parliament is being asked to approve the extension of the specific human rights and democracy programme for two years.
Our group has no objection in principle.
During the recent months of dialogue with the Commission, however, we have placed some political conditions on our assent: that is to say, we want a clear signal from the Commission that you represent to commit to a structured dialogue with Parliament.
It is not a question of our claiming management responsibilities that do not fall within this Parliamentâs remit, but rather of claiming the power to carry out a political evaluation of this measure and, more generally, of all initiatives relating to the development of democracy and action on human rights.
We ask to be able to carry out an evaluation of the priorities of the initiatives and an evaluation of their quality and the degree to which they have succeeded in advancing democracy in real terms.
In other words, Commissioner, this Parliament is asking to be involved in defining the guidelines for our actions and in judging the effectiveness of the results we obtain.
In recent years, many questions have remained unanswered and a great deal of information either has not arrived or has been supplied in a highly summarised form.
We do not know the extent of the funds actually spent through this programme, which projects have been concluded, where they were carried out or with what concrete results â because in some countries the funds have been frozen â or indeed what is being done to unfreeze the funds.
We do not want to break the sacred rules of comitology, but it is a question of finding a for a relationship that is not just based on a verbal expression of good will.
Commissioner, we appreciate your offer of collaboration, and our willingness to extend the life of this programme should be interpreted as an act of trust.
It is important to make it clear that Parliament must not be regarded, as it often is, as a notary who is called in to formally approve the accounts but who has to confine himself to that alone.
That is not in the interests either of Parliament or of the Community institutions.
In this regard, we believe that this programme should be streamlined and speeded up as much as possible.
Greater responsibilities should be given to local non-governmental organisations on the ground, and more emphasis should be placed on microprojects and on certain campaigns that in the past have made some headway in the difficult area of democracy in some countries.
We have to work a little harder on democracy, as we have neglected it up to now while focusing our operations on the area of human rights.
Naturally, it is also necessary to develop a capacity for dialogue, for which, Commissioner, Parliament will place our trust in you and give you our vote.
We hope, however, that from tomorrow this will become a daily dialogue â not just a formality but a dialogue of substance â to assess the decisions that have been made and to define the objectives that we set ourselves.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, perhaps we should start with the very timely question posed quite rightly by MrÂ Fava regarding the dialogue between our institutions.
It is a recurring theme, which by the way makes this late sitting at this late season of the year worthwhile.
On this subject, Commissioner, we have heard you say and we have read â and you also said in your hearing â that you wanted to maintain a dialogue that people can describe as they see fit, but which I in any case understood to be regular, relevant, open and prolonged, or, in short, structured.
This proposal, the offer of dialogue, is clearly one that Parliament will jump at, because, as you know, the Members of this House are eager to have the opportunity to engage in in-depth discussions about the direction and ongoing monitoring of this initiative and to receive information about programming.
Ladies and gentlemen, the ball is in our court and I am sure that the Commission would be delighted to see a proposal emanate from our ranks, from our committees and groups, in short from our Parliament, so that this dialogue can get underway very quickly, because it is urgently needed, with a group of Members who are well-motivated and have some expertise on this issue, and there is no shortage of such people in this institution.
Let us return to the initiative.
I think that we need to reiterate the extent to which it brings added value to all of the actions that the European Union might undertake on democracy and human rights.
It has perhaps not been said often enough that it is the only means at our disposal to support, against the will of governments that are often autocratic or dictatorial, civil society, activists and NGOs working in conditions that are often extremely complicated.
It is the only instrument that enables us to act in this way, and it is extremely precious.
In addition, I would add that the aid that is given to NGOs in this way is perceived on the ground as being neutral, that is to say that the European Union is not providing these grants in a bid to dominate or take over and is not perceived as doing so, contrary to the claims made when American agencies work on the ground, with such claims very often heard in Maghreb, in any case.
It is a very precious asset, made possible by the quality of the European Unionâs intervention.
Of course there is still room for improvement.
One of the issues, and we all know of many examples, is that some NGOs cannot, for one reason or another, be supported under this initiative.
The governments of third countries which do not wish to see democratic movements develop in their midst are not lacking in resources or imagination.
We have cases of legal NGOs being granted support under the initiative and then being quite simply banned from receiving the grant by a political decree or by direct censure.
All of the decisions have been taken, but these NGOs are prevented from benefiting from the funds granted to them.
We have other examples of associations which quite simply do not legally exist.
In such cases we have to resort to subterfuge, and we therefore need the ability to be flexible and find ingenious solutions on the ground to achieve our goals.
I should like to conclude by saying that this debate would serve no purpose if we were not already thinking beyond 2007.
And there, as other Members have rightly done, I would draw attention to the fact that we will need to work within this Parliament to ensure that this precious asset, that we can always improve, is able to endure beyond 2006.
That is what is at stake in the debates that we are going to have to hold at various different levels within this Parliament.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to welcome the Commissioner and I particularly appreciate the fact that she is a woman.
I fully agree with the need to extend the implementing arrangements relating to human rights, development and democracy.
I congratulate MrÂ McMillan-Scott and I especially share the opinion of MrÂ FernÃ¡ndez MartÃ­n â in line with the vote I cast in committee â particularly on the amendment specifically calling on the Commission to produce an annual report setting out the programming and to report back to Parliament on the implementation.
I have, however, in the words of MrsÂ Ferrero-Waldner, seized upon the Commissionâs willingness to collaborate and also to hold a serious and in-depth dialogue not only on the general guidelines but also on project execution.
I truly hope, amongst other things, that this dialogue will also take place directly with the Committee on Development, which I chair, since the issues of human rights, the empowerment of women and democracy are in fact closely linked to the question of development.
I should like to say to my very likeable fellow Member MrÂ McMillan-Scott that I understand his frustration and I agree about this precious project, as MrsÂ Flautre put it.
In fact, parents cannot always bear to see their children grow up.
Quite frankly, I would not want to emulate the United States, because their actions have very often led to the rise of dictatorships â I am thinking of the Pinochet regime, for example.
I believe the great plan for democratic development in the Middle East has already been repudiated by many in the Middle East because it is seen as an act of power and not as genuine help.
I should therefore like us to retain our own individual character and also to value the important work that we are doing.
We do not actually want to export democracy, but we want democracy to grow and to have the ability to grow, and we can provide the tools for that purpose.
Through visiting conflict zones and seeing the huge number of projects, I have realised that the ability to act without going through the authorities is fundamentally important.
The questions of torture, training and recovery, as well as the question of the empowerment of women have been extremely important.
I think we really need to continue along this path, but obviously in the knowledge that there are many limitations and many shortcomings, including in the area of finance.
I should not like us to confine ourselves to election observation missions, which very often cannot actually be taken very seriously if you consider that they only last one day.
I should really like us to continue operating along lines whereby our aid and our actions can truly be a tool for helping democracy to grow and not for imposing our values.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to say that MrsÂ Ferrero-Waldner is the right person in the right place.
This cannot be said of all her colleagues, but that is no fault of hers.
The European Parliamentâs role is becoming ever more important within the EU institutions, and its authority is becoming ever greater amongst the public in the Member States.
After 25Â years as a directly-elected body, Parliamentâs importance is now at its height.
Yet we should not derive satisfaction from the strengthening of Parliamentâs role as a result of battles of competence or procedure within the European Union.
To a greater extent than previously, the European Parliamentâs role must be to promote democracy in the world and to provide information on values and standards. These values and standards ensure that, although our societies and political systems are not ideal, there are fewer wars and more dialogue on our continent, less violence and more compromise, and less institutional aggression and more international and institutional cooperation.
This is not a matter of promoting European values. It is a matter of informing people about a style of politics based on a search for the common good and on widening participation in government at every level.
This is the role of both the European Union and the European Parliament today.
Is EURÂ 100Â million too much to spend on promoting democracy in the world?
It is undoubtedly not enough, yet even a sum five times greater would still be much cheaper than going to the expense of repairing the effects of a lack of democracy.
It would cost a great deal more to provide assistance to the victims of civil and international wars that break out because politicians in many countries do not understand the meaning of democracy.
They only know it as a notion found in foreign language phrase books.
If more than EURÂ 100Â million were to be granted, it would of course be necessary to monitor both our own institutions and the organisations receiving the funding.
In conclusion, I should like to offer my sincere thanks to MrÂ McMillan-Scott, the rapporteur, for his work.
I hope the House will continue to work together on this issue, regardless of political divisions, and that it will work towards the goals referred to by MrsÂ Ferrero-Waldner and the rapporteur.
Â Â  Mr President, I join with others in welcoming the new Commissioner to this debate.
We look forward to working with her and, indeed, we look forward to the Commission's plans in 2005 and 2006 on this budget line, the legal base for which we expect to confirm tomorrow.
I support the fact that this is a budget line that reaches the grassroots and that civil society in the countries has a priority in receiving the monies.
I also support the fact that the Commission is planning to make conflict prevention a permanent priority for this budget line.
Surely democracy is the best instrument of conflict prevention in our world.
I support what the Commission has done in terms of improving the contacts and support from its own delegations in third countries for projects under these lines, and also their plans to extend funding for micro-projects, in particular for local NGOs in third countries who are most valued by us in this Parliament.
If I have a word of criticism, it is that every year the Commissioner's predecessor used to speak about human rights and then come in with a preliminary draft budget that cut this line â last year from EUR 127 million to EUR 105 million.
Perhaps the Commissioner will choose not to do that in forthcoming years.
Indeed, as Mrs Flautre has said, I hope that, whilst there are proper objectives for simplification of the budget, this particular line has symbolic importance and will be maintained in the medium and long term.
I also draw to her attention the increasing demands from international organisations, like the ad hoc tribunals for Yugoslavia and Rwanda and the International Criminal Court.
However, if these are to be funded from this budget line there must be a significant increase or NGOs will fail.
I oppose the attempt to reduce the priority given to projects worldwide under this budget line and refocus on near Europe.
That is a mistake: human rights are universal in our world.
Finally, I express my respect for the rapporteur, MrÂ McMillan-Scott, and his sincere interest in this budget line; but I am pleased that he withdrew his amendments, which I believe represented micro-management of this budget line.
The Commission's commitment to structured dialogue, as it put it, is one that we should welcome, and, with my colleagues on Parliament's Subcommittee on Human Rights, I very much look forward to engaging with the new Commissioner on that.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, many thanks for this debate.
Firstly, let me say to the Vice-President, Mr McMillan-Scott, that if he had not already invented this interesting procedure, we would have to invent it now.
I am absolutely convinced that it is a good thing, for I have always been highly committed to human rights.
In other words, you can count on the fact that you are dealing with someone who really believes in what they are doing.
Let me say again that there will be genuine dialogue, not only at my level but also at working level. I would like to reiterate this point unequivocally.
I do not agree that all we have done is observe elections.
I can cite a host of examples demonstrating that this is not the case.
We need only think of Ukraine, where a variety of projects is under way.
Let me cite a few examples to show you that we really cannot view the situation in such narrow terms.
The Commission is already providing support here: for example, it has given EUR 300 000 to the European Centre for Common Ground, EUR 334 000 to the International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights: Improving the Human Rights Situation in Ukraine through Legal Aid Provided by NGOs, EUR 787 000 to the European Roma Rights Center: Defending the rights of Roma in Ukraine, EUR 685 000 to the Kharkiv Human Rights Protection Group, and so on.
These are just a few of the projects. Let me turn to another region of the world which is very important to you and, indeed, to me, namely the Southern Mediterranean, the Arab region, although this does not only include the Arab countries, it also includes Israel, of course.
One example is the project entitled Palestine: Democratization from the Grassroots, Media and Networking as a Tool for Community Development, which is important in that it focuses primarily on civil society.
Let me reiterate: I am particularly pleased â and I think this is a fortunate coincidence â that I was able to present seven action plans recently to the Commission and again here in Parliament on Monday.
The Commission and the Council have adopted the proposals and everyone spoke about them in very positive terms.
Why?
Because these action plans will enable us to bring our values, namely human rights and everything with which they are associated â namely the rule of law, human rights and democracy â to these countries, such as Ukraine, as soon as free and fair elections have taken place there.
After that, the implementation begins.
However, they also focus on a poor yet important country like the Republic of Moldova, where we also need to take action.
Belarus is a separate case which I will come back to in a moment.
Then, of course, there are the major countries in the Middle East which are ready for this process, notably Jordan, Morocco, Tunisia, Palestine and Israel.
The presentation of these seven action plans at this time offers a really good opportunity, in my view, to work together with and on these countries.
Naturally, the action plans also offer opportunities for us to present our priorities alongside the countries' own priorities and promote democracy and human rights.
I would like to outline some of the campaigns which we are carrying out within our human rights programme.
I admit that they do not amount to a massive sum, but it is still considerable, and I believe that there is a great deal that we can discuss in detail.
Campaign 1 is entitled 'Promotion, justice and dignity'. This targets criminal justice, supports universal abolition of the death penalty, and supports the work of international mechanisms which monitor and report on respect for human rights and related international treaty obligations.
Campaign 2, which is especially dear to me, is entitled 'Fostering a culture of human rights': human rights education, training, monitoring and awareness-raising by targeting advancement of rights of marginalised or vulnerable groups â that means the rights of women and children â including female genital mutilation, trafficking of women, human rights defenders; torture prevention and rehabilitation of torture victims, programmes of higher education and training for professionals, support for human rights dialogues.
So, on the whole, it is a very important campaign.
Campaign 3 is entitled 'Promoting democratic process'.
This is essential for all these societies, especially for the Middle East or the broader Middle East, which I will come to later.
So there is a lot of development of participatory democracy, fostering informed pluralistic discourse with civil society, targeting freedom of association, freedom of expression, independent press, broadcasting, unimpeded access to the Internet, and election observation missions.
Campaign 4 is entitled 'Advancing equality, tolerance and peace', embraces the issues of racial discrimination, xenophobia, rights of minorities, indigenous peoples.
Then there is the selection of regions and countries and matching them with each of the four campaigns.
All that is foreseen for 2007, and in the next financial perspective there will be only six finance regulations, four of which are very important ones: enlargement, development, good neighbourhood policy and stability.
In all of them, democracy and human rights are in the mainstream, which is a real achievement on the basis of which we can work.
There is thematic programming here.
Returning to Belarus, which we spoke about in the Council recently, I explained that I wanted to work specifically with the NGOs.
We then received an invitation from Lithuania to hold a workshop there.
So we will have three phases: firstly, two phases in the Commission, and then we will confer with Parliament.
Then there is also an invitation from Lithuania, because Lithuania, Poland and many of these countries know where we have to start with NGOs.
You are right: we can only work with civil society there, because we cannot work with governments at this stage.
On the broader Middle East, I was very interested in this new possibility for cooperation.
It is true that we have been working for ten years with the countries of the Middle East, the southern basin of the Mediterranean.
The United States is now doing something similar.
It is a good initiative, because the more we can work in parallel and thus bring more democracy and easier access to democracy to the region, the better.
I now turn to some other more formal questions.
According to the information I have, for reasons of juridical coherence, the Council has now reintroduced the amendments tabled by Parliament when Regulations (EC) Nos 975/1999 and 976/1999 were at the drafting stage.
I hope this information is welcome to the Members who raised this.
In order to work better with NGOs it was essential to have deconcentration, as we call it.
That means that we have given a lot of responsibility to the delegations, that are also in a much better position to conduct a survey on what NGOs are doing.
This is also why we will follow developments much better.
I hope that there will be better control because I know that while, on the one hand, we should have a speedy means of action, on the other hand we also have to be very careful and to control things properly.
This is what I wanted to say.
Indeed, it is an offer of dialogue on my part. I thank you for taking it.
We are not perfect, but there is a positive offer and I hope that Parliament will take it in this positive spirit to work together for the major values of our European Union â that is, human rights.
Â Â  .
Mr President, as the Commissioner will find, the European Parliament always has the last word.
I am pleased that the Commission is beginning to examine the possibility of doing some work in Belarus.
I mentioned Belarus, and also Tunisia and Iran: two other countries where nothing is happening.
I am grateful for the good will and the commitment of the Commissioner in her new post, and we welcome her into it.
I also welcome her commitment to establish some working-level cooperation between Parliament and the Commission.
I advise the Commission that this week the European Parliament, through the good offices of the Human Rights Subcommittee, is commissioning a study by independent experts into the operation of this programme.
It is something I asked for last year from the Commission, but it was unwilling to give it.
This will be completed by February.
May I make one final remark, since I know the Commissioner was in Rabat at the weekend and we are dealing with a vast and important agenda: the process of reform in the Middle East.
When I began working on this report, the funds available from the European Initiative on Democracy and Human Rights to the entire Middle East were four per cent of the total.
Given the circumstances of the last three years, that was an extraordinarily low figure.
I am pleased the Commission is now adjusting that, and we need to refocus the programme.
Notwithstanding what Mr Howitt said, we have strategic objectives and strategic priorities. I am pleased to see the Commission is now beginning to focus on those.
I thank the Commissioner for her words and for her commitment, and we look forward to working together constructively and practically, but on the basis of equal interest in the development of democracy, particularly in our neighbourhood.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report by Mr Papadimoulis on the proposal for a Council decision amending Decision 1999/847/EC as regards the extension of the Community action programme in the field of civil protection.
Â Â  . Mr President, I am pleased that Parliament supports the Commission's proposal for the extension of the Community action programme on civil protection for the years 2005 and 2006.
I very much appreciate the efforts that have gone into this report, in particular the work of MrÂ Papadimoulis, the rapporteur.
Before I go into detail on this report, I think it is worth recalling the work done under the auspices of this action plan since its adoption in December 1999.
The objectives of the civil protection action programme are to help to ensure better protection for people, the environment and property in the event of natural or technological disasters across the Community.
The action programme has funded a range of useful projects, exchanges of experts and workshops that build invaluable cooperation and also mutual assistance between the Member States' civil protection services.
The action programme supports and supplements efforts at national, regional and local levels.
Emphasis has been put on major projects concerning prevention, information of the public, crisis management, disaster medicine and networking among the different volunteer associations active on the ground.
In recent years we have seen major disasters.
You will recall the floods in central and eastern Europe in the summer of 2002, the oil spill, also in the same year, the unprecedented heatwave and devastating forest fires in southern Europe in the summer of 2003.
This year we were shocked by the violent terrorist attack in Madrid and saddened by the earthquakes in Iran and Morocco.
These events clearly illustrated the need for further action to strengthen prevention and preparedness measures and also to enhance our ability to respond rapidly and in solidarity as a European Union.
The Commission believes that major progress has been made in recent years in the contribution and role of the EU in civil protection.
The rapporteur has rightly highlighted some issues in the report, and these are both valuable and constructive remarks that we will take into account in our future work.
I would like to react immediately to a number of points.
The report recommends 'better sharing of information on available resources, expertise and successful strategies and practices at national level'.
The Commission agrees that our database of resources should be further upgraded and contain more data on responsive capacities, associated costs and available equipment.
The Commission is currently working with Member States on these issues.
The report argues for an improved operational framework for volunteers and for the establishment of guidelines for their work.
This is a helpful suggestion and echoes the emphasis that the Commission is now putting on the work on this subject, which was and will remain a priority for financing in 2005.
Let me turn to the issue of financing assistance during emergencies.
This is an issue of concern to us, but depends on having a sufficient level of funding available.
For the time being the budgetary resources available only permit financing of experts who travel to the scene of disasters to assess needs for assistance.
Additional financing depends at present on the donating and receiving Member States.
I should like to add that there is also, as you know, the possibility to use the EU Solidarity Fund to provide compensation to a country suffering severe damage from a disaster.
Finally, the report asks the Commission to provide a report on the programme in 2006.
We have no difficulty in accepting this request.
With these remarks, I reiterate my thanks to the rapporteur and to Parliament as a whole for this thoughtful and constructive opinion.
May I add that my colleague, Commissioner Dimas, sends his apologies for not being here.
He is in Buenos Aires and asked me to replace him.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the debate on this report comes, as the Commissioner noted, after a series of major natural disasters in recent years which raise the question of the need to strengthen the Community action programme: floods, heat-waves, forest fires, earthquakes, serious pollution incidents from toxic waste or oil spills, such as that from the , as well as serious industrial accidents and also terrorist attacks.
My country, Greece, is currently experiencing immense anxiety as the result of the hijacking of a bus with several hostages whose lives are in danger.
These dangers and these disasters have many victims and cause ever greater economic losses; they disrupt the economies of the countries affected, hitting in particular the poorest and most vulnerable sections of the population.
That is precisely why action also needs to be taken by governments, preventive measures need to be strengthened and response capacities need to be extended.
The Community response to this problem is the Community action programme in the field of civil protection.
This programme expires in a few days, on 31 December 2004, and we need to approve this proposal which I have prepared, in order to avoid a gap until such time as the new programme is prepared.
That is why I support the Commission proposal to prolong this programme for the next two years, just as I support the Commission proposal on the necessary increase in the budget for the action programme in the field of civil protection from EUR 1.5 million annually, which was the amount in 2004, to EUR 2.4 million annually for the next two years.
You may say it is not a big increase.
I agree, but it is absolutely essential in order to finance increased needs due to enlargement and to finance the action programme to combat marine pollution which has been decided in the meantime.
Unfortunately, it would appear that the Council of Ministers does not have the same perception as we have in the European Parliament and in the Commission, and the Council also needs to understand that the decisions which we take in order to do certain things also need the money necessary for their implementation.
Otherwise, we shall not be consistent in our obligations towards the citizens and it is precisely at times of natural disasters that those who voted for us and sent us here need to see the European Union and the European Parliament by their side.
This programme therefore needs to proceed and, at the same time, certain points in it need to be improved on the basis of experience obtained to date.
In studying the problem, I have identified seven sectors in which improvements are needed in practice, because on paper the system looks good, but on the ground experience to date has shown that it has serious shortcomings.
One, better sharing of information on available resources, expertise and successful strategies at national level.
The database, its data and the capacity for fast communication and coordination need to be improved, in other words the computer database needs to be upgraded.
Two, more training for intervention teams.
Experience has shown that more regular training is needed for better cooperation and interoperability.
Three, better communication, coordination, in-time information systems for the prompt information of the public and links with other networks.
Four, funding: not simply increasing funding but safeguarding speedier response with the release of the source of funding and concentrating all the appropriations needed under one heading.
Five, strengthening social partnership with a more active involvement of civil society and local authorities.
Increasing the number of volunteers.
Six, empowerment of research and development of emergency systems for a more efficient management of disasters.
And seven, implementation of the principle of subsidiarity and reinforcement of the drawing up of national plans for emergency coordination, a sector in which numerous Member States have serious shortcomings.
For the reasons which I have described to you and so as not to be too longwinded, because it is already quite late, I call on the European Parliament to approve this report with the greatest possible support, as did the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, which approved my report almost unanimously.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with MrÂ Papadimoulisâs report regarding the absolute necessity of extending the Community action programme for the two-year period of 2005-2006 in order to facilitate cooperation, especially cross-border cooperation, on the exchange of expertise and mutual assistance among Member States in this field.
Cross-border cooperation and a cooperation culture are fundamental, because the security of the countries in the European Union is closely linked to what happens on their borders.
To that end, we must invest heavily in volunteers.
In addition, we agree on the seven areas that need to be strengthened, in view of the deficiencies revealed at the level of individual nations.
The European Peopleâs Party also believes that the Commission ought to evaluate the implementation of the current programme before it ends and prepare a report to be submitted to the European Parliament and the Council.
I would point out that the Community action programme is being extended to the years 2005-2006 without Parliament having been sent the mid-term report or the final report provided for by Decision 1999/847/EC establishing a Community action programme in the field of civil protection for the period from 1Â January 2000 to 31Â December 2004.
To date we have not even received any justification for the delay.
That is a very serious failing, because it violates Parliamentâs prerogative to give its opinion and forces it come to a decision without seeing any qualitative or quantitative information on the actions taken or the results achieved.
Our confidence in the new Commission, however, leads us to hope that these reports will be forwarded by the requested date of 30Â June 2006, precisely for the purpose â and in the hope â of promoting full cooperation between the European Parliament and the Commission.
Those documents should give us an evaluation of the extent of the Community action programme in the field of civil protection, together with the actions planned under the other two ongoing Community programmes, which will provide Parliamentâs Committee on the Environment with useful suggestions for inclusion in the single action programme that we hope the Commission will put in place for 2007-2013.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, happily we all agree on this issue and, consequently, I also share what has been said by previous speakers.
We feel that it is crucial to extend this action programme and we also deem it important that in the two years concerned, 2005 and 2006, the Commission can make an accurate assessment of the current programme and can prepare a new and more ambitious instrument of action, taking account of the Financial Perspectives for 2007-2013 and any needs identified in the meantime.
New problems require new solutions.
We also, therefore, endorse Mr Papadimoulisâs report â and I compliment him on his work â and we naturally support the Commissionâs proposal to extend the programme.
We do feel, however, that, bearing in mind the programmeâs objectives and its enlargement to ten more countries, funding should be stepped up even further.
The importance of civil protection continues to grow.
Persons and property must be protected and this is an area that requires greater resources.
In recent years, as has been pointed out in this House, a number of natural disasters and criminally-motivated disasters have occurred, which have affected both the people and the economies of the countries concerned.
Such was the case of the accident, the floods in the South of France, the terrorist attack on Madrid and the forest fires in Spain and Portugal.
Coming from Portugal as I do, I am particularly sensitive to this issue, as you will understand.
As I have said, greater funding would be desirable so that we can better prevent and remedy situations of this nature.
In Portugal alone, for example, in 2003, 400Â 000 hectares of forest were burnt and approximately 170Â 000 hectares in 2004.
It is therefore essential that the next action instrument provides for greater financial support.
The environment is priceless and our forests cannot continue to disappear.
We have an obligation to preserve them so that we can leave them to future generations.
We cannot forget that the Earth does not belong to us, it has been borrowed for our children.
We must therefore step up measures aimed at prevention and cure.
As far as prevention is concerned, there must be greater EU involvement, in conjunction with national, regional and local administrations, along with technical and financial support, to prevent these disasters, which occur year after year.
Prevention is better, and indeed more effective and cheaper, than cure.
With regard to restorative measures, coordination and monitoring must be stepped up, particularly in terms of reforesting the areas affected by the fires.
It is worth remembering that the restoration of the Mediterranean forest has taken almost a hundred years.
There are sectors in which we cannot make savings.
As for civil protection, making savings might mean becoming irredeemably poorer and our collective future being severely compromised.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I shall say straight away that I am in favour of extending the Community action programme on civil protection by two years.
To me it seems not so much a free choice as a mandatory solution, without any alternatives.
We have reached the end of the current programme without a lasting, concrete solution to the problem.
That very fact shows just how marginal the subject of civil protection in Europe is.
I feel I have developed some modest experience in this field, as I chair the civil protection committee in Catania, the province of Italy most exposed to seismic and volcanic risk, and also because I coordinated the emergency measures for the Italian Government during the terrible eruption of Mount Etna in the summer of 2001.
Over the years I have come to the conclusion that civil protection is not just an agreeable topic for a round table or a pleasant, convivial get-together, but is a subject that is indissolubly linked to peopleâs safety and, as you know, safety is a physiological right before it is a constitutional right.
I believe I can say that the European Union is seriously and scandalously dragging its feet in this area.
The subject was first addressed only five years ago with a number of initiatives that appear good in theory but in practice suffer from serious deficiencies â as was pointed out by the rapporteur himself, whose work I admire.
In fact, the approach seems schizophrenic not only at a logistical level but also because of the inadequate financial cover.
Commissioner, what results have the information monitoring centre, the solidarity fund and the Community mechanism achieved in terms of risk forecasting and prevention, rather than of emergency and post-emergency management?
What qualitative results have they had on European Union territory?
Can we find out what their effect has been?
Can we have a detailed report?
Will people understand that a disaster may not always coincide with the borders of an individual state, thus becoming a supranational problem, as the oil slick from the demonstrated?
How can civil protection capabilities in Europe be allowed to remain fragmented among the areas of responsibility of the environment, health, territory, agriculture and internal affairs?
A European civil protection agency needs to be set up, something I asked the Commission to do two years ago.
Apart from the fact that an operational structure can undoubtedly increase involvement, especially in Member States that are less sensitive to the problem, such a solution would have the advantage of operating above the territorial level to develop and harmonise procedures and methods for analysing and mitigating the risk of natural and technological disasters, and it would establish a proper task force.
In conclusion, I believe we need to promote the action of civil protection volunteers and to support it with structured training, equipment and funds, so that it can become an essential resource for dealing with emergencies and natural and other disasters.
I hope that the Commission will find the strength, the will and the courage to work with Parliament in this area.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the rapporteur for his clear and specific comments on the Community action programme in the field of civil protection.
His proposals on integrated management and more efficient operation of the relevant mechanism and the extension of the programme, which we support, are also to the point.
Over recent years, all of us in the European Union and the world at large have experienced disasters with the broadest, direct consequences on the lives of a large number of our fellow men and on society and the economy as a whole.
In response to these events, we adopted the Community action programme.
As we all recall, we were overtaken by events and reacted after them.
Let us take proper stock today, quantitatively and qualitatively, and let us look with the experience we have acquired at how we can improve the existing mechanism in all its functions and at all stages, from prevention to combating of disasters and the restoration of and return to social life.
This relates both to the monitoring mechanism and to the Solidarity Fund.
The rapporteur proposes better exchange of information and best practices, more training for intervention teams, mobilising volunteers and better coordination between the agencies involved at European, national, regional and local level.
As far as increasing the budget is concerned, it is necessary but, at the same time, the procedure also needs to be simplified.
I trust that the issue we are debating tonight will receive the assent of the Council, because it is a very important issue.
It not only resolves daily problems, but is also of major symbolic importance.
The citizens feel the European Union in their lives with this sort of intervention.
European nationality thus acquires a specific and deeper meaning.
This sort of programme brings European institutions, national and local agencies and local authorities into direct cooperation, something in which we are lagging behind, both at national level and in terms of coordination between the European Union and the national agencies.
To the outside world, this sort of programme gives the European Union visibility and, more importantly, projects an efficient and humane face, something which, listening to you on the previous report Commissioner, you intend to make a reality.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish first of all to welcome the proposal by the rapporteur, MrÂ Papadimoulis, to extend the action programme in the field of civil protection.
Coming from a country which has benefited in the past from EU funding in order to cope with natural disasters, I fully appreciate the importance of the programme.
Indeed, as a former minister in my own government, I visited Brussels in 1995 seeking assistance to alleviate the effects of substantial flooding throughout the length and breadth of Ireland.
I succeeded in obtaining considerable financial assistance.
I note the increase in the budget from the action programme in the field of civil protection for 2005 and 2006 but, like other speakers who have contributed to this debate, when I examine the increase I note that it is a mere EUR 0.9 million for each of the years 2005 and 2006.
I read the report in some detail and the justification for the increase is 'EU enlargement'.
When one considers the fact that we are increasing the size of our Community and welcoming the accession of 10 new Member States to our Community, in real terms the so-called increase is actually a decrease; that is without factoring in inflation.
I would like to see an emergency fund â I know you mentioned the Solidarity Fund â for civil disasters, where direct aid would be given to the regions of the new accession states, in the same way as Ireland was helped in the past.
These states have freed themselves from the iron grip of Moscow.
They all qualify for ObjectiveÂ 1 status; their economies are still largely embryonic.
Just as Ireland found itself in civil disasters, these new countries will inevitably find themselves in situations where natural disasters will occur.
I fundamentally believe that we should set aside each year a substantial fund to assist such countries by way of direct relief aid.
I commend the rapporteur for his systematic approach and recommendations.
He went through each area in detail.
Prevention, where possible, is desirable; preparedness is vital; protection, emergency measures and recovery are all essential.
I believe the scheme that he has prepared is excellent, but it is totally underfunded.
We cannot foresee earthquakes, floods or forest fires â they are natural disasters.
In conclusion,
I am not speaking Swahili, it is my own native tongue, Irish, which unfortunately is the only official language not included in the Community.
A happy Christmas and a happy New Year to each and every one of you.
Â Â  . Mr President, I have listened very carefully to what has been said.
First I wish to thank you all â the rapporteur and all the Members of Parliament who have spoken â for your support for this programme for civil protection, which we all feel is important.
I also thank you for your cooperation.
In answer to the question about how will this go forward, I can tell you that there will be no problem, there will be a prolongation.
Coreper discussed the Commission proposal on 15 December, and it will go as an 'A' point â that is, one where there are no problems â to the Environment Council before Christmas.
Let me also say that, in the meantime, the Commission intends to present a proposal for a new legal instrument with a view to its entry into force in January 2007.
That means that this new proposal will be based on the provisions of the new constitutional Treaty for greater possibilities to develop European cooperation in the field of civil protection; and thus we will be working particularly in the field of prevention that you all mentioned, but also in the field of response.
The next two years will be a transitional period to prepare in the best possible way the venue for the new Treaty, which will include many of the items and elements mentioned here.
You all spoke about prevention and nearly all of you mentioned the importance of contributions of volunteers and also of social partnership and the question of financing, which depends on the financial regulations.
Again, we are ready to make the preparations, and in the next few months the Commission will come up with a proposal.
I hope that my colleague Commissioner Dimas will then be able to discuss this very closely with you.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the Commission statement on the transport of animals.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by expressing my gratitude for the opportunity which I have today to convey to you the Commission's views on such an important and emotional issue.
I understand and share the concerns and interest of the European Parliament on such an important issue.
Allow me to assure you that I know full well how important this issue is, not only to the European Parliament, not only to the European Commission, but also to our millions of citizens and, of course, to farmers and to all the agencies involved.
I have no doubt that the European Community has a very important role to play in improving conditions under which animals can be fed, transported and slaughtered.
The need to ensure that animal welfare is improved during transport as a matter of day-to-day reality and not just on the statute book is an important objective for me.
I have long been aware of the unsatisfactory way that the current legislation on transport is being applied and of the apparent lack of priority given to this area of legislation by national authorities.
The correct and full enforcement of animal welfare legislation is essential, as is the immediate improvement of the conditions of animal transport.
This is why the Commission, despite its desire to do more to restrict transport-by-road times and reduce stock intensity on vehicles, accepts the presidency's step-by-step initiative in the Council.
We felt it was important to make the significant progress that was already within our grasp, rather than to defer the whole dossier to a later indefinite date.
This, as I will point out later, is without prejudice â and I would like to emphasise this â to any improved future solution.
In doing this, we have opted for much stricter rules, significantly improving current conditions, to be applied as soon as possible.
They will cover matters such as long-distance transport or new, substantially upgraded standards for vehicles.
These will be enforced in the shortest possible time within EU standards.
I wish to point out that the vast majority of Parliament's amendments have been integrated and incorporated into the final text and I thank Parliament for its important contribution.
I have no problem in admitting that it is unfortunate that there was no agreement on the issue of restrictions on the travel time and the transport density.
There was no chance â and I have to be frank about this â of such provisions being supported in the Council, and the failure to reach agreement at the April 2004 Agricultural Council was a clear warning.
But failure to reach agreement at the last Council would have meant an indefinite continuation of the existing unacceptable conditions and a significant delay in their improvement.
This does not mean, however, that the Commission does not believe that all possibilities for reinforcing the provisions on travel time should and will be exploited in the future.
Firstly â and this is not the only possibility â the final text provides for the Commission to report back to the Council within â not after â four years of the date of implementation on the issue of travel time and loading densities and possibly to modify its approach on the basis of the experience acquired from the application of the new rules.
However, in addition â and this is important â regardless of what the regulation provides, the Commission will carefully analyse the situation, including the prevailing political conditions, and will avail itself of its power of initiative.
I retained this right when giving our consent to the compromise.
Let me briefly list some of the improvements that this new regulation will introduce in the near future.
I have a list of four pages and I will not read them all.
Before I do so, I want to remind honourable Members that the regulation states that Member States have the right to adopt and implement stricter rules within their territory than those provided for in the regulation.
Therefore, this is a challenge for the Member States, and it is a challenge for you.
If enough Member States adopt stricter rules then the political pressure â the peer pressure â on the rest would be much more evident and effective.
However, we need the improvements in the existing regulation.
Firstly, a satellite navigation system will be used on road vehicles from 2007.
There will be forced ventilation and temperature monitoring inside the trucks, with improvements in water facilities and drinking facilities, individual stalls for the transport of horses and other conditions in relation to horses.
There will be stricter conditions for the training of drivers and a ban on transporting pregnant, sick and wounded animals.
There will also be administrative provisions to ensure consistency between checks by officials in different Member States.
This will apply to all journeys.
As you will be aware, the use of satellite navigation systems was promoted by the European Parliament last month and supported by the Commission.
This represents an innovative and promising tool to monitor animal transport, and the Commission is ready to invest immediately in this.
The proper use of this technology will contribute to the promotion of a more transparent and high-quality approach to animal transport in Europe, in tune with the wishes of our citizens but also enabling better enforcement.
This is extremely important.
It is not enough to regulate or adopt rules, we must have the means to enforce them and to supervise their enforcement.
European citizens have pointed out on innumerable occasions and in many ways that the lack of effective enforcement has been an appreciable weakness of the current system.
I fully agree with that.
I am determined and committed to ensuring better enforcement of animal welfare rules and to insisting that Member States report precisely on the state of play of the controls carried out.
We will continue to press Member States for this information and I am pleased that the new legislation will allow us to do so in a more efficient way.
To sum up, we stated in the Council that the Commission reserves the right to respond in accordance with the rules of the Treaty, with due regard to the welfare requirements of animals.
Therefore, the Commission will continue to be vigilant and will closely monitor the situation on animal transport in Member States.
We are prepared to take a legislative initiative at any time in the future should animal welfare conditions need further improvement.
I would like to comment on two more issues.
First, the improvement of animal welfare is a continuous process.
It is not just a regulation, we are already working on other improvements on poultry and on microclimates within the transport vehicles.
Therefore it is not the end, it is just the beginning.
At the same time, I have looked at what the options were at the last Council meeting.
They were not between the optimum maximum and the compromise, they were between the compromise and continuing indefinitely with the present situation, with all the unacceptable conditions that prevail at this point.
I am certain you will understand that if one has the responsibility of taking a decision, one has to weigh the pros and cons and decide in which direction to go.
I can assure you that the Commission's only concern on this issue was the welfare of the animals and how to make practical improvements as soon as possible.
It was not just to insist on a principle which eventually would harm the animals, because it would not enable us to improve the existing conditions in any way.
I repeat, the present compromise significantly improves the present situation without depriving the Commission of the right to come back to these very important issues.
Believe me, it was a Commission proposal.
We would have been much happier if these provisions were included and accepted in the compromise.
But, unfortunately, there was no possibility of such an agreement.
If I may, I suggest talking to the various NGOs.
They were not happy but they accepted this compromise because they realised that it is a significant step forward.
Finally â and I would be interested to hear your comments as I feel that Parliament will be a significant ally of the Commission in this matter â I can assure you that my intention is, before the end of this Commission's term and definitely before the end of this Parliament's term, to come back with a new proposal and have a new discussion.
The Commission is committed to this.
But, the big question and the big challenge will be to convince the Member States to accept this new proposal when it comes.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, I should like to thank Commissioner Kyprianou most warmly for the openness with which he has raised this issue once more.
You have only just assumed your duties, and I think that your position at all events opens up the possibility of a very good future working relationship between Parliament and the Commission on this, too.
I am saying this with good reason: you hit the nail on the head when you said just now that the main problem regarding animal transport in Europe is the lack of priority given to it by national authorities.
This is our sticking point, and remedying it would represent tremendous progress.
I should like to give an example by way of illustration.
I note that, at the present time, the Austrian government, in particular, is doing a good job and is exercising good supervision.
This is resulting in a large proportion of the international transport of stock for slaughter travelling to Italy by routes other than Austria all of a sudden.
This is the kind of situation that arises when a number of other Member States neglect their duties.
In that regard, the Austrian model should become the European model: with effective legislation and effective enforcement.
This is the way to put an end to all the unpleasant debate.
However, the Council has come to an agreement, and has made a corresponding amendment without giving prior notice to Parliament, which I find very disconcerting and also blameworthy on the part of the Council.
On the other hand, I must add that we should have been even worse off without this initiative, because we cannot deny that the agreement does constitute an improvement on the existing legislation.
You know Parliamentâs line of thinking.
I myself was rapporteur on the subject of a maximum journey time for stock for slaughter. This has now proved unattainable in the Council.
Nevertheless, I note that the introduction of the satellite tracking system has become a reality, at all events, and that enforcement of the existing rules is to be improved.
In that regard, I should like to hear how the Commission intends to enforce this at Member State level.
Are other instruments necessary in this regard, including on the part of Parliament?
I should also like to know how the Commission intends to support this in the context of improving training.
Finally, I note that farm-to-farm transport has been liberalised.
We should have liked to see 100 kilometres, but this was evidently unattainable in the Council.
Nevertheless, we have taken a small step forward.
I should like to mention two other points.
First of all, there is still a great deal of criticism of the means of regulation of the transport of breeding stock and the rest periods stated for this.
Animals must be transported as quickly as possible, and introducing the minimum possible number of rest periods for the transit of breeding stock, too â which is undertaken in the main in very favourable conditions â would be a step forward.
This means that animals can also be transported over medium distances.
The same goes for the roll-on/roll-off system on ferries.
Telling Member States in plain language that this is normal rest time would also be a great help.
All this would represent another few steps forward in improving the quality of animal transport.
As a former rapporteur, I am a little disappointed that no maximum journey times for stock for slaughter have been agreed.
Nevertheless, I see that this package as a whole does represent a genuine step forward.
I am extremely curious to hear what proposals the Commissioner intends to make before 2009 for the establishment of a good working relationship with Parliament, and also, in particular, for making Member States comply with the European rules.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, I should like to thank the Commissioner for his words.
I share his disappointment over the Councilâs compromise.
It brings no improvement in the journey times for animal transport, none in the rest periods and none in the maximum stocking density, and that could endure for years to come.
I wish the Council every success in attempting to explain this compromise to the European public.
It is an extremely bad one, including for the image of the whole sector, and one that is unacceptable from an animal welfare point of view.
I therefore support the proposal by my fellow Members to limit the maximum journey time to eight hours.
Only a decision of this nature would demonstrate that Europe is really serious about sustainable agriculture, one of the priorities of which must be animal welfare.
Europe is built in small steps, as we all know, and indeed that is a very good thing, in many cases even the best way.
Whilst the EU is taking excessively small steps here towards improving animal welfare, animals in Europe are being dragged back and forth for thousands of kilometres in atrocious conditions.
It will be nice and reassuring for them to know that they are being watched by satellites all along.
Â Â  . Mr President, I agree with the Commissioner's statement.
This is a very important issue.
I also agree that the EU has played an important role in regard to the way that animals are fed, transported and slaughtered.
As the Commissioner stated, the EU has ensured many improvements in animal welfare during transportation.
Some of them have been mentioned already: proposals for satellite tracking systems, ventilation and temperature monitoring, stricter conditions for driver training and a greater number of official inspections in different countries.
Progress has been made.
I also want to nail my colours to the mast because I am an MEP who represents a constituency that is both rural and urban.
Agriculture continues to play a very important economic role in the north and west of Ireland.
Indeed, the agriculture business has for many years been well supported by the EU.
Live animal exports are a hugely important, legitimate business for Ireland.
We export 90% of our animals and about 10% of those, or 200 000 live cattle, are exported every year to markets in France, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands.
This trade is worth over EUR 150 million annually.
Therefore, a vibrant export trade is essential for Irish agriculture and for the entire livestock sector.
I believe we must have access to the single market.
There is an important market for Irish weanlings in Europe and I believe this market should not be hindered.
Surely, free access to the market is one of the cornerstones of EU policy.
We also need to balance animal welfare with market access and support for agriculture, not just in Ireland, but also in the EU as a whole.
Again, I agree with the Commissioner.
We need enforcement and no one has a problem with that â consumers or farmers, it is in all our interests.
Another issue regarding live export is that the trade provides competition in Ireland.
This is another cornerstone of EU policy.
I believe we have made progress; there is probably further to go, but the Commission is doing useful work.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I took the initiative regarding this extra debate following the Council decision in November.
A number of technical improvements were at the cost of up to six yearsâ blocking of the issue of protecting our animals.
This would mean that, throughout their periods of office, neither Parliament nor the Commission would be given an opportunity to improve the conditions of animals, a state of affairs that is quite unreasonable.
The Council decision departed so completely from the proposal that I even doubted its legality.
MrÂ Kyprianou, I hope you realise your ambition of coming back with density figures and transport times as soon as possible.
I also hope that you make use of the Treatyâs articles concerning transport, consumer issues or health as a legal basis so that Parliament can participate through the codecision procedure.
We could then together break the Councilâs resistance to providing animals with reasonable conditions.
Unfortunately, the Council listens more to lobbyists than to opinion.
The maturity of a society is shown by the way in which it treats those who are defenceless.
If the rules governing the transport of animals are an indicator of Europeâs maturity, we are unfortunately still barbarians.
I invite all ministers to travel, together with myself, between Stockholm and Brussels under the conditions that apply to the transport of animals.
They might then understand what they have done.
If we are regarded as 75-kilo sheep, there will be ten of us in an area as large as a double bed.
If we are regarded as chickens, we shall see how faeces from those above fall down onto those below.
If we are regarded as pigs, we shall, in accordance with the Council decision, be given nothing less than electric shocks if we refuse to move.
We shall also be given water only after 14 hours before continuing for another 14 hours.
We must also try to ensure that, in accordance with the Council rules, the temperature is kept above five degrees Centigrade during the journey.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, if we are to believe what the Council says about this European Union of ours wanting to encourage sustainable development, and if we look at the reality of where this could be done and the way in which the Council goes about doing it in practice, we see that the Member States really cannot summon up the will to do it.
Yet again, animals have lost out when there is a choice to be made between protecting them or the profits of the firms that fatten them up.
I will nonetheless concede that the Commission has made an effort, and I will not deny that a number of changes have been made for the better, but the underlying principle has remained the same as it was before.
There are those of you in the Council who have decided not to have a limit on transport times for animals and that the permitted density should not be specified, and I am absolutely convinced that you would be quick to introduce other rules if your domestic pets were to be transported the length and breadth of Europe.
If we want to defend the right to life and the rights of animals, then we need to approach this from a different angle.
The introduction of the GSP satellite navigation system does, of course, achieve something; it means that checks can be better carried out.
There is no disputing that.
Likewise, if it is ensured that the animals are given water and improved ventilation, that is of course a small advance, but it does not solve the problem.
If you want regional development, this is a real opportunity to demonstrate it, for you can raise animals, fatten them up, and process them on the spot or within the local area without having to organise these transports from one end of the European Union to the other.
I really cannot understand how Mr Maat can describe this as tremendous progress.
I cannot see it as such.
It patches things up, without doing anything to deal with the main problems and remove the main causes of the torment these animals undergo.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I am a severe critic of the damage the EU has done to Britain and a passionate advocate of Britain's withdrawal from it.
The European Union destroys jobs â as Tony Blair said in his 1983 election address.
It has also passed legislation that has led to the closure of hundreds of local abattoirs.
However, this toothless Parliament passes resolutions that are then ignored by both the Council and the Commission.
The decisions made by this Parliament on the transportation of animals have been repeatedly ignored and horrendous suffering continues.
Over 3 million animals every year endure journeys lasting 30 hours or more in unacceptable conditions and many die in transit.
Were this not bad enough, even more suffering is now being planned by the European Union under the REACH Directive, and we will see millions more animals moved around for live testing.
To those in the outside world â the real world â who are as appalled as I am by all this, I have a simple message.
I wish the European Union would interfere and legislate less, for if the European Union is the answer it must surely have been a very stupid question.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the welfare of animals during transit has been a matter of continuing concern for Parliament over recent years.
I venture to suggest it has given rise to more concern than the plight of the millions of children dying of starvation or living in unacceptable conditions in contemporary Europe.
If the humanitarian organisations acting in the interests of those individuals had shown the same determination as their counterparts promoting the cause of animals, something could probably have been done to help the European children dying day after day.
I shall be more specific.
Parliament has issued two opinions on animal welfare in transit over the last three years.
I do not believe it is appropriate to devote any more time to the matter, as fortunately it was finally settled this November, following the agreement reached in the Council of Ministers of the European Union.
In my view, the compromise proposal tabled by the Irish Presidency was better.
It contained a reasonable restriction on journey times, taking account of both the animal welfare and the question of freedom of movement of goods within the European Union.
I would remind the House of the times in question, namely nine hours of journey time plus twelve for rest and a further nine hours of journey time.
The agreement reached today under the DutchÂ Presidency does not imply any change to existing regulations on journey time.
The decision on this crucial issue in the debate has been postponed for six years.
The postponement is due to the differences of opinion that still exist between the Member States. It amounts to stalemate.
Nonetheless, I would like to clarify one aspect I feel many of those following the debates have overlooked, and which should be brought to the notice of the citizens.
Existing regulations already impose a maximum travel time of eight hours when vehicles that do not comply with the welfare standards laid down in the regulations are used.
In addition, these standards have been tightened up by virtue of the agreement reached in the Council of Ministers.
Â Â  Mr President, I can understand why the Commission has gone along with this solution, because it is a pragmatic one.
The Council was not going to agree to anything more at this stage.
However, it is extremely disappointing â as everyone has said â that we could not get something on journey times, one of the key issues; or on stocking densities.
Member States can adopt tougher legislation.
We in this Parliament want a bigger say on these issues, but at the moment we do not have it.
I will certainly press my own government to go further on this.
I am pleased, Commissioner, that you mentioned enforcement.
That is one area where this legislation has fallen down in the past.
You will be aware of the NGOs that have given us video evidence of how this legislation has been by-passed and ignored.
You said that in four years you are going to come back with more legislation.
I hope that you do.
I hope you will keep Parliament informed of what happens in the interim.
We want to hear about what is happening with regard to reinforced monitoring.
I can guarantee that Parliament will back you when you bring forward your legislation.
We already have a written declaration on journey times.
I am sure that our commitment will remain the same.
Â Â  MrÂ President, animal protection should be moved immediately from the agricultural heading and from ArticleÂ 37.
It could, of course, be transferred to health and consumer protection because it would then be Commissioner Kyprianou who would be responsible for the matter, which sounds more reassuring.
In Denmark, it is the Justice Ministry that is responsible for this matter.
We regard animal protection as legal protection, but ArticleÂ 37 is exclusively about increasing production and earnings.
The poor animals must suffer heaven knows what kind of mistreatment when protection itself is subject to greed.
It is actually grotesque that export subsidies are paid when horses, cows and sheep have to be sent out of the EU.
Animals that are to be slaughtered should only be driven to the nearest abattoir and for a maximum of eight hours.
We have a majority in favour of this view in Denmark.
Animals that are not to be slaughtered should only be transported for eight hours without rest, food and a change of air, and the accommodation must be in order.
That is also something favoured by a majority in Denmark.
Of course, the previous Parliament stated this too, and it has to be asked why the Commission did not go to the Council and insist on these conditions being respected.
When we obtain the new Constitution, Parliament will have the right of codecision and, if animal protection had no longer been subject to ArticleÂ 37, Parliament would now already have had this right.
Regarding another matter â namely transparency â our Ombudsman expressly stated that the provisions of the new Constitution could properly be used when there was such large support for doing so, so there is a double opportunity for involving Parliament in this procedure right now.
What has happened is that a strategy has been chosen whereby a decision has been hurried through, almost as if it were a question of keeping both people and Parliament remote from the decision-making concerned over the next six years.
We, indeed I, have noted that the Member States must implement decisions that go further ...
Â Â  â MrÂ President, the problem at issue is of a cross-border nature and cannot be solved by national legislation alone.
For this reason, it is a matter for the European Commission and the European Parliament.
For years, Parliament has been inundated with petitions from people rightly calling for attention to abuses in animal transport.
This applies in particular to horses that come to the end of their useful life in the East but are destined to be slaughtered and eaten in the South.
Many animals spend a very long time in transit in lorries, with little to eat or drink, foul themselves, start to panic and suffer injury.
The only way to prevent this is to drastically reduce the distance and time permitted for the transport of live animals.
At the start of 2004, the dispute in this Parliament was a question of eight hours versus nine hours of continuous transport and of limited, cheap protective measures versus further-reaching, more expensive measures.
At that time, Parliament made a very moderate choice, but even that went too far for the governments of a number of Member States.
As a result, there is still scope for allowing those abuses to continue.
The key question is whether we accept this unnecessary animal suffering in anticipation of a resulting reduction in the costs of the livestock trade and of road transport companies, or whether we consider this suffering to be completely at variance with our civilisation and our responsibility for the welfare of our fellow creatures.
My choice is emphatically in favour of civilisation and responsibility.
What the Commissioner is now announcing is the failure of decision making in the European Union.
We have shown ourselves to be unable to do what is urgently needed.
National economic interests are taking precedence over our shared civilisation and responsibility.
Listening to Commissioner Kyprianou speak, I have no doubt as to his good intentions.
I support his announcement of new initiatives by the European Commission.
I also agree with his view that it would be better to start quickly on the basis of a woefully inadequate result than of no result at all.
Satellite monitoring is cold comfort for the animals.
Let us not trust solely in new technologies, but rather build on the political will to genuinely eliminate this abuse.
That is what is important.
I hope that we are able to achieve real results by the end of the term of office of this Parliament and this Commission, because what is currently taking place is an absolute disgrace.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the transport of animals within the EU and from the EU to countries outside it has on quite a few occasions been comprehensively criticised.
Most recently, we have received information about the disgraceful conditions under which animals have been exported from the EU to Lebanon.
That worries us.
Will the Commission prioritise this problem?
We hope so, but are not completely convinced.
Another matter that gives rise to concern is the reports on financial fraud issued by OLAF at regular intervals.
Recently, these concerned complaints relating to financial fraud in connection with the transport of animals to Lebanon.
In purely financial terms, subsidies for the export of animals from the EU to third countries total approximately SEKÂ 60â100Â million per year.
Does this amount to properly used tax revenue?
We hope that the Commission will take animal protection seriously and that we do not have to read further reports concerning misused export subsidies.
Â Â  Mr President, I thank the Commission for raising this important issue for animals and humans.
There is a failure of implementation, not a failure of regulation.
In fact, in many cases we have over-regulation but also non-implementation.
This has led to problems for farmers and those engaged in what is a very legitimate trade.
One of my Irish colleagues has mentioned the importance of this trade for Irish farmers.
The new agriculture support system urges farmers to opt for market-led farming.
There is a legitimate market in mainland Europe for young cattle from Irish farms.
Are we going to tell farmers that they cannot engage in this legitimate trade?
I do not think we can, because it is vital for the success of Irish farmers.
However, animal welfare must of course also be a priority.
One colleague raised concerns about Lebanon.
