That is all covered by the Commissionâs proposals.
Mrs Buitenweg specifically mentioned Eurotax.
The Commission proposed to open this possibility for the next financial perspectives in 2014.
I can inform you that the Council is currently discussing that and that it will continue to do so.
By way of update on the discussion, I can inform you that it is unlikely that the Council will argue in favour of bringing this date forward any earlier than proposed by the Commission.
Another specific point that has been mentioned by a number of you â Mrs Jensen, I believe was the first one, but Mr Walter and others followed suit â concerns the duration of the financial perspectives and the seven-year term.
The Commission has proposed to apply the seven-year term once more, and this is also still being discussed in the Council.
We have not adopted a position on this.
You know just as I do that the multi-annual budget is a framework within which the annual provisions are made.
We do not lay down everything in exact detail for seven years, or however many years, but I do not need to tell you that.
What matters are the ceilings within which there is scope for annual allocations, provided that the margins are sufficient.
Finally, I am looking forward to working with the European Parliament, for the remaining time that I will be in the role of President.
I am also saying this on behalf of the Council.
We will not be accepting foregone conclusions, as some of you fear.
First of all, at all times, but certainly now during the preparations of these financial perspectives, the Council listens very carefully to the opinions, remarks, signals or resolutions in the European Parliament.
I cannot speak formally on behalf of the Luxembourg Presidency, but I can say that it seems a good idea to me to continue the informal way in which contacts between Council and the European Parliament have been established during the preparatory stages.
Which brings me to my last remark.
I do not entertain the worst-case scenarios one or two in this House have suggested in connection with the question as to what we will do if things do not go to plan.
We should beware of a self-fulfilling prophecy and should consider how we dealt with confrontation between the European Parliament and the Council about the annual budget.
As you know, the negotiations were tough and in a tense atmosphere.
If truth be told, the Councilâs and Parliamentâs starting positions were very different, but we have struck a sound compromise.
This compromise is beneficial to the European Parliament, to the Council and, above all, to Europe, and all of this on time despite tense negotiations.
I think that that should be an example of how we can look toward the multi-annual budget.
Â Â  I have received a motion for a resolution (B6-0189/2004) on behalf of the Temporary committee on policy challenges and budgetary means of the enlarged Union 2007-2013.
The debate is closed.
Â Â  The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the EU-Russia summit.
Â Â  . Mr President, further to your kind words, I would like to preface my speech with the remark that unfortunately, given todayâs previous planning in your Parliament, I have a commitment as a result of which I should have left by 7 p.m.
With your permission therefore, I will leave after I have read out my speech.
I would like to start by saying that I fully agree with Mr Cohn-Bendit that the EU-Russia summit was more than a discussion on Ukraine.
It was an occasion to further deepen our relations in various fields and therefore I am glad that we are holding this debate on the EU and Russia today.
I hope that you will forgive me for not staying for the full debate.
The EU and Russia have come closer in more than one respect.
With the ratification of the PCA (Partnership and Cooperation Agreement) enlargement protocol and the Russian ratification of Kyoto, Russia has underlined the importance it attaches to its strategic partnership with the European Union.
This strategic partnership is also important for us.
Together we can handle not only difficult issues of mutual importance but we can also address important international issues such as the environment and the fight against terrorism.
The four common spaces form an essential part of our strategic relationship; they show that we want to be more than just close neighbours.
We want to be good neighbours.
During the last six months we have made substantial progress; we have been able more or less to complete negotiations on two of the four spaces, namely on economics, research, education and culture.
We hope that at the next summit in May 2005 in Moscow we will be able to reach agreement on all four spaces.
In the EU, we see those four spaces as interlinked.
The EU wants to lift the level of cooperation between the EU and Russia to a higher level, but this has to be across the board.
There can be no picking and choosing.
Furthermore, we will do this â and I have not set aside fundamental principles and objectives for the sake of a quick compromise.
It is important to note that, whilst negotiations on this basis are ongoing, we will try to intensify EU-Russia relations wherever possible whilst respecting our principles.
There are some very important issues, such as the Kyoto protocol, where we have to move forward and we cannot wait for a final agreement on this basis.
Both Russia and the EU have agreed that the WTO accession is important for Russia.
The EU has offered assistance in the WTO negotiations with other partners, but we have insisted that Russia should take WTO rules seriously.
Russia should thus increase the confidence of foreign investors.
It also means that Russia should be willing to solve economic disputes.
In this respect the EU recalled the unresolved issue of Siberian overflight payments at the summit.
There is still some work to be done in the common space of freedom, security and justice.
The most important issue is the question of the EU's desire for readmission agreements, which is linked to the Russian desire for visa facilitation as well as the long-term objective of a visa-free regime.
For the EU a readmission agreement is an essential element of this common space, therefore we are not willing to compromise just to obtain a result.
We want a good result â and that is in the interests of our people.
We consider respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms to be of paramount importance and therefore an importance element of this space.
We raised the issues of Chechnya and the situation in the Northern Caucasus as well as the position of the media with our Russian partners during the summit.
Unfortunately we were not able to make substantial progress since opinions continue to differ.
But I hope we will be able to maintain a frequent dialogue on human rights issues.
This discussion is a two-way street, therefore we had no objections to Russia raising the issue of Russian-speaking minorities in the Baltic States.
In my view, we gave the Russians a clear and satisfying answer to these questions.
The EU asked Russia about its objections to the notion of a common neighbourhood, which we consider to be important for the common space of external security.
Unfortunately, here we have different views as we have seen with Ukraine, but we will continue to try to convince Russia that working together to create a stable, democratic and free common neighbourhood is not only in the EU's interest, but also in Russia's: it is a win-win situation.
We should look to see where we can find common ground rather than just criticise each other.
On the common space of research and education, including cultural aspects, there was agreement in principle to establish a European training centre institute in Moscow.
This will enable Russian citizens to understand the European Union better.
Furthermore the EU appreciated Russian support on ITER.
Regarding the fight against terrorism, during a visit by Gijs de Vries, our counter-terrorism coordinator, President Putin said that Mr de Vries was highly valued by his Russian counterpart.
His counterpart will visit Brussels shortly.
Moscow was very interested in EU policy developments such as document security.
Russia also wants to exchange data with Europol, Eurojust, etc. The EU is in principle ready for this, but first Moscow has to ratify the Council of Europe's Convention on Data Protection.
President Putin committed himself to this and I hope that this commitment will bear fruit shortly.
The discussions on external relations were primarily focused on what the EU considers to be our common neighbourhood, in particular Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova.
It will not come as a surprise to you when I say that the discussions on Ukraine were long, intense and very frank.
They took up the whole working lunch.
We agreed on a number of important issues.
The current situation should be solved in a peaceful manner without any violence.
Secondly, Ukrainian law should be respected.
Thirdly, we should try to avoid a deepening of the rift between the Ukrainian people.
Whoever becomes President should be the President of all Ukrainian people and the territorial integrity of Ukraine should be respected.
I have already referred to the telephone call that Prime Minister Balkenende made to President Putin this afternoon, so I do not think I need dwell too much on this subject.
In addition to Ukraine we discussed a number of other international issues.
In view of the limited time and given the fact that the views of the EU and Russia on, for example Iran and the Western Balkans, coincide to a large extent, I will not go into details now.
The relations between the EU and Russia are of strategic importance.
Russia needs the EU, just as the EU needs Russia.
During the Dutch presidency we have been able to intensify our relations and bring the four common spaces a lot closer.
Furthermore, the EU has managed to speak with one voice during the past month, which has not always been the case with such an important dossier as EU-Russia relations.
I believe this can be seen as progress.
The EU and Russia have had and still have differences, but that is only natural.
Russia has to get used to the fact that in more that one respect we have become closer neighbours, whose interests are not always identical.
However, we are able to discuss those issues freely and in a very frank manner, and that is essential for a strategic relationship.
I hope that the next presidency will be able to inform you that we have complete agreement on the four common spaces that form the basis of this relationship.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr NicolaÃ¯, both for your statement and for the time you have shared with us.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr NicolaÃ¯, although much has, of course already been said, I should like to start by stressing once again that the EUâs enlargement has made Russia a much more important partner for us, as it is the European Unionâs big neighbour, and we want it to be a strategic partner.
We must be able to discuss all issues with Russia, both with regard to where we want to make progress, but also with regard to international issues, even if we sometimes have differences of opinion.
At the summit on 25 November, it became clear that we could talk in a very good, business-like atmosphere, and the discussions were also very detailed.
Mr NicolaÃ¯ has already mentioned that we, of course, want to have the four large areas together as a package.
This package was the focus of our negotiations.
In addition, as he also quite rightly noted, we discussed international issues, with Ukraine taking up a large part of the time.
The Commission saw it as particularly important to maintain the quality and integrity of this package as regards the four common areas.
We did not want the individual parts to be negotiated separately.
This was what we had agreed on, and this will remain the framework in future.
Whilst wishing to express my thanks to the Presidency of the Council, the Commission also played a large role in enabling us to continue with this position.
I am confident that intensive further negotiations will allow us to reach an overall agreement on this package in May.
Some of the packageâs contents have already been mentioned.
In the common economic area, the conditions must be created for a strengthening of economic relations. This means that trade and investment must be promoted, existing obstacles must be eliminated and, above all, that legal and administrative provisions must increasingly comply or be made compatible.
We have also decided â and I believe that this is an important point â to initiate a dialogue between the European Union and Russia on energy, and, above all, to utilise successful cooperation in this area as an engine for other areas.
We also raised such issues as the investment climate in Russia and, in this connection, the situation of YUKOS.
Above all, we stressed the need for transparency, stability and predictability.
We have also decided, as MrÂ NicolaÃ¯ mentioned, that the common economic area will particularly deal with environmental issues.
This will make it possible for us to take a common approach to the challenges of environmental policy, and we have of course welcomed Russiaâs ratification of the Kyoto Protocol.
This will make it possible for us to step up our bilateral cooperation, but above all cooperation in international forums on climate protection.
In the second area, the area for freedom, security and law, we decided to continue our intensive discussions, during which equal account must be taken of the aspects of security, on the one hand, and freedom and law on the other.
It is important for us that it should be in this area that we anchor the basic questions of protection for fundamental rights, of the principle of the rule of law and of human rights.
We agreed that it is in this area that we wish to deal with issues relating to easier travel and issues of asylum and return.
In addition, this area will continue to deal with issues such as terrorism, organised crime, corruption and trafficking in human beings.
In addition, we offered to step up our cooperation in the fight against drugs, for example with third countries such as Afghanistan, or also with the United Nations, which plays an important role in this respect.
Turning to Chechnya, we made an offer to Russia to assist in the reconstruction of the country, as soon as the security situation makes this possible.
With regard to the area of external security, this should make it possible for us to implement genuine cooperation on all issues relating to conflicts in our common neighbourhood, so that we can promote common care for stability and security in the region.
It did of course become clear that we still need to convince Russia that cooperation on issues of common security is in both our interests; we also discussed the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the fight against terrorism and civil protection as part of closer cooperation.
We also, finally, want to extend our cooperation in the field of research, education and culture.
Our goal in this field is again to promote contacts between our societies and, above all, to continue to promote innovation.

Of course we discussed a number of individual questions, of which I would particularly like to draw attention to three; firstly, on the Commissionâs suggestion we decided to set up this new forum in which we wish to discuss all issues relating to regional cooperation.
In addition, we want to set up a new sub-committee in the framework of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, where we will also be able to discuss issues relating to Kaliningrad.
In our opinion, it is important to discuss not only issues relating to transit, but also, and above all, issues relating to economic and social development.
Secondly, we agreed to hold regular consultations on human rights issues, including the issues of minorities and fundamental rights, which Mr NicolaÃ¯ has already mentioned.
Thirdly, we reached an agreement on an Institute for European Studies in Moscow.
You will all be aware that the situation in Ukraine was a priority at the working lunch, and we referred very clearly to our position, which we set out earlier.
I can say that we agreed that the situation can be resolved only by peaceful means and within the framework of the Ukrainian constitution.
We said that the Ukrainian people had a right to decide its own future and the future of the country.
Despite all the differences of opinion on this issue, we should not forget how much also connects us with Russia, this large country and our partner, and we must therefore do everything in our power to eliminate differences, to make progress and to find joint solutions.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to wish Commissioner Benita Ferrero all the best with her important responsibilities.
Today is her first appearance at a Brussels plenary session, though I know that this afternoonâs debate is her second one.
The truth is that you have taken up your responsibilities at a very delicate time on the international scene; you have been at the International Conference on Iraq; you have met on the sidelines with the Quartet to deal with the relaunch of the Roadmap for the Middle East peace process following the death of Yasser Arafat; you have had to attend this European Union-Russia Summit; we have the political crisis in Ukraine.
You will have plenty of work to do over the coming days, Commissioner.
With enlargement, the Union has clearly extended its borders with some new neighbours.
You have referred to the new neighbours to the north; Russia, Belarus, Ukraine and Moldavia and it is true that we are currently linked to Russia by means of an Association Agreement which is based on principles and values to which the European Union is fundamentally committed; principles and values, Commissioner, which I believe have not on this occasion been compatible with the Russian authoritiesâ comments on the European Unionâs position on Ukraine, since they have said that the European Unionâs position could lead to a bloodbath in that country.
I note that President Putin has put that right, accepting the results following his meeting and talks with the German Federal Chancellor.
As you are aware, Commissioner, this Parliament is completely and utterly committed to human rights; they are not just for one country, for one region or for one continent; they are of a truly universal worldwide nature.
In our relations with Russia, we cannot stress the good things and forget about the bad.
The ratification of the Kyoto Protocol is clearly one of the good things, and the bad things include, as you have mentioned, the human rights cases in Chechnya and the Yukos case, for example.
I believe, Commissioner, that it is important for the Commission to have a defined policy of friendly relations, but on the basis of our values; to this end, we must also closely monitor the measures taken recently by the Russian authorities, in terms of the always difficult balance between security and freedom, following the attacks in North Osetia, in a decentralised manner.
It is, therefore, very important, Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, that we enhance those relations.
Russia plays an extremely important role in terms of the stability of the new neighbours, and has fundamental influence in the Balkans and also in Central Asia, it has nuclear weapons, it participates with us in the Quartet and we must therefore develop a strategic association and cooperation, not at any price, but based on the values and principles that we as the European Union hold dear.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, at the end of your speech you referred to the need to extend and build good neighbourly and cooperative relations with Russia.
I should like to lend my full support to this and to all the other points you mentioned.
The fact that we have not yet achieved such relations is perhaps due to the fact that the basis of trust between Russia and the European Union is perhaps not yet quite as it should be.
In turn, this is due to the fact that Russia feels almost hemmed in by an enlarging European Union, and now, faced with developments in Ukraine and the South Caucasus, is, so to speak, worried for its own existence and field of influence.
I am not saying this in order to justify Russiaâs position, but this position must also be viewed from a psychological viewpoint.
The European Union â and I am therefore also grateful for what you and the President of the Council said â must explain to Russia that democracy in countries neighbouring Russia, combined with the rule of law, will ultimately result in stable economic conditions in Russia as well.
It was therefore vital not to say, with regard to Ukraine, that there is a Russian candidate and an EU candidate, but to say that there can only be candidates elected by the Ukrainian people to be their president.
What is at stake, as you have already mentioned a few times today, is that Ukrainian interests should prevail.
With regard to the issue of dialogue on energy as well, it is vital that the Russian partners also understand the psychological situation on our side.
The fact is that we will have a major interest in Russian energy supplies only when we are sure that energy will never be used as a political weapon and that the supply will not be cut off on political grounds, in other words, only when there is an open investment climate in Russia.
Cooperation with Russia in the field of energy will then be much improved, as I have just stressed.
With regard to the fight against terrorism, we do indeed have common interests, but â while I will not deny that the armed forces or the police need to be deployed â our methods differ.
As we have always stressed in connection with Chechnya, however, it is also important to fight the causes of terrorism, and in many cases these are poverty and poor economic development.
With regard to the issue of human rights, I am fully in favour of dialogue.
We have nothing to hide.
We also have nothing to hide with regard to the treatment of Russian-speaking minorities in the European Union and with regard to the situation of such minorities, as we have done a lot for them, and it is to be hoped that we will continue to do so.
Yet we must find Russia prepared to engage in this dialogue.
Finally, there is something else of great importance that we must communicate.
In recent discussions with Russian journalists in Berlin, I was asked why it was necessary for Russia to justify itself to the European Union.
No, Russia does not need to justify itself to the European Union!
Russia must justify itself to its own people, and, in common with the European Union, Russia must also justify itself to the world at large.
We are all committed to the goals of democracy and the rule of law.
When Russia feels itself to be just as committed to them as is the European Union, its situation will improve.
It is therefore important for us to build relations, in the interest of Russia and not only in the interest of the European Union.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, relations with Russia are extremely important for the EU.
Russia is our neighbour and, because of its size, history and position, the country can play an extremely important role and be a constructive partner on the continent of Europe.
We have many shared interests and problems that we must solve together, and our group supports the partnership with Russia and wants it to be strengthened, deepened and developed.
It has to be said, however, that the Russia strategy has not been any great success so far.
It feels rather as if we are treading water and not getting anywhere.
Russia is unwilling to appreciate that cooperation is based upon give and take and that the EUâs policy is based on certain values that cannot be negotiated away and that must be seen as a clear thread running through everything we do.
There is reason for feeling very uneasy now, following the latest developments in Russia.
I am thinking of the concentration of power in the Kremlin, of the media situation â in principle, media freedom is a thing of the past â and of the lack of a political solution in Chechnya.
I am also thinking of very recent developments, namely Putinâs support for Yanukovich in Ukraine and, earlier, for Lukashenko in Belarus.
Relations between the EU and Russia are in a critical phase, and we cannot describe the latest meeting as anything other than a failure, even though I genuinely admire and sympathise with your optimism, Commissioner.
You stated that a decision had been made in favour of deeper and more organised cooperation when it came to human rights and minorities.
I hope that this will lead to something more practical so that this forum does not just become a talking shop that skates over the surface of issues, but is a place in which difficult issues genuinely can be solved.
It would be interesting to hear more details from you about this decision.
Â Â  . Mr President, I too should first of all like to congratulate Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner.
It is her first debate here and I look forward to good cooperation.
I have listened carefully to what you said, Commissioner.
You said that we have offered to help the Russians in the countryâs reconstruction as soon as security is guaranteed.
That, Commissioner, is putting the cart before the horse.
That is not the right way of going about things.
After all, we all know there is no peace in Chechnya, that a peace process is being imposed that has no support base and that human rights are being violated on a daily basis.
We all know that the situation in Russia is extremely serious.
I have gleaned this from the most recent book by Anna Politkovskaya, an independent journalist who writes in her new book âPutinâs Russiaâ how in Russia, human rights are being violated on a daily basis, how the grip of central government on the press is being tightened every day and how the power of the KGB/FSB is increasing.
We can all see that the situation is serious and that in Chechnya, a true peace process must be put in motion.
That is where the European Union comes in.
Indeed, we are next-door neighbours and we can play a role in that respect. Not by building houses over there, but by organising a true peace conference.
That is why it surprises me that the Russians do not even want to get involved in talks with ordinary citizens, with representatives of the mothers of soldiers who are worried about the fate of their children, who are worried about peace and about human rights being observed, and who want to go and talk to representatives of the Maskhadov Government and Mr Zakayev.
I am also surprised by the fact that the Russians are even putting governments, including the Belgian Government, under pressure to deny Mr Zakayev access to this country and to this Parliament.
That is unacceptable.
That is something we as MEPs cannot accept and against which we must protest.
If an important group in this Parliament wants to organise a dialogue between mothers of soldiers and Mr Zakayev, then this should be covered by parliamentary immunity; if not, Belgium is not worthy of retaining the seat of the European Parliament here in Brussels.
Â Â  .Â Â Â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, one thing becomes clear when considering the relations being forged between the European Union and neighbouring countries, namely that the EU is suffering from Americophobia and Russophobia.
In recent days, the second of these has become particularly apparent, that is, the fear of Russia as a major partner and a major country to the East.
The European Union has an inferiority complex that overshadows its relations with Russia, and today a strange kind of judgment is being passed on Russia for its position on Ukraine.
It has been said that Russia is interfering in Ukraineâs domestic affairs.
Yet what action is being taken by the European Union and our representatives?
They are travelling to the country as observers, but becoming involved on behalf of one of the candidates.
This should not be the case.
Democracy is something quite different.
If we wish to demand democratic standards of Russia, we should first demand them of ourselves, and do everything in our power to ensure that we observe these standards.
We are not entitled to pass judgment on Russia in this matter.
Why is the EU interfering in such a manner in the sovereign decisions of the independent Russian state, when PresidentÂ Putin has warned us against interfering in the Russian sphere of influence?
Russia has a right to its own opinions, and it is our strategic trading partner.
Kaliningrad, which borders directly onto the European Union and Poland, should be of the utmost importance to us, as it is a window onto the world in terms of trade.
Yet as a result of our panic-stricken reaction to the events in Ukraine, Russia has tightened restrictions on people passing through border crossings, in particular those into Kaliningrad.
We have much to lose by adopting such a schizophrenic approach in our relations with Russia.
Relations with this large country should be stepped up, not restricted.
Finally, I should like to add that the EU has interfered enough in the domestic affairs of independent states, in this case in those of Russia.
The result of this has been that, against our wishes, the areas in the east of Ukraine are being pushed into Russiaâs hands.
I should like to end my speech with an old Roman maxim: âfirst, do no harmâ.
This is particularly true in the case of relations with Russia.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, I should like to make reference to the statement issued by the parties after the 14thÂ EU-Russia Summit, and in particular to the section concerning the implementation of elements on which both sides agree.
The elements in question relate, of course, to the common spaces.
It is my opinion that both the Presidency and the Commission have given way on this issue in the face of Russiaâs disapproval, expressed on a number of occasions before the summit, of the position taken by this House and by the Members of this House.
I refer to the view that the PCA should be treated as one package in negotiations with Russia.
In a certain sense, this has meant that our votes on this issue have been disregarded.
I should like to say one more thing with reference to discussions on Ukraine.
The country with which we are negotiating a road map for implementation of the PCA and the country actively interfering in the electoral process in Ukraine are one and the same country.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, in my country childrenâs programmes are broadcast after 7Â p.m.
It is my belief that the President-in-Office is a fan of bedtime stories and childrenâs programmes, and that is why he has left us.
This does, however, show a certain lack of respect for the European Parliament, and I very much hope it will not be repeated in future.
I am delighted this debate is taking place today.
It would have been wrong to replace it with the debate on Ukraine, as Ukraine is one country and Russia is another, even if Russia, or part of Russia, still thinks or wants to think in terms of the Soviet Union or the Tsarist Empire.
I am also delighted for a second reason, namely that MrÂ Barroso and MrÂ Putin had major differences of opinion at the recent summit in The Hague, and that these differences of opinion did not merely relate to Ukraine.
The sight of self-satisfied politicians shaking hands has generally been a bad omen for the average citizen, especially in the East.
What conclusions can be drawn from relations between Moscow and Brussels, or in other words between Russia and the European Union, over the past few years?
The most obvious conclusion is that these were not in fact relations between Brussels and Moscow, but between Russia and the individual EU Member States, in particular the largest Member States.
They were relations between Russia and France, Russia and Germany, Russia and Great Britain and Russia and Italy.
Moscow chose its own partners for bilateral relations and played off the EU and, to a large extent, large countries against medium-sized and small countries.
Our only reaction therefore has to be to act in solidarity within the framework of a united EU.
Russia is an important and difficult partner, and we should not give it any opportunity to develop imperial and superpower-like tendencies.
Europe, both Western Europe and Central and Eastern Europe, cannot afford to allow this to happen.
It is not in Russiaâs long-term strategic interest either.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, no one is likely to question the fact that Russia is one of the EUâs most important partners, yet at the same time few people in Europe would question the fact that Russia is a very difficult partner.
On the one hand, we are linked by extremely close economic ties that benefit both sides, yet on the other hand, tensions are increasingly being felt between the two parties in the political sphere, and very far-reaching differences of opinion are becoming apparent.
In spite of what is said by some in Europe, and what was said earlier by some of the Members of this House, we should not fear such differences.
On the contrary, our experience of countries which were in the so-called Soviet sphere of influence for many years has taught us that a genuine partnership and respect from the Russian side will only become possible if we state our views clearly and firmly, even if these views are extremely critical of certain aspects of Russian politics.
In this context, I should like to congratulate MrÂ Balkenende and the entire Dutch Presidency for their clear and firm approach during the EU-Russia summit on 25Â November.
In the days after this summit we saw that we were right in our assessment of political events in Ukraine, and this continues to be the case today.
I should also like to remind MrÂ Rogalksi that Ukraine is not a part of Russia, and so speaking out in defence of free and democratic elections for the Ukrainian people does not constitute interference in Russiaâs domestic affairs.
Ukraine is a separate state and a separate nation, and I should ask you to bear this in mind.
Thanks to the position taken by the Dutch Presidency, the EU is gaining face in the eyes of the European nations, after a long period during which too many European leaders pretended not to see, or indeed did not see, the problems which arose with regard to relations with Russia in the past, such as the centralisation of power at the cost of a still-fragile democracy, Russiaâs policy on the Caucasus or the reconstruction of the Russian âsphere of influenceâ.
I should like to thank MrÂ Balkenende for the position he adopted during the EU-Russia summit.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union now has problems both to the east and to the west, both with the United States of America and Russia.
The administration in the United States has adopted a strongly unilateral approach. It is conspicuous in trade disputes and the Iraq war, and has given rise to an estrangement of sorts.
Our relations now require much effort.
Immigrants have formed a new group of American citizens that voted for the Republicans in the last elections.
Defence Minister Donald Rumsfeld has said that we have new Europeans in the same way.
In fact we have enlarged and in this way brought new blood to our numbers.
These newcomers, however, have had a different relationship with the United States (not for very much longer, in my opinion, as our work gradually hones that relationship), and Russia, through a grim and difficult history as part of the Soviet Union or as one of its satellites.
Our first Parliamentary Cooperation Committee met last week, and it was then that the issue was raised for the first time, though certainly not the last.
Last weekâs summit, in my opinion, was largely unsuccessful.
We did not achieve consensus on four areas of action that we share.
They are only part of the whole.
We know the reasons.
The problems relate to both America and Russia, but relations with Russia are virtually at a standstill.
There has been some progress: acceptance of enlargement and the partnership pact, the Kyoto Protocol, and so on. There is, however, a long list of problems with regard to the investment protection accord in Chechnya, which has been mentioned here too.
We have discussed common values with the Russians at many summits.
But just how much do we share the same values?
Are we drifting away from one another as far as our values are concerned?
If they are very different for very long it will not be long before we drift into the area of sanctions.
What does the Commission intend to do to halt this drift and ensure that Russia does not sail off into the void, as it were, perhaps towards the east and Asia?
What could the Commission do about this?
Â Â  Mr President, this EU-Russia summit is a very important event because it is the first held since EU was enlarged to include the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.
It is my sincere belief that the outcome of the summit needs to be debated in the European Parliament, so let me stress a few points that were discussed during the summit.
Parliament should welcome the 14th EU-Russia Summit in the Hague while regretting, however, that it has been a failure as far as substantial progress on the establishment of the four common spaces is concerned.
We should strongly support the efforts of the Council and Commission to use the opportunity provided by the summit to underline that Russia, the partner of the European Union, carries a great responsibility in our common neighbourhood, and in Ukraine, Moldova and Belarus in particular.
We should also firmly reject the allegations recently made by the Russian authorities that the European Union and the international community, by expressing their support for the Ukrainian peopleâs right to exercise their constitutional rights, is encouraging violence in Ukraine.
In this context we should express our concern about the centralisation of Kremlin powers at the expense of democracy, independent media, the regions, the rule of law and human rights, especially with regard to the situation in Chechnya and the Yukos affair.
At the same time I believe that ratification of broad agreements between the Russian Federation and certain Member States of the Union is one of the keys to strengthening the EU-Russia partnership and encouraging mutual understanding and trust.
Finally, the Kaliningrad region, as an important factor for the overall development of the Baltic Sea area, was also discussed in the Hague.
Therefore, I would like to take this opportunity to call on the Russian Duma and the leadership of the Russian Federation to start a dialogue on the development of a separate action plan for the economic and social development of the Kaliningrad region.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the new map of Europe has been redrawn in conjunction with this yearâs enlargement, and most of the new Member States and those countries that are negotiating for membership right now have, in one way or another, had strong connections with Russia.
Sometimes, those connections were made willingly and, at other times, unwillingly.
Russia thus continues to play a large role in terms of stability, especially in the area around the EUâs eastern borders.
It must not, however, actively side with the dictatorships there or impede the development of democracy.
If this happens, the EU must be vigorous in its condemnation.
The events in connection with the election in Serbia a few years ago, which resulted in Milosevicâs departure, are very reminiscent of what is happening now in Ukraine.
Then, the crisis was resolved peacefully, and we must ensure that this crisis too is resolved peacefully.
In that case, Europe needs, on the one hand, to show itself prepared to cooperate with Russia and, on the other hand, to emphasise that Russia should not interfere in other countriesâ internal affairs, irrespective of the common history these countries and Russia may previously have had.
If Russia seriously wants to be a strategic cooperation partner of the EU, it must be clear that the cornerstones of such cooperation have to be freedom, mutual respect and the democratic values shared by the EU countries.
I have no specific questions for MrsÂ Ferrero-Waldner but wish to emphasise that neither the EU nor Russia should ever have interests in another country other than an interest in democracy and that this must be both a basis for, and an objective of, cooperation between the EU and Russia.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, Ukraine is being born in front of our very eyes and those of Russia.
Russia and ourselves take different views, and that is why the Summit has communicated so little on the issue.
Instead, there are Europeâs open evaluations.
There is extraordinary development in Ukraine.
A nation of citizens, such as Russian manifestly is not, is being born.
It is Ukraineâs hour now.
According to our documents, however, Russia has great responsibility, â in my view, the greatest.
Ukraineâs chairman of Parliament made a start by announcing that Ukraine has only two alternatives â either the division of the state or bloodshed.
It looks like the Russian President would be in favour of completely restarting the election process, so that the opposition leader could be eliminated.
If the resigning president of Ukraine is going to listen to such advice and announce a decree to organise not just the second round but completely new elections, Russia will be responsible for the consequences.
This would become a provocation for hundreds of thousands of people, who could lose patience leading to a loss of peaceful civil order.
If they were to occupy the presidential palace, as happened in Georgia, they could be met by the gunshots of a foreign army.
The European Parliament or the European Commission â I am directing my comments to Mrs Ferrero Valdner here â could officially ask the Russian Government, or at least its representatives, if the reports by the Moscow press about Russian special armed forces being brought into Kiev dressed in Ukrainian uniforms are correct.
Extreme as the situation appears, it is difficult to understand the sympathy expressed for the Russian president â who got involved so unnecessarily â as if he cannot lose.
Fourteen years ago, we in Lithuania were similarly aware of the majority in the West feeling sorry for Mikhail Gorbachev.
That had a bad effect on the Kremlin, and Gorbachev lost a lot more influence.
A politics designed to restore the Russian empire has now already been defeated in Ukraine, even though President Putin remains a force in the world.
He has two alternatives â either acknowledge the Ukrainiansâ right to have their government and democratic state or spill blood and be left with blood on his hands like Gorbachev.
President Putinâs friends should speak directly with him, not via Mr Kuchma, and unanimously advise him to choose the first option.
Thank you.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like, briefly, to revisit a number of points.
Firstly, I should like to re-emphasise that this summit was not, as I see it, in any way a failure; on the contrary, it allowed us to make significant progress.
As I said before, the EU insisted on quality and on putting together a package that really does enable us to push through our concerns and our values, which are of course very important to us.
The big question is how difficult questions are to be dealt with.
This year has already seen us asking ourselves this question, and it was decided that it was important to set clear priorities, to be open, to deal with all problems, and to stick to common positions â and we succeeded in doing all of this, which was an important step and a positive one.
This was something to which the Commission attached particular value, and I am glad that all the Members of this House helped us to achieve this goal.
The issue at stake here is the finding of mutual interests, but this presupposes care before links are forged, and must be founded on values rather than on interests.
One example of a success is that at the WTO negotiations we came to a bilateral agreement on private transport to and from Kaliningrad.
As already noted, we have set up two sub-committees, which I believe is important, and this has been approved by Russia.
We have major tasks ahead of us, which include migration, visa issues, returns and cooperation in border regions.
I should like to reply to Mr Staes, not having done so before as there was of course a lot going on at this summit.
I can tell him that Mr Barroso made it clear to the Russian delegation that a political solution in Chechnya does of course enjoy support from Europe, the Commission and the entire EU.
Â Â  â Thank you, Commissioner.
I inform the House that at the end of the debate I have received two motions for resolutions.
For technical reasons, these motions for resolutions cannot in any case be put to the vote during this round of voting.
Â Â  â We come to the time for speeches by those Members who ask to speak.
As you know, they are limited to one minute each.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, I should like to inform you that the salami producer IgloomeatÂ SA SokoÅÃ³w Polska has asked to be deleted from AppendixÂ 12 to the Treaty of Accession.
There is documentary evidence that IgloomeatÂ SA met the requirements arising under Council Directive No 77/99/EEC relating to the processing of meat on 13Â FebruaryÂ 2004.
It therefore applied to be included in the list of establishments exporting products to the EU Member States, but Igloomeatâs management has not yet received any decision.
I should therefore like to ask you, Mr President, to call on the European Commission to take action in this particular case, and to highlight the failure of EU institutions to act promptly, thus making it difficult for businesses from the new EU Member States to operate on EU markets.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to raise the situation of one of my constituents, John Packwood from the Isle of Wight, who, as a result of an international arrest warrant taken out against him by the Moroccan authorities, is currently being held in prison in Madrid.
Mr Packwood, along with three colleagues, delivered a privately-owned boat from the UK to Morocco back in 1997.
The boat was fully searched on its arrival, given a clean bill of health and the four men went home.
A full ten weeks later several tons of cocaine were found on board the vessel.
Interpol interviewed the men and was completely satisfied that they were not implicated in any criminal activity.
The first the men knew of the international arrest warrant was last month â over seven years later â when John Packwood was arrested as he passed through Malaga airport.
He is now in prison in Madrid and that is completely unacceptable.
I would ask the President of Parliament to intervene with the Moroccan authorities to raise these concerns and ask that these arrest warrants be lifted.
The international NGO, Fair Trials Abroad, has agreed that this appears to be a blatant abuse of the international arrest warrant, since it is quite clear that the men could not have been involved in any smuggling operation.
Â Â  Mr President, on 17 November many Members of this House will have seen the appalling abuse of international football players at an international match between Spain and England, held in Spain.
That appalling abuse was not just an isolated incident; we have seen it at international football matches and in football matches across the European Union.
This is not just about abuse of people in their workplace, the football stadium; it has a symbolism and a resonance beyond that.
We believe â and many of my fellow MEPs believe â that UEFA, the body that regulates football, is not sufficiently serious about stamping out racial abuse in football.
Football is the game of Europe, it is Europeâs most prominent spectator sport.
In the United States, the major spectator sports are family occasions.
That is not the case in the European Union.
We call on UEFA and FIFA to bring in rules to stamp out and kick out racism in football right across Europe, making it the family game that we all want to see.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to draw the attention of the House to a decision made in the Council a short time ago on live animal transport.
I would like the House to join with me in expressing regret that agriculture ministers failed to reach an agreement on limiting journey times.
They also failed to reach an agreement on rest periods for animals transported for meat and they failed to reach any agreement on stocking densities â the number of animals that can be put in one unit.
These are all vital issues with respect to ensuring that we end the cruelty to which animals are currently subjected during live transport in Europe.
It is deeply disappointing that, yet again, the Council of Ministers has failed to take into account and adopt the approach of the Parliament, which has consistently voted for an eight-hour maximum limit for the transport of live animals.
The Council got it wrong.
It should have persisted and tackled these important issues in order to end animal cruelty in the European Union.
Â Â  Mr President, by a strange coincidence I would like to raise exactly the same point.
I have had literally hundreds of letters from concerned EU citizens on the Councilâs failure to reach an agreement on 24 April on the Commissionâs proposal on the transportation of live animals.
Each year some three million live animals are transported around Europe.
Many face journeys of 50 hours, some as long as 90 hours. The suffering of the animals on these journeys is terrible.
As Mrs Villiers said, this Parliament has on four or five occasions voted for a maximum journey time of eight or nine hours.
We have been ignored by the Council and we need to put pressure on it.
My personal preference is for the transportation of animals on the hook, not on the hoof, but if we cannot have that, the minimum we should have is decent conditions for these animals and an end to extra-long journey times.
I hope the Council will at long last respond, not just to this Parliament but to the citizens of the European Union.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to ask Parliament to call on the European Commission to abolish or temporarily suspend customs duties on aluminium imported from Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States into the new Member States of the EU, in particular Poland.
These customs duties were introduced after the recent enlargement of the EU and set at 6%.
The result has been a significant fall in the competitiveness of many Central and Eastern European businesses.
In Poland, for example, these customs duties directly affect businesses employing 5Â 000Â people, as well as many thousands of businesses associated with the aluminium industry.
A great deal is heard in this House about those who have benefited from the EU enlargement, but it is worth remembering that there are also those who have little reason to rejoice, and through no fault of their own.
Instead of being selfish, we must help those who are suffering as a result of the fact that the European Union underwent enlargement on 1Â May.
Â Â  â From the chair I have not recorded any other requests by Members to speak.
The debate is therefore closed.
Â Â  â The next item is the Commission Statement on World Aids Day.
Â Â  . Mr President, it truly is an honour for me to stand for the first time before plenary, although I would be even happier were I here on a more pleasant subject.
Unfortunately, I am appearing here for the first time so that we can debate and I can speak to you on a very important and worrying subject, by which I mean the continuing threat to our society from the scourge of HIV/AIDS.
Today in particular, on 1 December, which has been designated 'World AIDS Day', I think it is important that we exchange views and a few thoughts as to how this scourge can be combated.
Today has been designated 'World AIDS Day' in order to mark, on the one hand, the progress which has been made in combating this scourge.
However, more specifically, it gives us the opportunity to focus on the challenges we face and to intensify our collective efforts and consider and ask ourselves if we are doing enough.
Over recent years, most of our attention has focused on the tragic situation in sub-Saharan Africa and in developing countries in general.
However, HIV/AIDS is causing very deep and constantly increasing concern here in Europe and our neighbouring countries.
It is something which affects us all, here and now.
The subject of this year's global campaign against AIDS was women, girls, HIV and AIDS.
This was also the subject of the annual AIDS campaign coordinated by UNAIDS.
This subject is exceptionally topical.
Recent epidemiological data show that, over the last two years, the number of women affected by the HIV virus increased throughout the world.
While the largest increase, in the order of 58%, was in the area of eastern Asia, it is worth noting that the second largest increase was in Eastern Europe and central Asia, where it reached 48%.
Allow me to give you some statistics which were published just last week and which are particularly worrying: approximately 40 million people throughout the world are carriers of the HIV virus and almost half of them are women.
In the European Union, the number of cases of HIV increased by 75% between 1996 and 2003, with the largest increase in the Baltic States.
In Europe, the country which has been hardest hit by the epidemic is the Russian Federation, where it is calculated that over 800 000 people are HIV positive, 80% of whom are young people under 30 years of age.
According to UNAIDS estimates, over 500 000 people in the European Union are carriers of the virus.
It is clear without any doubt from these statistics that the tragic problem of HIV/AIDS is spreading more and more quickly and now has not only arrived at our door, but has also entered our house.
The European Commission is addressing the matter both inside and outside the European Union.
Together with the Member States, we are the biggest donor to the Global Fund which is the main financing mechanism for combating the epidemic throughout the world.
Similarly, we are intensifying our cooperation with neighbouring countries, in full recognition of the fact that they are in a particularly difficult situation.
In September, the European Commission issued a paper entitled âCo-ordinated and integrated approach to combat HIV/AIDS within the European Union and its neighbourhoodsâ. Î€his paper summarises the current evaluation of the situation and the problem.
It also offers a compendium of best practices for combating the recent wave of the epidemic and highlights the Commission's short-term proposals for addressing the situation.
The Commission's main commitments are to the prevention of new cases of contamination with HIV, the reduction of repercussions from the epidemic, access to antiretroviral treatment at more affordable prices, the inclusion of young people, the development of epidemiological monitoring of HIV/AIDS, more intensive research and the participation of civil society.
However, I should also like to draw your attention to certain basic aspects of efforts to combat HIV/AIDS.
Prevention is still the main weapon in the fight against the spread of the virus.
We badly need an information campaign throughout Europe.
It is important for us to bear in mind that the information campaigns of the 1980s did not address today's young people and, consequently, there is an acute need today to implement new efforts, so that we can send the message to precisely these people.
Planning has already started and a conference is due to be held next week with the Member States, the international organisations and representatives of civil society on this subject.
As the target of a general campaign will be the general public and young people, there is a clear need for other partners to plan and implement specialised campaigns targeted at vulnerable groups, in keeping always with the particular requirements of each group.
I should like to stress that the impression that the transmission of HIV is limited to these vulnerable groups is totally unfounded.
On the contrary, HIV/AIDS is a subject which concerns us all: women, men, girls and boys, and it is a subject which concerns us here and now.
It is calculated that a large percentage of people with the HIV virus living in the European Union do not know they have it.
As a result, the risk of the virus spreading is increasing and, naturally, these people cannot benefit from the treatment available.
Generally speaking, access to antiretroviral treatment at affordable prices would appear to be fairly good within the European Union.
Nonetheless, certain Member States have expressed their concern about the future: if, or rather when, the number of cases of HIV spirals and the cost of treatment remains high.
This is one of the main issues being addressed by the European Commission and it has raised it â and continues to discuss it with the Member States and the pharmaceutical industry â in the aim of finding effective ways of overcoming these problems.
However, we must not underestimate the economic consequences of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, which are huge.
The cost of antiretroviral treatment is just one aspect of these economic consequences.
At macro-economic level, HIV/AIDS results in increased health care and social security costs.
It causes a drop in manpower numbers and a fall in productivity, which increase labour costs.
The cumulative result is an adverse impact on investments, production and per capita income.
In brief, the HIV/AIDS epidemic represents a very serious threat to global health, development and security.
However, over and above the economic aspect, HIV/AIDS is also a problem with respect to human rights.
The stigma and adverse discrimination are subjects which concern Europe, as much as any other part of the planet, and they cannot be overlooked.
The psychological aspect of HIV/AIDS and the isolation which it causes must be addressed with the same decisiveness.
If these aspects are disregarded, the effectiveness of the aforementioned efforts of prevention and medical care will be jeopardised.
The subject of HIV/AIDS can no longer be a taboo subject.
It is of the utmost importance that the subject be discussed openly and that the social stigma cease at long last.
Only thus will it be addressed effectively.
Open discussion is an integral part of the information campaign which, in turn, will contribute most towards prevention.
All of us, especially the institutions of the European Union, the European Parliament, the European Commission and, above all, the Member States, need to recognise and accept the new worrying increase in the HIV/AIDS problem.
Let us stop deluding ourselves, believing that it is under control or at least contained; on the contrary, we need to step up our efforts to combat it, to the extent required for them to be effective.
I am optimistic that, together, we can achieve this.
Â Â  .
Mr President, today Ukraine has dominated our discussions, and in Ukraine people are dying, not as a result of the political crisis, but because of the AIDS crisis.
Ten years ago, 183 people were registered as having HIV/AIDS there, today, in 2004, it is 68 000.
That is the scale of this problem within our own continent.
Across the world nearly 40 million people have HIV and, as the Commissioner said, we must take action to prevent and solve these problems.
The focus this year has been very much on women and children.
As the Commissioner said, women account for some 57% of those who are HIV positive in sub-Saharan Africa, and over 60% of those with HIV aged between 15 and 24.
Finding vaccines appropriate to them before the onset of sexual activity is fundamental.
The figures are appalling for orphans too.
There are 15Â million orphans in the world, 12.3 million of them are in sub-Saharan Africa.
There are 1.8 million already in Nigeria, and there will be 1.5 million in South Africa by 2010.
And so it goes on.
We have to take action along the lines of our resolution; we have to take action on HIV/AIDS and on conditions, disorders and diseases such as tuberculosis, hepatitis C, mental illness and depression.
We have to find more palliative care for those dying of AIDS, in particular in the developing countries.
We have to protect our health workers from the dangers of AIDS from needlestick injuries â witness the exhibition in this Parliament today.
I welcome the Commissionerâs statement.
I also welcome the work done in this field by Pavel Telicka during his time as a Commissioner.
We urge Commissioner Kyprianou and his colleague Commissioner Michel to put shoulders to the wheel and to close the door on the epidemic faced by Europe and the rest of the world.
Â Â  . Mr President, I too would like to thank the Commission for its explanation, although I hope that Commissioner Kyprianou will, before long, be able to come here with more news, more hard facts and more specific intentions on the part of the Commission.
I should, above all, like to thank Human Aids for the fact that during this yearâs World AIDS Day, it will be focusing on women and girls and HIV/AIDS.
There are sound reasons for doing so.
The figures speak for themselves.
AIDS is increasingly taking on a feminine face; the number of women infected with HIV/AIDS is rising at a terrifying rate.
So who are those women?
Are they women displaying serious risk behaviour, or are they women who have been sexually active with too many partners?
Not at all.
In most cases, they are ordinary, often young, women who are very vulnerable on account of their sex.
They are often married, they are very often faithful to their partners and are mothers of children.
It may be useful to inform the Vatican of the fact that 88% of the Ugandan girls and women who are HIV positive are married and have not had partners other than the man with whom they share their lives.
These women are vulnerable on account of the social inequality and the lack of access to education and healthcare, as well as on account of the fact that they do not have their own incomes and are often incapable of negotiating about their own sexuality.
For those women, the ABC prevention method â Abstinence, Being faithful and Condomsâ is anything but sufficient.
In order to combat AIDS effectively, we need more than simply ABC.
We need the whole alphabet.
To begin with, I should like to add the letter M for microbicides and the letter V for vaccines, because these open up promising prospects for women who may finally gain control over their own prevention methods.
In my view, it is crucial for the European Union to invest more in research and development into those new products.
I should also like to add the letter E for empowerment, because the fight against AIDS is simply impossible without reinforcing the rights of women and without combating violence against them.
Commissioner, I am therefore very much looking forward to the global action plan which the Commission will be presenting to us in the spring of 2005, because a global approach is indeed what we need.
It is, of course, not enough that well-meaning Commissioners such as yourself or Commissioner Michel should be committed to the fight against AIDS.
This issue must also be dealt with by the Commissioners for Equal Opportunities, External Trade, Justice and also naturally by the Commissioner for the Budget.
I hope that the European Union will continue to take the lead in order to mobilise more financial resources for the fight against HIV/AIDS, but also to improve cooperation among the Member States on the basis of a coherent multiannual plan.
I regret that the Dutch Presidency is not present here today, because I would like to pay tribute to the courage with which it has put this matter on the agenda.
I also think that Europe should do more to increase the financial commitments.
By 2008, we should be able to treble our financial commitments, in my view.
Finally, it appears to me essential that women be personally involved in drawing up a global plan of this kind â especially women and girls who live with HIV/AIDS, for they are not only its victims, but also vital partners in working out a sound policy.
I therefore hope that the Commission will include them in its stakeholdersâ platform for the compilation of this global plan.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a time bomb is ticking on Earth, and its name is Aids.
For several years, the number of new infections has again been increasing at an alarming rate.
This rise also includes Europe, with particularly Eastern Europe affected, both the new Member States and Russia.
The majority of new infections involve young people aged between 15 and 25, and in particular women.
A new carelessness has crept into their dealings with HIV and Aids.
New medicines and therapies have improved the situation of HIV patients, so that the virus is losing its horror and thoughtlessness has become a way of life for many.
Such thoughtlessness is lethal!
The best protection against HIV is the use of condoms; this is a fact, and it should be supported and promoted by all sections of society.
Abstinence is of course also a form of protection against Aids, but it should be left to individuals to decide whether they wish to practice abstinence or use condoms.
Moral appeals are of no use in stopping the spread of the virus.
Instead, we need encouragement for each person to act responsibly, both for themselves and for others.
It is the job of politicians to create the conditions that enable as many men and women as possible to make this decision freely for themselves.
The most important pillars of prevention are sex education without taboos and access to condoms, above all in schools and for young people.
I am delighted that Commissioner Kyprianou placed particular emphasis on this.
In many African and Asian countries, Aids is depopulating entire regions, for example South Africa, where over half of the population is infected with the virus.
This is no longer merely a disaster in human terms, but also in economic terms.
I should like to appeal to the EU Member Statesâ sense of responsibility and the commitments they have already entered into.
We welcome the fact that some Member States, for example the United Kingdom, Sweden and the Netherlands, have provided financial support for the international fund over and above what they committed themselves to.
Unfortunately, some of the other Member States have either not met their commitments at all, or only in part.
Aids is one of the twenty-first centuryâs global challenges.
Above all, it is the task of the Western societies to put up a fight against this epidemic.
We need discussions without taboos in Western societies on new methods of prevention, as especially African and Asian societies are dependent on help from outside, or, to put it another way, from us.
Â Â  I should like to thank the Commission for its sound statement.
Millions of people in the South suffer from HIV/AIDS and, weakened by HIV, they often fall victim to other diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis.
Millions of children with no parents wear themselves out cultivating the food they need.
Many of them have no access to medicines, and almost none of them have medicines adapted for children.
Exemptions from the TRIPS agreement permit the export of generic medicines, but the EU countries have been slow in implementing such exemptions, a dilatoriness that leads to suffering and that, each day that passes, increases the suffering and the number of deaths.
Now, the Commission and the Council have the opportunity to show that this wait is to be brought to an end.
Better access to medicines must, however, be combined with increased knowledge of HIV and increased provision of information about the disease, together with an ambitious aid policy and fair trade so that the countries concerned can afford economic development that increases trade.
Â Â  . â The scenario that has been illustrated here is not just the result of a natural disaster but represents a tragic synthesis between an aggressive virus and the unbridled drive for profit by single-minded, powerful organisations like the multinational pharmaceutical companies.
While 95% of HIV-positive people in the world already have no access to treatment today, the situation is bound to get even worse after 1 January 2005, when the derogation from Article 31 of the TRIPS agreement expires.
India, with a billion inhabitants, and other developing countries will then no longer be able to produce the drugs.
Even now, those who produce them cannot sell them to other developing countries or to African countries.
The European Union therefore needs to go beyond all the talking and the statements of principle and make every effort above all to obtain a further derogation from the TRIPS agreement, pending a complete change to it.
Not only that: the European Union must also oppose the US practice of holding developing countries to ransom in their bilateral agreements, with the aim of preventing them from exercising their right, laid down in the Doha declarations, to use or import generic drugs.
The Global Fund to Fight AIDS must be supported with an increase in the funds allocated to it.
I propose that, on the part of the European Union at least, they should reach EUR 1Â billion and that everyone, including Italy, should abide by the commitments that have been made.
According to Fortune, the average salary of the top nine pharmaceutical company directors in the world is USD 42 million a year.
At the same time, tens of millions of people die without being able to receive treatment.
In the face of such injustice, any kind of moralistic argument should be thrown out.
We should remember that a condom is something very useful: a health aid that should be distributed absolutely free of charge.
It is part of the toolkit needed to defeat the virus.
Â Â  Mr Commissioner, today World AIDS Day and your statement on this subject was, in my opinion, very good, but it was still just aÂ statement.
IÂ hope that it will be followed by practical measures on your part that will help to alleviate the situation.
Todayâs AIDS Day calls on us to be aware of the kind of decisions that we have to take as politicians.
AIDS is aÂ disease that spreads regardless of borders and therefore todayâs decision that health should be aÂ matter for individual states is not aÂ good one.
AIDS cannot be seen, it cannot be noticed, it cannot be felt.
It is aÂ disease that crosses borders and pays no attention to customs officials.
AÂ disease that began amongst risk groups â among homosexuals and then haemophiliacs, then blood donors and drug addicts.
Now we also see that aÂ large number of women are infected.
What was not said, however, is that 5 to 5.5 million of the 40 million are children and young people.
These are alarming figures.
It has been said today that it is transmitted through sex.
IÂ am talking about love.
Perhaps this is why women so often become victims.
On this occasion IÂ would also like to mention some people who have not been mentioned today. These are the health workers, people who are ready and willing to risk their lives.
They are volunteers.
Are we aware, however, that these health workers are likely to be the first victims of the health reforms being prepared in the European Union?
This is a poor way of thanking them for their work.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the European Commission for its strategic framework of October 2003 and the proposed action plan for next year, which also provides for concrete and targeted measures.
The EU is the second largest donor to the global Aids fund, provided around 18% of the total funds.
Yet we are faced with the fact that new infections are rising dramatically, both within the EU and in other countries.
Commissioner Kyprianou said in a press release that many young people who are currently becoming infected were too young to understand the first Aids campaign.
This is undoubtedly correct.
Yet it is also necessary to remember that many young people are quite simply given false information, with, above all, Aids being depicted today as a treatable disease.
The pharmaceutical industry is also doing its bit by presenting it as a conquered epidemic.
The fact is, however, that even the anti-retroviral medicines which are available have major side effects, and that being able to lead a normal life is of course out of the question.
Furthermore, the high costs of therapy, which range from EURÂ 7Â 000 to 12Â 000 per annum, must also be taken into account, as they are a major burden on a countryâs health budget.
I should therefore like to call for research and development to be carried out into better and, above all, cheaper medication, possibly by means of generic medicines, so that these can be made available to wide sections of the population.
Something I find particularly worrying is the lack of awareness of the problem among young people, who, when asked in interviews why they have such a lax attitude to the disease, reply, âwhich life should I protect myself for?â
I therefore believe that the plan drawn up by the Commission must also include this holistic approach, and, above all, combine education and possibly also giving meaning to life with the whole field.
Â Â  Mr President, of the 40Â million people suffering from AIDS, 70% live in Africa.
The Millennium Objectives are a central ambition to focus on basic health carewhere it is needed.
Europe spends too little of its development cooperation budget on basic health care, which should be linked to good nutrition, access to clean drinking water and basic education.
Commissioner Michel has stated that he will make a new announcement in which Europeâs priorities in terms of development cooperation will be specified.
Commissioner, I do hope that the words you spoke a moment ago will also find expression in this new announcement.
According to the UN, of the 45 million people at risk of infection, 27 million would, if we had a specific campaign, be preventable cases.
We have a great deal of experience in campaigns of that kind globally.
It does, however, require an enormous effort and we should therefore focus our minds in that respect.
It has been stated before that we here in Europe can encourage our Member States to say to the pharmaceutical industry that it can make cheaper products.
To the developing countries, we could say that we will provide them with a waiver, as a result of which the TRIPS agreements will not prevent them from manufacturing within the cheap market.
Finally, the Vatican spoke a few days ago through Javier Cardinal Lozano BarragÃ¡n, President of the Pontifical Council for Health Pastoral Care, about immunity, moral deficit and pathology of the mind as causes of AIDS that have to be combated with correct sexual practices.
I regard this as a discriminating and stigmatising remark and believe that Commissioner Kyprianou was right to say that we should not stigmatise AIDS patients in that way.
I am pleased that in principle, the Commissioner has given the Vatican a clear response with this.
Â Â  â This yearâs UNAIDS report on the trends in the epidemic has been even more distressing than in the past: the projections for sub-Saharan Africa and for its survival in the new century are extremely grave.
This is one more tragedy to add to other, equally serious human tragedies, such as the exploitation of adult and child prostitution, drug addiction, the lack of minimum standards of hygiene, the break-up of families and the growing numbers of little orphans, as well as infant mortality, which has reached appalling levels: throughout the world, 500Â 000 children die every year â which means 1Â 300 children a day â from AIDS.
That is why today it is important that the European Parliament should stand united, with no distinction on the basis of party or nationality, and send out a strong appeal to all the European Union Member States â starting with my country, Italy â not to throw away all the efforts that have been made so far and to continue to support the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.
Let us avoid adopting a reductionist view of the fight against AIDS and not forget that this virus is not only transmitted by sexual means but that there are many other reasons for its spread: infected syringes, breast-feeding and the lack of adequate medical checks.
Let us not forget, either, that condoms are merely a means of containment â an effective one, let us be quite clear on this, but containment all the same â and not a means of prevention of the virus.
If we really want to combat this disease, we have to fight it at its social, economic and ethical roots by raising the standards of living and the levels of prevention and treatment in the worst-affected countries.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to raise two points regarding the tragic situation in certain developing countries.
Firstly, our attention should not solely be focused on the important question of medicine or some future vaccine. It should also be focused on restoring or setting up proximity-based health services, in other words those located as close as possible to communities.
Those services have, unfortunately, been badly affected in recent years by structural adjustment plans undertaken in those countries, especially in Africa.
We must also offer all our support to local initiatives launched by civil society and to networks, on the ground, of local representatives and authorities, associations, carers and mediators from the societies in question, who have been working together to combat AIDS, with some success.
Secondly, the growing rate of infection among women is not simply down to their fragile nature or to bad luck.
It is also the result of violence of all kinds â particularly sexual â against women in various regions of the world, and of the blatant discrimination to which they are subjected.
Such violence has nothing to do with cultural characteristics, which is the erroneous explanation that is sometimes given.
It must be referred to by name and combated as such.
These two aspects show, therefore, that AIDS is as much a social problem as it is a medical problem.
Let us not forget that.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I well remember when the HIV epidemic began to spread in the 1980s.
Even then, there were prognoses that the spread of the epidemic could be as serious as the situation is today in parts of the world, especially in Africa.
Such prognoses were, however, dismissed at that time as mere prophesies of doom.
As a result, the world closed its eyes for a long time â in fact, for too long â to the seriousness of the epidemic and did too little in terms of developing effective programmes of prevention, including contraceptive advice, of developing health care for the sick and of supporting research into more effective medicines and an effective vaccine.
Now, the world has finally woken up, but efforts at prevention are still insufficient.
If we do not do more than we are doing at present to prevent the spread of the epidemic, it will, according to experts, not reach its biological culmination until 2060.
I dare not think of what the consequences would be in terms of human suffering and economic and social crisis.
Let us consider this resolution as a powerful exhortation to decision-makers the world over, and especially to the European Commission and to the governments of the Member States, to give still greater priority to continuing to combat this epidemic in the future.
This will require us to set aside considerably more resources, both for our own HIV programme and for the global fund.
If we do not do so, the consequences will be disastrous from humanitarian, economic and social points of view and also from the perspective of security and stability.
The Commission has made a superhuman effort in recent years in its strategy to combat HIV but, just like MrÂ Bowis and MrsÂ VanÂ Lancker, I think that we need to take far more ambitious steps in the future.
Â Â  Mr President, on World AIDS Day, I would like to begin, as other Members have done, by alerting the institutions to the most dramatic aspect of this tragedy: its spread amongst women and girls.
By doing so, as well as acting in accordance with my personal political commitment to women, I am stressing the enormity of the problem in human terms, in terms of development and in terms of the future of the world.
Half of the 40 million people infected with the virus are women and girls, and this proportion is increasing in almost every region, reaching 57% in Sub-Saharan Africa.
With regard to the industrialised world, I will give just one example: Hispanic and African-American women make up a quarter of the women in the United States and account for 80% of AIDS cases.
The feminisation of AIDS is one further form, the ultimate form, of violence against women, and we have not provided them with the resources to defend themselves against the disease, the fundamental resources, such as sexual education, protection of reproductive health rights or information on measures to prevent infection.
The social norms which keep young women and girls ignorant about sexuality and do not criminalise sexual violence inside and outside marriage increase the danger of the infection spreading.
The Socialist Group would like to congratulate the Commission on treating education as a priority in its political framework for combating diseases relating to poverty.
I would like secondly, Mr President, to express a complaint.
I would like to say that the Catholic hierarchy is guilty of negligence in the fight against AIDS.
Today the Vatican is marking World AIDS Day by condemning the disease as a spiritual illness, which it calls âmoral immunodeficiency syndromeâ, which demonstrates the ethical and technical shortcomings of the Catholic Church.
Via the Secretary of the Spanish Episcopal Conference â Spain being the European country in which the number of infections is increasing most â the Catholic Church intends to politically undermine the world campaign for combating AIDS by warning that contraceptives are unsafe and advocating chastity and fidelity as a method of prevention.
That statement would not warrant any further comment were it not for the fact that AIDS is killing millions of people, including children; if sexual violence, which leaves no chance of chastity, were not a daily reality in many African and Asian societies; if there were not 15Â million orphaned children; if it were not an attack on the sexual and reproductive freedom of men; if it were not, therefore, an attack on human rights and a veritable genocide.
We are talking about life or death; we do not know whether the Episcopal Conference has understood this.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to congratulate my colleague Mr Seeber on his maiden speech in this House.
I believe that todayâs debate makes it clear once again that our analyses are right, that the figures are dramatic and that there is support for the declarations of intent, but that the measures taken are insufficient, that there has been no about-turn in opinions, and that the situation is losing none of its drama.
I can do no other than underline everything that has been said.
Aids is a disease of our times and a mirror of what has gone wrong in our society.
Where Aids is concerned, we cannot merely tell people to live differently, to avoid doing certain things, and to be more responsible.
It is clear that Aids is closely linked to poverty.
Those affected by Aids are mostly those who live on less than one dollar a day and suffer from hunger.
Aids today is a disease which affects above all the weak, children, young people and women.
Aids is also an expression of a lack of prevention, education, sex education, employment and of inequality in the world.
There is therefore no one solution and no one treatment.
We must continue the prevention measures already taken, and it is therefore important that we regard Aids as forming part of our health and development policy, our education, family and employment policy and the overall view we take of our responsibilities.
I call upon this House to not shirk this global responsibility and to ensure that we are number one in the world in the research against Aids.
Â Â  MrÂ President, today, the European Parliament is observing International AIDS Day.
It is important for us to give those affected our full support and for us to take extremely seriously our share of responsibility for public health.
For the first time since HIV/AIDS was discovered, more women than men are now infected.
In certain areas, young women are up to two and a half times more vulnerable to infection than young men of the same age.
In certain countries, nearly 60% of the people infected are women.
Many women and girls are especially vulnerable to infection because of other peopleâs â that is to say, menâs â behaviour in terms of risk and because of the discrimination widely practised in the world between men and women when it comes to views of sexuality and sexual rights.
The consequences of the HIV/AIDS epidemic are far greater for women and children than for men and boys.
This year, the UN body, UNAIDS has therefore selected its theme, âWomen, Girls, HIV and AIDSâ.
When relatives become sick or die, it is mainly women and girls who have to take care of their own families.
When the health care systems are over-stretched or when they collapse as a result of HIV/AIDS, it is women and girls who have to compensate for the fact by providing increased care and attention in the home.
Nor are women given the same access as men to health care and to medicines that retard the progress of the disease.
Old, traditional views, such as the view that men have a right to sex, also mean that many married women cannot protect themselves against infection introduced by their husbands after they have been unfaithful.
It is therefore outrageous that, in todayâs edition of the newspaper , the Vatican calls AIDS a moral disease of the immune system.
I think that laying the blame on those who are ill is both inhumane and unchristian.
Gender equality, together with sexual and reproductive health and rights, need to be common objectives for every country in the world and, above all, a responsibility for all men.
Women must be strengthened in their negotiating position when it comes to condom use and, without exception, given increased rights and better conditions of life.
We are all losers now, but tests are now beginning in Sweden on a new medicine to combat HIV.
If this works, it will create a sensation throughout the world.
A preventive vaccine is no doubt what we all dream of, so let us hope for a positive result.
Â Â  â Mr President, I have listened very closely to the issues raised and the views formulated during the present debate.
I must say that it truly satisfies and heartens me to hear that the honourable Members not only share my acute concern on the subject of HIV/AIDS, but also my firm conviction that we need to make a full and effective contribution towards relieving the terrible hardship which is causing this epidemic, both in the rest of the world and in the European Union.
We need in particular to understand the gravity of this problem today.
Allow me, however, to comment on certain issues raised by the honourable Members.
First of all, I wish to emphasise and recapitulate that this is an issue which concerns us all.
As the honourable Members have already mentioned, it is no longer an issue which only concerns vulnerable groups.
On the contrary, it is something which concerns each and every one of us, witness the way in which it has now spread within families, affecting whole families and underage children, not only in the developing world but also within the European Union itself.
I wish to assure you that the entire European Commission, all my colleagues and I are aware of this issue.
We share the same concerns and we have set the same targets and I wish to assure you that there will be full coordination between me and all my colleagues in combating this problem, in drafting and implementing programmes in this direction.
As far as the question of research is concerned, may I remind you that, for the vaccine in particular, research into an HIV vaccine is a priority under the sixth framework programme for research and development and we expect up to EUR 130 million to be earmarked for research into an HIV vaccine.
As far as drugs are concerned, may I remind you that I absolutely agree that there must be access to cheap drugs for everyone who has a problem with this disease, especially of course for poor countries and poor sections of the population who cannot meet these high treatment costs.
May I also remind you that recently â and this is also mentioned in your resolution â the Commission adopted a proposal for the mandatory licensing of drugs for export to countries in need.
This point is currently at the codecision stage and I trust that, judging from other cases in the past on highly sensitive issues, a study will be expedited rapidly so that this proposal can be completed as quickly as possible, and that this proposal will provide the possibility of access precisely to cheap drugs.
There is a huge need â and I repeat this â for the social stigma to be lifted.
One of the serious problems which we face today with regard to the spread of this disease is that, because of this pressure, many people are suffering from or have been affected by the virus and not even they themselves know it.
They do not undergo the necessary tests in fear of the stigma which there may be and, thus, they pass it on to their families.
Special emphasis needs to be placed on enlightening people and on the fact that it must be understood that no social stigma should attach to a disease; on the contrary, it should be addressed in the same way as every other serious epidemic disease.
Finally, I should like to assure you once again that the European Commission is truly dedicated to these efforts to combat this scourge.
I welcome and I wish to express my thanks to Parliament, on behalf also of the European Commission, for the active interest which we see.
We trust that we shall be close and effective allies in this fight, so that this problem really is addressed efficiently.
There is no room for complacency; we need to continue with the same intense effort, to show the same zeal in preventing and stopping the spread of this illness.
At the same time, however, we need to contribute towards the relief of those who are already affected and to their treatment.
I await and look forward with interest to a future constructive dialogue between the Commission and Parliament so that we can achieve our joint objectives.
Â Â  At the end of the debate I have received five motions for resolutions.(1)
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Â Â  Â Â Â The fight against Aids should unite all people of good will.
Unfortunately, the strategy for this fight proposed in the joint motion for a resolution, a strategy based on the promotion of âreproductive and sexual rightsâ, excludes millions of people in Europe and the world.
The reason for this is that millions of people throughout the world do not believe that any benefit can result from the promotion of abortion and contraception and from the provision of sex education to ever-younger children in violation of the rights of parents and without their knowledge or consent.
Many people in Europe are morally opposed to such things, and justifiably so.
Furthermore, there is no proven link between the promotion of such âreproductive rightsâ and a fall in the number of those infected with Aids.
Quite the contrary is the case.
Some African countries, such as Uganda, have significantly reduced the number of infections, not by promoting the use of condoms, but by encouraging a move towards abstinence and more responsible sexual behaviour.
Such brazen promotion of âreproductive rightsâ makes it impossible for me to vote in favour of this resolution.
Â Â  â The next item is the report (A6-0028/2004) by Carlos Coelho, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the Commission proposal for a Council regulation on standards for security features and biometrics in EU citizensâ passports.
Â Â  . Mr President, first of all I thank you most warmly for according me the opportunity to express my views on the report and on the amendments to this important draft regulation.
May I also congratulate your rapporteur, Mr Coelho, on his valuable contribution to this debate.
Before presenting my remarks, I wish to recall the context of the Commission's proposal.
The primary objective of the Member States was not only to improve the quality of documents, but also to establish a reliable link between the holder and the identity document.
The aim of this approach was to minimise the dangerous trend of the production of counterfeit documents, which are used to enter the territory of the EU illegally.
The approach was confirmed by the Thessaloniki European Council in June 2003.
In September 2003, the Commission presented two proposals introducing biometric identifiers into the uniform format for visas and residence permits for third-country nationals.
On 18 February 2004, the Commission put forward a proposal for a regulation on common standards and biometrics in EU citizensâ passports as we were convinced that we cannot only secure documents related to third-country nationals.
Otherwise mala fide foreigners could abuse less secure European passports.
In its proposal for biometrics in passports, the Commission provided for one mandatory biometric identifier, the digital image, and left the second biometric identifier, fingerprints, optional.
When drafting the proposal on passports the Commission was fully aware of the sensitivity of this issue.
On the one hand the EU has to suggest measures enabling Member States to strengthen security and the protection of their citizens; on the other hand the Commission has to take data protection and privacy concerns into careful consideration.
At the Council of 25 October 2004, the questions as to whether the second biometric identifier, the fingerprint, should be integrated in a mandatory way, and what the implementation data for the regulation should be, were discussed again.
Ministers reached a unanimous political agreement that the first biometric identifier, the facial image, should be implemented at the latest within 18 months and the second biometric identifier, should also be mandatory at the latest 36 months after the adoption of the technical specifications.
This political decision could help Member States to issue identity documents capable of establishing a reliable and direct link with all others.
In this context it is equally important to underscore that the two biometric identifiers, digital image and fingerprints, should be used to reduce the production of counterfeit documents, not to interfere in the private lives of EU citizens.
As regards the timing, the European Council in its conclusions on terrorism of 26 March, set the end of 2004 as the date for the adoption of the proposals and the technical specifications.
We are actively moving things forward.
Our technical committee has made an early start on its preparatory work on the technical aspects regarding the integration of the biometric identifier into the visa and the residence permit.
Also, the measurement work for the passport has already been completed.
The technical specifications have to be adopted by the Commission via the comitology procedure after the Council has adopted the regulation, which constitutes their legal basis.
Mr President, the 19 amendments tabled by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs are primarily concerned with data protection issues.
They are also concerned with reviewing the comitology procedure, so that Parliament and the authorities responsible for data protection are involved in the decision-making process.
The ArticleÂ 29 Working Party for the Directive was consulted on the proposal, and most of the amendments relating to data protection were already taken on board during the Councilâs work.
Nor can the Commission endorse these amendments: either they were incorporated into the version under discussion at the Council, or some of them do not comply with the legal basis, which only covers the security characteristics of passports.
As regards revising the comitology procedure, the amendments cannot be accepted, because this procedure is the result of an interinstitutional agreement and a Council decision in 1998-1999 laying down the general procedure applicable to committees.
These instruments also lay down Parliamentâs right to participate and I do not see how there can be any derogation from these.
A further amendment has been tabled today during the plenary session by the rapporteur, Mr Coelho, on behalf of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.
It concerns the second biometric identifier to be integrated into the passport, namely fingerprints.
In its proposal, theÂ Commission had left it to the Member Statesâ discretion whether or not to take their citizensâ fingerprints, insofar as some of them did not want to adopt such a policy at that time for political reasons.
Nevertheless, the Council unanimously decided, on 25Â OctoberÂ 2004, to make fingerprints similarly compulsory at the latest 36Â months after the adoption of the technical specifications.
TheÂ Commission considers, in fact, that this unanimous decision clearly symbolises a new political will to harmonise across the Member States the ability to ensure â on the basis of elements such as fingerprints, which are more reliable than simple digital images â that identity document holders are the individuals referred to therein.
This approach, in other words, has in fact overridden the initial proposal, which made fingerprints optional.
EU Member States have in fact shown their political will to have two biometric identifiers.
In other words, they have, politically speaking, chosen between the two options.
To conclude, I feel that joint effort on the part of all the institutions is crucial to step up security in the Union, whilst ensuring that the legitimate rights of law-abiding citizens are respected.
I am grateful to Parliament for expressing its opinion so promptly.
This will make it possible for the regulation to be adopted by the end of the year and for us to keep to the timetable set by the Council in March 2004.
Â Â  . Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by thanking my colleagues in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs for their help, particularly the shadow rapporteurs, among whom I am especially grateful to Mr Cashman.
We must all work together to find solutions to the dangerous times in which we live.
There is no point in burying our heads in the sand.
It is crucial that we strengthen our citizensâ security, and yet we must do this without compromising essential freedoms, including the right to personal data privacy.
The proposal before us today was submitted to Parliament in February 2004 and is the result of a coherent approach towards biometric identifiers involving harmonised solutions on national documents from third countries, on EU citizensâ passports and on the Visa Information System and the second generation of the Schengen Information System.
Increased security in travel documents and the integration of biometric identifiers will help in the fight against terrorism and illegal immigration, and will lead to increased security in the exercise of freedom of movement.
The best way to prevent the use of false identities is to check whether the person presenting the document is the genuine holder or not.
New technology offers many benefits when it comes to identifying individuals and preventing counterfeit documents.
We must combat what is known as âvisa-shoppingâand identity misuse.
Parliament is entirely justified in the importance that it attaches to data protection.
A balance must always be struck between the need for security and respect for individual rights and freedoms recognised by national and Community laws.
This is an essential and condition for adopting the use of biometric identifiers.
I therefore fully endorsed the proposed amendments tabled in the letter from the Article 29 Working Party and I emphasise the need for measures relating to access; in other words, who is entitled to access and for what purpose.
The Member States must draw up a list of the competent authorities, of guarantees relating to people who cannot provide certain of the selected biometric data, such as fingerprints, as in the case of burn victims or amputees, and of guarantees to the effect that when border checks are carried out and a false rejection occurs, the citizens concerned will be informed of the reasons for such a rejection and of the means to be employed in order to clarify and rectify the situation as quickly as possible.
Lastly, new functions must be granted to the supervisory authorities in this area, along with an increase in the resources needed to carry out those new functions.
To conclude, I should like to mention the four questions that are crucial to the adoption of this report.
Firstly, there should be one sole objective for the use of data.
It must be made clear, with no room for doubt, that data may be used solely for the purpose of identification and under no circumstances for the purposes of covert identification or surveillance.
Secondly, there is the question of the database.
The report that I am presenting to you categorically rejects the idea of setting up a centralised database.
Biometric data must be stored solely on the passport.
It is not necessary to set up a database to ensure a more reliable link between the passport and its holder; the risk of function creep â the use of data for other purposes than originally envisaged â is too great.
I wish to state categorically that nowhere in the Commissionâs legislative proposal or in the current Council text is there a proposal to set up a database.
There was a reference in the explanatory statement to the notion that this may be considered in the future and, for this reason, we suggest that Parliamentâs position be made clear straightaway.
Thirdly, the technical solution chosen: the technical specifications should be sound, as it is those specifications that determine whether the biometrics will work or not.
We cannot run the risk of rushing into solutions that are later found to be poorly prepared, technically outdated, or too costly.
This would damage the citizensâ trust.
One key question, Mr Frattini, is that the most delicate part in terms of data protection is not a matter of which principle is chosen, but the way in which it will be implemented.
We therefore propose that the experts viewing the technical specifications from a data protection point of view should have the opportunity to evaluate the technical specifications and raise any issues.
The fourth and last point concerns amendments to the initial proposal.
At its meeting of 26Â October, the Council decided to proceed with the amendment to make fingerprinting compulsory; it had previously been optional.
From a political point of view, the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs had already adopted, by a large majority, the introduction of both biometric identifiers, with the sole difference that it left the adoption of the second to the Member Statesâ discretion.
All reservations were raised with the Council and it was the Member States themselves who opted to dispense with that discretion and to choose both straightaway.
I therefore feel that there should not be any objections to Parliament voting in favour of this report.
In so doing, Parliament will be making its position clear on the issue and underpinning the guarantees that we always want to see safeguarded.
Â Â  . Mr President, as someone who opposed the previous nominee, I should like to say to Commissioner Frattini how pleased I am to see him take up his duties.
I would like to welcome Mr Coelhoâs report â it is an excellent piece of work.
On behalf of my Group, however, I have to state that we are not happy that there has not been time for Parliament to be reconsulted on the new proposals from the Council.
We have concerns â although thankfully some of them have been met â with regard to the protection and integrity of data, verification by the passport holder of that data, the insertion of any corrections necessary, and restrictions on the use of the passport and the data.
The reality is that our citizens want freedom of movement not only within our borders, but outside those borders too.
We must therefore be realistic in our approach and ensure that biometrics in passports ensure free and virtually unrestricted movement across borders so we can focus on and combat organised crime, traffickers, drug barons and terrorists.
However, one particular fear that arises from this, and which has frequently been discussed in our debates, is that of the capture of data.
In this area we must be extremely vigilant.
Access to data must be carefully regulated by national legislation in accordance with the provisions of Community law, European law and our international agreements.
Biometrics in passports must reinforce privacy and civil liberties and must not be used as a catalyst to assault fundamental freedoms and rights.
In conclusion, I welcome the protection of citizensâ rights and freedoms as contained in Articles 2 and 3 of the Council document agreed on 23 November 2004.
I commend Mr Coelhoâs report and in particular Amendments 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12, which reinforce citizensâ rights.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I am delighted that you are still here at this late hour.
I should firstly like to thank Mr Coelho for his report on the Councilâs proposal to include biometric data in identity documents, which from a liberal point of view was on the whole balanced and justifiably critical.
I believe that Mr Coelho, in his report, made reference, without hesitation and with the necessary clarity, to the issues that remain unclear, whether these issues involved the guarantee of data protection or the remaining uncertainties with regard to the technical procedures for storing the data on the identity documents.
Further to MrÂ Coelhoâs comments, I wonder why it has not again been clarified as to which costs will be incurred by the inclusion of biometric data in identity documents, before the Council presses forward and takes a decision?
The question must also be asked as to whether this is financially responsible.
I am, however, seriously annoyed, as the lack of clarity over some of the contents leaves me no option but to ask myself how much attention the Council really pays to such a serious issue.
I am not necessarily talking about technical issues.
In this connection, I have to ask myself â and this is something that was referred to by MrÂ Cashman â how the Council defines its relationship with Parliament.
After the relevant committee issued its opinion on the proposal, the Council presented us with an amended proposal, with amendments which were clearly more than merely editorial or cosmetic changes.
The original Council proposal provided, as mentioned by Mr Frattini, for the mandatory integration of a biometric feature in EU citizensâ identity documents, with the way in which this was to be implemented being at the Member Statesâ discretion.
The new proposal we have before us is quite different.
This gives rise to two questions, to which I would ask the Council to respond; why have these amendments been made after the relevant committee had discussed the proposal?
The Commissionerâs answer implied that the subsidiarity principle was being circumvented here, as a number of Member States had no interest in implementing the proposal.
The other question â and I know that my time is nearly up, but I have one more question I should like answered â is: what kind of way is this to act?
Parliament is being threatened with ...
Â Â  Sorry Mr Alvaro, but please put your question to the Commission in writing.
Â Â  . Mr President, the Verts/ALE Group is of the opinion that the Commission proposal to introduce two biometric identifiers lacks crucial information on important points such as costs, proportionality, added value and security.
The Commission has not yet provided Parliament with the requested information on the scope and seriousness of the problem of false documents, the results of previous improvements in document security and the error rate of the various biometric options, in particular the lack of reliability of fingerprints, the intrusive nature of their use and the risk of misuse.
Yesterday the Chairman of the Article 29 data protection working party sent a letter to the Chairman of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, in which he pointed out that the working party does not have enough information on which tests have been conducted, what their outcomes were, or on which basis the Council decision had been taken.
Therefore the working party expressed its reservations as to the use of biometric procedures that have not proved efficient, in particular the compulsory use of biometric features such as fingerprints.
For the Verts/ALE Group, it is clear that the introduction of two biometric identifiers can represent a threat to security through risks of abuse, technological flaws and lack of transparency and data protection.
We are therefore suggesting that only one biometric identifier be integrated, namely a digital photograph in visas, residence permits and passports.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I should like to add to the criticism expressed in this House.
I consider the report a democratic scandal.
I turn firstly to its substance.
What is, of course, at issue is whether it is fair to introduce biometric data, which in this case means fingerprints, into peopleâs passports.
Yes, says the Council, and the report submissively concurs, of course, irrespective of the fact that these demands are synonymous with a huge extension of the police surveillance that the EU has been developing in recent years.
The scandal consists in the fact that neither the report nor the Councilâs decision contains any serious discussion of the relationship between ends and means.
A number of significant encroachments upon peopleâs rights are to be introduced without the remotest evidence that these encroachments are of any use at all in achieving the objective.
On the contrary, all the competent and expert bodies have been united in stating that there is simply no point in demanding biometric information in passports.
The operation was successful, but the patient died, as we say in Denmark.
In recent days, this scandal has taken on the character of a farce.
The consultation of Parliament, ostensibly based upon ArticleÂ 67 of the EC Treaty, is clearly inadequate, and a future Council decision would therefore be invalid.
I adhere to the minority opinion, issued by myself and a number of fellow MEPs.
Â Â  Mr President, on 25Â October, the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs voted on the report by Mr Coelho.
It was already apparent that biometric details would soon be included in passports, and Mr Coelho tried to subject this to a number of conditions in order to safeguard the privacy of citizens in any case, for which credit is due to him.
Even before the Commission had a chance to vote on this, however, the Council tabled its own, much more far-reaching proposal.
In other words, the Council did not even have the decency to wait for Parliamentâs recommendation.
Judging from the subsequent course of events, it would appear that the Council wants to push its own opinion through at all costs, and is prepared to bring considerable pressure to bear on Parliament in order to achieve its goal.
That is a very undemocratic attitude, certainly in view of the fact that passports directly affect every EU citizen.
I do not harbour any illusions, though.
I am convinced that the governments that are represented in that self-same Council will, in the national debates about this issue, point the finger at Europe once criticism gets underway; that, they will say, is what Europe prescribes.
I do want to clarify, though, that this is not a European decision.
It is a decision that the national governments enforce at European level, by capitalising on, or taking advantage of â whichever way you look at it â the democratic loophole that is still there.
I was very curious to hear the response by the minister responsible, but none was forthcoming.
Let us hope that his response would have been less cynical than that of Mr Donner, the Dutch Justice Minister, in the Dutch Lower Chamber, to critical questions about this sequence of events.
It was suggested to him that this was immoral, but, to his mind, it was simply politics.
Â Â  Mr President, I join with the previous speakers in extending a warm welcome to Commissioner Frattini and congratulating Mr Coelho, the rapporteur.
The previous speakers have already drawn attention to the lack of cohesion in the democratic process where this issue is concerned.
The decision to add a second characteristic was taken behind closed doors, and both the EP and the national parliaments were simply frozen out in the process.
The Council has subsequently more or less blackmailed the European Parliament to push through a few decisions as soon as possible, even though this issue is a very fundamental one.
I have to add that I very much regret the fact that there is no one from the Council present today to respond to this.
Commissioner Frattini has said that this is a security measure and that we demand better passports.
That is of course all very well and good, but we should not forget to add that we also have to consider the request of the United States that we should include one biometric characteristic.
It has not asked for two, and it is therefore beyond me why this second characteristic should all of a sudden be added, certainly if the United States has no intention at all of doing the same.
I would therefore ask you to support our amendment tomorrow to keep the second characteristic optional.
Finally, looking through the proposals, I wonder whether these would really lead to an improvement in security or whether they represent a show of security, because, as you know, terrorists simply travel using their own passports.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we disagree with the introduction of biometric identifiers and feel that they infringe fundamental rights which we consider to be .
They are an insult to human dignity and jeopardise the safeguarding of important human rights, such as privacy and freedom of movement.
Behind these measures is concealed the adoption of the so-called 'war on terrorism' as a priority in the objectives of the European Union.
It is important that Europe should not get carried away and should fight for the good of nations and people. This should imply resistance to such policies.
The collection, storage, access to and transmission of personal data harbour huge dangers and are equivalent to acceptance of global policing and excessive controls.
I should like to take this opportunity to denounce the action of the Council, which adopted these measures before procedures had been completed in Parliament, as well as the arbitrary change to the provision on mandatory biometric identifiers in the passports of European citizens, from a digital photograph only to a photograph and fingerprint.
The Council wrongly underestimated our role, the voice of the European citizens whom we represent âŠ
Â Â  I am sorry Mr Triantaphyllides, we have run out of time.
I should like to thank the Commission and all speakers for that debate on what is a very important topic.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be tomorrow at 11Â a.m.
Â Â  The next item is three oral questions to the Commission on football in the EU:
â Oral Question (B6-0133/2004) by Ivo Belet and Doris Pack, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on a framework for the balanced development of football in the EU;
â Oral Question (B6-0134/2004) by Christa Prets, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the development of football in the EU;
â Oral Question (B6-0135/2004) by Hannu Takkula, on behalf of the ALDE Group, on a framework for the balanced development of football in the EU.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, although I realise that this problem pales somewhat before what has been discussed here in this House this afternoon, I do think that developments in the area of football also have major social implications.
I am delighted that, despite the late hour, it is still possible to have this debate today.
You will agree with me that the future of football hinges upon our youth training.
If that deteriorates or falls by the wayside, it undermines the game itself.
That seems to be a spectre that prophets of doom confront us with, but regrettably, that scenario is far closer than the average football fan could ever imagine.
Commissioner, the situation is serious.
It is no longer the case that youth players can play up in higher divisions, because their places are increasingly being filled by often cheaper players from outside the European Union or even from within it. This leads to bizarre situations, such the Belgian first division club SK Beveren usually fielding eleven Africans in Belgiumâs top football league.
This situation has a pernicious effect on our footballâs social function.
After all, you will agree with me that football is an excellent instrument for social integration and against social exclusion.
I particularly regret that it is precisely this function of football that is currently being undermined in different European competitions, not only in the Belgian ones, but also elsewhere in Europe.
That is particularly regrettable in this day and age.
This development is also detrimental to the scope for expansion in competitions, but perhaps we will hear more about this during the debate.
A number of concrete proposals have been tabled to turn the tide and call an end to this development.
One of the proposals provides for a regulation which prescribes that clubs must play a minimum number of players who have been trained by their own clubs or in the competitions in which their clubs are involved.
I believe that such a measure would give the clubs an enormous boost in terms of the effect they have on young people.
Moreover, from a moral point of view, it would be preferable to invest far more in the training side of clubs than in buying players and trading them as pure commodities.
Hence my specific question to the Commissioner whether he approves of this proposal.
Commissioner, do you also agree that it is desirable that the government â and I mean both the national and European authorities â should help invest in youth activities and in clubsâ sports facilities?
Finally, Commissioner, would you agree that it is necessary to uphold the social fabric of football?
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, by means of this question, I should like to emphasise the contribution made by sport to promoting social cohesion within society.
Particularly in the year that will shortly come to an end â the European Year of Education through Sport â we must thoroughly discuss and learn from the knowledge we have gained and the criticisms that have been made.
As we know, football is of a very particular importance.
It is therefore important to face up to the fact that increasing numbers of young people are being excluded from training or shut out of their normal places in their teams.
UEFAâs initiative to call for possible quotas for young players or native players is therefore entirely understandable.
I would like to stress the point that these quotas have nothing to do with the racism or xenophobia that we have seen frequently in recent times, but are merely about promoting young sportsmen and sportswomen.
I believe they would also help to improve the budgets of certain teams. They do not violate the Bosman judgment.
I know that the argument is often used that there are not enough reliable young players.
Perhaps this is because they are treated unfairly by comparison with the other players who are paid high wages.
Young players should and must have the chance to develop and make a name for themselves.
It should not always be the mathematical or economic aspect which is focused on, as what this is much more about is a responsible way of dealing with young people.
I should therefore like to ask the Commission what its opinion is of possible quotas for native players or of investments in local training institutes and the training of players.
Â Â  Mr President, physical exercise, including that king of sports, football, is an increasingly important resource that promotes human wellbeing, health, the cultural dimension, social cohesion and the economy.
People have become powerfully aware of the importance of sport in the European Union and, consequently, it is to receive a legal basis under the new Constitutional Treaty.
The moral and ethical basis for the sports culture in Europe is the rule of âfair playâ.
The values connected with democracy, equality and solidarity are also of key importance.
The European Model of Sport, as it is known, has been structured around these values.
It is especially important, as we are in the European Year of Education through Sport, to examine the Commissionâs accomplishments in the area of sports culture.
The ratification of the Constitutional Treaty in the Member States, which is due to take place soon, places an obligation on the Commission to set about preparations promptly to clarify the legal basis for sport.
We have a lot of questions, which await answers.
Today, as far as our special subject for debate, football, is concerned, we need action, for example, which will ensure that European competitions are conducted cleanly and that young players are properly protected.
We also need action to weed out the unfortunate by-products of sport, such as drugs, racism and football hooliganism.
It is important that sports organisations and clubs know their responsibilities.
In football one would hope this would mean that there will be special measures in the field of work with junior players in clubs.
When we speak of the possible support that society can give to football, support for the work of training clubs should take precedence.
Investment from the Union and society is also needed to improve training conditions and build sports facilities for our citizens.
There are huge differences between football clubs and cultures at European level.
Some clubs concentrate on training players and selling them to top clubs, and some on achieving maximum success among the worldâs best clubs.
As football is a big industry, it is difficult for nation-states or the Union to supervise the selection of players by football clubs.
I do not think it is appropriate either.
In the case of the players, they who are employed by the football teams, the free movement of European players ...
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, there is a danger that the way in which sport is developing in the European Union will result in the weakening of its educational and social character.
The social function of sport, which is its more general interest, has been damaged for some years now by the appearance of new phenomena, which have caused the application of fair play, overall action and the development of the sporting ideal to be questioned.
Violence at football grounds, following a period of quiet, has revived over the last two years, with new trials for the most beloved of popular sports, football.
Hooliganism is now being translated into racism at football grounds where black footballers are playing or in teams to which players from other races are transferred.
There are signs of xenophobia and racism in that, apart from the chanting, banners and flags with emblems of the terrible past, full of hatred and incitement to terror, are also making their appearance.
The spread of doping and financial exploitation in relation to television rights and marketing have turned sport, and football in particular, into a field of competition and conflicting interests.
Footballers' contracts in the post-Bosman era have taken on values of huge dimensions.
The liberalisation of the market, which initially appeared to benefit clubs, has proven with the passage of time to be an unpleasant surprise, in that the so-called 'national product' has lost out.
In numerous European countries, especially over the last five years, another phenomenon has emerged which has led very well-known and historic clubs to bankruptcy but not to spending: ambitious plans, vain hopes, unpaid coaches and players, debts reaching as far as FIFA and UEFA.
The European Union of the 25 now faces a different prospect and the entry of the ten new Member States is creating the need for conditional harmonisation in the free movement of football players for the transitional period.
UEFA is studying new ways of rescuing and producing new talent.
That is why it is essential that the European Union cooperate with the competent ministries of the 25 on the completion of the plan for a national character.
Â Â  â Commissioner, we must all help so that the function of football, which is the popular sport , operates as a social inclusion factor.
Football is not simply a game which lasts 90 minutes, nor is it a purely business activity.
It is, in many cases, the image of the efforts of an entire local society.
That is why it is not right for the player transfer system to be based purely and simply on a decision by the Court of Justice which completely ignores the social role of sport.
The free movement of workers also applies to footballers who, as working citizens of the European Union, have â and must have â this right.
Nonetheless, the Commission could adopt measures designed to strengthen the ties between footballers and football clubs and the local society, as we heard earlier.
The proposal formulated for a minimum number of players, for example, who must come from the area of their team, is important.
On the other hand, the concentration of high value players in financially robust teams is weakening the tie between these teams and the societies from which they come and is having an adverse effect on the possible development of the talent of players in the area.
The picture painted today by numerous big, mainly European teams which, at important football events appear with only one or two players from their country, or even none as we heard a short while ago from Belgium, should be a cause of concern to us.
Sport is and must remain the basic axis of social integration and I hope that the Commission will move in this direction.
The social and educational character of sport has been emphasised several times and we must promote it as such.
Â Â  . Mr President, Mr Frattini, I should like to pick up on two points.
It strikes me that a much stricter regulation is required on the purchase of young players.
We have recently read in the press that players of six and seven years old have been bought by two clubs, Real Madrid and Manchester United.
I feel that, in this case, the purchase of young players has gone way too far, even if this is, of course, sanctioned by the families.
I believe that transferring players under the age of 16 should be banned and that priority should be attached to training clubs.
Every country has perfectly good training schools, and we must make sure that they are able to keep their young players up to a certain age.
Nor can we any longer accept the fact that young African players are brought to the EU on full charters and that only a few are taken on and all of the others completely abandoned.
My second point is about acknowledging what is happening in our stadia â in Italy, France, Spain, the Netherlands and elsewhere â and acknowledging the acts of xenophobia and racism that happen there.
I feel that we need to address this issue.
This is a question for the Council, although it also concerns the Commission, in my opinion.
Â Â  . Mr President, rather than begrudge the success of certain football clubs, we should try to emulate the very best and the most successful football clubs in the world and use that as our model to be followed by other clubs.
If this requires us to make changes to legislation or to national rules with regard to the support given to football clubs, then so be it.
It really irritates me when I hear people complain that clubs like Real Madrid or Manchester United are using their financial power and muscle to the detriment of other clubs.
In fact, as we can see, clubs that have spent less money on players than Manchester United or Real Madrid are now ahead of them in their national leagues and doing better than them in the European Champions league.
What is really at the heart of this whole argument is what we put in place to ensure that local talent is given the best opportunity to prosper and grow within its own area.
More important than that â as the Bosman ruling has proved â is to ensure that those who have talent, natural ability and skill are not restricted and can utilise that ability and skill wherever it is most beneficial to them.
In reality, the careers of football players are getting shorter and shorter, because of the professionalism and speed of the sport.
Therefore they have to make the maximum use of those resources.
Commissioner, I would plead with you to look at the best model and follow that.
Do not go with the lowest common denominator.
Â Â  Mr President, sport is an important economic and social factor, and is significant both in terms of its social role and of its value in the development of personality and peoplesâ ability to integrate.
Yet even during this, the European Year of Education through Sport, which has seen many successful major events, there have been problem areas, for example with regard to football.
In its Helsinki report, the Commission stated its intention of encouraging legal certainty in football and of cooperating more closely with clubs.
The aim of this is to find alternatives to the development of a European transfer system, in which the training of young players is often treated as a secondary consideration.
As a member of the European Parliamentâs âFriends of Footballâworking group, I have spoken with many players, trainers and club and UEFA employees about how to promote clubsâ autonomy and long-term training for players at local, national and international level.
In most of Europeâs football leagues it has become the norm to use players who are mediocre, and who were therefore bought cheaply, while blocking promising young ones, who are given far too little time for personal development.
When wealthy clubs then obtain these talented youngsters for themselves, this leaves the smaller clubs extremely frustrated.
In the case of the top teams, it is precisely these talents who then sit on the bench if they fail to achieve rapid sporting success.
This is the way in which valuable young talents are burnt out.
All of this means that the initiative that Mr Belet and other Members have launched is extremely important, as much too little is invested in the promotion of new talents in the EU.
Mr Figelâ, do we need quotas for football teams so that the first team can include at least three self-trained players?
Origin, nationality and EU citizenship should play no role in this respect.
Or do we need the clubs to voluntarily commit themselves to giving their own young players a chance?
I believe that it is not only trainers, clubs and football players that are interested in a solution, but also the millions of fans throughout Europe who identify with creative talents and their carefree style of playing.
Â Â  Mr President, as we have heard, sport is important for the physical and psychological health of our communities.
Football, which is the most popular sport, has a particularly important role in this.
The top professional clubs have to lead by example.
I have to say I have been very impressed by the work of the professional clubs in my own region in the north-west of England in working to combat exclusion, providing education and providing community leadership.
One area of great importance where football clubs have to be active is in combating racism and xenophobia.
I was delighted to support the âGive racism a red cardâ campaign in the United Kingdom.
We have to keep up that fight.
I regret the scenes we have seen recently in Spain, Italy and elsewhere, which show racism in football on the increase again.
We must not condone this.
It is important that the new Commission takes initiatives in this field and it is important that we make it clear to football clubs that they must not condone the activity of their own fans.
We must not forget, however, that football is a business and it must be allowed to operate in the same way as any other business.
Nor must we forget that â frankly â the old transfer system was akin to serfdom and did no service at all to professional footballers.
I hope we would not advocate a return to those days but we have to do everything we can to support plans to bring young people into the game and give them more opportunities than they have at the moment.
This is why we need to look at the UEFA proposals.
But I think that talking about the transfer system is missing the point.
The points of key importance in football at the moment are television rights and how they are distributed among television clubs.
I would like to hear the Commissioner tell me whether he has any proposals on those rights so the money is more fairly shared between all clubs in football.
Â Â  Mr President, : sports and citizenship.
This was the slogan of the Catalan autonomous government during the second Spanish Republic.
Sports are an instrument of social cohesion and social inclusion, and also an instrument of community identification.
For these reasons we have to promote sports practice and a sports social organisation.
For stateless nations, community identification through sports becomes very difficult.
In the UK this is solved through the existence of the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland national teams.
In Catalonia we have several national teams that cannot compete in international competitions.
Last summer the Catalan national roller hockey team was allowed to participate in the âBâ World Championship in Macau.
Catalonia was the winner and was supposed to move up automatically to the âAâ World Championship.
However, the intervention of the Spanish state changed the votes so our national team was not recognised at the meeting in the USA last week.
That is a bad example of the intervention of a nation-state with a sports federation in a world series.
Â Â  Mr President, in recent years increased television coverage of football and increased funding through advertising revenue have changed the nature of the game and its impact on society out of all recognition.
As a major aspect of entertainment, in which society takes considerable interest, it is appropriate that the EU institutions are aware of developments, even though the football authorities and the clubs take the major responsibility for organising the game.
The issue raised by this debate is one which the clubs and UEFA have been considering: whether they should encourage young sportsmen to aspire more to a career in the game, whether they have a real prospect of playing for the clubs which train them, or whether â particularly at the top level â it is merely a market for a limited number of world superstars.
As I understand it, the European Union is not seeking to prescribe employment practices to be followed by professional football clubs but there may be opportunities; observations and recommendations may be made.
International competitions also form an important aspect of the publicâs enjoyment and interest in the sport.
If home-based youngsters are not encouraged, this aspect of the game may well lose out accordingly.
My question to Commissioner Figelâ is: what should be the precise relationship between the Commission and Council of Ministers and the football authorities now that the game has such a major impact on society at large?
Â Â  Mr President, Mr Figelâ, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the proposal that UEFA put forward in July 2004, which aims to encourage voluntary involvement.
This is a step in the right direction.
I also welcome the fact that this question session is being held at the end of the âYear of Education through Sportâ, as this means that particular emphasis is given to sportâs significance in terms of education, society, health policy and the community, even though we are also aware that it is also a significant economic factor, and more than that besides.
With regard to the âYear of Education through Sportâ, I should like to ask the Commission when we can expect a report on the results and conclusions, in order to continue the debate on this year more intensively than merely with regard to one sport.
Today we have spent a lot of time discussing the issue of coercion, and I am wondering whether coercion and education are not contradictory terms.
I am therefore rather more in favour of voluntary commitment.
The European Union cannot take the responsibility away from the teams, the trainers, the paying spectators, the paying members, the members of the public who give their time as referees and linesmen, the sponsors and the state.
Should sponsors, members and the state not link their funding to certain developments in sport and in the clubs?
I wonder why todayâs debate, and UEFAâs proposal, are necessary, while we have the Helsinki report and Parliamentâs resolution of 2000?
I should therefore like to ask the Commission what it has done with the two reports, what has gone wrong and at which measures it is prepared to have another attempt.
Â Â  I now call on the Commissioner to reply to these questions, but I would like to remind him that we are in injury time â there are two more debates on the agenda tonight and it is almost 10 p.m. already.
Â Â  . Mr President, I am glad that there is such interest in sport and football.
Much of my week has been taken up with discussing it, including yesterday in Parliamentâs committee.
Today I should have been in The Hague with the Council presidency and the ministers for sport.
I hope to be there tomorrow for the closing event of the European Year of Education through Sport 2004.
So, sport is currently getting a lot of attention, and much action is being taken that could result in some answers to the questions heard here today.
This will surely bring more value and political weight to debates about sport in the European Union and also to developments surrounding cooperation.
Mr Karas said that self-regulation is better.
That is true, but the rule of law is a founding principle of the Union, and we have to abide by all the rules, including Community law, national law, both and .
This includes employment legislation, because in sport and in football there are different dimensions to activities.
The educational and social value of sport, and football in particular, is reflected in many positions of the Commission and in Parliament.
You will remember the Helsinki report and the Nice Declaration on Sport in 2000.
We then came up with the idea of making 2004 the Year of Education through Sport.
I am sure that we will evaluate experiences, especially as the year draws to a close.
As I said, the closing ceremony will take place tomorrow.
I hope to come back soon with some evaluations and proposals.
For the future, the draft Constitution gives us a much wider legal basis for activities.
Once it is ratified, we will work on European sport policy.
Until then we have some time to prepare.
We want to start open consultations, mostly based on workshops but also via the Internet to ensure we have the widest possible audience.
Probably the most sensitive question was the idea on quotas âŠ
Â Â  I am sorry to interrupt you, Commissioner, but we have a problem with time because other debates have overrun.
I wonder whether you could answer the questions in writing?
This is unusual, but we are half an hour late and the interpreters want to finish.
Would you mind bringing your remarks to a close and answering Membersâ questions in writing?
Â Â  . That is no problem for me, if it is satisfactory for you.
Â Â  Sorry colleagues, I must insist.
We have two more debates to conclude.
The Commissioner is prepared to answer your questions in writing.
He could not have answered all the seven or eight questions put to him in the time available.
I am so sorry, colleagues.
