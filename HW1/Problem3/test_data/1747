Madam President, what entitles the EU to undermine Sweden' s alcohol policy and its campaign against drugs?
What makes imports of alcohol into more of a trade issue than a public health issue?
In the 1994 referendum on Swedish membership of the EU, Swedish citizens were told that the derogations could be extended beyond the year 2000.
The temperance movement and many citizens, including myself, were satisfied with that.
On 13 March of this year, Mr Guterres, Prime Minister of Portugal (the country currently holding the Presidency of the Union) described the EU' s cultural diversity as a form of wealth.
He talked of there not being a single, general opinion, but 15 different arenas.
Through the Commissioner responsible, Mr Bolkestein, the European Union should now nonetheless normalise the conditions which enable the Member States to continue to pursue national, democratically determined alcohol policies.
Mr Bolkestein and the Commission maintain that the internal market functions in such a way as to require that every citizen be given the so-called right day in and day out to bring 210 litres of alcohol across national borders.
For a family with three older children, this corresponds to 7 metric tons of alcohol per week.
Should that be a so-called right?
Is that a level consistent with moderate consumption?
There is no question of Sweden' s being a nanny State.
It is about a one-nation mentality and of taking the issue of alcohol and drug abuse seriously in terms of an integrated view of society.
In the light of this issue and of the disquiet felt during Euro 2000 on the subjects of hooliganism and alcohol abuse, the Commission' s decision and the actions of Sweden' s Social Democratic Government appear absurd to say the least.
Madam President, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Maaten.
The Commission proposal reflects the compromise which has been reached between Sweden and the Commission regarding prolonging the possibility of applying restrictions to products subject to excise duties which may be brought into Sweden by travellers from other Member States.
This arrangement would normally have expired at the end of this month.
Sweden has requested more time to adapt its alcohol policy.
This has also been stressed by Mr FÃ€rm who said that we need time to adapt our policy.
Well, the European Commission is prepared to give Sweden until the end of the year 2003 at the latest.
I believe that the compromise which has been reached is fair and reasonable.
It guarantees that the restrictions for travellers will disappear once and for all by the end of the year 2003, as I have already mentioned.
But at the same time, it provides for a short, further period of adjustment.
The gradual liberalisation during the transitional period underlines Sweden' s commitment to finally do away with derogations and will ensure that Swedish citizens will finally be able to benefit from the unified market in the same way as other EU citizens.
I am also delighted that Mr Maaten' s report supports the Commission proposal.
But the Commission cannot accept the tabled amendments, although it very much understands the reasons which have led to their tabling.
The Commission is of the opinion that it is not advisable to make reference to general issues, such as the connection between alcohol policy and health policy or the need to aim for more coordination of excise levels on alcohol, within the context of a proposal on derogations applied by one Member State.
These derogations from fundamental principles of the internal market have been granted in order to allow Sweden to adapt its alcohol policy.
As such, - and I would also address Mr SacrÃ©deus here - we are dealing here with fundamental principles of the common internal market.
Whatever the justification was for Sweden enjoying this derogation since joining the Community - and if I could once again address Mr SacrÃ©deus - as far as I can remember, no exceptions which were to apply forever were made at the time.
The derogation was supposed to lapse at the end of this month, and this has always been provided for.
But as I have said before, Sweden was granted a few more years to adapt its alcohol policy.
But - once again - this exception was certainly not meant to last forever.
I repeat: whatever the justification was for this derogation, the Commission is of the opinion that the transitional period will have been sufficiently long, namely nine years from Sweden' s accession to the EU until the end of 2003, and that it is now time to establish a definite expiry date for this derogation from the principles of the free movement of goods and persons.
Maybe you will allow me, by way of concluding, to address a few points which have been raised by Members of Parliament this evening.
I would especially like to stress once again that the public health aspect which Mr Maaten mentioned is, of course, important.
All countries, all EU Member States have alcohol-related problems, and know about alcohol-related problems, and all EU Member States are adopting an anti-alcohol policy.
It is only natural and very sensible that Sweden should do the same, but this should be possible without prejudicing the rules for the free movement of goods which, as has been mentioned before, is one of the European Union' s cornerstones.
So once again, it is very understandable that that health policy is pursued in Sweden.
Mr FÃ€rm and Mrs Carlsson have already clarified the way in which it should be pursued.
It is important to take measures in the form of information campaigns, information in schools and vis-Ã -vis the public, as happens elsewhere in the Community.
This is the first point which I wanted to raise.
The second point concerns the harmonisation of excise duty on alcohol products.
Could I inform you that, as the Members of this House are aware, the Commission does not have any instruments at its disposal to impose a specific excise policy?
The Commission might wish it had, but it has not.
What the Commission can do, however, is to ensure that the minimum tariff, which is the only rule which pertains to the whole of the European Union, is maintained.
Furthermore, the Commission will, as it is required to do, be drawing up a report either at the end of this year or at the beginning of next year which will outline the state of affairs within the EU with regard to excise.
This report will thus be available around the beginning of next year, and the Commission will naturally make some recommendations in this report because, after all, the huge discrepancies in excise levels between Member States lead to distortions within the internal market, something which the Commission does not like to see.
So the report will contain recommendations, but the Commission does not have instruments at its disposal.
I would recommend Parliament to adopt Mr Maaten' s report without amendments.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon.
Exchange of information with third countries
The next item is the report (A5-0142/2000) by Mr Berenguer Fuster, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Directives 85/611/EEC, 92/49/EEC, 92/96/EEC and 93/22/EEC as regards exchange of information with third countries [(COM(1999) 748 - C5-0011/2000 - 2000/0014 (COD)].
Madam President, we must bear in mind that the powers of investigation and control available to the supervisory authorities in the financial field are incomparably greater than those which exist in other fields.
In the financial field - to a large extent because there is public concern about credit and savings, including, therefore, companies which use the securities market - there is a public interest in safeguarding the interests of huge numbers of third-party savers who put their confidence in companies which manage other people' s money while the real owners of that money have no capacity to intervene in that management.
The protection of the interests of third parties justifies a high degree of intervention by the public authorities, which leads, amongst other things, to very great powers which provide the authorities with information about the internal affairs of companies.
There is no doubt whatsoever that, if the data obtained as a result of the exercise of these authorities were to be made known to third parties, this could not only cause irreparable damage to the bodies under investigation, but could also cause serious fluctuations, and ultimately changes, in the market.
Therefore, as a counterbalance to such broad powers of investigation, the authorities are obliged to keep the information secret.
That duty of secrecy, taken to the extreme, could hinder certain objectives pursued by the control authorities, which, ultimately, consist of ensuring that the markets behave properly.
There is no doubt that one of the areas in which the phenomenon of globalisation has had the most obvious effect is the financial field, in which the large companies use the securities market.
Today large companies operate in many countries, but there are no supranational supervisory authorities and furthermore the Community authorities find it difficult to carry out their work outside their own borders.
Ultimately, we are talking about issues which involve sovereignty. To sum up, the problem is that the authority supervising the activities of a certain country cannot itself access the data relating to the activity of that company, its parent company or its subsidiaries in other countries because its powers of supervision do not extend beyond the borders of the country to which it belongs.
In order to resolve this problem cooperation is needed between the authorities of the various countries. This cooperation, amongst other things, has to take the form of an exchange of the data obtained.
The problem is that this exchange generally involves a degree of non-compliance with the obligation to secrecy.
It is therefore necessary for the regulations to provide for a way to overcome this conflict between the obligation to secrecy and the exchange of information, and to seek balanced solutions to the problem.
With regard to the European regulations, after the previous unstable regulation which furthermore was different for the different sectors, in 1998 the first banking sector directive was amended to allow Member States to reach agreements on the exchange of information with third countries, on the condition that the information exchanged was subject to guarantees of professional secrecy at least equivalent to those in force in the European Union.
Now, by means of this directive, the corresponding amendments are being made to the other financial sector directives, in the same way that they were made in the case of the banking sector directive.
Just as we agreed with the 1998 amendment, and for the same reasons, we are going to support these amendments in the terms proposed by the Commission.
A final comment.
We are currently awaiting a report by the European Parliament on the review of the SLIM initiative aimed at simplifying the legislation on the internal market.
What has happened in this field may be very significant and it may have very beneficial consequences.
If we want to simplify the legislation, it will also be necessary to reduce the number of regulations and rationalise the initiatives.
We should consequently ask the question why, when the banking sector directive was amended in 1998, the directives on insurance and collective investment, that is to say the ones that are now being amended, were not amended at the same time.
The simplification and coherence of the legislation may perhaps have required this.
Madam President, I am delighted to at least have the opportunity of contributing to this debate on behalf of the PPE, and firstly to congratulate Mr Berenguer Fuster for the work that he has done in relation to this report.
I recognise that his report is quite brief, but that belies the amount of work that has had to be undertaken because the issue that we are considering is a complex one as he made clear in the course of his remarks.
We are dealing in essence with the compromise between access to confidential information, information which comes into the hands of a whole range of regulatory authorities, and the use that is subsequently made of that information.
We know that the information is in general gathered as a result of the obligations that rest with companies from the whole of the inspection regime.
We have a range of regulators now, across the whole of the European Union, but we very often have a whole range of regulators within Member States themselves, and the dilemma of how information is in fact used is one that is not just a dilemma for the Community and its exchange of information with regulators beyond the Community itself.
We often have that dilemma within Member States.
I certainly have had first-hand experience of government in the United Kingdom where I can remember very many instances where the government has been on the point of granting a contract to a particular company only to find out that another branch of government is actually engaged in starting legal proceedings for one reason or another against that very company.
This is often described as the left arm of government not knowing what the right arm is doing, but what it is really about is the willingness on the part of the regulatory authorities within Member States, but also within the European Union and beyond, to exchange information whilst at the same time respecting confidentiality.
That brings me to the second brief point that I wish to make this evening which is about the need for the consolidation of regulatory authorities themselves.
That is a process that has been undertaken within the United Kingdom.
Recently, Howard Davies, who heads the new Financial Services Authority in the UK, was speaking to our Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee and outlining what that experience has been.
It has not been a wholly easy experience, but I think that people are broadly of the view that the consolidation of regulatory authorities within the United Kingdom has been a success.
It is something that could be commended to other authorities within the European Union, not least because it would lead to a common approach to the use of the information that is made available by this process, to the advantage of investors throughout the whole of the European Union itself.
. I thank the rapporteur, Mr Berenguer Fuster, very much indeed for his report and for the helpful coordination and cooperation.
The approach of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has facilitated prompt adoption of the proposal.
The aim of the proposal is to amend several financial services directives, to align them with rules already in force in the banking area in order to improve the exchange of information with third countries.
The proposal is also a response to international recommendations on the exchange of confidential information.
It is necessary to improve supervision of financial conglomerates.
This is an aspect which was stressed by Mr Berenguer Fuster this evening and also Mr Evans.
I fully agree with both of them that confidentiality of that information is absolutely essential.
The measure proposed will allow European securities and insurance regulators to exchange, on a cross-sectoral basis, confidential supervisory information with third country competent authorities.
It also allows European securities and insurance regulators to exchange supervisory information with third country bodies, such as clearing and settlement systems, auditors, etc. which by virtue of their functions help to strengthen the stability of the financial system.
The proposal makes clear that information is exchanged for supervisory purposes and it provides for protection of the confidentiality - the important point mentioned - of the information exchanged.
Mr Evans has spoken of the consolidation of regulatory authorities.
That indeed is what happens in the United Kingdom.
The Financial Services Authority, headed by Mr Howard Davies, is indeed a consolidation of regulatory authorities.
That example is followed by Sweden, or perhaps it is the other way around.
In other words, both in London and in Stockholm there is a consolidated regulatory apparatus.
Within the FSA in London there is a unit working with banking.
There is another unit working with insurance undertakings and there is a third unit working with the stock exchange.
They are under one roof, but under that one roof there are still distinct entities.
Mr Evans implies that they are cooperating - and indeed they are cooperating - but cooperation means more than being under one roof.
Mr Evans would like the Commission to exhort other Member States to follow the British example or the Swedish example.
Opinions differ very much indeed.
We are dealing here with a very sensitive question.
In some countries there is consolidated regulation but in other countries there are three separate entities, for example in the Netherlands and other Member States.
They say: we cooperate, so what is the worry?
I am not saying that there is no reason to be worried.
A report was recently produced by a committee under the chairmanship of Mr Brouwer, who is the second in command of the Bank of the Netherlands.
It was welcomed by ECOFIN.
It is available on the Internet so anybody can take cognisance of it.
The report says that basically, as far as banks and insurance companies are concerned, the institutional framework is adequate but it leaves aside the matter of how to deal with systemic crises.
Nor does it deal with stock exchanges.
But thinking does not stop.
If it did we would be in a very bad position.
Everybody knows what has happened in other parts of the world in the way of systemic crises.
Also, everybody knows that the alliances between various stock exchanges are the order of the day.
So we must give this further attention and see whether the rise of conglomerates leads to the need for further supervision.
Certainly in the case of stock markets, whether we should leave everything to national supervisory instances or whether there should be something at European level is a valid question.
This thinking has not led to any firm conclusions but it is continuing.
If developments are favourable then I look forward to engaging in a dialogue with this Parliament on these very matters.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Imports of beer into Finland
The next item is the report (A5Â­0144/2000) by Mrs Lulling, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs,
I. on the proposal for a Council directive amending Directives 69/169/EEC and 92/12/EEC as regards temporary quantitative restrictions on beer imports into Finland [COM(2000)76 - C5Â­0137/2000 - 2000/0038(CNS)],
II. on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EEC) No 918/83 as regards a temporary derogation for duty-free imports of beer into Finland [COM(2000)76 - C5Â­0138/2000 - 2000/0039(CNS)]
Madam President, Commissioner, in its 1995 accession treaty Finland obtained a derogation until 31 December 1996 to restrict beer imports from other Member States.
This derogation is an exemption to the fundamental right of Community citizens to carry goods purchased for their own consumption from one point in the Community to another without having to pay further duties.
Finland obtained an extension of this derogation until 2003.
At the same time, in order to comply with European legislation in force in the context of customs union, Finland was required to increase the quantity of beer that could be imported tax free from third countries from 2 to 15 litres.
Now, in the face of the massive amount of importation carried out by its citizens from Estonia and Russia, which primarily affects the livelihood of the many SMBs retailing beer in border regions, Finland has requested that the limit for residents' beer imports from these two countries be reduced from 15 to 6 litres.
Finland also mentions problems to do with health, public order and loss of income.
In the meantime, such imports account for some 10% of Finland' s beer retail market.
The reason for this is simply the vast price difference resulting from the exorbitant taxes on alcohol in Finland.
The Finnish population' s response to this situation is a perfect illustration of the truth of La Palice' s maxim according to which too much tax kills tax, because citizens react against what they consider to be excessive taxes.
In comparison with other Member States, Finnish excise duties on alcohol are the highest, and for beer, for example, they are 17 times those in Spain and 44% higher than those in Ireland which, in the hit-parade of excise duties, comes in second position behind Finland, which is the champion of the European Union, though, admittedly, it is beaten by Norway, which is not a member.
It is true that, due to Finland' s geographical position, imports by private individuals from other Member States are much less, and this is not, for example, the case in the United Kingdom and Denmark in particular, which have much higher excise duties on alcohol than their neighbouring Member States.
Given the seriousness of the situation, I recommended in my report that we should agree to this new 6 litre limit for beer from Russia and Estonia, but only until 2003 and not until 2006, principally due to the fact that Estonia is an accession candidate and that the traffic in goods, even the illegal traffic, will not cease after 2006 unless Finland decides to impose less stringent taxes on alcohol products, especially beer and wine.
The majority in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs did not agree with me on this.
I persisted, and I even tabled an amendment, principally due to the review of the derogation on imports for personal use from other Member States.
The amendment of the directive in question, which was referred to us at the same time, effectively envisages gradual liberalisation from the 15 litres currently allowed up to 64 litres in 2003, and then, as of 1 January 2004, the general regulations will come into force.
This represents definite progress in relation to the current situation which may continue until 2003.
There was a great deal of controversy in committee regarding the problem of alcoholism.
I still claim that the problem of alcoholism, especially the Scandinavian style of consuming alcohol for the purpose of getting drunk, cannot be solved by excessive taxation, quite the contrary, because it makes alcohol a luxury product, a sort of status symbol.
I therefore dare to recommend that Finland take advantage of this new derogation period in order to reduce its high rates of taxation, particularly on alcoholic drinks such as beer and wine.
The real alcoholism and health problems which result can only be combated by information and education.
High taxes do not stop serious drinkers from drinking, they just penalise the great majority that consume beer, wine and other alcoholic beverages in moderation, which is very well known and scientifically proven to have beneficial effects for health and for the prevention of diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer' s and cardiovascular illness.
Let us put an end to hypocrisy, and let us give up on solutions that do not work.
Obviously, we all know that we cannot, and do not, wish to challenge the prerogative of Member States, in matters of fiscal policy, to set their own excise duty rates as they see fit.
We at least hope, though, that Finland may be persuaded that reducing the gaps between its own excise duties and those implemented by the other Member States and neighbouring third countries would be the best means of preventing an increase in the cross-border trade which presents a problem, and that such a policy would have much more chance of success than maintaining and intensifying restrictions on quantities.
Commissioner, I deplore the Commission' s reticence on this subject, especially given that you use Article 93 of the Treaty as a legal basis, and this deals specifically with the harmonisation of indirect duties and taxes.
Make of it what you will!
Madam President, Commissioner, representatives of the Council, it is often said that Parliament is far removed from the people and that what we speak about here does not interest the people in our home countries.
Ladies and gentlemen, for once we have a report to discuss that is guaranteed to interest consumers, at least in my home country of Finland.
Before we joined the European Union we Finns were promised that the EU would mean a more open policy on alcohol, that it would bring down the astronomically high prices of alcoholic beverages due to heavy taxation and that it would free up the retail market as well as break up the state monopoly on alcohol.
I quite agree with what Mrs Lulling said, that the alcohol problem cannot be resolved by restricting imports, nor can it be resolved by keeping prices high and the sale of alcohol in the hands of a monopoly.
Consumers have had to wait for reforms as regards the policy on alcohol, on account of the fact that the long transition periods and the various restrictions on imports have blocked healthy competition.
The report we now have to discuss is a giant step forward in the gradual opening up of the Finnish markets.
As a counterbalance to the opening up to EU imports, Finland, however, is asking for the right to reduce quotas on beer imported from non-member countries.
This restriction that is being sought is, in itself, justifiable, as long as the restriction is not a permanent one.
Also in connection with non-member countries, Finland must, in a determined manner, approach a situation where the market is as open as in other Member States.
The restrictions with regard to non-member countries should be lifted by the end of 2003, as the faster Finland is obligated to open up her market entirely, the more likely we will be able to see a real solution to the question of excise duty.
This is what everything hinges on at the end of the day.
Obviously, lifting the restrictions by the end of 2003 on imports from Estonia and Russia, for example, would, at present gross price levels, lead to an undesirable situation.
Opening up the market in respect of non-member countries more rapidly than scheduled, however, will increase pressure to lower taxes, and the faster taxation reaches a European average, the healthier the situation in the internal market will be.
Madam President, Finland' s special regulations governing beer imports are naturally of great importance both for public health and for commerce.
The problem is, of course, much more acute because of our proximity to third countries, that is to say Russia and Estonia.
Clearly, special rules are also required when it comes to customs relations with these third countries.
As we saw in the previous debate on Swedish alcohol policy, Finland, like Sweden and Norway, has a quite distinctive policy in this area, based partly on high taxes in the belief that high consumer prices will also lead to reduced consumption.
The fact is that, in Finland too, this policy has proved to be successful when it comes to combating the harm caused by alcohol.
In spite of the special pattern of consumption traditionally to be found in countries like Finland and Sweden and in spite of there being a good deal of smuggling and illicit distilling, the relatively low overall level of alcohol consumption does in fact lead to less harm and lower social costs as a result of alcohol.
Where this is concerned, I do in fact believe that there is convincing proof that the rapporteur, Mrs Lulling, is wrong when she states that high taxes do not lead to reduced consumption or that a restrictive policy would not be effective.
On the contrary, there is a good deal of research to show that it is in fact effective.
It is also now the case that the UN, for example, is recommending an alcohol policy based on the Scandinavian experience and is recommending other European countries too to go down the same road.
However, this more restrictive policy is naturally more difficult to implement without the protection of import restrictions.
That is the reason why Finland, in common with Sweden, has requested until the year 2003 to increase the quantities of beer imported from within the EU.
Quite simply, time is needed to prepare the new alcohol policy and incorporate new features which may reduce the possible risks involved in abolishing import restrictions.
For Finland, the problems it shares with Sweden are exacerbated by its proximity to non-EU neighbours, especially Russia and Estonia, for these countries have quite different cost levels and quite different levels of prices and taxes than is the norm within the European Union.
The proximity of southern Finland to Estonia and the enormous differences in prices and taxes have led to a situation in which Finland and the European Commission wish to retain the restrictions in connection with these countries for a further two years, that is to say until the year 2005, which I in actual fact think is reasonable.
However, the rapporteur, Mrs Lulling, felt unable to accept this and is instead demanding that the same time limit apply in regard to third countries as applies to the internal market.
Happily, the Committee nonetheless elected to follow the line taken by myself, the Finnish Government and the Commission who considered that these big differences in price and tax levels do in fact justify an additional two-year period of adjustment, as long as Estonia does not become a member of the EU before this period expires for, if it did, then it may only be right that the EU' s rules should also apply to Estonia.
Of course, the risks concerned relate, above all, to public health problems but also to problems involving the national production and sale of beer in border areas.
Mrs Lulling has, above all, chosen to use her report to argue the case for reduced taxes on alcohol in Finland.
I agree that high taxes are likely to be difficult to maintain in the longer term when more and more people are crossing borders and have the opportunity to import alcohol on a private basis.
As Commissioner Bolkestein noted earlier, it is, however, in spite of everything, an important principle that this type of tax is an issue for individual nation States and not a subject for formal harmonisation in the context of the internal market.
Nonetheless, it will now probably become necessary for the Finnish Government to begin adjusting tax levels downwards so as to avoid major problems when the restrictions on private imports of beer are gradually reduced to that level which is to apply to the rest of the internal market.
It is nonetheless a little sad that the rapporteur, who is of course a well-known champion of the interests of wine producers, does not take the public health problems at all seriously but, unlike Mr Maaten (the rapporteur on the issue of Sweden' s restrictions on alcohol), only sees this as a tax problem and as a problem concerning the internal market, for it is in fact obvious that low-price imports into Finland from Estonia and Russia have already led to undeniable social and public health problems.
It is therefore gratifying that the forthcoming presidencies will - as I understand it, during the coming year - in actual fact be taking up this issue in terms of public health initiatives concerning the role of alcohol.
However, a whole range of new methods will certainly be required.
Against this background, I nonetheless propose that we support the Committee' s proposal to approve the agreement between Finland and the EU.
Madam President, now that Finland has joined the European Union, she must apply the EU regulations regarding competition.
These include regulations on the importation of beer.
As representative of the ELDR Group, I wish to defend the abolition of competition distortion as well as the principle of free trade, which, however, must benefit the public.
I would approach the problem, however, from the angle of the principle of subsidiarity.
For a very long time in Finland, there has been a successful social policy in force where the aim has been to restrict alcohol consumption.
All the statistics relating to alcohol consumption speak in favour of continuing with this policy.
On the other hand, I will admit that consumption is not evenly spread.
In Finland there are groups of alcohol abusers, such as the young, for example.
It is alcohol consumption among these groups that we aim to influence.
One reason for keeping stringent restrictions on imports is, for example, the matter of public order.
An essential part of health policy has been high taxation and, at the same time, well-maintained border controls.
Finland' s geographical position is very different from all the other EU countries.
Beyond our frontiers are countries where prices are low.
If, for example, the general EUR 175 tax-free import limit were applied on imports from these countries, permitted imports would double in terms of litres.
That is why Finland needs an independent mechanism regarding what it itself perceives as reasonable import restrictions.
In this matter it is necessary to advance in stages towards lower taxation on alcohol and a gradual liberalisation of imports, but let us respect the conditions that now prevail in the Member State as it itself sees them.
Finland believes it justifiable to have a two-year extension to the restriction on imports from non-member countries.
We cannot therefore support the amendments that were reintroduced in plenary after having been voted down once in committee.
Madam President, Commissioner, Mrs Lulling has done a great job with this report, in my opinion, in the sense that she has endeavoured to adjust the restrictive approach of the Commission.
There is an initial point which needs to be cleared up: it is true that the free movement of goods and products within Community countries seriously hampers the creation of the single market. And it makes no difference whether the products in question are beer, as in this case, or other products.
The discrimination between consumers who are citizens of other countries and Finnish consumers is clear and self-justifying.
The discrepancy between the restrictions imposed by countries such as Finland on importing beer for personal use and Community standards must therefore be eliminated, and eliminated immediately.
There are no grounds for setting the deadline stipulated of 2003, and there are even less grounds for setting the deadline of 2005 for importing for personal use from third countries.
On this point, we Radicals will support the amendments tabled by Mrs Lulling.
Neither are we convinced, Madam President, by the social or health reasons put forward in support of the derogation.
The bans, the high level of taxes and the public monopolies, which are as unacceptable as all other monopolies, generate smuggling and unlawful activities even though they might benefit the Treasury.
In the long term - and there is not even any need to cite the case of prohibition of alcohol in the United States, last century - they harm society and health rather than generating awareness in the consumer.
Information on smuggling in the Scandinavian countries of products which are in themselves harmless, such as beer or wine, must serve as a warning against political prohibition of alcohol, and against prohibition of other products as well, rather than being an example which some have maintained should be followed by the other countries of the European Union.
And that is not to mention the serious harm to individual freedom caused by all paternalistic excesses, whether they are engaged in by States or politicians.
Madam President, Finland is prepared to increase imports of beer from the internal market.
The derogation has been restricted in terms of time, and I thus support the Commission' s line here.
Finland' s alcohol policy has been a valid one, and we see evidence of this that goes unchallenged anywhere in the world.
Our problem is the enormous difference in taxation.
Hardly anywhere else does such a huge difference exist as is the case on the eastern border of our country.
The reason is obvious if you think about it for a moment.
A whole state collapsed over there and, at the same time, the price of vodka and beer likewise collapsed.
That is what happened over there, and we will not get carried away in the flood, whatever you tell us.
The cost of alcohol fell.
Besides, they concoct alcoholic beverages over there by mixing tap water and home-made spirits.
That makes for a pretty powerful brew.
You can buy that virtually for the price of the bottle alone.
What production could be so cheap that you could compete with that?
Besides, who will be bothered by this restriction on imports from the east?
It will not bother anyone, at least not the EU.
It is being said here that taxation cannot reduce the consumption of alcohol.
What sort of experience have you had in this regard?
Because we do have experience of it.
The first thing that the poor cut back on if prices rise is alcohol consumption.
There is research data on that.
Then you say that education helps.
I happen to come from a region where such education has been provided.
What happened?
Vodka continues to be drunk as before, and on top of that there is wine.
In other words, total consumption is increasing.
And we still have an additional problem.
We have high taxation, which I used to be in favour of.
If private citizens are allowed to bring in more foreign beer, tax revenue will fall.
Then we would be obligated to lower taxation in our own country with a consequent decrease in tax revenue, but in either case the consumption of alcohol will increase.
In other words, there is quite a significant double-edged problem.
I regard a gradual switch as being the correct approach and one where consideration is given to our country' s levels of taxation.
Excise duty on beer is very high in our country but, ladies and gentlemen, what we cannot eliminate is the price gap that exists between us and our neighbour to the east.
Our resources are insufficient for that. This gap is so great that, as a result - as Mr PesÃ€lÃ€ said - our special position is quite important for us.
And if it is removed, I will just say that our roads to the east will be soaked in vodka if all import restrictions are lifted.
That is the issue here.
Mr President, Commissioner, unlike my fellow MEP, Ms Kauppi, I think there are better ways of celebrating the first anniversary of the latest election to the European Parliament than by taking up the time of the Member of the Commission to discuss this minor issue as late as 11.00 p.m.
We could have dealt with this issue in a more appropriate way.
It is also obvious that this is mainly a fiscal problem.
To my fellow MEP, Ms Kauppi, I would say that it is quite right to identify matters of concern to liberals here, but what has Ms Kauppi' s party colleague, Finland' s finance minister, done to try to adapt conditions in Finland to take account of this or other tax issues?
It is, as has been said, in actual fact a fiscal problem.
I have referred in part to points of order.
I am very disappointed that the Court of Justice of the European Communities considered that a discriminatory time limit could be introduced for citizens from third countries.
My party, the Swedish People' s Party, was against this, but was unfortunately forced to give in when the Court in Luxembourg made its decision.
It is worth noting that, unlike a number of Swedish colleagues, the Finns were no doubt aware that our derogation for other alcoholic drinks from EU countries was a temporary derogation.
For my part, I nonetheless support the Commission' s proposal whereby the year 2006 would be the time limit where imports of beer were concerned.
I am also concerned that we should not relinquish future opportunities for transitional regulations in the negotiations with Estonia.
The Committee has introduced an addendum concerning Estonia, among other countries.
We have a similar problem in many border regions, and I would refer in this regard to Mr Paasilinna' s intervention.
It is a question of not making a hasty decision.
I would also refer to the difficult situation where competition between transport operators in the Baltic is concerned.
The situation is very unequal, and there is a risk of its deteriorating further.
Madam President, Finland has had a period of transition to adapt regulations for imports of alcohol to EU levels.
This is being done by 2004, according to the deadline fixed in respect of the Internal Market.
In asking for extra time for harmonising exports from non-member countries, however, Finland has been keen to ensure that imports from the Internal Market, considered a priority, are harmonised in a controlled way.
The European Court of Justice and the Commission accept this order of priorities, and I thus hope for understanding on the part of Parliament as well.
In my opinion, the picture created in Mrs Lulling' s report of the situation in Finland is a false one.
Commissioner, you can surely ascertain that from what we Finns have been saying here in our speeches.
The essential problem regarding imports from non-member countries is that an EU-wide restriction on imports has been imposed on strong alcoholic beverages and wines among products liable to excise duty, but, for some reason or other, there is no such restriction on beer.
Therefore, as regards the importation of beer, the general euro limit has to be observed, which is products to the value of EUR 175.
At Russian prices, as we have heard, this means more than 200 litres of the best European beer.
That is double what a citizen of the EU can bring in from another EU country.
At what limit the importation of beer from non-member countries should be set is not as important as attending to the issue of imports from non-member countries according to a timetable only after the Internal Market has started functioning.
The border between Finland and Russia is quite exceptional in the EU.
I would point out that no other EU country faces such a wide price differential on its borders as Finland - and the problems resulting from this price differential will not be resolved at any level of excise duty.
Recent information, for example from research carried out in France, shows that alcohol causes serious public health problems in all EU countries.
I also understand that Sweden and France are planning an EU policy, when they hold the presidency, aiming at preventing health problems caused by alcohol throughout the EU.
Knowing the high social costs of alcohol-related problems, the harmonisation of excise duty should preferably come about at the average rate for Europe, not its lowest.
Excise duty is not fiscal in nature, simply a policy to provide revenue for the state, but clearly it is an instrument which will lead to healthier lifestyles, aided by a market economy.
Madam President, may I start by saying that, with this proposal, the Commission is meeting a request made by Finland which is aiming to combat increasing levels of beer imports from neighbouring third countries, such as Russia or Estonia, where beer is much cheaper.
Finland has also agreed to gradually increase the quantities of beer which travellers coming from other Member States can bring into that country without paying excise duties.
In this way, Finland is bracing itself for 2004 when travellers will be able to bring alcoholic beverages for their own use from other Member States for free, in line with the internal market principles.
Despite the large number of amendments tabled, I am delighted that Mrs Lulling' s report largely supports the Commission proposals.
Although the Commission very much understands the motives behind the tabled amendments, it is unable to accept them.
A number of these amendments concern the level of the tariffs applied by Finland.
As I explained earlier this evening, as Community legislation stands at present, stipulating only minimum excise tariffs, it is up to Finland - and Finland alone - to decide whether the adaptation of its alcohol policy should also entail a reduction in the tax level.
In any event, the Commission will be dealing with the level of tariffs in its wider context in a report which will be presented either at the end of this year or the beginning of next year.
That report will also take into account the Treaty' s general objectives, such as health policy.
Neither is it necessary in this proposal to draw attention to the fact that Finland has so far failed to fulfil its obligation to liberalise the intra-Community restrictions in stages.
This obligation is already embodied in the existing text of the directive, and the Commission has reminded Finland of this obligation in its general report of 24 May last on the application of the restrictions in the Scandinavian Member States, a copy of which has also been sent to the European Parliament.
With regard to the restrictions on imports from third countries, I would like to note that it is the first time that Finland is requesting a derogation.
Before, these restrictions were automatically incorporated into the restrictions within the Union.
Concerning the situation in Estonia, I would point out that the excise tariffs which apply to beer in that country are already somewhat higher than the minimum tariffs laid down in Community law.
Finally, the proposed date of implementation, i.e. 1 April of this year, will have to be changed by the Council upon receipt of the recommendations from Parliament and the Economic and Social Committee.
This change will not require a change in the proposal.
The new date will most likely be 1 July of this year.
This concludes my comments.
I would once again like to express my thanks to the rapporteur.
.
(FR) Madam President, since I am entitled to do so, I should like to respond, as I cannot let some of the observations and even complaints, directed at me in my capacity as rapporteur by Mr FÃ€rm, go without comment. I shall refrain from commenting on his own rather contradictory statement.
If the policy of high excise duties, at 17 times higher than the Community minimum for beer, had indeed been successful, then what need would there be to request further restrictions?
It has been clearly demonstrated that this policy is not successful. Why else would Finland be complaining about the increasing amounts imported from Russia and Estonia in spite of the exorbitant excise duties.
So I would advise Mr FÃ€rm, who has unfortunately left the building, to check back over his reasoning and try to come up with something better, since he is subject to rather a lot of contradictions.
He even suggested that I had reduced excise duties.
That would be a fine thing, if only I could.
(The President asked the speaker to conclude) I have the right to reply, and I shall finish soon.
As I was saying, I mean to make the most of my right to speak.
Mr FÃ€rm also criticised me for defending wine producers.
I am proud that I did though!
Must I remind you that wine is an agricultural product and a foodstuff which, consumed in moderation, has therapeutic and preventative properties, and I would like to see those citizens that get drunk on beer and vodka on Friday and Saturday drinking a couple of glasses of wine every day instead. It would be much better for their health.
I should like to see these citizens in a position to purchase these two glasses of wine, for this is not possible due to the excessive excise duties applied by this country.
It would even be good for the social security department in Finland.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Statistics for trade between Member States
The next item is the recommendation for second reading by Mr Beysen (A5-0153/2000), on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the Common Position adopted by the Council on 28 February 2000 with a view to the adoption of a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 3330/91 on the statistics relating to the trading of goods between Member States, with specific reference to a simplified application of the nomenclature of products [(14100/1/1999 - C5 - 0134/2000 - 1997/0162 (COD)]
Madam President, the entry into force of the internal market and the lifting of border controls have led to the abolition of VAT declarations along with the statistics which used to be kept by customs offices.
Intrastat, the statistical collection system on the transport of goods, is met with little appreciation by industry, as the latter is weighed down by the red-tape involved. Indeed, not only does industry need to provide data on the products in question, it is also required to provide information which does not fall within the remit of the companies directly involved in the transaction but within that of the transport companies which they use.
The basic regulation stipulates that providers of statistical information shall make use of the combined nomenclature, which comprises more than 10 500 entries, in order to classify goods.
This combined nomenclature is a tariff and statistics nomenclature which is used for the trade between Member States and that with third countries.
Within the framework of the SLIM Initiative, the simplification of Intrastat has been set up as a trial project.
The SLIM Intrastat working party has proposed to simplify this nomenclature and better tailor it to the real needs of the user without adversely affecting the link with the nomenclature for the transport of goods with third countries, or the connection with other statistical nomenclatures.
In fact, this proposal was carried by representatives of professional organisations and by companies alike because they themselves have contributed to the effect of the recommendations.
Indeed, the simplification must first and foremost benefit small and medium-sized companies.
The number of codes is restricted and, as such, the classification and codification of goods by companies is simplified without them needing to take any special measures.
This proposal, along with all other measures to simplify the system, can only benefit industry.
The European Community could take the initiative here and propose at international level that the set-up of the harmonised system be reviewed and better tailored to the needs of international trade in the 21st century.
Finally, I would like to inform you that a tripartite consultation, held over the course of three meetings by the European Parliament delegation, finally led to a compromise during the meeting of the Conciliation Committee.
The report was adopted unanimously without amendments within the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
I would, accordingly, be indebted to the MEPs if they were to cast a unanimous vote on this tomorrow.
Madam President, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, I would like to very much welcome Mr Beysen's report and also to thank him for the very clear and concise way he has presented the text.
We entirely support his proposal to push this through without any amendments.
Why are we supporting this so strongly?
Anything in today's world that is going to simplify life for businesses without, as Mr Beysen points out, affecting some of the key business statistical information they need to plan their businesses has to be welcome.
As someone who has founded and started small businesses himself, it is a very frustrating thing when you are trying to manage a business to be asked to fill in statistical returns, taking resources from your business that you could well be using on developing new sales and moving your business forward.
Reading Mr Beysen's report, the history of this proposal is rather depressing.
I was not in the last Parliament, and it is clear that Parliament has put a lot of work into this, but it has taken three years to get to the point where we are now.
It may well be that Mr Beysen's report hides a deceptively complex set of variables that the Commission has had to deal with.
Nevertheless, it seems to me that if we are going to make serious progress on slimming down legislation, making the environment for small businesses better - and that after all is an aim of the Lisbon Summit, we have seen that - we must get better at approaching these sort of projects.
So, I would like you to assure us this evening that you are making a serious effort to move more quickly in this area; and also, given the benefits of new technology moving forward in this area, with many more business-to-business transactions being handled electronically, more business-to-government transactions being handled electronically, that you are planning to exploit that technology in such a way that statistics can in future be collected automatically. Both more reliably and automatically and also, as Mr Beysen says, "internationally as well".
The final area, Commissioner, is to look at ways in which we can work with you as a Parliament to speed up the approval of the process.
Surely it should not be taking this amount of time to work on largely technical areas.
Mr Beysen was talking about the way that Parliament has been working internationally on some of these issues.
Surely we should be setting our own house in order first.
If you want a special committee within the Internal Market Committee to look at small business issues, simplification issues and statistical issues, then ask us to work with you and for heaven's sake let us not have to consider these proposals again when we had to wait three years to make serious inroads into what ought to be a comparatively simple area of progress.
Madam President, I would like thank all the speakers and especially Mr Beysen for his work.
In 1997, the Commission presented proposals for the simplification of the basic regulations for the Intrastat system, reducing the list of variables to be introduced into declarations and also simplifying the nomenclature of the products used for exchanges.
It is true that each time a simplification of this type is produced, we have a debate between, on the one hand, the necessary reduction in administrative charges to reduce the cost to companies and, on the other, the lack of information resulting from reducing this information.
At the time, the Council reached an agreement on the basis of the Commission' s proposals by amending them, and Parliament is reaching a solution which in our view is an intelligent and practical way to partially resolve this contradiction.
We are happy to accept Parliament' s proposal and we believe that the idea of reducing the number of products exchanged to ten, only indicating the country of origin or destination of the products and their value, may be a good way of resolving the difficulties which I referred to earlier.
You also ask us to analyse the change of threshold from EUR 100 000 to EUR 200 000, which would exclude a greater number of companies from the obligation to present statistical declarations.
As I said before, we consider the work of Parliament' s committee to be excellent and we therefore support and accept it totally.
I would like to congratulate them on their work.
However, you have raised a couple of issues.
Firstly, Mr Harbour asks how the process can be speeded up.
The Commission is not concern about the delay.
We are prepared to accelerate the process as far as possible and we are interested in reducing the cost to companies to a minimum.
Nevertheless, we must recognise that we have two problems which we must address in a different way.
Firstly, with regard to the selection of the ten most relevant products for the purposes of the declaration, that will have to be done by means of the normal comitology procedures.
However, we hope that excessive time will not be required in order to arrive at these results.
Secondly, the increase in the threshold from EUR 100 000 to EUR 200 000 is a problem which requires the necessary cooperation of the Member States, which is already under way, and as soon as we have the opinions of the different Member States, we will be able to make the specific proposal which will allow us to apply this increased exemption.
Lastly, Mrs Berger asks us which additional initiatives we are going to take.
You have said correctly that this is a first step for us.
We believe that it is essential to go further with this process of simplification.
I can therefore state that we are committed - as we have already said publicly - to continuing with the SLIM and Intrastat initiatives and, above all, with the Edicom actions in favour of companies, bearing in mind that the Council has approved the report on information needs which are essential for economic and monetary union.
I cannot give you a specific date for the new proposals, but I can assure you that we are working on them and that Parliament and the Council will receive the new proposals from the Commission as soon as we have the basic information from the Member States.
Before we start with the order of business, there are still a number of points of order.
Mr President, with regret I have to inform the House of the arrest yesterday in Moscow of Vladimir Alexandrovich Gusinsky, chief executive of the Most-Media group of television, radio and newspaper outlets.
Mr Gusinsky is a leading Russian community leader, being chairman of the Russian Jewish Congress and deputy chairman of the World Jewish Congress.
This morning he is in what is known as a general purpose cell in Butyrsky prison where conditions are such that they must be left to your imagination.
Mr Gusinsky's media activities were the only ones permitted to criticise Mr Putin and his government.
His independent television is the only one that questions the behaviour of Russian troops in Chechnya.
His programme Dolls, based on Britain's Spitting Image, satirises the President, something which supposedly causes him great irritation.
His radio station Moscow Echo was selected by President Clinton a few days ago for the only substantive interview that he gave to a Russian outlet.
On 11 May Mr Gusinsky's places of work were raided by so-called tax police - men in ski masks and camouflage outfits carrying Kalashnikov rifles.
There are few Russians who do not see a connection between Gusinsky's criticisms and the heavy-handed treatment now being meted out to him.
Now we have this arrest and Mr Putin says he knows nothing about it.
This latest event leaves Russia teetering on the brink.
Either Mr Putin backs down and releases Mr Gusinsky, or we shall have to conclude that Russia's brave attempt to establish a free press has turned out a failure and their democracy an illusion.
The consequences of this will be devastating. It will mean goodbye Council of Europe, goodbye Partnership for Peace, farewell Tacis and a warm welcome to a new arms race.
The European Parliament must do what it can to avert this catastrophe.
I ask you, Mr President, to confer with your colleagues so that the whole range of EU-Russia relations can be investigated, debated and our influence brought to bear not least on the turbulent Mr Putin, who is putting us all in danger.
Thank you.
As you can hear from the applause, the House has taken note of your comment.
- (NL) Mr President, I would like to bring up another point.
Not only yesterday, but also a few months ago, every month really, permits are granted to the presidency or other nationalities to organise receptions.
These then degenerate into all-out bingeing sessions, at which point the cameras start to roll.
I think, Mr President, that that is unworthy of Parliament.
What I would like to ask through you is that these kinds of festivity be regulated properly.
I think that we can no longer afford this kind of behaviour.
I am surprised that permission is granted for this kind of thing, because my request to set up an exhibition for the handicapped, organised by myself, was turned down last week by the same College of Quaestors.
My request was looked upon critically, whereas these kinds of party, where we are portrayed as vultures, are simply tolerated.
I would ask you to raise this matter with the College of Quaestors in order to put a stop to this, as this is beneath us all.
Madam, please be so kind as to file your concern in writing with the Quaestors, who will then take the necessary steps.
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
Mr President, I have been studying yesterday' s Minutes and I have noted that Elmar Brok, MEP, has not mentioned that there might be grounds for his disqualification when voting on the report on digital television, although he has indicated in the register containing information on Members' secondary occupations that he is senior vice-president in a company called 'Media Developments Bertelsmann' .
In my opinion, this matter should be discussed in Parliament.
I have not quite understood the honourable member.
Are you saying that he did or did not vote?
According to the translation, he did not vote and if he did not vote on a matter which is pertinent, then he behaved correctly.
Mr President, I have been reading the Minutes and it does not say here that he would not have voted.
We shall clarify the matter.
(Parliament approved the Minutes)
Mr President, I have taken the floor simply to tell you that I have been in contact with Mr Murphy, the rapporteur of this report, and we have agreed that it would be better to proceed to the vote without debating the report.
What you have suggested is most unusual, because normally this is decided when the order of business is adopted.
If reports have been entered on the order of business with a debate then, having consulted the Rules of Procedure, I see no way of removing them from the order of business.
I suggest that we keep to the chosen procedure with debate.
I now have another statement to make.
Yesterday Mr Lannoye moved to ...
(Interruption by Mr Brok)
Mr Brok, we have moved on to another point.
If it is about what the honourable member said earlier, I shall gladly give you the floor afterwards so that you can make a personal statement.
Now if you would be so kind as to take your seat, that would ease the tension somewhat.
Yesterday Mr Lannoye moved to table the motion by 185 members to set up a temporary committee of inquiry into ECHELON in accordance with Rule 151 of the Rules of Procedure, which was rejected by a majority at the Conference of Presidents' meeting on 13 April, for a resolution by Parliament.
The President has informed me that the Conference of Presidents is due to discuss the question of setting up a temporary committee again tomorrow.
I am sure the honourable member agrees that it makes sense to wait for the results of this discussion before tabling the matter before plenary.
It makes no material difference, a vote will he held anyway, the question is merely whether it will be during this plenary session or the next.
Mr President, I do not know if the problem lies in the wording, but this does not appear to answer the question I was asking.
In fact, on tomorrow' s agenda, the Conference of Presidents has tabled its proposal for the establishment of a temporary committee, not a committee of inquiry.
This, however, is not the issue: what I am asking for is a vote on the decision by the Conference of Presidents, with the motion that there should not be a committee of inquiry.
There is another motion, but that is not it.
You have therefore not answered my question.
I believe I have because, as far as the procedure is concerned, we have two options.
First, we can vote separately on the question of setting up a temporary committee and the question of setting up a committee of inquiry.
We can do that separately and at different times.
But the Rules of Procedure do not require us to proceed in this way.
The motion, therefore, is to vote on both questions jointly as a package and that is our second option.
I cannot see that it will prejudice the idea of a committee of inquiry, which is what you want, if we merge the votes and the whole issue takes another three weeks.
It makes no material difference; at some point the House will have to state its view.
I repeat: it would be possible, but the President suggests that we proceed differently and I suggest likewise to you now.
Mr President, I think that it is quite reasonable to propose two votes at the same time, but I insist that there should be two votes: firstly, a vote on the principle of establishing a committee of inquiry, which was rejected by the Conference of Presidents, and there may have to be a second vote if agreement is reached on establishing a temporary committee, which, I must point out, serves a quite different purpose.
These are two different problems and a close look at the Rules of Procedure will show that Rule 151 does not provide for a temporary committee: it only mentions a committee of inquiry.
I feel that the plenary is within its rights to state its opinion on the position adopted by the Conference of Presidents.
Mr Lannoye, that goes without saying!
The Rules of Procedure are crystal clear: if the requisite number of signatures is collected, then a vote must be held in plenary following the decision of the Conference of Presidents, otherwise it would mean that the Conference of Presidents decides whether or not to set up a committee of inquiry rather than plenary.
And, of course, that is not how it works.
There may be one or two people in the Conference of Presidents who believe that it is, but they are labouring under a misapprehension!
(Heckling, interjection by Mr Poettering)) Mr Poettering says no-one believes that and so your problem is solved!
Mr President, I have taken the floor in order to support the request and I am satisfied with your response.
At last, tomorrow afternoon, the Conference will give a response to this request which has been signed by so many Members.
I have taken note of the honourable member' s comment.
Decision on urgent procedure
The next item is the vote on the motion for urgent procedure with regard to the proposal for a Council Regulation [COM(1999) 576 - C5-0280/1999 - 1999/0236(CNS)] amending Regulation (EEC) No 1251/1999 establishing a support system for producers of certain arable crops to include flax and hemp grown for fibre and the proposal for a Council Regulation [COM(1999) 576 - C5-0281/1999 - 1999/0237(CNS)] on the common organisation of the market in flax and hemp grown for fibre.

These proposals were addressed in Mrs Schierhuber' s report, on which the final vote on 16 May was postponed in accordance with Rule 69 (2) of the Rules of Procedure. The matter was referred back to committee.
Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf has the floor for the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture, as the committee responsible.
.
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as far as Parliament and the Commission are concerned, this regulation raises three issues: first, how to prevent abuse of the aid scheme for flax and hemp, because there have been very significant irregularities under the regulation in the past; secondly, how to ensure that flax and hemp, both of which are impressive, renewable raw materials with a strong ecological and social impact, can continue to be cultivated in the EU.
And thirdly, we need to protect, consolidate and promote the burgeoning processing industry in this area, an industry producing smart, ecologically valuable, biological degradable products.
So we agree on the objectives, but we do not agree on how to achieve them, which is why Parliament has postponed the final vote on this report and is currently negotiating with the Commission.
Considerable progress has been made towards consensus and a compromise has been reached on numerous points.
We met again yesterday but did not finish editing the compromises and proposed compromises.
This motion for urgency tabled by the Council or the presidency is therefore premature and we propose therefore that it be rejected for the time being.
We assume that we will have reached a compromise which can be tabled by July and plenary will then be able to vote on it in July.
I should like to reiterate my express thanks in this connection to the Commission and Commissioner Fischler, who has been most cooperative in this matter.
I hope that we shall also be able to take account in this proposal of the fact that the Commission is keen for us to table and complete this procedure this year.
Thank you.
The chairman of the Committee on Agriculture has tabled a procedural motion.
According to the Rules of Procedure, one member may speak for and one member may speak against the motion.
Mrs Schierhuber has asked to speak.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen. I agree wholeheartedly with the motion tabled by the chairman of the Committee on Agriculture.
He has outlined the matter quite clearly.
I, for my part as rapporteur, should like expressly to thank the Commission for its willingness to negotiate.
As you know, we still have no co-decision in agriculture, hence the two informal meetings, both of which lasted over an hour.
We reached a consensus on a great many points and the Commission too was willing to compromise.
Unfortunately, we have no written documents on which we can really vote and pass resolutions, which is why I support the motion to reject urgency for the time being.
As no one wishes to speak against the motion, we shall pass to the vote.
(Parliament rejected the request for urgent procedure.)
President.
Before we start on the order of business, Mr Brok has the floor for a personal statement.
Mr President, allow me a brief personal comment.
My professional activities are entered in the presidents' register in accordance with the rules of the European Parliament and I have conducted myself over the last eight years on that basis.
I have never taken any parliamentary action on matters which bear directly on my corporate interests and have refrained from voting on such matters, despite the fact that I am not obliged to do so.
For the rest, there has been no occasion on which my voting conduct might be interpreted as representing indirect interests or on which I have departed from the opinion of my group.
I therefore refute what Mr SeppÃ€nen has said.
President.
Mr Korakas on a point of order.
Mr President, we shall shortly be debating Mrs LalumiÃšre' s motion for a resolution on European security and defence.
It is an important proposal and we each have an opinion on it; however, I think that, if we are to hold a proper debate on this important issue, we should have received the amendments in time.
We requested the amendments this morning between 8 and 8.30 and they were not available.
This means that, when the time comes to vote on these amendments, we shall be unable to debate them first.
Because this also happens with other debates, I should like to ask for measures to be taken so that we receive amendments in time, before reports are debated in plenary.
Our services tell me that the honourable member is right and that there was a delay in distributing the documents because the deadline was set so late.
But as we are not due to vote until Thursday, I think that there is some justification for holding the debate nonetheless.
But basically you are right and we shall make an effort to distribute the documents earlier in future.
European political parties
The next item is the joint debate on the following oral questions:
(B5-0488/00) by Mr Poettering on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, Mr BarÃ³n Crespo on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, Mr Cox on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democratic and Reform Party and Mr Lannoye on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance to the Commission on European political parties;
(B5-0494/00) by Mr Pasqua on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group to the Commission on political parties at European level.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to submit seven considerations on this important issue.
First: in 1991, the European heads of state and government expressly recognised the importance of European political parties in Article 138a of the Treaty of Amsterdam, guided by the idea that full-blown democracy in the European Union cannot be achieved without solidly-funded European political parties set on a reliable legal basis.
Secondly: next year will mark the tenth year without any material progress with the legal status of European political parties or life breathed into the Treaty.
The group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats deeply regrets this.
Thirdly: we would remind the House of the important preliminary work carried out in the Tsatsos report adopted in 1996 and the Kuhne report of 13 April 2000.
Other reports by the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control, the most recent being the Ferber report, have also indicated the urgent need for a European party statute and for this matter to be regulated.
Fourthly: we therefore welcome the fact that the Commission is prepared to advocate an addendum to Article 191 of the EC Treaty on European political parties and thank President Prodi, Commissioner Barnier and the College as a whole for treating this concern with the importance which it deserves.
It is this which will enable a solution to be found.
We hope that the wording selected will allow the Commission to finalise a European party statute quickly, not set the majority requirements in the Council too high and respect full co-decision for the European Parliament.
Fifthly: we also welcome the fact that the European Commission obviously also confirms the possibility, if my information is correct, of proceeding on the basis of Article 308.
The possibilities offered by Article 308 must be used if and insofar as the Treaty is not supplemented.
Nonetheless, we take the firm view that supplementing the Treaty is the best way forward.
Sixthly: the chairmen of the four largest groups in the European Parliament, i.e. the group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats, the Group of the Party of European Socialists, the Group of the European Liberal, Democratic and Reform Party and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance submitted a proposal for the core elements of a European party statute several months ago, in agreement with the chairmen of the party federations and the Commission, thereby demonstrating that this problem should and could be solved within a broad political consensus.
We are confident that other groups which do not yet have their own European party can be included in this consensus.
Seventh and lastly: we are also aware that, until such time as a European party statute enters into force, we need transitional rules regulating and limiting support for European political parties by groups in the European Parliament and we are prepared to take a broad initiative here which crosses the group divide.
We want to promote the emancipation of European political parties from the groups still further and open up future prospects for them and our main concern is to see European political parties become a major vehicle for European political work.
We want to give them this opportunity and we want, above all, to ensure that, in all aspects of support for European political parties, we have a transparent situation and clear legal conditions which can be presented as such to the public.
This will serve the credibility not only of the parties but also of the European Union and the European Parliament.
Mr President, Commissioner, I agree with the words of chairman Poettering on this joint initiative and, if you will allow me, I would like first of all to remind you that ten years ago we achieved jointly - on that occasion we were the Christian Democratic Party, the Liberals and the Socialists - the inclusion in the Treaty of Maastricht of the article recognising the personality of the political parties.
It fell to me at that time to negotiate its inclusion with President of the Council Lubbers and I would like to pay tribute to him because I believe that it was an important step.
We could have chosen to pose the question in reverse, that is to say, why, when the Commission had the monopoly on initiative for ten years, did it not take any step to regulate such an important issue?
However, we are taking a constructive view.
We want to resolve this problem which is not just a question of a legal vacuum but a constitutional problem for the European Union.
The current situation is becoming increasingly complicated.
It was traditionally believed in the media that it was necessary to go 'lobbying' in Brussels, to behave like a pressure group.
We managed to have the political parties recognised. In our countries they are a fundamental pillar of democracy.
Nevertheless, in ten years, no progress has been made and we truly find ourselves in an increasingly difficult situation.
We could go so far as to say that at least 75% of the Members of this House are affiliated to organisations which are not clandestine, certainly, but do not have legal status, and demands are continually being made of us, which we try to respect and comply with, by the Court of Auditors, a key institution within the European Union, but which must not be the institution which in reality establishes the legal framework.
We believe that it is absolutely essential, in order to ensure that it is the democracy of the people and not the power of money, which prevails in the Union, that the Commission should exercise its power of initiative responsibly at the moment.
We have made certain useful suggestions so that we may find our way out of a situation which is not only unsatisfactory but also negative for the development of democracy in Europe.
Mr President, the essentials have been covered, but I should like to reiterate the point that the right to propose legislation rests with the Commission.
We have taken an initiative across the various political groups, which we presented in February to President Prodi.
As a matter of law there has been a reference to political parties in the Treaty for more than seven years now.
It states that the parties are a factor for integration, they contribute to the formation of European awareness and are a vital element in the democratic life of the Union and the political debate of the Union.
However, like several of the rather aspirational articles in the Treaties, Article 191, the article referred to, lacks a certain operational content.
The question is: can the Commission take an initiative which breathes life and operational content into the aspirations of Article 191?
That really is what the debate is about in this House today.
I share the concern of other speakers that the reports of the Court of Auditors - which, by the way, we fully anticipated in this House several years ago with the report of Professor Tsatsos, which pointed out the urgent necessity of validating parties in statutory terms - adds a new urgency.
The institutions must be able to deliver accountability and transparency.
This House does not have the right to draft legislation: that is the exclusive preserve of the Commission.
We are asking for your assistance to ensure that this vital element, as the Treaty states, in the democratic life and political debate of the Union is validated by statute.
Mr President, my Group has also been involved in submitting this motion to the Commission, simply on the basis that we are creating a Europe that is undergoing integration, but it is not at all clear that our citizens will be able to have a say in this merging Europe and keep pace with the advance of integration.
I do not want to say that the political parties are the only, or even necessarily, the most important channel whereby the public can have a say in matters that currently affect society, but they play a part, and the status of the European parties must be defined without delay.
Just as my colleagues have said, these parties must be brought out into the light of day.
They are, in any case, already active today.
They cannot replace the national parties, but cooperation among national parties is no longer necessarily enough.
It is important that we agree on fully open and transparent financing when the European parties are defined.
It is, for example, very important that accurate information is available concerning their sources of income, and the financing of elections is of particular importance in this respect, since money must not determine success in elections.
My Group does not merely intend that we should acquire in this way a funding channel for the European parties, but what is most important is that there will now be the opportunity to define those basic principles on which the European parties can function.
We must take the view that they must respect fundamental democratic rights, human rights and the principle of the rule of law when they function.
The time perhaps has come to specify that only European parties such as these may enjoy public support.
If the legal basis is vague, we agree with the request for the Commission to take an initiative to make it clearer, and the Intergovernmental Conference must also take responsibility for this.
Mr President, according to the Treaty, parties which contribute to informing the citizens about events which take place within the Union and the European Parliament are political parties, and therefore, by their political activities, they contribute to the development of a European awareness and European knowledge.
But what is European awareness?
It may be that the Treaties are not sufficiently clear on this subject, seeing that they do not mention the rights of the disabled and they do not provide enough protection for children and babies, who are nowadays particularly affected by widespread paedophilia in Europe.
European consciousness is that which must contribute to the development of mutual respect, which must prevent one culture prevailing over another, and which must ensure that tolerance is not confused with laxity and an absence of rules and laws and that laws and rules are not made with the intention of protecting some and not others.
The European culture is born of respect for our national cultures and national traditions.
New elements are integrated, but this must not lead to a situation where one category of individuals dominates to the detriment of another.
The citizens of the Union need greater protection of their rights, economic and otherwise, in the face of a world market which is becoming increasingly dominated by the interests of multinationals and of a world market created, one might say, to serve political as well as other purposes.
Therefore, European parties are not those parties which, to further party interest, have the same acronym in different countries, but those parties whose common ideals, values and programmes lead them to unite within groups and to work together to give the citizens a louder voice and greater representativity
So, Ã  la Voltaire, if you want to talk to me, lay down the rules now.
We have to clarify whether the European parties are something that we want to develop now, something different which will overlap with the national parties, that is if we desire cultural and political globalisation to follow economic globalisation - which would bring total uniformity - or whether we want, effectively, to build a Europe in which parties with the same affinities and ideals can work together at European level.
European parties, let us not kid ourselves!
Before hearing the speakers for the groups, I would like to give the floor to Commissioner Barnier.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my Group chairman has tipped me the wink and I am able to say on behalf of our group, the PPE-DE, that we fully support and welcome the Commission' s explanations in reply to the oral question, as regards both what was said and the timetable and legal evaluation.
Secondly: I am also delighted that we are again stepping up the political debate on the party statute, the pressure of time in the run up to the final stage of the intergovernmental conference notwithstanding.
This is not just a question of money.
This is also a question of political self-awareness, a question of political identity, a question of the role of national and European parties in the unification process.
We want a stronger European Parliament and that means reducing unanimity and increasing the co-decision powers of the European Parliament.
But a stronger European Parliament depends on strong groups in Parliament which have the authority to act.
We want a strong Commission which drives the European integration process forward.
One of the ways in which this is expressed is by lobbying for the President' s function to be strengthened and through parliament' s proposals to the intergovernmental conference.
We want a statute for European political parties because our democracy is a civil and party-political parliamentary democracy.
But we must not underestimate the psychological importance of this debate.
At present people and national parties are elected.
We want, as we have stated in the proposal to the intergovernmental conference, members on European lists to be elected because we want to raise the European political profile of members further still.
The proposal was touched on at the intergovernmental conference.
I readily admit that we want European lists and European members of parliament.
The proposals have been made; it all depends on the European party statute.
The report by the Court of Auditors containing demands on the groups was also touched on.
We shall comply with these demands.
My group started taking steps in this direction even before the Court of Auditors' report in order to clarify this transparency and this division.
But it cannot work against the European parties because that would represent a reduction in our European self-awareness.
That is also why the party statute is one of the conditions which needs to be put in place so that we can in fact quickly do what is demanded of us and what we demand of ourselves.
Mr President, I take good note of Commissioner Barnier' s statement and the commitment which the Commission is making.
Please allow me to express, not a criticism, but surprise in relation to the unassailable legal basis.
The Union Treaty, at that time signed by the twelve Heads of State and Government and ratified by all the parliaments of the Member States with the approval of the European Parliament, which recognises citizenship, is not, it appears, a sufficient legal basis.
This surprises me because to be associated with a political party is a fundamental right for citizens and, while our citizenship is recognised, that right is not.
We did not manage to have this included in the Treaty of Amsterdam.
The Commission is behaving gingerly and takes this approach: two stages, almost three stages, according to the Commissioner.
I understand that the proposal relating to the tripartite dialogue and stemming from Article 308 is a provisional proposed legislative provision and the best laws, at least in my country, are provisional laws, which are the ones which have lasted the longest.
This would allow us to end this current situation of a lack of legal status, and I take good note of this and I believe we should work in that direction.
The second step is the amendment of the Treaties.
I believe I can say that we all support it, but the important thing at the moment is, firstly, the existence of a public commitment by the Commission to exercise its right to initiative, a common will to consolidate a fundamental dimension for European citizenship and contribute immediately to the political parties beginning not only to exist in reality, but also to be legally recognised, because I believe that this is an important step towards the construction of European democracy.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I naturally concur with Mrs Hautala' s views on transparency.
I would also like to thank the Commissioner for his proposal in which we will be given the opportunity to exchange ideas here with Parliament which is, after all, eminently suited to express its opinion on this matter.
But what we need is an initiative - albeit hopelessly overdue - from the Commission.
After all, for the past twenty years, we at the European Free Alliance have been bringing together political parties which want to help build Europe on the basis of a diversity of cultures, peoples and regions.
In this connection, we have always attempted to stand up for the small and the weak, who cannot represent themselves in this big Parliament but whose concerns we are trying to take into consideration.
Up to now, it has been impossible to do this fully transparently, because there has been no clarity with regard to the European parties' expenditure and revenue, among other things.
But there are questions left unanswered concerning the future too.
It has not yet been mentioned here, Commissioner, but I would like to raise the question nevertheless.
Will the European democratic parties which in future appoint themselves as European parties only be supported if they stand for the values on which Europe is built?
This seems a rhetorical question to me.
I hope that the Commission can give me a clear answer to it.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are totally opposing views on European political parties within my group.
The main question raised is the extent to which they can actually represent a European public.
Direct links with people exist not at a pan-European, but at national or regional level.
That is where the parties are anchored, that is where their members and electorate are.
The situation is in fact quite paradoxical.
First, there are European parties.
Secondly, there is Article 191, which states that European political parties are an important factor for integration.
Thirdly, at the same time, we still have no idea what European political parties actually are.
On 12 December last year, the chairmen of the Party of European Socialists, the European People' s Party, the Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party and the European Free Alliance and the secretary-general of the European Federation of Green Parties themselves stated in a joint declaration that clarification was needed as to what a European party is.
Now I am convinced that, outside this House, no-one, to all intents and purposes, can comprehend or understand this.
Plus, the parties tend to take themselves very seriously.
It is not by chance that citizens - and not just in my country - are highly sceptical about things such as party memberships.
When they commit, it is mainly in civil initiatives, non-governmental organisations and various structures within the civil society.
I have nothing against European parties.
I think that they face the challenge of achieving cross-border coordination of their work during the course of integration.
But one thing is unacceptable and that is a situation in which European parties exist and receive funding but are still undefined.
The criticism of the Court of Auditors was justified.
I should like to close by saying that I too am in favour of finding a solution to this muddle.
But the solution must include treating political democratic forces in Europe equally, including those which define themselves otherwise and which, for example, are critical of the EU, and not excluding them from this problem-solving process.
Mr President, I would first of all, perhaps specifically for the benefit of the German delegates, insofar as they still care about respecting the rule of law, like to remind you of the judgement by the German Constitutional Court of Karlsruhe, in which the European Union is unambiguously defined as a confederacy, and hence the opposite of a federal state.
In fact, this vision of the European Union is also held by the large majority of citizens of our Member States for whom our Union is a close partnership of free peoples and states which very clearly respects the principle of subsidiarity.
In the light of this, the project of European political parties is the umpteenth fundamentally undemocratic project because it can only widen the enormous chasm which exists between the electorate on the one hand and European political decision-making on the other.
But this is apparently the price which some, hiding behind a mask of rhetoric, are willing to pay here in order to channel even more of the taxpayers' money to already excessive party funds.
It is also a project of people who are hoping to create the European federal superstate.
Indeed, these people are trying to attain their goal, the undemocratic federal superstate, by guile, and seize upon a variety of issues, including monetary union, the unified statute for MEPs and the possible accession of countries which are not even geographically situated in Europe, such as Turkey, to help them reach that goal.
In a European Union which really respects the principle of subsidiarity, we do not need a European political party.
Anyone who has different ideas about Europe or who would like to increase the pompe afrique, the money pump from the taxpayer to the European political parties, should have the courage to stand up and speak out, but you are lacking this courage.
Mr President, I am a strong supporter of cooperation between peoples.
Many problems can only be solved jointly.
Global problems must be solved in the UN.
The court here in Strasbourg can support us in connection with human rights.
In Brussels, we have close economic cooperation between the EU and the EEA in connection with a common market.
Would we obtain better solutions, however, if decision-making were, in every conceivable case, to be centralised in Brussels?
Would we obtain better democracy by downgrading the national parties and raising the profile of common supranational parties?
Would more people join, become active members and take part in debates in connection with elections and decision-making?
Supranational EU parties are an artificial product which will never be financed through voluntary subscriptions but only by siphoning off EU funds.
We are familiar with the pattern from many national parties which have distanced themselves from the electorate and instead allow themselves to be financed by the State, business and the unions.
It is quite right that the State should support parliamentary work and provide citizens with information. It must not, however, be a propaganda machine for the view of the majority.
To quote Grundtvig, doyen of the public education movement in Denmark, there must be 'freedom for Loki as well as for Thor' .
The supranational EU parties will never win the hearts and minds of ordinary people.
They will instead be populated by highly paid officials bound to no country in particular - bureaucrats without roots in local political associations.
Manifestos will be written by small groups of experts out of touch with the lives of real people.
An artificial product of that kind does not deserve financial support from the EU.
My group will vote against subsidies for supranational EU parties and against bending the Treaty by using flexible clauses for that purpose.
Mr President, this is a question of democracy.
Democracy is transparency, public accessibility, rule by the people, and participation.
The current European political parties do not represent transparency or public accessibility.
It is a rhetorical question, but who of us knows anything about the European political parties?
The only certainty is that some groups in the European Parliament have given financial support to the Europarties, contrary to the regulations concerning parliamentary funds.
They have been discovered in the investigations conducted by the Court of Auditors.
I suspect these abuses are now being covered up.
The European political parties do not represent democracy.
They are parties of parties and that means that the public does not have the opportunity to participate directly in their activities.
For rule by the nation, you need a nation.
Europe is not a nation; it is nations.
We have no concept of supranational democracy.
Now, supranational rules and regulations for Europarties controlled by the big countries are being drawn up, with the Commission' s support, by the big parties in the big countries.
Parties of parties are not democracy.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
Security and defence
The next item is the joint debate on the following oral questions:
(B5-0315/2000) by Mr Brok on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy to the Council on the European Common Security and Defence Policy in view of the European Council meeting in Feira;
(B5-0475/00) by Mr Brok on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy to the Commission on the European Common Security and Defence Policy in view of the European Council meeting in Feira.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the fact that we are already able to discuss this issue here today and I should like to start by saying that I consider this, to all intents and purposes, to be the first reading of the LalumiÃšre report, because Mrs LalumiÃšre has invested a great deal of expertise and work in this project.
We must stress that, after Amsterdam, Cologne and Helsinki, a great deal of progress has been made in developing the foreign, security and defence policy and we would like to thank the Council and the Commission for making this progress possible in these areas.
It is the result of our understanding that a disaster such as we have witnessed in the Balkans must never happen again.
We must guarantee that Europe has the authority to act in the area of foreign, security and defence policy, the authority which allows us to safeguard our interests jointly; however, at the same time, we must make it clear that this is not an alternative to the transatlantic alliance.
This development complements NATO, which will continue to remain responsible for collective security in Europe.
We as the European Parliament have already come to this conclusion by intensifying and institutionalising collaboration with the NATO parliamentary assembly.
We must realise that Amsterdam transferred the Petersberg tasks of the WEU to the European Union and that, as a result, practically all areas of the Western European Union now come under the responsibility of the European Union.
All that remains is Article 5.
I think this Intergovernmental Conference should consider whether Article 5 can be adopted in the form of a protocol to the EU Treaty and whether we should leave it to each Member State to take a sovereign decision as to whether or not it subscribes to this protocol.
This is surely a way for non-allied, neutral countries to find their own way as members of the European Union while, at the same time, allowing collaboration in practically all circumstances.
In the long run, this must be credibly sustained by the European Union.
We are a Union with our own legislation, which has resulted in our own legal system, and with our own interests based on the internal market and monetary union, which is why areas with different standards of security within the European Union must be a thing of the past.
This will surely help to develop a coherent foreign, security and defence policy.
We can see, precisely in Community matters, that the European Union has a plethora of instruments which are important for foreign and security policy, especially for civil crisis management, and that we are therefore able to provide more foreign aid than the United States Congress, that trade policy is the responsibility of the Commission and therefore that the nucleus of our potential to act is a Community remit and that we should not assign the development of a foreign, security and defence policy to intergovernmental collaboration.
The European Parliament will advocate bringing the Community position, the Community part to the fore.
We are of course delighted that we have a highly qualified High Representative in the person of Mr Solana, but it has always been the aim of the European Parliament in the long run to have a European foreign secretary incorporated into the Community area as part of the Commission.
This is unattainable at present for certain reasons, but we should strive towards it.
It is still our aim.
We can see that the Commission has a large stake and that foreign and security policy is being formulated in the European Council.
Defence is still a matter for national governments when it comes to equipment and similar questions.
This must be merged, including practically, so that such absurdities never occur again.
If we just think that today the foreign secretary of Kazakhstan will be received by fifteen foreign secretaries, the Commissioner responsible for foreign affairs and the High Representative, then I think this makes for wonderful Council meetings, but it is not a sign of any particular authority to act on the part of the European Union.
I think that we must speak up with one voice more loudly here and the Troika of Council President, High Representative and Commissioner for Foreign Affairs introduced in the Treaty of Amsterdam should first establish the Union' s authority to act; we should not have any other definitions in this area.
We must also ensure that this Treaty improves our decision-making mechanisms and we should not forget the huge shortcomings brought to light in the organisational disaster in Kosovo, which are the reason for the lack of an arms export policy and which have so far forestalled unity in the EU Treaty.
We must recognise the fact that we are squandering money in national budgets.
We spend more on defence than America, but with far fewer results.
This also applies to transport, satellites and such like.
According to the Treaty, this European Parliament is responsible for parliamentary control, including and especially of the Petersberg tasks, which is why the control function of the European Parliament must also be strengthened.
We shall also endeavour to bring about cooperation as well as collaboration with the foreign and defence policy committees of national parliaments in order to close gaps and cooperate with the parliaments of candidate and other countries.
But this European Parliament is named in the Treaty as the parliamentary controller of foreign, security and defence policy to the exclusion of all others.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, during Portugal' s Presidency of the European Union the development of the Common European Security and Defence Policy has been regarded as a priority, as is evident from the document which we presented at the beginning.
The report to be submitted to the European Council in Santa Maria da Feira will detail the progress made on the various mandates received in Helsinki. In particular it will cover the development of the European military capability, the headline goal, the institutional development of the permanent political and military bodies, the relations between the European Union and third countries in this area, the relations between the European Union and NATO, an indication of whether or not the EU Treaty needs to be revised and the problem of non-military crisis management mechanisms.
In the area of foreign policy and the Common European Security and Defence Policy, the EU has decided to develop the military and non-military dimensions in parallel.
We clearly must coordinate these two dimensions and particularly the military and non-military crisis management actions which the EU may decide to undertake.
This coordination will be carried out by the new structures of the Common Foreign and Security Policy, in particular by the Political and Security Committee, the future Military Committee and the Committee for Civilian Crisis Management.
I must point out that the interim bodies started work in March 2000 and that the Committee for Civilian Crisis Management was formally created during the Portuguese Presidency.
As will be evident from the Presidency' s report to the Feira European Council, an effort is being made to simultaneously develop the military and non-military crisis management capabilities. The Member States have already been working to develop the headline goal.
For example this was discussed yesterday at a meeting of the General Affairs Council attended by the Defence Ministers. The Feira European Council will also see the Member States make a commitment to develop their civil police capability by 2003, with up to 5 000 officers, for crisis management operations.
This represents a major effort by the Member States to ensure sustained and uniform development of these two dimensions which are fundamental for security and stability.
On another issue raised in Mr Brok' s question, I must say that strengthening the Common Foreign and Security Policy by developing a common European security and defence policy, thus allowing the EU to establish a military capability and also to reinforce the efficacy of its civilian crisis management mechanisms, does not necessarily require an increase in the defence budgets of the Member States.
Rather, the basic objective will be to improve the use and rationalisation of the military assets and capabilities of the Member States.
In this context it must be said that the European Union will use, in order to develop the headline goal, the NATO defence planning, the planning and review process for countries which are not members of NATO and the defence capabilities initiative which is ongoing within the Alliance.
Every effort is being made to ensure effective use of all the assets and capabilities and to avoid the duplication which could lead to additional defence costs.
No increase in the Community budget is planned as these efforts are to be implemented by the Member States in a context of voluntary cooperation.
A final answer on the budgetary impact of this policy may only be given, however, after the Commitment Capability Conference to be held in the autumn. This will analyse the national military contributions to this joint effort and the shortfalls which it may be considered necessary to meet.
As for the involvement of the European Parliament in this process, it should be recalled that the Common European Security and Defence Policy is a component of the Common Foreign and Security Policy.
The EU intends to make its foreign dimension more effective and credible by developing military and civilian crisis management capabilities.
Under Article 21 of the Treaty on European Union, Parliament shall be consulted by the Presidency on the main aspects and the basic choices of the Common Foreign and Security Policy.
The views of Parliament shall be taken into consideration by the Council.
The European Parliament shall also be kept regularly informed of the development of the Common Foreign and Security Policy and may ask the Council about aspects which it considers are important and may make recommendations which it deems appropriate.
The need to avoid unnecessary duplication and to make the best use of all the existing assets and capabilities also underlies the development of the Common European Security and Defence Policy.
It is therefore natural that the Member States have from the beginning advocated the transfer of WEU powers which could prove useful in the process now under way in the European Union.
Portugal, which holds the Presidency of the WEU, has tried to advance the process for transferring powers from the WEU to the European Union.
The Portuguese Presidency has therefore prepared a set of political and military concepts and procedures which, following the WEU Council of Ministers meeting in Oporto, will be transferred to the European Union. This constitutes a fundamental part of the acquis which must be preserved.
During our Presidency of the WEU, preparations for the process of transferring the Institute for Security Studies and the Satellite Centre of the WEU have also been started. This will occur during the next presidency.
The WEU has already taken the decision to allow the EU direct access to these structures.
Therefore, in accordance with the desire expressed by the Member States, the transfer of the Institute for Security Studies and the Satellite Centre will take place.
The transfer of powers from the WEU to the EU does not imply the end of the WEU; at least this is not the current aim of the Member States.
The amended Treaty of Brussels will remain in force without any further changes. This is why the collective defence mechanism specified in Article 5 will also remain in operation for the States which have signed this Treaty, as will the Parliamentary Assembly, which will continue to operate fully.
However, the whole organisational structure will be slimmed down. This will then simply provide support to a permanent council which will meet when necessary and to other structures which will continue to operate, in particular the Western Europe Armaments Group.
The budget for this organisation will also be substantially reduced.
The Common European Security and Defence Policy requires a close, intense and transparent relationship between the European Union and NATO.
The Portuguese Presidency has paid particular attention to developing ways of establishing this relationship, which must be based on cooperation, dialogue and transparency. However, it must not threaten the autonomy of these two organisations.
The report to be presented to the Feira European Council includes a document establishing the principles and terms of this relationship during this interim period.
Four ad hoc working groups involving the EU and NATO will be created on the following issues: security, European military capability, development of processes for transferring NATO assets and capabilities to operations led by the European Union and, finally, definition of the permanent terms of the relationship between the European Union and NATO.
If necessary, other working groups on specific issues may be created.
In its effort to develop the European military capability, the EU must take into account the need to maintain a relationship of cooperation, dialogue and consultation with European allies who are not members of the European Union and with the applicant countries.
It must be stressed that the headline goal defined in Helsinki is open to participation by these countries which may therefore contribute to the European force.
According to the document agreed by the European Union which will form an integral part of the Feira European Council report, a single and inclusive structure will be created in which the fifteen Member States of the European Union and the fifteen third countries will participate.
This structure will be responsible for dialogue, cooperation and consultation between these countries.
In view of the fundamental role of the six European allies who are not members of the European Union and also bearing in mind that NATO may provide assets and capabilities for operations led by the EU, meetings will take place within this single structure between the Fifteen and these six countries to discuss issues involving the development of the European military capability.
In the pre-crisis phase or rather at the start of a crisis, dialogue, cooperation and consultation will clearly be reinforced and, if the EU were to consider using NATO assets and capabilities, particular attention would be given to the dialogue, cooperation and consultation with the six European allies who are not members of the EU.
It must be stressed that, under the terms agreed in Helsinki, EU operations will in principle be open to participation by these countries.
Russia, Ukraine and other European countries may also participate in operations led by the European Union.
The French Presidency will be responsible for presenting the Nice European Council with proposals on the terms for the consultation and participation of these countries.
At the Feira European Council, the European Union will record the interest expressed by Canada in participating in this joint European effort.
Finally, in Helsinki the Portuguese Presidency was given the task of presenting the Feira European Council with an indication of whether or not the Treaty of Amsterdam needs to be revised.
From the debate conducted and the opinions expressed, it has been possible to conclude that the implementation of the EU decisions on the Common European Security and Defence Policy does not require the Treaty to be revised as this policy falls legally within the provisions currently in force.
However, as this is a process that is open to developments, the Member States have agreed on the need to keep an eye on this issue.
Mr President, I welcome this timely and useful debate, which was introduced characteristically and forcefully by my honourable friend, Mr Brok, in a thoughtful and useful speech.
I welcome the report by Mrs LalumiÃšre.
It is an exceptionally helpful document.
What it says about non-military crisis management provides us with a checklist, an action list of things we should be making sure are put in place over the next few years.
It is a very good report, and I would like to congratulate the honourable lady, without reservation, on what she has said.
The Commission has actively contributed to non-military crisis management since long before the Cologne and Helsinki Summits.
These summits have reminded us that there is an urgent need for our policies to become more ambitious, coherent and effective.
We need to improve our capacity for rapid and targeted action.
We need to step up our efforts of coordination.
We need to improve the availability of analysis and information exchange, and we need to radically enhance our capacities for pursuing preventive policies.
The creation of additional instruments, or the mobilisation of additional funding, does not, in my judgement, stand in the centre of current deliberations; nor are far-reaching Treaty changes required.
Instead, our focus lies on using existing instruments and financial resources considerably more efficiently.
Parliament knows the priority which the Commission and I attach to discharging our existing competencies a great deal more energetically and a great deal more competently than we have in the past.
That gives us a considerable agenda for the next few years.
I hope that we will have the support of Parliament in working through it.
We should build on existing competencies.
We should bring them to bear more effectively on the twin goals of conflict prevention and crisis management.
Saying 'no' to institutional revolution does not mean turning our backs on innovation.
The Commission recently tabled a proposal for the creation of a rapid reaction facility.
The limited funds we think are required for that facility will be found by redeployment within our existing budget.
I also believe that the idea to set up a European civil police corps merits careful examination through a feasibility study by the Council, as proposed in the relevant European Parliament resolution.
It is also plain that the Commission's lack of human resources for both conflict prevention and crisis management greatly impinges upon our capacity to make more rapid progress in this field, though that is something we are attempting at present to address.
Let me be clear about the Commission's role.
We are plainly not responsible for coordination of the military and civil components in crisis management.
What the Commission is trying to do is to ensure an effective and coherent Community input into the overall coordinated effort of the Union in this area.
I have spoken before about the impossibility of making a clear distinction, in preventing a crisis or in managing a crisis, between the military and the civil components.
The important thing is to recognise the relationship between the two.
Look at what the Commission is doing around the world: we are paying for the training of police in anti-terrorism tasks in Palestine.
We are helping to create border services in the Balkans.
We are spending money on de-mining in virtually every continent.
Those are the sorts of ways in which the Commission is contributing to preventative diplomacy and I hope that in future Europe will manage those tasks in a more coherent way.
This is not our first effort to create as it were a common foreign and security policy.
We had the Pleven plan.
We had de Gasperi.
We had Fouchet.
We had years of European political cooperation, during which there were lots of ringing declarations, perhaps slightly too many of them, some weeks after they could actually have any effect on events.
The decision taken at Maastricht, the decision taken at Amsterdam, the decision taken at Helsinki - they all mark a signal move forward, a recognition that we have not done enough in the past to ensure that Europe's voice is heard adequately around the world and that Europe's capacities to prevent and manage crises are brought to bear with sufficient competence and vigour.
This time we have to make a difference.
This time we have to ensure that a common foreign and security policy ensures that Europe discharges its responsibilities at the level which events require, at the level which our citizens now in my judgement demand.
We in the Commission want to play our full part in ensuring that this time a common foreign and security policy is a resounding success.
Mr President, the decisions made at the Helsinki European Council on the development of a common security and defence policy are open to interpretation.
Many aligned countries believe that the formation of a common military force would mean the start of a common defence arrangement.
Their plans are clear.
Under the treaties, the aim of a common foreign and security policy for the Union is to safeguard its independence and integrity, as well as strengthen its security in all its forms.
The military force to be established is, in their view, a tool to realise these aims: a common army for a Union that is becoming a federation.
In the opinion of the non-aligned Member States, only the creation of a system for crisis management has been decided upon.
They stress that each country should decide separately on its involvement.
They believe that they have no obligation to become involved in enforcing peace.
Non-aligned Member States do not want the Union to become a military alliance or military superpower.
These differences of opinion and interpretation must be taken into account.
It is also wise in security policy to establish differentiated integration.
Combined troops of the European Union should only be used for crisis management.
Countries which are part of the federal core, as proposed by Messrs Delors, Giscard d' Estaing, Schmidt and Fischer, could create a defence community, to form a strong European pillar within the context of NATO.
The understandable and commendable aim by the European NATO countries to develop a European defence identity should thus be realised within the context of NATO itself.
Decisions relating to security and defence policy are immensely important, and should therefore be made with the emphasis on openness and democracy.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is useful to remind ourselves and to realise that we are in the first round of many of a debate on European security.
This means that we have imposed a few restrictions on ourselves.
We are very much focusing on the Summit, the European Council of Feira, which is fine, but that means that we will not be covering a number of other issues which are vital to European security.
One such issue which we are not discussing today is the criteria for the deployment of this rapid reaction force.
I am sure that we will be discussing this issue following a further report by Mrs LalumiÃšre in due course, but in the meantime, we are subject to a few restrictions.
Despite these restrictions, we are able to pass a sound verdict now, in my opinion.
Let me start by making a positive comment.
A large part of the resolution is taken up by non-military crisis management, and this is very much how it should be, in my opinion.
The Commissioner spent quite a long time talking about this and I think he had every reason to.
According to my group, the EU has unique opportunities in this respect which, so far, have remained for the most part untapped.
Fortunately, there are also examples of how things can be done, for example, the Stability Pact, which is a mixture of economic reconstruction, promotion of human rights and the development of a civil society.
This is a good example of how, also in future, the Union will be able to use its nearly unlimited options in the field of non-military crisis management.
But military resources also form part of this package and, this may surprise some delegates, this is also largely backed by my group, albeit subject to a number of conditions.
I would like to specify two.
One is the EU' s say.
In my opinion, it should be crystal clear, and this is not included in the present texts, that the EU has autonomous power of decision and that the EU countries must be able to decide for themselves on their level of commitment, without needing permission from NATO - or should that be the US?
I would like to make one final point.
It cannot be the case that the new military resources which are required will be over and above the ones we have at the moment and that, as such, a new arms race would be created for military resources.
What is important is that the analysis and security policy are new.
This does not necessarily include more resources.
Mr President, there are matters which give rise to fundamental differences of opinion and this is obviously one of them.
You, Mrs LalumiÃšre, have obtained the backing of a large majority in committee and you will no doubt maintain this majority in plenary.
This majority confirms the quality of your work and the care which has gone into it.
But it also confirms how weak the critical voices have become.
I do not see this is a cause for celebration.
Even official threat analyses confirm that there is no military threat to the countries of western Europe.
Instead, scenarios such as the war in Kosovo or imaginary crises in the future, Islamic fundamentalism or, as in the German defence guidelines, even possible ecological threats are wheeled out in order to justify huge military spending.
It marks the capitulation of politics and of the intellect, when such problems are met with a military response.
Let me pick up on just one issue, an issue which figured at the centre of all the positions taken here today: the war in Kosovo.
I think that the Council, the Commission and we ourselves are drawing the wrong conclusions in principle from a war which was wrong in principle.
First, the violation of international law, as practised by NATO, and which, for the rest, still forms part of the official NATO military strategy, should not shape future security policy.
Secondly, I am convinced that the war against Yugoslavia could and should have been avoided with a consistent, preventive, long-term policy, especially as events over the last few days have again shown dramatically that its alleged or actual aim of safeguarding human and minority rights failed disastrously.
War, if anything, is the most unsuitable and most counter-productive method in this respect.
Finally, when it is again argued that the war in Kosovo demonstrated that the EU needs major military independence from the USA then, to my mind, this begs the conclusion that militarising international relations and security policy will increase, not reduce dependency on the USA.
Military is what the USA does best.
My group takes an opposing view in principle to the present prevalent European security policy on at least three counts.
First: the security policy template is a military, not a political, civil or cooperative one and the section on preventive and civil security policy cannot hide that fact.
It is interesting that military resolutions have been coming thick and fast since the Helsinki Summit while, to all intents and purposes, nothing has been done about a civil, cause-orientated security policy.
Secondly: we reject a European military block formation.
The only viable approach, in our view, is to restore the central role of the UNO for international security, reinforce the OSCE, design cooperative security concepts and radically disarm.
Thirdly: we are deeply concerned at how automatically demands are rejected which, until just recently, formed part of a broad political consensus, at least between Mrs LalumiÃšre and, for example, the positions represented in my group.
In all events, demands for an unequivocal declaration on the UN charter, defence of the ABM treaty, respect for the policy of neutrality of certain EU Member States or an increase in funds for peace education and peace studies failed to muster a majority in committee.
Germany has earmarked DM 17.5 million for civil conflict management projects this year.
I think it is a fairly typical figure.
It represents - and let me say this very slowly - 0.00029% of military spending.
I fear that this policy first creates crises which it then endeavours to control.
Which is why there is nothing left for us but to say a firm No.
Mr President, we take a different approach to the important point raised by our colleague, Mr Brok' s question to the Council.
This is an important issue, because, following the very serious crises that have struck the Balkans, the European Council, especially in its Cologne and Helsinki declarations of June and December 1999 and the Presidency, particularly in the two reports it has drawn up on the Union' s military and civilian resources for dealing with crisis situations, have demonstrated their intention to see the Union become more closely involved in the management of crises that threaten European security, interests and values.
A number of European Union Member States, but also non-members, may perceive such threats as common threats.
The issue of concern to us, then, is how we envisage establishing an intergovernmental process which deals with each country individually and which would allow all the States that wish to commit themselves, to actually do so and combine forces, while not forcing any State that does not so desire to take part against their will in a course of action of which it may not approve.
The organisation of this kind of intervention capability must not, however, be designed in ideological terms, as a factor to make political integration binding.
Such an approach would lead to failure.
It must be seen in terms of specific crisis situations which are likely to occur, whilst respecting the freedom and the will of each of our States.
Treating each case individually will enable us to do this and to establish a type of reaction that is appropriate to the type of crisis and in line with the will of the people.
Furthermore, the question of the financial resources allocated to the establishment of civilian and military capabilities which are likely to be united is obviously a crucial one.
It requires significant budgetary input and therefore a radical reversal of the trend that has been seen in most Member States, unlike the United States, since the end of the cold war.
It would be useful to know whether the Council feels that the upturn in growth in Europe is such as to favour this essential turnaround and how the Council intends to promote it.
Mr President, I am very grateful to the person who submitted the oral questions for creating the opportunity, before the Feira Summit, to debate the CFSP, which is shrouded in mystery.
Its lack of transparency is characterised by a multitude of initiatives and ever changing coalitions.
I would nonetheless like to try to make a few observations.
First of all, I wonder whether the creation of a European identity is backed by sound motives.
I would like to stress that we should not be guided by power motives.
If we only focus on a strong role for Europe on the world stage, then we have got it all wrong.
It is not about power, but about taking responsibility.
This cannot be done without joining forces with NATO as the latter has all the necessary resources available.
I should also like to warn against all too unrealistic expectations as far as cooperation between the Member States in this respect is concerned.
A realistic view of the current developments in Europe shows that paper declarations from St. Malo, Cologne and Helsinki have so far not been accompanied by real security guarantees.
The required "firm political commitment on the part of all Member States" of Paragraph 19 of the resolution is lacking.
These brief comments do not detract from the fact that it is important to include this subject on the IGC agenda.
We need plain agreements on competencies in this field.
And as far as we are concerned, these are still mainly within the national state.
Mr President, we must recognise that the progress that has been made in recent months in the field of security and defence policy originated from the informal Council of Defence Ministers in Sintra, which should be included on the list of successes of the Portuguese Presidency.
One of the many and complex problems involved in the development of this policy, which necessarily requires greater involvement by Finance Ministers and Defence Ministers, is the role and influence of the institutions.
At this initial stage, Mr President, Parliament should be more involved in the development of this policy.
We should be thinking about a parliamentary dimension for the common security and defence policy which includes the establishment of mechanisms necessary for Parliament to participate, with its corresponding institutional role, in the definition and the objectives of that policy.
Furthermore, the appropriate measures should be taken for the Parliament to exercise control over the security and defence policy and so that it is constantly and adequately informed of its tasks and of the provisional bodies which currently work in the service of the Council of Ministers of the European Union.
What I have just said with regard to Parliament, Mr President, is equally valid for the Commission.
The balance between the institutions should not be altered in the case of such an important question.
We should clarify the competencies of the Commission and the Council, since there is an unresolved tension between intergovernmental and Community powers.
The ambiguity with regard to the limits of the Commission' s role is particularly evident in the field of security and should be clarified once and for all, since we must not forget that the harmonious partnership between Parliament and the Commission has given rise to the successes of the European integration project, and we should work and fight for its restoration.
Furthermore, Mr President, this European Union project is not just a matter of a political, economic and military union.
Our project is based, or should be based, fundamentally on a community of values.
We in the European Union do not simply define ourselves as consumers in a big market place, but as citizens of the Union.
The citizens of the Union, represented by Parliament, increasingly want to be involved in this area which concerns them and affects them directly, namely the common security and defence policy.
Mr President, last month we celebrated Europe Day.
Central to this was Robert Schuman' s speech of 9 May 1950.
A lot has changed since then, but Robert Schuman' s and Jean Monnet' s basic axiom to the effect that a lasting peace is created by weaving peoples and nations together in mutually enriching dependence is still valid.
Security is created through cooperation pure and simple, as well as through integration and enlargement.
Schuman began his speech with these words: 'World peace cannot be preserved without constructive efforts to combat impending dangers' .
This far-sighted approach permeates the Socialist Group' s vision of Europe' s foreign and security policy and is also a persistent theme in Mrs LalumiÃšre' s report on the eve of Feira, a report which our Group supports wholeheartedly.
For Social Democrats like ourselves, there are two complementary dimensions to the challenge of security policy in the twenty-first century.
The first is the global dimension, and the second is the purely European dimension.
Seen in a global perspective, security is clearly indivisible.
We share the same planet and the same fate.
In today' s globalised world following the end of the cold war, poverty and exclusion stand out as the main enemies of peace and democracy.
No military arsenals and no new nuclear arms race can provide security against the resentment of the poor.
Generous, fair and far-sighted aid, together with a trade policy which attacks the causes of poverty and insecurity must therefore be an integral part of our foreign and security policy.
In the same way, we must look at conflict prevention and crisis management in the context of our new European security policy.
We are, of course, loyal to the decisions taken in Helsinki.
We should constructively develop the military capacity which the war in Kosovo, in particular, has necessarily brought about.
The headline goals which have been established are important and must be implemented in full, without delay and without exception.
At the same time, we must, however, oppose those who wish to exaggerate our military capacity and role.
We should accept increased responsibility for security on our own continent, but we should not take the place of NATO or create an embryonic form of permanent and independent European defence.
Such ambitions are pure fantasy and mere tilting at windmills.
A policy on conflict prevention is missing from our arsenal.
We must therefore actively support the proposals tabled by Commissioner Patten and also by the Council, together with the proposals in Mrs LalumiÃšre' s report.
Mr President, slowly and all too belatedly, a common European security policy is in the process of taking shape, one which, though it leaves a bad taste in the mouth to say so, is, at it were, being built on the ruins of Kosovo.
The EU did not manage to stop the catastrophe in the Balkans in time, and we shall forever be accountable to our children for this failure.
As Liberals, we consider it absolutely crucial for the EU to be able in future to intervene with personnel and resources in countries in its immediate vicinity, to be able to engage in civil crisis management, humanitarian efforts and peace-keeping exercises based on European values and human rights.
The EU must adopt a credible and independent policy in this area, but it is important to retain the commitment of the United States and the transatlantic link.
NATO is at present the most important organisation for peace and security in Europe.
The EU' s Member States must nonetheless soon come to some definite decisions about the common security policy.
There are three main questions which must be answered at Feira and which I want to submit to the Council.
What is the distribution of labour between the EU and NATO to look like?
We must develop complementary, and not duplicate, structures.
How will it be possible to guarantee the influence of the non-aligned States upon expanding security policy?
Thirdly, a question in connection with which there are many good proposals in Mrs LalumiÃšre' s excellent report: how will it be possible for the European Parliament and the national parliaments to be guaranteed influence upon, and participation in, the decisions so that the latter are made openly and democratically in the interests of our European citizens?
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, contrary to the priorities for Feira, the European Union must strengthen the civil conflict prevention dimension of its policy.
That means, as far as weighting instruments is concerned, that the financial and material focus must be on an effective conflict prevention policy.
The main lines of conflict today are to be found in domestic conflicts and this proves that the rich countries lack the will to do enough to foster sustainable and socially-balanced development in the crisis regions.
The opportunity was missed in Helsinki to give concrete expression to an active prevention policy and efficient and prompt crisis management and we urgently need to make up lost ground here.
I congratulate Mr Patten on his activities in this direction, which I should like to support and help develop further.
In building up conflict prevention and after-care instruments, the focus needs to be on combining a reduction in the production and sale of arms and stricter controls.
One more point: the importance of Parliament.
There is a risk in the numerous informal circles of totally inadequate democratic control of a European security policy, which is why the European Parliament needs to take the lead.
Its position must be strengthened and this point needs to be entered on the agenda for Feira.
Mr President, Europe is in the unique position of not having any enemies who threaten it militarily.
This might therefore be the time for extensive military disarmament in Europe but, in reality, rearmament is taking place.
Nor is this new military force of 50 000 to 60 000 men to be used within the EU' s own territories.
There is, in fact, no common defence commitment. Rather, it is a question of operating outside the EU' s borders.
It is about intervention.
Some might even go so far as to say that attacks may actually be mounted one of these days.
I am concerned about statements to the effect that the EU should be able to intervene anywhere in the world where there are threats to the Union' s security, interests and values.
To me, it sounds as if, in this area too, the EU has the United States' superpower policy as a model for its development.
Mr President, I too would like to express my great appreciation for the work of Mrs LalumiÃšre, who has produced an extraordinarily sound document which is also carefully thought out.
It has been discussed at length in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy and has put us on the right track.
Mr President, a European Union which cannot play a clearly defined role in terms of security and defence creates uncertainty on the world stage.
In tandem with the Commission and Council, Parliament would like to contribute to a transparent and convincing policy.
After all, the European Union cannot escape its responsibility which is commensurate with its economic and cultural stature.
The Christian Democrats hope that the transfer of tasks and competencies from the Western European Union to the European Union can contribute to this clarity.
As the President-in-Office of the Council pointed out, this naturally means that the budget of what may be left of the WEU will be drastically reduced but, to our great amazement, he is at the same time quite negative about the idea that the European Union' s budget should increase accordingly in this respect.
This seems extremely illogical to me and leads me to believe that this development is not taken altogether seriously.
Mr President, we have emphasised the civil and military aspects of this policy in our resolutions.
Both play a major role and the military component should explicitly be embedded in the wider context of the civil component.
These are not just pious words, they also have an immediate implication for the way in which this policy is supervised.
This is why it is essential that this European Parliament, in which we discuss all kinds of civil affairs with each other all the time, be the place where the military components form part of a wider context in parliamentary supervision too.
We know that the civil components will always take priority and the military components will in the first instance be used as a big stick and a last resort.
It would therefore be dangerous if this policy were not entirely supervised by us.
I also have to say that the nature of the tasks which we have in mind, the Petersberg tasks, is such that here is the ideal place where they can be dealt with.
As champions of a Community policy, we are particularly keen for the European Commission' s input, as Mr Patten described it a moment ago, to be at its best.
This means therefore that the Council must make this possible and that the personnel and budget required for this should be adequate.
Mr President, we do not want to disconnect these tasks from cooperation with North America.
Obviously not.
In fact, we are very keen for our security to be undivided.
This is why it was with some hesitation that, in another resolution, we in the meantime urged that a position be adopted on America' s inclination to determine its own security unilaterally via the ABM system.
We do not want this.
We want to cooperate with North America in these matters too, but also - and particularly - with sound backing from the Council.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner Patten, ladies and gentlemen, thanks to the excellent work of our rapporteur, Catherine LalumiÃšre, we are now able to present Parliament' s position in the run-up to the European Council in Feira.
She has succeeded in describing a really accurate and balanced position with which a large majority of the political forces here in Parliament can identify.
Thank you, Catherine LalumiÃšre.
The war in and about Kosovo has made Europeans realise three important things.
First, that we need to give ourselves conflict prevention capabilities.
So far, we have had neither the political mechanisms nor the instruments to prevent or settle conflicts.
If we want to avoid war, we need to give ourselves this capability.
I am delighted that you, Commissioner Patten, take this same view and look forward to hearing your proposals, the Commission' s proposals.
Secondly, we have learned that we are unable to intervene independently on our own continent and in our own neighbourhood, even in the case of very limited military action.
Thirdly: we have learned that we need to be independent from our American friends if we want to control the means to be deployed in a military conflict.
In other words: if we are dependent on others when it comes to reconnaissance, transport, attacking capacity and other such aspects, then we are fighting their war, not ours.
These realisations have resulted in the European Union' s at long last tackling and stepping up its efforts to define, organise and restructure a common security and defence policy.
Today' s debate is the European Parliament' s contribution to these efforts on the part of the European Union as a whole.
As the European security and defence policy develops further, the Commission and European Parliament are increasingly being sidelined.
The European Parliament should also gain greater influence on military action through the budget and proper accountability through the Council.
If the Union only deals with civil and police matters whilst the governments' exclusive remit is military aspects, then the unity of European action is in danger of becoming the first casualty in crisis situations.
There can be no artificial divide between humanitarian aid and military action.
The idea of a joint European and national Assembly has not been sufficiently developed by a long chalk.
Will it need to be more than an informal conversation club?
Will it be given competencies at the expense of national parliaments?
It should in any event not cause this Parliament to be sidelined even further during the development of the European security and defence policy.
Mr President, I hope that Mrs LalumiÃšre' s sterling report will this time not only meet with widespread agreement in Parliament but will also be heard in the Council.
But all too often the Council puts to one side what has been decided within the European Parliament, by consensus or not, as the case may be.
European unification is born from a desire for sustainable peace.
This is a leading concept which recurs in many interventions.
The Common Foreign and Security Policy should therefore forge a unity between political decision-making, conflict prevention, crisis management, possibly military action - only if need be, and ideally not - plus a plan to return to peace afterwards and to keep this peace.
I am not only thinking of Kosovo, which has been so important to us as an eye-opener.
The failure throughout the former Yugoslavia has shown that European helplessness and fragmentation between the different governments do not lead to a prospect of joint peace.
This peace is communal and it should also be maintained communally.
Mr President, the resolution proposed by Mrs LalumiÃšre seeks parliamentary backing in the form of proposals for the necessary means and structures so that the European Union can assume international policing duties alongside ÃÃÃÃ, especially when and where ÃÃÃÃ fails to act immediately, as specified at Helsinki.
Unfortunately, this philosophy, as can be seen from the debate, prevails not only in the Council and the Commission, but also in the European Parliament which, instead of expressing the feelings and interests of the citizens, is about to ratify an extremely dangerous policy for Europe and mankind as a whole.
