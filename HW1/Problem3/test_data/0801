It has to be said that in general, it has failed to do so. The report therefore formulates proposals to improve the efficiency of controls by increasing the frequency with which oil mills are to submit information and introducing similar conditions for aid to pomace oil.
Parliament has been speaking out about the problems ensuing from marketing blends of olive oil and other fats since 1996. We have called for similar protection to that in place for milk and butter, for example.
Unfortunately, no regulations have been adopted in response to these requests.
On this occasion, the proposal' s shortcoming is all the more conspicuous since the Commission' s proposal focuses on quality strategy.
The European Parliament' s Committee on Agriculture therefore proposes a ban on marketing blends of olive oil and other fats, in line with measures already in place in most of the producer countries.
Regarding the content of the proposal, the designations proposed by the Commission have been somewhat modified.
In addition, the report proposes a number of measures concerning labelling. The most significant of these is aimed at preventing the designation 'olive oil' being used as an advertising slogan, thus confusing the consumers.
In cases where olive oil was not the only fat contained in a food product, the use of the denomination 'olive oil' would therefore be restricted to the quantitative description of ingredients.
As far as labelling is concerned, the inclusion of two other details is proposed: the origin of the oil, namely the place where the olives were grown, and in the case of ordinary oil, a requirement to state that it is produced from refined and virgin oils.
I trust the Commission will respond more positively to these points than it has in the past.
On 25 October last, for instance, the Commission rejected some thirty of our amendments to the proposal for the COM in fruit and vegetables on the grounds that they would be included in a later report.
That report has now been published, but the substance of our amendments was not included.
Furthermore, our document includes a number of amendments aimed at making the Commission' s proposal more flexible and precise.
The Commission intends it to be implemented in two years' time, through the collaboration of what it terms the 'organisations of economic agents' .
Since the actions planned are to be financed partly from a deduction withheld from aid to production, it follows that producers will be involved in the administration.
Some clearly defined entities already exist, such as producers' organisations, their associations and interbranch bodies.
Given the circumstances, a two-year period for the introduction of the proposed actions should not be necessary.
A clear list of actions which may not be included should also be drafted, to provide legal certainty and speed up and facilitate the preparation of programmes.
In conclusion, special thanks are due above all to the members of the Committee on Agriculture.
Their amendments have enriched the report considerably, bringing it into line with the requirements of producers and consumers in all the states involved. This was evident at the meeting organised by the Italian Ministry of Agriculture in Verona as recently as last April.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to begin by offering my sincere congratulations to the European Court of Auditors, whose report on olive oil has made another major contribution to the debate on the effectiveness of the system of common organisation of the markets under which the common agricultural policy still operates.
My first thanks go to the Commission, which spared no effort during the drafting of this report to make themselves available, to answer the questions put to them and to explain their decisions.
I also wish to thank our Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, the draftsman of the opinion on this report, Vincenzo Lavarra and the rapporteur on the olive oil sector, Mr JovÃ© Peres.
My sincere thanks go to them for their contributions and for the way in which they cooperated so willingly with me.
I wish to make very special mention of the excellent study on the environmental impact of the common organisation of the market in olive oil, produced for the Commission' s Directorate-General for the Environment by accredited institutions for agro-environmental analysis, from which I shall quote frequently in this speech.
The COM in olive oil is based on aid for production. In other words, it encourages higher productivity as a means of increasing farmers' incomes.
The average production of an olive grove varies between 200 kg and 500 kg per hectare per year for traditional olive groves in poorer areas and between around 8 and 10 tonnes per hectare per year in the more intensively cultivated groves with the best soil.
Since it is possible, then, to increase the productivity of olive groves by 10 or even 20 times, a policy geared towards increasing the quantity produced has inevitably led to traditional olive groves and the most difficult land to cultivate being abandoned and has led to the intensification of production on more fertile land.
Traditional plantations have a low density of trees, which are generally old - trees that are centuries old are common - also contain arable crops or grazing land for sheep or goats, are frequently planted in terraces and are very labour intensive.
The value of olive trees for heritage and for the landscape in terms of protecting land from floods and landslides or in terms of increasing biodiversity is incalculable.
The study to which I just referred counted 120 plant species, 70 species of vertebrates and 160 species of invertebrates in traditional olive groves in the province of Cordoba in Andalusia.
Ancient olive groves and trees play a particularly important role in preserving many species of birds.
The value of subsidies for production is too low in this area and traditional olive groves are being abandoned throughout the Mediterranean, with the inevitable damaging consequences for the environment and for rural development.
Modern intensive plantations have a high density of low-yield trees, which are chopped down after a few years. These plantations use copious amounts of water for irrigation, up to 350 kg of fertiliser per hectare and pesticides and herbicides to clear the soil of vegetation.
These plantations do not use terraces, which often creates slopes of more than 12%.
It is estimated that modern olive groves in Andalusia have caused erosion of 80 tonnes per hectare, whereas more than 50 tonnes of erosion per hectare is considered to be an extremely serious level.
The around 1 million new intensive plantations in Andalusia are therefore causing erosion at a rate of 80 million tonnes of soil per year, making this one of the main factors for desertification in the southern Iberian Peninsula.
Although fewer studies have been made of the problem in these areas, it also affects huge swathes of the Peloponnese, Crete, the Aegean islands and Tuscany.
In areas such as Liguria and in many parts of Portugal, erosion is caused more by traditional olive groves being abandoned than by the establishment of modern groves.
The current system of production-related aid is not only stimulating the human and environmental desertification of the southern part of our continent, but is also making the work of those who adulterate olive oil easier, enabling them to cheat the Community budget, cheat consumers of their right to buy a natural, high-quality product, and cheat the farmers.
The level of fraud and irregularities uncovered by this Court of Auditors report on the olive oil sector is far too high.
It is true that there is every indication that the only reason for more fraud being discovered in olive oil than in milk is that there are tighter controls, not because there is any greater propensity to commit fraud in that sector.
The European institutions must make the fight against the adulteration of food in areas such as meat, milk, wine and olive oil absolute political priorities, which will inevitably mean overhauling the way in which the CAP operates.
Preserving and improving the environment and farmers' incomes is the prime objective of the agricultural chapter of the Treaty.
Our current approach, however, is proving of greater benefit to the agro-industrial conglomerates than to agriculture. It is causing the desertification of the poorest rural areas, is having a damaging effect on the environment and makes the sale of bogus products easier.
We therefore need to abandon the old COM system of providing incentives for productivity and to create a new CAP that focuses on protecting farmers' incomes, the rural world, quality and the environment.
Mr President, I should like to express my appreciation to the rapporteur, Mr JovÃ©, for his splendid work and for always being willing to collaborate with members of the Committee on Agriculture.
I should also like to thank the European Commission for its report on quality strategy for olive oil and for the draft regulation. Both these documents are sound in principle.
Nonetheless, the proposal in question has been much improved by Parliament' s report.
Allow me to highlight a number of areas where this is the case. Regarding checks, we fully agree that they should basically be undertaken at the level of the oil mills.
This is a far more efficient method of monitoring.
The geographical oil information system should become complementary to it. Secondly, as far as mixtures of olive oil and other fats are concerned, we advocate a total ban on marketing.
In so doing, we are responding to requests made by the producer countries.
The consumer can easily be misled by such mixtures, and olive oil' s reputation will be adversely affected. It should be noted that this in no way restricts consumer choice, as any individual interested in such a mixture can produce it for personal consumption.
Thirdly, following revision of the COM in 1998 and the end of intervention aid buying, aid to private storage became the only way of regulating market prices.
This measure has not been implemented correctly, however. As a result, price levels have been below the limits set by the Council for many months, when such measures had not been authorised.
It is therefore very positive that Parliament' s report should call for the automatic opening of private storage. This will allow olive oil prices to be maintained at an appropriate level.
Finally, I should like to refer to aid for the production of olive pomace oil.
Its purpose is to ensure that the by-products of olive mills are handled in an environmentally-friendly way. We feel that such aid should be calculated with reference to the amount of pomace oil actually produced, and should not be awarded on a lump sum basis as is currently the case.
Furthermore, this proposal is certain to have a beneficial impact on quality strategy.
Mr President, first of all I should like to thank the rapporteurs on these important issues.
I shall just take a few minutes to comment on the proposal for a Council regulation on the new COM for olive oil, first thanking Mr JovÃ© Peres for the competence and willingness he has shown, which have led to the considerable understanding of our Committee.
The conditions were not right for a thorough reform and so we have chosen to bring forward the introduction of some important rules allowing this sector to face the new challenges posed by the World Trade Organisation, the liberalisation of the markets and the reform of the common agricultural policy.
This has been the driving force that has led us to identify specific rules and requests for new aid.
In particular, for us it is important to give the origin of the oil as the place where the olives were harvested and not where it was produced.
We have the duty of transparency and of coherence with the principles of traceability: it is a matter of courtesy to the producers and the consumers.
I hope the Council will approve our position and issue an order to revise Regulation 2815.
Equally worthy of consideration are the ban on blending olive oil with other oils or fats and the incentive to the producer organisation to increase market supply capacity, because this is the paradox to overcome: a rising demand for consumption of this precious commodity and a fall in prices.
With these measures we think the whole sector can be sustained, and I am pleased to finish with a particular comment on the method we have used, that is to say the meeting of Parliament with the whole sector, which has led to these points which I hope we will approve today in this House and which I hope may guide the final decision of the Council.
Mr President, I thank Mr Peres for the work he has done and especially for his willingness to receive proposals and suggestions; I thank the Commission for having done such a thorough job; and I thank the Committee on Agriculture for having unanimously approved the amendments tabled.
This means there may be a unanimous vote in Parliament tomorrow, and there is hope that a strong proposal may reach the Council, strong because it is expressed by a unanimous Parliament.
It is true that in the debate about the reform of the common agricultural policy, which is beginning to be discussed, the conviction is emerging from many parts that in time aid for production will gradually be cut down.
Producers are not frightened by this prospect as long as it is possible to sell on the market at a fair price.
This objective can be pursued essentially in two ways: either by organising a promotion, information and consumer awareness campaign as well as advertising the product, which is the only way to make quality prevail on the market, or by preventing and discouraging fraud and adulteration.
The latter is a problem that cannot be left just to the Member States, but one that the whole Union must face by understanding that it is responsible.
The amendments tabled and approved are a step in this direction.
Here I shall ask the Commission a formal question.
With this resolution we are going to intervene in Regulation 1638/98.
There is, however, an amendment which explicitly seeks an undertaking regarding Regulation 2815, the regulation which provides for the possibility of marketing oil without labelling and lays down the origin of the product linked to the place of pressing and not the place of harvesting.
Commissioner Fischler gave me and Mr Lavarra an undertaking that at the time of the COM reform this Regulation too would somehow be eliminated or at least modified.
The Regulation expires on 31 October 2001.
My question is this: what is the Commission going to do?
Does it intend to keep faith with this undertaking and also with this approved amendment which will surely be approved by Parliament tomorrow, and thus not renew this Regulation from November 2001 onwards, or change it in line with the wishes of the highest democratic assembly?
We ask for an explicit undertaking by the Commission because while we are discussing and legally intervening in Regulation 1638 we do not want the other Regulation to go off in a different direction which does not allow for the possibility of its being legally amended.
Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to begin by thanking the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for its report, and also by thanking the rapporteur, Mr JovÃ© Peres, for his excellent input.
In my opinion, the Commission' s proposal to extend the current aid regime for a further two years is sound. However, I share the sector' s concern at the Commission' s intention to resort entirely to an operational geographical oil information system for future monitoring of this regime.
We feel this could prove a good monitoring tool, but only a complementary one.
We believe it would be more useful and fairer to put in place appropriate checks at the oil mills, not just a geographical information system. Hopefully, such checks would be more effective in preventing fraud.
We do not agree with the Commission' s proposal where it introduces a new concept, that of economic operators. This concept is quite unclear.
Any one of us could set up tomorrow as an economic agents' organisation and withhold significant funds from those genuinely involved in oil production, namely producers' or interbranch organisations recognised by the Member States themselves.
In our judgement, the key element of the strategy to promote quality is a permanent ban on the marketing of blends of olive oil and other fats.
This is essential to pursue fraudulent blending with seed oil. The ban must be central to management of the olive oil market, so as to avoid defrauding customers and to establish a clear policy on quality and food safety.
We endorse the general feeling within the Committee on Agriculture concerning the new designations. They result from extensive consultation with the sector, as does the reduction of maximum permitted acidity for extra virgin oil.
Ladies and gentlemen, no other crop is so closely linked with the people of the Mediterranean and with their culture. No other crop shaped the landscape over thousands of years, as this one has.
We are convinced of the environmental value of olive groves in maintaining biodiversity and stemming the advance of desertification. Those of us who live in the area are especially aware of this.
In drafting programmes aimed at improving the environmental impact of olive groves, consideration should therefore also be given to recycling material removed when pruning the groves.
Both the olive wood and the leaves can be used commercially, thus taking full advantage of all the by-products of cultivation.
Following the last 'reform' of the common organisation of the market in the olive oil sector and now that the transitional period has come to an end for the Commission to change the aid system, from aid for production to aid per tree, the Commission has presented its strategy for olive oil quality and is extending the present aid system for a further two years.
This extension is to be welcomed, but the Commission has failed to provide a solution on three points that were not resolved in the 1998 reform. These are: the establishment of compensation aid for small producers, as proposed by Parliament; a ban on the sale of olive oil mixed with other fats and labelling that does not mislead the consumer and which only gives the name 'olive oil' to products made from olives.
Furthermore, doing away with mechanisms for public intervention and replacing them with private stockpiling has not managed to prevent a fall in prices and the consequences of this on reducing farmers' incomes.
Salvador JovÃ©' s report seeks to resolve some of these fundamental issues, particularly with regard to blends, and I support his ideas on this matter.
The report by Paulo Casaca undermines the European Parliament' s resolutions by using an opinion on the report by the Court of Auditors to go ahead with proposals to replace the current system of aid for production with direct aid to farmers, which opens the way to the Commission' s option of per tree premiums.
We must reject this proposal.
Aid per tree would not only have damaging consequences for production and for employment - with the olives not being harvested - but we would also lose a key element for monitoring the production of olive oil and its quality. This would consequently increase opportunities for fraudulent practices.
Mr President, several times over the last year I have addressed enquiries to the Commission for news about the large consignments of extra-Community oil imported into Italy via third countries.
I have requested that a Community database be set up for oil and that Regulation 2568/91 be revised, in order to check analytically for the presence of hazelnut oil in the olive oil imported into Italy.
Unfortunately the answers have never been reassuring, and sometimes they have been quite alarming.
The observations made in the explanatory statement in the Peres report are all true, highlighting once again the demand for a guaranteed income for farmers and respect for the space and special character of the Mediterranean environment, the strong demand to prevent aid per tree by supporting aid based on production, and the valuing of the quality and genuineness of the product to protect the consumer.
It is clear that Parliament' s position is not yet in tune with the Commission' s, and I hope that at least some fundamental amendments in the Peres report will be approved to clarify the important function of the producer organisations as a useful presence on the market, to value interprofessionalism, to protect the consumer from any abuses by preventing the blending of olive oil with other vegetable oils, to establish the place of production of the olives as the place of origin, and lastly something which particularly concerns the south of Italy and the Puglia region: to add some cultivars to the genetic mark, preventing them from being regarded as defects of organoleptic characteristics whereas instead they are expressions of techniques and special characters that can be found in the production specifications of protected denomination of origin olive oils
Mr President, in just two years' time we will be facing a series of important dates for the common agricultural policy: from the verification of Agenda 2000 to the review of the common organisations of the market for seed plants, sugar, milk, and at this point also olive oil.
By chance, by a strange stroke of luck, we have the competent Commissioner here today.
The financial resources and the aid that the producers expect will become a sort of financial bottleneck which must in no way affect the solidity of any of the above-mentioned dossiers.
Oil in particular should be safeguarded as a sector because it represents European agricultural values throughout the world.
We must work so that quality and safety and also the multiple uses of the product can be the key to the future of Community olive oil production.
To achieve this aim it is necessary, however, that in the period before these important dates arrive there should be a review, reappraisal and enhancement of the role of producer associations especially; in fact, the centralisation of the operators is essential for achieving consumer protection based on labelling and traceability.
From this viewpoint, the introduction of a clear classification of oils can only result in greater access to the competitive advantages of guaranteed production.
In addition, alongside the financial aspects of a sector like that of oil, the Community law on designation of origin must necessarily be revisited.
The European principle must in fact become that of identifying the origin of the oil with the place where the olives are produced and no longer with the place where they are crushed, as has debatably been the case until now.
In this context the blending of olive oil with other vegetable oils, in the absence of labelling that will identify each component in the blend, damages the image of the producer, the consumer and the Codex Alimentarius.
It would in fact be deplorable if we were to find ourselves facing not just the existing uncontrolled piracy of digital music but also unfair competition in foodstuffs, playing on false denominations and bogus labels.
Adulteration must be repressed, especially in the area of foodstuffs, because what is at stake are the interests of consumer safety and the producers' right to entrepreneurial freedom.
The whole olive oil sector, supported by the political institution at whatever level, should assume the responsibility of carrying out the activities of management and market control through concentration and the marketing of the product, to the benefit of quality, certification, research, promotion and traceability.
I thank Mr Peres for the truly excellent results of his work.
This evening I take the opportunity - and I shall repeat this in the House tomorrow - to say that we have a problem with the Italian translation: the translation of 'brut' , referring to oil, as 'greggio' (crude) is not acceptable in my country and so tomorrow I shall ask for the Italian version to use the term 'naturale' (natural) or 'vergine' (virgin).
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my congratulations to Mr Casaca on his excellent report, which amply demonstrates that we have still not managed to bring olive oil regulations into line with the demands of modern agriculture and the fact that this agricultural policy is in need of radical reform.

I should like to cite two examples here.
First: one of the main objectives of production aid is to give olive farmers a fair income and guarantee market balance.
As the Court of Auditors quite rightly states, the objective of production aid in relation to producers' income has never been defined.
In other words, no one knows if this objective has ever been achieved, because we have never been able to assess it.
The same applies to market balance.
In 1998, the Commission established that there are 180 million olive trees.
That came as something of a surprise, because Olistat had reckoned with a lot fewer trees, some 140 million.
That is a difference of 40 million trees, a discrepancy of about 31%.
Just consider, you think you have market balance and then you find out that you have 30% too much stock.
The increase in stock over the last two years does, in fact, indicate that there is a surplus.
Secondly, there were similar weaknesses in the consumption aid abolished at the end of 1998.
There was no obligation to keep records or ledgers of accounts payable.
As a result, there was a huge amount of fraud and irregularity.
EUR 429 million in undue amounts have still not been recovered for the 1985-1998 period.
Only 6% has been recovered so far.
Just think how financial control and recovery were reorganised in connection with the reform of the Commission.
We really do have our work cut out here.
As far as export refunds are concerned, just 13% of the money has been recovered.
Anyone who takes the protection of European taxpayers seriously just wants to get on and reform this agricultural policy.
Mr Casaca's report shows us how.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first I should like to thank the rapporteurs on behalf of the Commission for their excellent work.
The area which we are discussing is not important just for the regions; it is also a very important area for the European budget.
After all, this year's budget includes EUR 2.4 billion for the olive oil sector.
In this respect, it is also an extremely important area when it comes to audits by the European Court of Auditors.
Mr Casaca has dealt with the special report by the Court of Auditors.
Mr JovÃ© Peres has led the debate on the Commission proposal.
Strictly speaking, these two areas are totally separate because the special report by the Court of Auditors addresses the measures and aid applied over a three-year transitional period before the Council decision in 1998, whereas the Commission proposal relates to measures to be taken from November 2001 onwards.
First to Mr Casaca's report.
The Commission can accept most of the points in Mr Casaca's motion for a resolution on the Court of Auditors' report.
However, I should like to take a more detailed position on two points.
The Commission stated in the middle of last year, during its examination of the Court of Auditor's report, that improving the control system would, of course, be an important issue in the forthcoming reform of the common organisation of the market.
Having examined this question closely, it is clear that radical reforms are needed if any decisive improvement is to be made.
However, come what may, we need a geographical information system.
As the right conditions will not all be in place for this sort of reform in 2001, the Commission suggested at the end of last year that, the decisive importance of the geographical information system notwithstanding, the reform should be postponed for two years.
Besides, the Court of Auditors' proposals suggested other ways of making improvements here.
After highly constructive talks with the Member States, these improvements were set out in Commission Regulation (EC) No 648/2000.
This motion for a resolution expresses surprise at the fact that the Commission questions the reliability of the International Olive Oil Council's statistics.
These doubts should come as no surprise.
They were expressed at every Council meeting between 1995 and 1998.
The Commission checked the data in question and clarified the details with the Member States on several occasions.
The International Olive Oil Council's statistics for 1999 had to be revised for the purpose of standardising the data. This resulted in a 30% reduction in the stock calculated.
It was also found that it was best to assume that national statistics had a margin of error of 10-12%.
I have the following to say about Mr JovÃ© Peres's report: the report on the Commission proposal on the future common organisation of the market in olive oil is divided into two parts, dealing with two different subjects. The first part deals with postponing the decision on the reform in the olive oil sector for two years, until we have more accurate data and a more reliable control system, and the second part deals with the introduction of a new regulation on classifying olive oil and the quality strategy for olive oil.
The proposed amendments relate to four main issues: market measures and final reform, controls of the current regulation, classification and labelling of olive oil and the activities of the organisations of market operators.
I should like to comment on all four.
As far as general market aspects are concerned, the Commission agrees with Amendment No 2 on the need to assess the results of the transitional period.
The Commission acknowledges Amendments Nos 4, 5 and 9 but cannot formally accept them because they anticipate the decision on final reform, which the Commission wants to leave open at the moment.
I cannot accept Amendments Nos 3, 6 and 26 on automatic private storage arrangements even where the market situation has no need of them.
Nor can the Commission endorse Amendments Nos 1 and 46 on aid for actual olive-residue oil production because this would complicate controls still further.
Similarly, the Commission cannot accept Amendment No 27 extending production refunds to products not in international competition with cheap olive oil.
As regards Amendment No 37, concerning the basic ban on the planting of additional olive groves, the Commission takes the view that conversions and the legal consequences with respect to land use would give rise to huge problems.
Numerous provisions on control measures have already been issued during the course of the year.
The outstanding problems are connected with marketing structures.
No decisive progress can be made until we introduce the geographical information system which the Commission has suggested as the basis on which aid should be granted from 2003 onwards.
Most of the substance of the amendments proposed here has already been taken into account in the Commission's regulations.
Amendments Nos 7, 11 and 14 call for greater involvement of the Commission and additional research.
But the Commission is already working closely with the Member States on controls without, however, disregarding the fact that they have the final say.
Research programmes have already been funded under the general procedure in the areas which you mention.
Amendments Nos 8, 10, 22, 23, 24 and 36 relate to improved monitoring of mills, the main concern being to use electronic data transmission.
The relevant Commission Regulation (EC) No 2366/98 already provides a legal basis for priority monitoring of mills.
As a result, at least 30% of mills must be controlled in situ.
In addition, the mills must send in data on their stock accounts at the end of every month.
These data have already been compared with the information available on olive oil production and marketing.
The proposal for a computerised system for monitoring on a day-to-day basis is being examined.
If it proves to be sensible and practicable, the Commission could issue the corresponding regulation.
However, we must bear in mind that, unfortunately, the IT tools for the Member States for which provision has been made are still not fully ready for use.
As far as classification and labelling are concerned, as addressed in Amendments Nos 16, 18 and 45, together with Amendments Nos 19 and 35, we have taken note of your proposals, especially the call for the place where the olives were grown to be taken as the place of origin.
However, as these questions come under the Commission's jurisdiction, the Commission cannot agree to their being included in the basic Council regulation.
Amendments Nos 33 and 34 call for the specific reference to olive oil as an ingredient to be banned on food labels.
These proposals are questionable from a commercial point of view and the Commission therefore takes the view that food labelling should comply with Directive 2000/13 (EC).
Obviously, the Commission is aware of the fact that the olive oil sector is calling for a ban on the marketing of mixtures of olive oils and other fats.
However, the Commission cannot ban healthy, properly labelled products for which there is a demand simply to protect sales of another product.
We therefore reject Amendments Nos 17, 20 and 32.
However, the Commission will make sure that suitable labelling requirements are drafted. It goes without saying that olive oil sold under one of the four compulsory names is still pure olive oil and has all the qualities which make it such.
Amendment No 47 suggests that the term "natural" should be used instead of the term "crude" and Amendment No 48 adds the term "ordinary olive oil" to the term "standard olive oil" .
The Commission is unable to accept this at the moment because it prefers to find terms which correspond more closely to the perceptions of the sector as a whole.
The Commission will, however, include your suggestions in subsequent Council discussions.
Under Amendment No 21, the new classification would enter into force on 1 November 2002, i.e. a year before the date proposed by the Commission.
As it will be impossible to complete the necessary implementing measures, market adjustments and international negotiations by then, the Commission cannot agree to this proposal.
Finally, as far as organisations of market operators are concerned, the Commission agrees to Amendment No 12 with its more general wording of the objectives, Amendment No 25 proposing that table olives be included in current provisions for quality improvement programmes and Amendment No 30 subject to legal examination and with the words "for recognised interbranch organisations" .
The very specific Amendment No 13 could be helpful for measures promoted in environmental programmes, but not for the basic regulation of the sector.
As regards measures for which organisations of market operators can claim a grant, the Commission is prepared to examine the inclusion of table olives and the assurance of origin.
However, the details of possible measures must be decided by the Commission.
The various methods for promoting sales must stay within the harmonised framework which applies to all agricultural products, which is why I have to reject Amendments Nos 39, 40 and 43.
If an organisation of market operators is to be licensed, it must meet certain criteria which the Commission has yet to decide.
The restructuring of the olive oil sector was less comprehensive than in other sectors and new discussions and conditions therefore appear to be needed.
The Commission has taken note of your request that organisations of producers and branch organisations be given priority.
However, there seems to be little point at present in restricting measures which could help to improve the quality and hence sales of olive oil.
Numerous proposed amendments call for new regulations on organisations of market operators to enter into force as quickly as possible.
This is certainly a good idea.
However, we need a good two years to work out detailed regulations for the sector, for the organisations of market operators and their programmes, for checking programmes and for the Member States to check and licence organisations and design the monitoring tools needed.
If we rush things, we will jeopardise the success of the quality strategy, which is why the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 15, 28, 29, 31, 38, 41, 42 and 44.
However, I can confirm that the Commission does appreciate almost half the proposed amendments, even if it can only directly accept a few of them.
The remainder are mostly provisions for which the Commission itself is responsible and which will be drafted and amended over coming months, taking account of your recommendations.
Thank you very much, Commissioner for this very full answer.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Draft SAB 2/2001
The next item is the report (A5-0138/2001) by Mr Ferber, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the Draft Supplementary and Amending Budget 2/2001 of the European Union for the 2001 financial year [60/2001 - C5-0153/2001 - 2001/2026(BUD)].
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Council has again presented a supplementary budget in order to set the Common Foreign, and Security Policy and defence policy in Europe on a broader basis.
We examined the original draft supplementary budget sent to us by the Council very closely and came to the conclusion that it was not acceptable as it stood and I should like to say why in no uncertain terms: what we need in this important political field is to safeguard the necessary transparency and the necessary controls.
The common foreign and security policy of the European Union is one of the core elements in the further development of this European Union.
We cannot withdraw control functions from the national parliaments in this important area without giving them to the European Parliament and we felt that this democratic gap needed to be closed.
I should like to say quite clearly that interinstitutional agreements are all well and good, but they are not the right tool for effective control.
Nor are the Western European Union and its parliamentary assembly the right tool for effective control.
That is why it was clear to us that transparency can only be reasonably guaranteed and this important political field can only be controlled within the framework of the budgetary procedure.
That is why I am most grateful to my fellow members for staying the difficult course which we have taken together and seeing the tough negotiations with the Council through to the end and for supporting the line which I, as rapporteur, have taken from the outset.
I should also like to thank the Swedish Presidency of the Council for making it possible to broker a solution now which guarantees the Council's ability to act in the area for which it is responsible under the Treaty and which also guarantees Parliament's right of control.
That was the brief which we stood up for and which we negotiated.
We resisted the temptation - and I am most grateful to my fellow members for this - to make a distinction between administrative expenses and operational expenses.
That would have been too confusing.
You cannot distinguish, post by post, when someone is administering and when they are operationally active.
But now that we have succeeded in ensuring that a separate title in the Council budget includes activities in the area of the common foreign and security policy, this distinction - and hence controls - are guaranteed in an optimum manner.
The supplementary budget, in terms of numbers, totals EUR 9.846 million.
It makes provision for 51 new posts in this area and for the further technical resources needed in order to refurbish the buildings.
I should like to say quite clearly at this point that we shall of course check the Council budget in general and this new title in particular very closely during the course of the 2002 budgetary procedure.
We cannot allow the Council to build up powers which the European Union already has, for which provision has been made under the Commission budget, especially in the area of crisis prevention and civil crisis management, as a parallel structure.
And, as long as that is not the case, I see no need to recommend that the House reject the Council's supplementary and amending budget.
We shall also ensure in future, as regards heading 5, that the European Union's ability to act is still guaranteed when it comes to administrative expenses. I should like to urge the Council not just to deal with this important area in supplementary budgets, but to include it once and for all in its normal budget, so that we have a reasonable set of figures at our disposal when discussing other areas under heading 5.
My thanks to the honourable members from nearly all the groups for supporting me.
However, I must say that I am somewhat disappointed that the Greens have moved to reject the supplementary budget.
The chairman of the Committee on Budgets will cast our vote on this motion tomorrow.
Until such time as we can prove - and we need ammunition here - that there are twin structures, it makes no sense to reject en masse something which represents a huge success for the European Parliament and, by extension, for the citizens of Europe.
Mr President, we object on principle to the accelerating growth of European Union military structures outside the NATO Alliance, with all their attendant costs and politically divisive intent.
We believe that the duplication of decision-making bodies and the development of a military staff separate from NATO will inevitably exacerbate policy differences between allies, to the detriment of the transatlantic relationship and the long-term security of our people.
The European Union should be focusing its efforts on economic, administrative and humanitarian contributions to crisis management, to complement the military capabilities which should properly be a NATO responsibility.
The European Union has not yet learned to deliver and manage its external assistance programmes efficiently or to properly spend the resources that have been allocated to these purposes.
Now it wants more money to spend on yet another ambitious and seriously misguided project.
Parliament is being asked to approve a draft supplementary and amending budget of nearly EUR 10 million to fund staff and equipment for the separate European Union military bodies.
In addition to some 90 staff redeployed from other tasks or seconded from Member States, 51 extra personnel are now to be recruited to expand the European Union military structures.
Can we have an assurance that this total of 141 personnel will not be exceeded?
How long will it be before there is a further increase in staff for the European Union military structures?
Mr Blair tells people at home that European Union's defence policy is all about strengthening NATO.
Mr Hoon has even said that there is no concept of a European rapid reaction force as such.
From what I hear, everyone speaking on this side of the Channel has an entirely different perspective.
The aim is to establish an autonomous European Union military capability to underpin a distinctive EU foreign policy in which the Americans are not involved - in due course, a European army.
That is a reality.
That is what it is all about.
It is very dangerous.
Tonight we are discussing an unnecessary EUR 10 million.
I wonder how long it will be before we are discussing a defence budget of EUR 10 billion or more.
The development of an autonomous EU military capability, separate from NATO, has come about as a direct result of initiatives by the British Labour Government in 1998.
Now their project has run out of control.
We know who is to blame and we cannot support this budget.
Mr President, I am truly amazed - I freely admit - by the last speaker as the official spokesman of the PPE group.
I really expected nothing of the sort.
I would have expected him to be closer to us, now that we know that the Greens have tabled a proposed amendment rejecting this supplementary and amending budget.
But nothing should come as a surprise in the European Parliament, especially not in this area.
The common foreign and security policy is one of the policies of the European Union which, to all intents and purposes, has yet to be developed.
In the past, it is true, we had a situation in which several Commissioners had to agree between themselves as to who was to look after and deal with which part of the world.
At times we remember this and smile.
But, when you look at politics from the point of view of content, it is irresponsible of the European Union not to speak with one voice and to behave like a dwarf in the world when it is in fact an economic global player and - to put it nastily - could in theory push the Secretary-General and representative of the common foreign and security policy around like an operetta general.
That is why we are convinced that anyone who wants to take the common foreign and security policy seriously and really implement it, anyone who wants to prevent the lack of European policy in the foreign policy area that we have seen over recent years, must support the common foreign and security policy.
This morning, Mr Brok said in the debate on the transatlantic dialogue that we, as the European Union, had no profile in Ukraine and that blunders had been made, which is why we must take the Council's desire to make real progress here seriously and support it.
So support in principle is there.
When the supplementary and amending budget was presented to us - and here I concur fully with Mr Ferber - not only did it fail to convince us; on the contrary we got all worked up and opposed to it.
It is wrong to try and hide such an important area which is so crucial to the future of the European Union beneath a gentlemen's agreement between Parliament and the Council in a budget over which only the Council has any influence.
All that does is to demonstrate that you do not want any parliamentary control or any parliamentary support.
Which is unacceptable.
We said as much from the outset and we shall continue to take this view and to formulate our policy and vote accordingly.
But if you enter into negotiations and can clear up this point, i.e. if you can demonstrate that the supplementary and amending budget has been changed so that we can assume in future that we have are involved and have a say, when there is a separate chapter under which the Council shapes future policy in the common foreign and security policy area with parliamentary support and control, then you have to agree to it if you really want to make progress.
That is not the time to stand on the sidelines and say, we are waiting to see what happens next.
In all events, one thing is clear: when in reply to questions from the relevant Commissioner one is told in the Committee on Foreign Affairs or in the Committee on Budgets, with the wink of an eye, according to my sources, that there is no overlap, then it is hardly surprising that people ask questions and want to know exactly how things stand.
What we shall not support - and I say this now as a member of the budgetary authority, we are talking here first and foremost as the budgetary authority - are overlapping structures.
We cannot stand and watch two different people doing the same work under the same structures for the same tasks in the European Union.
That cannot be.
In this respect, we have to know what the common foreign and security policy should look like in the future and who is to be responsible for it.
We need concepts here and the Council and Commission need to know where they stand here.
We shall, of course, bring our standpoint very clearly to bear in the overall debate.
We shall wield our power as budgetary authority on every future demand in order to stop this sort of blunder.
Now is not the time to be petty.
Europe's share of the common foreign and security policy is still very small.
We should not start by being petty.
But we shall monitor how everything develops very closely, we shall address painful subjects and say stop as soon as we get the feeling that we are being taken for a ride.
That cannot be.
We shall agree here, but everyone should know that we shall be extremely vigilant in connection both with heading 5 and with how expenditure develops and with future developments in the common foreign and security policy.
Of course, we shall also give our input so that a forward-looking policy for the world and for Europe as a whole can be developed.
Mr President, first I would like to thank Mr Ferber for an excellent report.
I know that it was the result of hard negotiations in which the rapporteur and the other representatives of the Committee on Budgets successfully defended the rights of the European Parliament.
With the supplementary and amending budget the Council intends to set up three new directorates within its General Secretariat to implement the common European security and defence policy.
These directorates are: 1. a Political Affairs Directorate, 2. an Operations and Exercises Directorate, and 3. an External Action Mechanisms Directorate.
There would be a total of 140 employees involved in this new organisation, of which 51 would be in newly created posts.
One' s attention is drawn the urgency of the situation.
Why is there such a hurry to create the new posts immediately, even though the actual budget is to be discussed in a few months' time?
Another problem is the overlapping of functions.
The structure of the organisation menacingly indicates that the same functions are to be discharged in the areas of both crisis prevention and civil crisis management in the Commission and the Council.
This overlapping must definitely be prevented.
Under pressure from Parliament, the Council is now creating a special Title in its budget for the common security and defence policy.
It is obvious that this will involve the creation of an entirely new Council activity, which will, in fact, have nothing to do with normal administrative expenditure.
For this reason the 'gentlemen' s agreement' between Parliament and the Council, according to which they undertake not to interfere in each other' s budgets, cannot be extended to these actions.
Expenditure relating to the common security and defence policy falls within the competence of Parliament.
Finally, it should be noted that the margin for 'Administrative Expenditure' in heading 5 is now only EUR 34 million.
On the threshold of enlargement this is so little that it does not make possible any operative additional expenditure at the cost of administrative expenditure.
Mr President, I too must say that this is a most interesting debate.
We already had a taste of it in committee when Mr Laschet suddenly stepped forward ardently advocating rejection, despite belonging to the same group as the rapporteur.
If we are in favour of rejection today, it is not because we do not appreciate Mr Ferber's work.
On the contrary, we truly believe that Mr Ferber was a tough negotiator.
We have the greatest respect.
Nonetheless, we take the view that one voice here in Parliament must give a clear warning because a development is being introduced here which should give us all cause for concern.
Like the previous speaker, I consider that this agreement cannot come under the gentlemen's agreement because it does not concern administrative expenditure.
These are politically charged questions, as Mr Ferber has already made clear in his speech.
They are also questions of transparency and control of the common foreign and security policy and of defence policy.
Here too we are of one opinion.
But Mr Ferber believes that introducing a separate title is sufficient guarantee that Parliament will be able to exercise control in the future.
We have our doubts.
We take the view that this separate title alone does not empower Parliament; on the contrary, because these posts are the Council's responsibility, they are beyond our influence and control.
I think this is the deciding factor; not just the overlap, but the question of who can exercise control.
What is at stake here is the delicate balance of power between Parliament, the Commission and the Council.
The Council is taking on more and more, trying to resolve more and more intergovernmentally rather than by really communitising these areas.
That would mean making the Commission responsible and strengthening Parliament's right of control. That is our one great fear, namely that we have no real control.
There is also another point which must also be addressed.
In our view this question should be resolved in a conciliation procedure, not under a trialogue, because that would demonstrate exactly how much importance we attach to this question and just how much store we set by Parliament's having full right of control.
I think that the Council should be quite clear that Parliament will not brook this policy of using supplementary budgets to alter political relations and the political balance of power.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, just two brief comments.
First, may I assure you on behalf of the Commission that we shall make very sure that no overlapping structures are created - and I say that not just as the member of the Commission responsible for the budget.
Secondly, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur and the Committee on Budgets on using their initiative and exerting pressure to bring about a change in how the budget is represented, a change which affects not just how it is represented per se but which represents an important contribution towards both enhanced democratic control and transparency.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Commission presentation of the preliminary draft budget for 2002
The next item is the Commission presentation of the preliminary draft budget for 2002.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we acknowledge the Commission's preliminary draft budget and, as always, shall check very closely to ensure that sufficient account has been taken of the priorities set in advance by the European Parliament.
By that I mean both new and traditional priorities.
No doubt the rapporteur, Costa Neves, will have something to say about this now.
We shall have to check that the Union's revenue is going to be used efficiently and for its intended purpose within the framework of our budgetary law, the financial regulation and the commitments entered into.
And we shall have to look very closely to ensure that due account has been taken of the reforms announced, only some of which have just begun.
Obviously, we too want a speedy and fair budgetary procedure without too much arm wrestling.
The Council needs to heed that more than in previous years.
I should also like to add the following in the wake of the discussions and votes in the Committee on Budgets this year: we shall oppose any suggestion which tries to trim or limit the budgetary powers of the European Parliament in any way, such as by amending the financial regulation or in some other wondrous manner.
I also advise the Commission to take a constructive position which favours Parliament here on all these questions.
That will be a help to all of us who so keenly refer to ourselves as allies in the European integration process.
The truth is we have commitments of EUR 100 billion, payments of 97.8 billion, payments well below the ceiling or 1.06% of GNP or, to put it another way, EUR 265 per capita of the population, of which EUR 121 per capita is for agricultural for agricultural produce, policy and the countryside.
That sounds solid enough.
Taken overall, it is geared towards stability and certainly does not overburden the Member States, the taxpayers or consumers, as many official but emotional and one-sided accounts would have us believe.
At the same time, however, it is the penultimate budget of the Union of the Fifteen.
We need to bear that in mind at this point.
I just want to list a few points which will be important to us.
It is good that the Commission intends to do more about clearing the backlog of payments.
Commissioner Schreyer has just quoted a few figures here.
But we also need a guarantee that payments for new commitments will be dealt with speedily so as to avoid another mountain of backlogs in the future.
We also welcome thoughts of setting up an earmarked reserve in the agricultural area.
The idea of creating a contingency reserve, given the imponderable nature of these markets, was originally Parliament's.
I would add that the ad hoc procedure has proven to be an increasingly constructive procedure between the institutions over recent years.
The actual figures will be available in the autumn.
It is good that the Commission has left room for manoeuvre in internal policy.
Nonetheless, the reasons behind certain estimates require clarification. For example, -5.3% for culture and the audiovisual sector, below average rates of +1.8% in the area of social dimension and employment and -14.5% in the area of the labour market and technological innovation.
These are examples of where there is a real need for consultation.
In foreign policy - which was addressed earlier - the question arises of how democratic control and discussion of operational expenditure under the common foreign and security policy will take place in future.
Then there is the fact that Asia is down 2.2%, Latin America is down 6% and food aid is down 4.5%.
The question is, has the necessary balance between traditional priorities and new tasks been duly safeguarded or might this positioning be construed as concentrating on Europe and its neighbours.
That would be too little for me from a foreign policy point of view.
Commissioner, I should like to address one final point: administration.
I should like to remind you that Parliament stipulated that the second tranche of 317 posts was linked to the early retirement commitment, so as to bring about a bit more budgetary neutrality, and it is up to the institutions to achieve this.
I remember the resolution passed in spring last year, in which we clearly stated that the second tranche was linked to very clear, precise considerations as to how measures to guarantee the ability of the European Union to act during the course of the enlargement process could be prepared while retaining the substance of the acquis communautaire.
I should like to remind you of this resolution.
Clearly, therefore, we shall all be called on to discuss the introduction of and introduce a realistic pre-accession and accession strategy as of this year, including in the administrative area, so that we have sufficient time left over to include this aspect in the budgetary policy.
I get the impression from all the discussions that resolving these questions will be more difficult and more complicated that resolving many agricultural and structural problems, which is why we intend to tackle these and other questions during the budgetary procedure.
Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to begin by emphasising the need to respect the timetable unveiled by the Commission when it presented its preliminary draft budget. I must say that it did provide us with the information we needed.
This is a further contribution to a positive climate for the debate on the proposed budget for 2002.
My initial reaction to the preliminary draft budget is that, overall, I welcome the proposal to increase appropriations for commitment by 3.4% and for payment by 4.8%.
The difference between these figures seems insufficient, given the need to make good payments that are overdue.
I would point out that one of the European Parliament' s priorities is precisely to eliminate quickly the difference between commitments given and payments that have actually been guaranteed.
To confirm our fears, the reduction of unpaid commitments (RAL), will be in appearance only.
The truth is that, if the increase in appropriations is insufficient, paying the commitments that have been outstanding the longest will delay the payment of new commitments.
This would be the equivalent of rehashing the RAL and would not solve the problem.
The solution lies in paying off old RAL, specifically in categories 3 (internal policy) and 4 (external action), not in creating further RAL.
With regard to this matter, we shall carefully analyse the progress report that is to be presented to us at the end of June, as was agreed, and we will continue to do everything we can to improve the budget' s implementation rates. In other words, we want to contribute to a more effective discharge of the European Union' s commitments.
I have noted the fact that, despite the 4.8% increase proposed for payments, these will remain at a level of 1.06% of the European Union' s GDP, whereas the financial perspective would allow the figure to reach 1.10% in 2002.
I must also stress that we shall be undertaking a thorough assessment of the Commission' s commitment to the priorities defined by Parliament which feature in the broad economic guidelines adopted in April.
In the agricultural sector in particular - category 1 - I have paid close attention to the impact of the BSE and foot-and-mouth crises on the budget.
It would be useful to have the precise figures as soon as possible.
Nevertheless, the existence of a reserve of EUR 1 billion proposed by the Commission seems acceptable, given the unpredictable nature of these crises.
I would state my view once again, however, that we consider a reserve always to be non-compulsory expenditure, as we want to be able to intervene in decisions on its use.
We hope to find out, in the Letter of Amendment which is to be presented following first reading, if not before, exactly what the costs arising from BSE and foot-and-mouth disease are.
In this context, I would remind you that we are counting on a Commission document on the direction to take with regard to the mid-term review of the last common agricultural policy reform, in which I hope to see consistency between the decisions taken on the crisis, and guidelines for the future.
The broad economic guidelines give 15 September as the date for this document to be presented.
The Letter of Amendment is another possibility to consider for the presentation of this document.
With regard to fisheries and given the much-discussed failure of the Fisheries Agreement with Morocco and the consequent need to restructure our fleets, we must make a careful assessment of how this will be funded.
In internal policies (category 3), the current margin is limited and the broad economic guidelines lay down clear priorities in this area, which must be respected.
In external action (category 4), it is still difficult to guarantee the stability of the European Union' s action.
Reprogrammings have been the rule and we are concerned about the possibility of once again facing reductions in appropriations in budget lines to which we attach great importance. I am referring here to Latin America, human rights and the fight against Aids, for example.
In the meantime, in the Balkans, where the European Union has also made clear commitments, we are seeing, as I understand it, a reduction in budgetary resources.
Everything indicates that account has not yet been taken of the report by the World Bank, which will give precise details of reconstruction needs.
What will happen then?
And what about the operational costs of our defence and security policy?
In the field of administration (category 5), to what extent are the appropriations proposed sufficient, when added together, to cope with the reform of the Commission, enlargement, the launch of new policies, an increase in the Council' s budget of around 10%, and the proposals of other institutions?
It seems quite clear that the resources decided on in Berlin are insufficient.
We shall see.
In the field of pre-accession, (category 7), I would stress that Parliament came out in favour of reallocating unused appropriations, similarly to what is happening in category 2.
Once again, I wish to state my hope that we can maintain a constructive approach to the debate that has now begun.
Consensus with the Commission and the Council is both desirable and possible.
We must therefore watch out for clouds on the horizon, and I am referring specifically to the fact that the Committee on Budgets today voted on its position on the financial regulation.
I would stress that this position complies with the broad economic guidelines.
These stated that Parliament will not hesitate to reconsider its position on such matters in its budgetary decisions.
It is still possible to guarantee a real assessment of our position on the revision of the financial regulation.
I thank the rapporteur and the Commissioner.
Estimates of the European parliament for 2002
The next item is the report (A5-0166/2001) by Mrs Buitenweg, on behalf of the Committee for Budgets, on the estimates of revenue and expenditure of Parliament for the financial year 2002 [2001/2062(BUD)].
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today, during the formal meeting with President Schuster of the Republic of Slovakia, we spoke yet again of the historical opportunity of overcoming once and for all the division of Europe.
An opportunity that must be given concrete shape, as the honourable Member BÃ¶ge said.
In just three years' time we shall be able to work together on an equal footing with colleagues from current candidate countries, at any rate in theory.
Consequently we must speed up institutional changes to ensure that enlargement goes smoothly.
We shall shortly be receiving the three-year plan on administrative preparation.
Perhaps then, we may come to the conclusion that it would be sensible to employ civil servants from candidate countries in advance so that they can play a part in preparing for enlargement.
Think, for example, of people required to set up a language regime.
It therefore strikes me as extreme foolish to reject that option now in the resolution of Parliament.
Enlargement must be prepared for not only administratively, but also substantively.
In order to exchange mutual experiences it is important that contacts between ourselves and colleagues from candidate countries are intensified.
The Committee on Budgets asks that the most appropriate form for this be included in the three-year plan.
I myself can imagine that it might, for instance, be useful if a very limited number of facilities were offered to these parliamentarians and future Member States so that their visits are as effective and useful as possible.
Mr President, enlargement will increase pressure on the margin of the budget.
It is therefore a financially sound policy to pay off real estate costs faster, creating scope for future budgets.
In addition accelerated financing leads to considerable savings in interest.
It is, though, a pity that I now have the doubtful honour of being the rapporteur who is investing a very considerable sum in the parliament building here in Strasbourg.
But you will agree with me that for as long as the Parliament is condemned to being a travelling circus, it is not sensible to force another EUR 210 million down the throat of the European taxpayer.
It is becoming less and less of one, so that it is all that money for just four days in Strasbourg.
This brings me nicely to another point in which I hope content will win out over the fine words, and that is the environmental audit.
Mr President, this House also devoted some fine words a few years ago to the desirability of an environmental audit.
An interinstitutional working party was even set up.
But since it was not given the slightest priority, it was short-lived.
So we shall now again, and more resolutely, take responsibility and consequently, Parliament should make a clear political promise to participate in EMAS, the Community eco-management and audit system.
Our political position against discrimination must be converted here in this House into policy.
Equality of opportunity is still not a reality.
And I am talking not only about women in influential positions but, for example, about equal treatment irrespective of sexual orientation, race or religion.
The Committee on Budgets therefore asks the Secretary-General for clarification on what measures are necessary to be able to keep the promise of Article 13 of the Treaty of Amsterdam.
Mr President, in recent years we have gained greater understanding of the advantages of Activity Based Budgeting and Activity Based Management.
The old management structures method of budgeting need a radical overhaul and part of that is a clear division of responsibilities between the Bureau and the Committee on Budgets in the area of personnel policy as at present specified in the budgetary procedure.
The Committee on Budgets examines the financial envelope and its limitations and the Bureau concerns itself with specific content.
This system must be complemented by guiding statements by the House to the Bureau and close monitoring of the management of the Secretary-General.
Should problems arise in future with the Bureau or the Administration, they should lead to changes at that level and not to the assumption of management responsibilities by a House of 626 political representatives.
The new modus operandi must go hand in hand with a radical change in culture, so that the Administration can be democratic, monitored and also very decisive.
To those honourable Members who have been seriously concerned about the margin of category 5, I can say by way of reassurance that that this afternoon' s vote on the schedule of part-sessions for next year at any rate turned out very favourably financially.
Estimates were based on a four-day week in Strasbourg and the decision now taken entails no change in costs.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the rapporteur for her hard work on behalf of the members in the run up to the preparation of Parliament's budget.
Nonetheless, I should like to take this opportunity to pick out one or two points and examine them more closely.
Enlargement: of course we must prepare for enlargement.
But anyone who thinks that preparing for enlargement merely means creating new posts has failed to recognise the problem.
Everything has to be tested against what we have learned to appreciate and love about the modus operandi of the European Parliament over the last twenty years.
We face a huge challenge if we want to master all that.
Nor is it a question of creating new posts and manning them with officials from applicant countries.
Why are there no other options in situ?
For example, the Commission intends to work with satellites in applicant countries in the translation area.
We need to create information offices because we have a problem as regards the acceptance of accession to the European Union.
That is our job as representatives of the people.
It is not a question of taking a few people to the fleshpots of Europe here in Strasbourg or in Brussels or Luxembourg, it is a question of bringing people to the European Union.
That is best done locally.
That is why I ask you to consider carefully what really needs to be done and what is better done through activities in the candidate countries, in order to save money.
The Commission is on the right track here.
Buildings policy: I agree with the rapporteur that, as things stand, the cheapest solution here in Strasbourg is to pay off the outstanding amounts as quickly as possible.
But that is only the second cheapest solution.
We must be clear about that.
The cheapest solution would be to build ourselves.
Then we can decide on the layout and fittings, without having to admit in the end that someone has done well out of us and that now we must somehow take over.
We went through that in Brussels and we have been through it here.
We could show a bit more intelligence here.
That would be the cheapest solution.
What we are doing is the second cheapest and I should like to make that clear.
Staff policy: I am surprised at the administration, which is calling for numerous new posts on the one hand, while at the same time making increasing concessions in the so-called non-occupancy quota.
This means that more posts are saved than new posts requested.
We still need an in-depth discussion of how this can be reconciled.
In other words, there is a great deal of room for manoeuvre by transferring staff between the services of the European Parliament without always needing to create new posts straight away.
I can tell you now that the PPE group will be looking at this issue very closely in the autumn, once we have the actual figures to work with.
I am delighted that the rapporteur has also taken up our transport options.
I hope that we shall not have to cycle around Brussels.
I consider that far too dangerous.
I think the initiative by the town of Strasbourg following the change in the mayor's office is real progress. We too can take the tram now.
Perhaps we can take the metro in Brussels.
That would take us one stage further.
But, as I say, bicycles in general are too dangerous in my book.
I hope that we can find a reasonable solution here.
We in the PPE shall carry out a strict and close examination of the budget line by line in the autumn, once the figures are available.
But let me make one thing clear: if the report is adopted tomorrow, this does not mean free passage for the reading which we shall have to hold in September or October.
Madam President, I also wish to congratulate the rapporteur on her work; I support most of what she has said, especially on reform.
You may be aware of the findings of a recent Euro poll, which showed that the European Parliament is one of the most recognised of all EU institutions.
Therefore, the onus is really on us to ensure that we increase the confidence of European citizens in the EU as a whole.
This is why we need to set an example and lead the way in improving effectiveness, transparency and accountability, as outlined by the rapporteur.
However, the reform process embarked upon so far sometimes feels a bit slow.
We need to speed things up in the coming year and try to embrace reform and modernise our working methods and decision-making processes.
As everyone agrees, this is essential because of the challenges presented by enlargement.
There is a clear danger that the EU could be deflected from its course if the public does not see concrete and swift reform being carried out on a significant scale.
All of us know that enlargement will have far-reaching effects on all aspects of Parliament's services.
The additional budgetary cost of enlargement could be in the region of EUR 145m per year, according to one report.
We could need about 459 new offices in Brussels alone.
This will need considerable planning, with all the implications well thought through.
Therefore, Parliament's three-year plan is essential to make enlargement successful.
It is critical that this plan should be considered and not rushed.
I strongly oppose the amendments tabled by the PPE-DE Group imposing a deadline before the summer for this report, because if we do not have a considered and well thought-out enlargement plan, it could backfire on us.
The PPE-DE Group has tabled other amendments, which are equally nonsensical and will not enhance the standing of the European Parliament if adopted.
What I find particularly astonishing is that, on the one hand, we are constantly nit-picking about minor new establishment posts for the executive and yet, in practice, we are happy to increase posts for the political parties, when it suits particular needs, without any real justification.
Where are the principles of budgetary rigour and efficiency which the PPE-DE Group often talks about?
It is important that we review these issues, but not at this stage.
I wish to stress that the three-year plan should be considered because we face many challenges, but we should - and must - be more dynamic in all areas, in particular languages and buildings, because that is where the substantial costs lie.
I hope the plan will in some ways think the unthinkable and radically review the language services, given that in two to three years' time we may have six new official languages to deal with.
Just to give you some food for thought: the Commission is a very different institution from us, but it manages to work in two languages.
Let me make it clear that I strongly believe in linguistic diversity, but we cannot just add on all these additional languages and still try to be an efficient and effective organisation.
In relation to buildings policy, we must carefully examine all available options.
I know there is a proposal to purchase this building, and although it makes financial sense here and now in terms of the savings we will make in the immediate future, I am concerned about the long-term suitability of the building: it hardly meets our requirements now, so what is it going to be like six years down the line?
Madam President, I will try and keep to the timetable.
Mrs Buitenweg has drawn up an excellent report as a basis for Parliament' s budget next year.
My sincerest thanks go to her accordingly.
Among the main challenges for the European Parliament are improved administration and increased efficiency.
The EU' s forthcoming enlargement will make these especially necessary.
Next year, we must prepare for the fact that in 2004 Parliament will grow by more than a hundred members bringing with them a dozen or so new languages.
This will make very special demands on the organisation and enhanced effectiveness of the translation and interpreting services.
There will also be totally new demands on general administration, which is why it is absolutely necessary to extend Activity Based Budgeting and Activity-Based Management to parliamentary administration also.
The other problem is buildings policy.
There must be an aim to rationalise the work of Parliament so that buildings expenditure can be cut.
Buying property is quite acceptable when money can be saved as a result.
On the other hand, we must insist that the Member States that have seats here do all they can to ensure that a swift decision can be taken on settlements in respect of property.
It does not do the host country credit if the European Parliament in its territory has inconceivable difficulties trying to establish a rational building policy.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
(The sitting was closed at 11 p.m.)
Address by Mr Schuster, President of the Slovak Republic
Ladies and gentlemen, I take particular pleasure in being able to welcome the presence here today, in this Chamber, of the President of the Slovak Republic, Mr Rudolf Schuster.
Mr President, since the Slovak Republic was founded on 1 January 1993, and particularly since Slovakia presented its candidature for accession to the European Union in 1995, relations between your country and the European Parliament have developed steadily and fruitfully, paving the way for mutual understanding and the building of ties of trust.
The change of government in 1998, and then your election as President of the Republic in the first presidential elections to be held in Slovakia using direct suffrage, in May 1999, are events that have had a very positive influence on enhancing relations between us and making them more effective.
Since you were invested in Bratislava, having served your country in various roles, including as mayor of the town of Kosice from 1994 to 1998, the Slovak government, led by Mr Dzurinda, the Prime Minister, has turned its policies towards the prospect of accession to the European Union.
Under your Presidency, Mr Schuster, democracy has been established and consolidated in Slovakia.
The Helsinki European Council of December 1999 took the decision to open the negotiations for accession, which began in March 2000.
The opening and progress of negotiations between your country and the European Union demonstrate, and I am particularly pleased to see this, that Slovakia has fully mastered the 'catching up' principle, because it was at the request of the European Parliament that this principle was established at the Helsinki European Council.
Slovakia has now decided to place itself, as you have just said, Mr President, at the vanguard of the accession process.
I want your country to know that it has the support of the European Parliament.
It can count on a totally constructive attitude towards this accession being achieved as soon as possible.
Mr President, I shall now ask you to address our Parliament.
(Applause)
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, only a short while ago I paid my tribute to the memory of Louise Weiss, an exceptional person, initiator of the idea of European unification, journalist and politician who gave the opening address at the first session of the European Parliament in 1979 - ten years before the fall of the Iron Curtain.
Louise Weiss was connected by ties of deep friendship with one of the most noted personalities of our history, a Slovak politician of European-wide standing - Milan Rastislav tefÃ¡nik - politician, diplomat, scientist and astronomer who made France his second home.
Louise Weiss said in her address to the European Parliament that it was the happiest day of her life.
Today, I have the exceptional and great honour to speak to you at the plenary session of the European Parliament, representing the most important political parties of the Member States of the European Union and for this opportunity I wish to thank you.
This is the first time that the Slovak language has been spoken at your plenary session.
It is my deep conviction that, in a not too distant future, it will become one of the official languages of the European Union.
Just as, geographically, my country is an indivisible part of the European continent, its history, culture and traditions are an inseparable part of European history.
Shutting my country out behind the Iron Curtain was nothing more than an artificial move by the holders of power on the political chessboard of history.
It is therefore natural that we should link the future of Slovakia with Europe.
Europe that is unified and prosperous, peaceful and attractive.
Our common Europe.
You are performing your work for Europe in a truly momentous period.
Your term coincides with the taking of historical decisions on enlargement which, and this is my deep conviction, represents the most important contribution to the stability and prosperity of our continent in its modern history.
We owe you our respect and gratitude for promoting this process.
The citizens of Slovakia will always bear this in mind.
The accession of the Slovak Republic to the European Union is among the key priorities of our foreign policy.
However, I view accession also from the broader perspective of the development of our society and of Europe.
Slovakia's progression towards the European Union means that the country is returning to the culture and civilisation where it belongs both by its history and its system of values.
This is the general framework in which the Slovak Republic defined its foreign policy priorities right from the outset, when it set out to obtain full membership of the European Union and NATO.
In 2000 Slovakia gained membership of the OECD and is one of the most hopeful candidates for NATO membership when the Alliance decides to enlarge.
We are pleased to note that around 70% of our population of more than five million people support accession to the European Union.
What is even more important is that this percentage includes the supporters of the strongest opposition parties, because these political parties too, currently in opposition, built their political programmes on the integration ambitions of the Slovak Republic.
The right course of Slovakia's security policy whose ultimate goal is membership in the North Atlantic Alliance, through active participation in the European Security and Defence Policy was confirmed by the security strategy document adopted by our legislature.
The fact that this document was adopted with the support of an absolute majority in Parliament, demonstrates that both the ruling coalition and the opposition pursue the same strategic principles when it comes to the future orientation of the Slovak Republic.
However, as the President of a young democratic country, I cannot fall victim to the feeling of self-satisfaction with this rare political consensus.
Ever since I assumed my presidential office I have been trying to impress not only on the political leaders, but also on all those who are not indifferent to the future of Slovakia, that the direction of the country must not depend on a momentary euphoria or on the fleeting political preferences of those in power.
This is the reason why I and a group of experts are drafting a medium-term and a long-term vision, which should be adopted as a constitutional statute by the National Council of the Slovak Republic with the support of the broadest possible political spectrum.
This document - may I call it a State doctrine - should define in very clear terms and at the highest legislative level the future orientation of Slovakia to the European and transatlantic structures.
It would convincingly dispel the doubts with which I am often confronted during by trips abroad in my discussions with the friends and observers of Slovakia who ask: "What changes can be again expected in the foreign policy orientation of Slovakia after the next elections?"
As I have said, we are pleased with the public support for the integration ambitions of Slovakia.
However, we cannot ignore the worries or mistrust among citizens of the EU Member States who fear that the enlargement of the Union could have undesirable consequences.
I can understand their concerns - they are natural and human.
At the same time I have the impression that these worries are often conjured up artificially.
It is not our wish to disturb what has been achieved in the integration process in past decades.
We have to jointly focus on two areas.
We - in the applicant countries - must thoroughly prepare for membership and, together with the EU members, we should alleviate the doubts concerning enlargement.
And we must work together to strengthen European solidarity and the feeling of togetherness.
Europe is not only a map.
I am convinced that the basis for its permanent revival is an ongoing honest dialogue with the citizens of the unifying Europe.
The entry of each new country will enrich the common house by its spiritual, cultural and historical heritage.
We want to contribute to the enlargement of the common market but at the same time we want to be a contribution to the economy and thus contribute to greater stability and security for all of Europe.
You are familiar with the fact that the Slovak Republic was not invited to open accession negotiations in 1997 in Luxembourg because of its failure to fulfil the Copenhagen political criteria.
This was not a good situation for Slovakia.
The European Parliament was the first to respond to the new situation in the Slovak Republic through its Resolution of October 1998, which acknowledged the changes in the style of government of the country and its new orientation after the elections.
I would like to take this opportunity to state how highly I regard the relations between the European Parliament and the Slovak Republic which, especially during the last two years, have gained a new momentum.
The relations between the European Parliament and the National Council of the Slovak Republic have also intensified thanks to the activities of the Joint Parliamentary Committee which I personally highly appreciate.
Parliamentary democracy is also greatly strengthened by the joint meetings between the President of the European Parliament and the presidents of the parliaments of applicant countries.
The next such meeting is to be held in a few days in Bratislava.
Slovakia was invited to open negotiations on accession to the European Union in 1999 in Helsinki.
Today - after 17 months of negotiations - we note great progress.
I am convinced that by the end of the Swedish Presidency we will provisionally close negotiations on more than half the chapters.
At this rate our country has a chance to catch up with the countries that had started negotiations earlier, and to complete accession negotiations by the end of 2002.
We make no secret of our hope that the citizens of the Slovak Republic will also cast their votes in the 2004 elections to the European Parliament.
The path of integration is interspersed with exceptionally lively political discussions and, sometimes, disputes.
We are happy that we have got rid of the one-sided monologue of political elites we knew in the past.
This path is not a smooth one, but the prospect of future membership of the European Union multiplies the sorely needed pro-reform energy.
I want to assure you that we have no shortage of this energy.
The year 2000 was the year of the "economy".
We continued implementing the reforms launched by the Slovak Government after its coming to power in 1998 with a view to restoring stability at the macro-economic level.
Structural adjustment brought improvements in the effectiveness of the corporate sector.
However, if I want to take a realistic view of the economy of my country, I must consider it from the point of view of the everyday life of people, their economic possibilities.
And here I realise - as confirmed in my direct contacts with the citizens of my country - that economic reforms can have painful consequences for the socially weakest groups of the population.
I am convinced that the current - and the most difficult - phase of the reform will soon bring its positive effects.
In this respect, I feel that the Slovak Government may have lost some time when, during its first year in power, it was too absorbed with pointing to the mistakes of the previous government and pronouncements of the need to eliminate their consequences, rather than immediately and constructively tackling all the problems, especially in the economic field.
It is too late to say now that if the style of government had been more flexible right from the start, today the citizens could enjoy the fruit of all those sound economic steps.
This too is the reason why in every political or professional discussion on the subject of economic and legal reforms I stand up as an advocate of the reforms, even though I always view them in terms of their benefits for the majority of our citizens.
This year, 2001, is the year of "legislation".
In February the Slovak Parliament passed the long awaited amendment to the Constitution, compatible with the constitutions of EU Member States.
The amendment has put in place the legal prerequisites for the integration of Slovakia.
The amended text explicitly provides that the Slovak Republic may delegate the exercise of some of its powers to the European Union through or on the basis of an international treaty.
The amendment also lays down the precedence of legally binding acts of the European Union over the laws of the Slovak Republic.
Moreover, it sets out the procedure for the transposition of legally binding acts into the national legislation in the form of laws and government ordinances.
Other necessary steps include the taking of measures for implementing public administration reform, completing structural reform, strengthening the banking sector and building a modern state administration.
The national legal system of the Slovak Republic is based on the principles of democracy and the rule of law.
Through its Constitution and the ratified international instruments on human rights, the state guarantees the enjoyment of rights and freedoms to all citizens without any distinction.
However, unemployment and the adverse economic situation in some regions of Slovakia have created serious problems for dealing with the issue of the Roma national minority.
In my opinion, finding effective solutions in this area is one of the most important tasks of society as a whole.
The serious attention given to this problem by the government is expressed through the Government's Strategy for Addressing Roma National Minority Issues and the set of measures for its implementation.
I take the view that this is not a problem of Slovakia alone, but a broader European problem whose solution is very complex and requires a partner-like approach.
The visit to Roma settlements in Slovakia by Commissioner GÃŒnther Verheugen exemplifies the commitment to a common approach to dealing with the Roma issue, which is one of the key areas that will require our attention in the future.
During my years as the mayor of the city of Kosice, situated in the region with higher concentrations of the Roma population, I learned the basic precept - effective assistance requires active involvement of the Roma themselves in the solution of their problems, otherwise the efforts will be wasted.
The Project on Eliminating the Disproportions of the Roma National Minority, launched on my initiative, envisages the participation of the representatives of individual Roma groups in its implementation.
The first experience gained indicates that the level of legal awareness and democratic thinking - even among educated Roma - has been marked by decades of a paternalistic approach by the state to the Roma community whose members find it difficult to exercise their powers.
This is why I believe that this issue will still have to be addressed by the generations that come after us.
I have also brought my initiative to the attention of the Presidents of other Visegrad Group countries; we agreed to adopt a common procedure with the President of the Czech Republic.
I fully agree with the individual approach and the assessment of the countries on their merits.
This is the reason why we internally are striving to make the Slovak Republic take its place among the first countries to enter the European Union.
We make no secret of our ambition to do it together with our neighbours - the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland, our partners in the Visegrad cooperation process.
This cooperation, which strengthens our good neighbourly relations, is being positively received both at home and abroad.
Not only does it enhance the atmosphere of regional European allegiance, but is also an important element of integration.
In this connection, on my initiative and in cooperation with the President of the Republic of Poland, several cross-border cooperation projects were launched under the patronage of the Chancellery of the President.
Because of their positive results I plan to extend similar projects also to other border regions - those with Hungary and the Czech Republic.
I attach great historic significance to the creation and functioning of the Visegrad grouping whose aim is to encourage close cohesion of an mutually beneficial cooperation within the central European region as the basis for its future integration into economic, political and security structures.
These common objectives of the V-4 countries contribute to the development of Europe as a whole and to expanding the zone of stability to the entire continent.
The idea of the accession of Visegrad countries to the European Union as one group has logical implications for the definition of the Schengen-type border whose length will depend on the map of the enlarged European Union.
When speaking about the future of the European Union, the discussion on which was launched in the wake of the Nice summit, I would personally prefer to speak about the near future and the distant future.
It would not be easy to mix everything together and to try to resolve all the issues facing the European Union by 2004.
I support the opinion that the candidate countries should be given a chance to effectively contribute to the exchange of views in the preparation for the 2004 Intergovernmental Conference.
It is personally hardly conceivable for me to see the prospective members of a family left standing at a closed door during the discussions on important matters that concern everybody, older members, newer members and prospective newcomers, especially if the latter are expected to enter the family within the time horizon in question.
We all, both members and candidates for membership, want a stronger Europe.
We may agree with many, although not all the opinions.
Thus, it would not be appropriate to delay the process of enlargement on the ground of what I consider to be unjustified worries about the enlargement bringing the threat of "dilution" of the European Union, or endangering the possibility of the continued political integration.
I am convinced that the Slovak Republic and other candidate countries are no less prepared for further integration than some current members.
Our objective must be to further build the European Union as a political community.
I agree with the words of the President of the European Parliament Madame Nicole Fontaine according to whom we cannot continue building the European Union in "closed circles".
At a certain stage of development, several issues may emerge and require solution, while it is not always possible to resolve all of them.
But the process must continue and the system must remain open.
An important part of the entire European integration process is the building of the European identity.
National identity plays an important role in the life of individuals, because it is the means for their self-identification and affiliation with a certain group.
As the President and a citizen of the Slovak Republic, I have no worries about the loss of sovereignty after our accession to the European Union, because in an integrating Europe, a sovereign country is one that takes part in the decisions that concern the development and direction of the European Union.
The entry of the Slovak Republic to the European Union will be the real completion of sovereignty of our country.
The future of Slovakia lies with the European Union which will become the area of freedom, security and justice.
I am speaking to you as a European to Europeans, facing a unique challenge and immense responsibility.
Let us turn the ideal of common spiritual values and historic experience into the reality of a unified and prosperous Europe, attractive to all citizens of its countries and serving as an example for other regions and continents.
The Slovak Republic declares its willingness to share in this common responsibility.
Thank you for this opportunity of addressing you
(Loud and sustained applause)
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
Madam President, yesterday, as we all know, there was a minor incident here during the debate on the situation of Turkish prisoners.
In this connection it was stated, by the Vice-President in the Chair amongst others, that the Committee on Budgets was blocking the posts which were necessary to strengthen the security service.
As the rapporteur responsible, I should like to state here that the posts requested were entered in the reserve with the agreement of the Bureau and that the Bureau has not yet made any request for these proposed posts to be taken out of the reserve.
I firmly refute, therefore, the accusation that the Budgets Committee is blocking the posts necessary to improve security in Parliament.
In so doing I would point out that the Bureau is required to request the relevant transfer of appropriations.
Mr Ferber, your point has very little, if anything, to do with the Minutes.
That said, you raise the issue of yesterday' s incident.
I can assure you that we take such incidents quite as seriously as they deserve.
The Quaestors have already met and looked into the matter.
I would also point out that the group involved was brought in by a Member, and neither he nor his assistant seemed to be around any more, so it was a kind of orphan group, no longer accompanied.
That is one thing.
As regards the Bureau, Mr Ferber, thank you for raising that, we are currently working to adopt some very strict security measures, which I believe many Members want in the interest of our institution, because what happened yesterday is one thing, but other things could happen.
Everyone is well aware of that.
Of course, the Bureau is seeking the cooperation of the Committee on Budgets.
We hope we will be successful as soon as possible.
Madam President, yesterday's incident has nothing to do with the fact that certain posts have not yet been approved.
The two are wholly unconnected.
Firstly, a mistake was made at the checkpoint here on the way into the Chamber.
The people are there. We do not need any new posts.
Secondly, people are saying that the security guards posted at the entrances were responsible.
That does not have anything to do with the posts either.
What is important is that we improve security.
Mr Ferber is right there.
However, there is no direct link to yesterday's incident.
(Applause)
Absolutely, Mr Schmid, that is what I said myself: yesterday' s incident is one thing, the general security problem is another.
Madam President, I also wish to address item 23 in yesterday's Minutes concerning security.
We are all very grateful for the explanation that you have given about how the matter occurred yesterday, and it is very important that the House recognises the point that you also made, namely that this is a subject that the Bureau is also currently discussing.
It is an extremely serious and vitally important point, because security in this House is not good enough.
What happened yesterday, however, is slightly different, because it calls into question the status and the responsibility of individual Members as to whom they invite into this House.
We have had a very lively discussion in our own political group this morning on this matter, and I am going to ask you, Madam President, to convene a special meeting of the Bureau so that all these matters can be discussed.
I recognise that it is already on the agenda of the Bureau and is an on-going discussion, but it is so important that we have time to consider the issue properly that I believe we need a special meeting of the Bureau and I hereby request you to convene that meeting.
Thank you Mr Provan.
We will see if that is possible tomorrow morning.
I am joking.
That being so, on 30 May, we will look at the whole situation in all its aspects.
I do not think Mr Provan has understood my invitation.
Thank you very much indeed for that statement, Mr Wurtz.
Madam President, what I have to say concerns the Minutes to the extent that, although it states correctly in the German version of the Minutes that the Secretary-General has been asked to report to the Bureau on the matter, at least in the Spanish version of the Minutes - admittedly I have not been able to check all eleven language versions - it states that posts are being blocked by the Committee on Budgets.
I should like to request that the Minutes be aligned with the German language version.
The Spanish version, in any case, is incorrect.
Madam President, I should simply like to add one more point: the striking thing about this situation was that one of the three people who caused the commotion here was the same person who attacked the Turkish Foreign Minister during a meeting of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy.
I should like this to be recorded in the Minutes once again.
I did say it yesterday to your representative.
Surely it cannot be possible for an individual, who has been identified, not to be banned from entering this House!
Why is there not a computer with an alarm signal stored in it by means of which a person of this kind is denied access?
There must be no repeat of this!
I would really ask you to ensure that these matters are investigated.
Quite, Mrs Pack.
Mr Wurtz did indeed explain that his colleague had been mislead, but you raise another issue, which I have also recognised. We are going to look into it, together with the Quaestors, to prevent this happening again and ensure that security checks are in place.
Madam President, I want to speak on the item 'statute and financing of European political parties' .
I do not think the Minutes accurately reflect the point Mr Ribeiro e Castro raised yesterday.
He invoked Rule 143 of the Rules of Procedure, raising the question of prejudice and contesting the legal base for Mrs Schleicher' s report.
A majority in Parliament agreed with Mr Ribeiro e Castro' s interpretation, and as there is therefore a question of prejudice - the fact that the Treaty of Nice has not yet been ratified - it seems to me that Parliament certainly cannot return to this issue pending the Treaty' s ratification.
It cannot therefore be put back on Parliament' s agenda.
I would also like to thank the President for the sitting, Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca, for the way he conducted yesterday' s debate, and mention a letter from Mrs Palacio, who reminds each of us that the legal bases underpinning Parliament' s decisions are not determined by strength of majority alone, but also by legal factors and assessments.
Mr Dupuis, I do not feel that what you have just said requires us to amend the Minutes for yesterday' s sitting.
Is that what you said yesterday, Mr Berthu?
Absolutely, Madam President, those were the remarks I made yesterday and they do not appear in the Minutes.
Very well, we shall amend the Minutes so that your remarks are properly reported.
You have jumped ahead rather, but we are still on the Minutes.
That being the case, we will be able to save time later on.
Madam President, with a view to clarifying the situation, allow me to say the following: yesterday, as we all know, there was great confusion here in the Chamber, and I do not wish to reopen the debate on the issue itself at this stage.
However, the reason why it was suggested that we should not debate this report on the status of political parties was in fact that it was said that it did not have a legal base.
In this respect it is right, however - as you said - that the relevant provision is Rule 143 of our Rules of Procedure.
Now the impression has been given that I and my colleagues thought that the report ought to be referred back to the committee; this has arisen from the fact that we mistook the number of the rule in the Rules of Procedure, and after all to err is human.
The relevant provision was Rule 143.
That is why there can be a vote straight away on whether we address this report or not.
Madam President, I have since read up on exactly what was written in the Minutes about the incident involving the demonstrators.
I would like to make something clear.
During the sitting, three demonstrators carrying banners entered the Chamber.
That is what it says.
I have to tell you that these three people did not make their way into the Chamber calmly, but sneaked in quickly, and they had not unfurled the banners at that stage.
They did not do this until they were in the Chamber, and our staff were unable to see them.
I simply wanted to say this, because as it is minuted here, one could assume that the staff should have noticed the fact that they were carrying banners.
That was not the case.
Are there any other comments?
Madam President, with regard to my speech on the debate about the inadmissibility or supposed inadmissibility of the Schleicher report on the status of parties, I asked for the point to be included in the agenda for today, but I would like to add the following: I made this request pursuant to Rule 111 of the Rules of Procedure, which gives the President the authority to propose it, and I would like this point to be added because here we are not debating a referral back to committee, but whether a commando act during a plenary sitting of Parliament can modify the agenda and wipe a subject as important as this from the attention of the Members of this House for years to come, basically, for ever.
Quite, Mr BarÃ³n Crespo.
We will make that change to the Minutes.
Madam President, I would ask the various parliamentary units to listen to yesterday' s tapes before recording Mr Baron Crespo' s opinion in the Minutes, as, to my mind, the opinion he expressed this morning is not the same as that he had yesterday.
We will look into all that, of course.
(Parliament approved the Minutes)
Agenda
Pursuant to Rule 111(2) of the Rules of Procedure, and at the request of several political groups, I propose to include in today' s agenda, as the first item, the report by Mrs Schleicher, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the statute and financing of European political parties.
Who wishes to speak in favour of this proposal?
Madam President, I do not wish to repeat all that I have just said.
It is completely justified to make this proposal here in accordance with Rule 111.
Our group, like the other groups - not all of them, but those which have a major interest in this issue, because we believe that it promotes democracy in Europe - are of the opinion that we must not give way to the opponents of Europe in order to postpone this report, but that we must do our duty here.
That is why we are in favour of this item being placed on the agenda and also of it being voted on today in the voting block at 12 noon.
The people of Europe expect us to discharge our responsibility here.
(Loud applause)
Thank you, Mr Poettering.
Mr Dell'Alba, you want to speak against this proposal.
Madam President, I cannot understand what Mr Poettering is talking about.
This does not actually involve either Europe or the citizens as such, but only the bureaucracies of the European political parties.
Under the rules you certainly have the right, Madam President, to ask for this report to be included, but I would like to remind you, before you confirm your request, that only yesterday afternoon, the Chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, Mr Napolitano, supported by six Members, Mr Gollnisch, Mr Abitbol, Mr Souladakis, Mr Onesta, Mr Krarup, and Mr Meijer, as well as the rapporteur himself, proposed dealing with this matter in committee as soon as possible, which seemed to me to be a wise gesture.
So I cannot understand the rush.
Secondly, while Rule 111 does indeed authorise you to take a proposal for an amendment, that Rule also stipulates that the agenda cannot be amended, except pursuant to Rules 112, 143 and so on. Rule 143 has been applied.
We are not going to do that twice in the same part-session and on the same subject.
That really is quibbling.
So let us be realistic, there is a mini-session soon.
Your services can, I think, wait a little while.
There is a serious problem about the legal base; Mr Napolitano, the Chairman, has said so. Let the Committee on Constitutional Affairs deal with the matter first.
We have heard one speaker in favour and one speaker against.
As reference has been made to action by the Chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, Mr Napolitano, and as he is asking for the floor, I am very happy to call him.
Afterwards, Parliament will decide.
In my speech of yesterday - as can be seen from the verbatim report - I certainly did not say, Mr Dell' Alba, that there is a problem of legal base.
I said the opposite: I said, rather, that in the matter of the legal base, in relation to the Treaties, of this Commission proposal - since we are discussing a Commission proposal and then Mrs Schleicher' s report - we had discussed it long and hard in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, and had also received an opinion from the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, which did not come up with any observation on the legal base of the measure.
As regards my proposal to convene the committee, that was a result of the confusion that Mr Poettering has mentioned.
I unfortunately arrived in the Chamber - and I apologise for that - once the vote had already been taken and I was given some inaccurate information.
Mr Berthu told me that he himself had thought of asking for a referral back to committee, but then in effect I realised that the vote had been taken under Rule 143 and not 144.
Therefore my intention to get ready to rapidly convene the Committee on Constitutional Affairs no longer made any sense, once I had found out what had been the base in the Rules of the vote taken in the House.
Mr Dell'Alba, I want you to know that before using Rule 111, I naturally gave the matter a great deal of thought.
I met with Mr Napolitano, I met with other Members, and of course I took careful note of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs on this problem of admissibility.
All the conditions seem to me to be in place - I say that in all conscience, but I may be wrong - for me to propose the inclusion of this item on the agenda under Rule 111.
(Parliament gave its assent)
The report therefore becomes the first item on the agenda.
Status and financing of European political parties
The next item is the report (A5-0167/2001) by Mrs Schleicher, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the statute and financing of European political parties (COM(2000) 898 - C5-0081/2001 - 2001/0011(CNS)).
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is regrettable that a number of meetings are taking place at the same time as this debate, despite the fact that this is an issue which actually concerns the whole Parliament.
Parties are the foundation stone of democracies.
Without parties, which ideally fight to establish a model which maximises the welfare of state and society, democracy is inconceivable.
Today, all 15 Member States of the European Union are ruled by democratic forms of state, and therefore by governments composed of varying combinations of political parties.
As citizens of democratically governed Member States we are right to attach importance to them; as Europeans we can rightly be proud of them.
Many people ask whether we need a statute for European parties.
The European Parliament is the only institution of the European Union which is legitimated by direct, free elections.
The European Parliament is also regarded as the cradle of European parties.
Cooperation in the groups required there to be increasingly close contacts between their constituent parties and with the national parties.
In this way, new international party structures and European parties gradually developed.
I should simply like to refer to the fact that the European People's Party has been in existence since 1976, the Party of European Socialists since 1992, the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party since 1993 and finally the European Federation of Green Parties also since 1993.
If my information is correct, two more European parties have apparently been founded since then, which means that we already have at least six European parties now.
The party political landscape is hardly uncomplicated.
The number of parties represented in national parliaments varies considerably across the Member States.
Our 626 Members of the European Parliament, at any rate, hail from 130 different national parties.
Italy, with 21 parties in the European Parliament, is represented by the greatest number of parties.
These different national parties have combined in the European Parliament to form eight groups, alongside the 14 non-attached Members.
In response to these various developments, Parliament has been calling for a legal base for European parties since the eighties.
The adoption of the Treaty of Maastricht ten years ago brought a breakthrough for the European Parliament in the shape of Article 191, which was adopted unanimously by the governments of the Member States.
This article reads: "Political parties at European level are important as a factor for integration within the Union.
They contribute to forming a European awareness and to expressing the political will of the citizens of the Union."
In the Treaty of Nice, Article 191 is amplified to turn that article, on its own, into a legal base.
"The Council, acting in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 251, shall lay down the regulations governing political parties at European level and in particular the rules regarding their funding."
European parties therefore make a valuable contribution to European integration, which should not be underestimated.
This work cannot be done by a national party.
To continue this work, European parties need, for example, office space and employees, which means, in other words, money.
Up until now the European parties have been supported by their groups in the European Parliament.
However, it is precisely this indirect funding by the groups which the European Court of Auditors has criticised on the grounds of lack of transparency and the improper use of parliamentary funds, and it will not tolerate this any longer.
The European Union budget already provides funds for the current financial year in line B3-500: EUR 7 million for all parties.
This is certainly no cornucopia, as we hear from resentful quarters.
How the funds are to be distributed is also laid down in the Regulation.
The Commission generously tabled a proposal for a regulation in February to establish the conditions which would need to be met.
One of these is for statutes to be submitted, providing evidence that a European party is committed to the principles of democracy, respect for fundamental rights and control of income and expenditure, which are enshrined in the Treaty on European Union.
This goes further than existing national legislation on parties.
In addition, a European party has to prove, amongst other things, that it has been successful in elections in at least five Member States or that it is represented in the European Parliament by Members from at least five Member States.
There are also precise rules on how the Regulation is to be implemented and on control.
The European parties are not permitted to use their funds to finance national parties.
This ban also applies to the funding of election campaigns.
The Committee on Constitutional Affairs has added several points in its opinion, including the reference to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, a definition of the party as having legal personality so that it can conduct legal transactions, and further-reaching proposals on controls, including on revenue from donations.
Thanks are also due here to the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market for their good proposals.
In addition there are now a further 40 amendments, which I should like to classify under three headings: those which make the text of the Regulation more precise, those which propose detailed rules and those which reject the proposal.
You will understand that, as rapporteur, I cannot support the proposal's rejection because, after all, it is Parliament itself which has been calling for a regulation for a long time.
There is another reason why rejection is also incomprehensible to me. It arouses suspicion that we want to prevent party financing being made transparent at European level.
I cannot recommend detailed rules at present.
This Regulation is a temporary solution until the entry into force of the Treaty of Nice, when we will be in a position to draft comprehensive legislation with the Council.
Today we are taking the first step and until the Council makes a unanimous decision we can unfortunately only deliver an opinion.
It is in the interests of the European Parliament for a neat solution to be found which will enable the criticisms of the European Court of Auditors to be taken into account as quickly as possible.
I should like to address one more point: the Council was present yesterday, and I received the speech of the President-in-Office on behalf of the Council Presidency.
I should very much like to hand it over to the President of Parliament.
In it the Council says that it is interested in our completing our work as early as today if possible.
The Council is full of good intentions to do all it can to bring this dossier to a conclusion, possibly even under the Swedish Presidency.
I should therefore like to thank the Swedish Presidency for showing such commitment in its efforts to allow the European parties to stand on their own two feet, by conferring legal status on them and making their funding transparent.
This is a very difficult task which, in the interests of democracy, will hopefully be crowned with success.
I hereby hand this speech over to the President of Parliament.
Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, to point out the contribution that the European political parties have made to the affirmation of democratic values and the strengthening of a European awareness, the Nice European Council approved an addition to Article 191 concerning the statute of political parties at a European level and, in particular, the rules regarding their financing.
Until the Nice decision is ratified, it is appropriate that a set of rules should be defined that apply to the creation and financing of the parties to ensure immediate effectiveness and transparency in this field from this moment on.
This is the purpose of the timely proposal by the European Commission, to which can be added the proposals set out in the report by Mrs Schleicher, whom I congratulate on the quality of her work.
The opinion of the Committee on Budgets seeks to strengthen the guarantees of transparency in the financing of parties, particularly through the express identification of the origin and destination of all funds.
At the same time, the clear distinction between political groups in the European Parliament and European political parties is maintained for the next legislature, particularly as regards their buildings and staff.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the debate on the party statute and the resulting statute on political parties is of far greater significance than most people probably believe.
We think that a party statute, in the truest sense of the word, is important for the unification of Europe and for democracy in Europe.
How then is the will of the European people to be expressed, if not through parties?
As varied as our views may be, it is after all the parties who, in the end, give expression to our political will, even if this is often only after a very tough process of debate.
That is why the significance of this party statute for the unification of our continent and for democracy in our continent cannot be overestimated, even if it is criticised here and there in the media or in extreme quarters of this House.
The last time that we debated this initiative - I myself was astonished that it is already nearly a year ago - was on 14 June 2000.
Yesterday we had certain events here in this House and I would also say, Mr President, that we need to consider how we can prevent an anti-European minority from stopping progress in the future.
That is why we need to amend our Rules of Procedure.
I should particularly like to express my appreciation - and for me as a democrat this was a cheering sight yesterday - of the fact that after yesterday's tumult four conscientious groups immediately realised their responsibility for Europe - the Christian Democrats, the EPP, the Socialists, the Liberals and the Greens - and sought a way out of the situation.
That was a test of democracy here in the European Parliament and I would expressly thank the other groups who took that step with us.
I should like to express my heartfelt thanks to Ursula Schleicher, who by working unbelievably hard in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs under the Chairmanship of our esteemed colleague, Mr Napolitano, managed to forge agreement on majority positions.
My dear Mrs Schleicher, you have done an excellent job here and people will always remember your name with gratitude when this party statute is adopted.
I should also, however, like to thank the Commission, in particular Commissioner Barnier and the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, for responding to the initiative taken by the four aforementioned groups in this Parliament and tabling this proposal.
Even though it is still based on the old law - we are being heard - it is nevertheless a prerequisite for the Swedish Presidency to be able to decide.
I should also like to acknowledge explicitly the very great effort that the Swedish Presidency is putting into this.
Of course Mr Danielsson is not able to be here today. He was here yesterday, however, and we only have ourselves to blame for the fact that we are not able to debate this with him today.
I regret this, and in the future we need to find a means of cooperating with the Council of Ministers to ensure that the Council is represented here in the European Parliament - and this is not to criticise the Swedish Presidency - throughout the week that we are in session.
We want more transparency. We want straightforward financial control, Commissioner Schreyer.
That is why I was astonished - I must mention this now - to see a statement by Messrs Kuhne and Van Hulten in Euronews.
They had not secured a majority in the Committee on Budgetary Control and were attacking us.
That is completely inappropriate!
If a rapporteur in a committee does not succeed in securing a majority in favour of his report then that is due to the rapporteur's own incompetence, and he should not defame others who are full of good intentions and wish to contribute to the overall result.
We want transparency and we also need this party statute so that we can integrate the parties from Central Europe.
There, where democracy is only just being established, it is even more important than it is here for democratic structures to gain stability.
I should like to refer to one further point: legal personality for the parties.
Parliament's Bureau will, as you know, after consulting a committee of eminent persons, advise on the basis on which it will be decided which organisations are genuinely European parties which comply with the criteria.
Obviously there will also always be the temptation of political opportunism to say yes or no to a political party.
That is why the parties need to be endowed with legal personality, so that they are able to appeal against a decision if they believe that the rules have been violated and the right decisions have not been made.
Legal certainty is actually the most important thing in the European Union.
In conclusion I should like to say that whenever there are conflicts between us it is important for those conflicts to be resolved peacefully.
This peaceful conflict resolution is only possible on the basis of the law.
That is why it is important for there also to be recourse to the ECJ.
I hope that a large majority of this House will vote in favour of this proposal tabled by Ursula Schleicher.
(Applause)
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today is an important day for European democracy, because we always talk about the institutions of the European structure, but we never talk about the protagonists and we need protagonists on the European stage.
They are the political parties.
Following the awful things that I heard in this House yesterday, allow me, Mr President, to say something that is based on my own experience, which is shared by you, in your country, and by Mr Poettering, which is that those who are against political parties are against democracy.
Parties will have their flaws, but there is no pluralist democracy in the world without political parties that represent the will of the people.
We therefore need to be very careful with demagoguery on this very important issue.
I have to say that I feel particularly proud, because almost ten years ago to the day, with the help and support of President Martens, President De Clercq, who is still our colleague, and President Spitaels, as President of Parliament, I made the first proposal that was given form in Article 138 of the Treaty, now Article 191, in which, in agreement with President Lubbers, we succeeded in having the political parties incorporated into the Treaties.
We must not now simply content ourselves with proclaiming principles.
What we have to do is develop and give personality to the European political parties, and ensure that they do not continue to be some sort of annex to our groups.
This is the reason why, although we debate and disagree on many other things, we are in agreement on these matters, which are essential for democracy.
With regard to the debate and the report drawn up by Mrs Schleicher, whose work I welcome, I would say to my fellow Member, Mr Poettering, that we disagree on many things, but I would ask him not to get angry with Mr Kuhne, who raised a request made to us by the Court of Auditors in the Committee on Budgetary Control, and I would ask him, before twelve o' clock, to reconsider his anger and support these amendments, which I think could be positive for everyone.
Another aspect that we think is essential, and here I would also ask for the support of your group, is that we should take a step forward on an essential issue for European democracy, which is the funding of the parties, in terms of who can contribute funds.
This is an open debate.
In the United States we have just seen the McCain initiative on soft money and hard money.
In many European countries we have had bitter experiences in this area.
We have not taken drastic action. We have worked instead on the basis of experiences that have occurred in the various European countries... what we say is that legal entities, basically commercial companies, should not be able to give money to parties.
We are in favour of a ban in this area, because we believe that this is good for democracy and for transparency, because what we are talking about here are not acts of philanthropy. Something is always asked for in return - you only have to look at what President Bush is proposing for the energy sector.
To conclude, Mr President, allow me to point out the happy coincidence that today the majority of this House and the groups that have a European dimension, and we should not forget that we have a European dimension, have members from all the countries in the Union.
We want order, regulation, transparency and responsibility to the citizens and we therefore ask that our positions be respected in this debate and above all that there should be a shared democratic will at this decisive moment for European integration.
Mr President, in line with our Rules of Procedure, I believe that I should first of all indicate that there is a conflict of interest in my case, as I am also treasurer of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party.
This is not a financial interest, since the position is unsalaried - exceptionally so, I may say - but nevertheless, this is in any event probably a case of conflict of political interests.
However, I am speaking here on behalf of the liberal group, and not on behalf of the European Liberal, Democratic and Reform Party.
The thing that should, of course, stand out in this entire discussion, is the fact that the situation as it is now is really not acceptable.
The situation in which the groups are keeping the parties afloat.
There was no other way until now.
There was no other way around this, but I believe that we all have understood by now, even intuitively speaking, that this situation is untenable.
The Court of Auditors has highlighted this, which is to be applauded.
Needless to say, nothing has happened in secret.
Everything was above board, everyone was able to see that things were done in this way, but it cannot continue like this.
As it happens, our groups cannot live on air, and if they do not receive support from general resources, where does that support originate from?
Do we want the European political parties to become a plaything of whatever pressure group, be it trade union, businesses or other non-governmental organisations, rich individuals or whoever?
It is patently clear that political parties must be able to lead an independent life.
If we do not, we will have American-styled practices on our hands, and I would not simply refer to President Bush, but also to the practice of candidates actually only accruing funds instead of pursuing politics.
We must never end up in a situation of that kind.
We need effectively functioning parties, as Mr Poettering and Mr BarÃ³n Crespo already stated very eloquently.
Indeed, that is where representative democracy comes into its own. That is the case nationally and even much more so at European level.
We need stability in our democracy with a view to enlargement.
The new countries which are about to join us are also politically active.
They too have political parties which need to feel at home in the existing European political families.
Only in that way can we in this Parliament help democracy develop in the future.
That is of key importance.
Furthermore, we need stability with a view to democratic development in the European Union.
We do not know how this will develop, but we cannot rule out that there will come a time when there will be European electoral lists.
Someone will then need to put forward these candidates.
We cannot rule out that a system can be set up whereby it is possible to become individual members of European political parties.
For that too, a proper system will need to be developed to accommodate this.
In addition, it is necessary for those parties to be independent.
It is, of course, too crazy for words that the political parties must be financially independent from those elected on behalf of that political party.
It should be the other way round. Those who are elected, should be checked out by their political parties.
That is how democracy works most effectively, and in that respect, I believe that even the present system can be improved on.
There is more to say on this subject.
We very much share the view, of course, that this cannot mean support for national parties.
We also agree that the system does not mean that pro-European campaigns are funded with this.
We believe that a number of issues still need to be examined, including legal status.
We should examine these aspects further.
For example, the aspect of support for political campaigns should be addressed.
We can come back to this during the amendment procedure, which will take place in due course, and then we will be able to put the finishing touches to the system.
Mr President, I have little time, that is why I hardly have the opportunity to highlight the importance of the forming of European parties.
Whoever claims, however, that parties are needed should also be aware that they take care of their financial resources and so far, this has been done in an unorthodox fashion.
It had to be done in the twilight zone.
We need a solid basis, transparency and control.
That is why our group is principally in favour of no donations from businesses for political parties, so as to vouch for the independence of Parliament as an institution and of the individual MPs.
Virtually every country has had its fair share of scandals, and we know that it is necessary to act very strictly and monitor closely.
If there are donations, it should be made very clear and transparent where they are from and what they will be spent on.
It must be possible to form democratic parties without creating too high thresholds.
That is why we support the proposal which the Commission presented right from the outset, to take five countries as the norm, so as not to deter any forces - at least if they are democratic.
There should also be sufficient funding for all recognised parties to be able to function as a party.
The overheads - and this can be verified objectively - must be covered before the resources are shared out proportionately.
Finally, we should be acutely aware of the fact that the citizens keep a watchful eye over the system.
We ourselves should ensure that the democratic fundamental rights are observed, for we cannot subsidise parties which subsequently undermine democracy.
Mr President, our Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left is not the group of a left-wing European party.
The parties represented in our group have differing positions on the political proposal on European political parties.
Some colleagues wonder, not without good reason, how meaningful it is and to what extent they actually can represent a European public.
The direct link to the people is not actually forged through Europe; it exists at national and regional level.
That is where the parties have their grass roots; that is where they have their members and electors.
I should like to ask Messrs Poettering and BarÃ³n Crespo to reconsider their words.
Mr BarÃ³n Crespo has just said that those who are against parties are against democracy.
I do not think that this is the case.
Rather I think that parties often tend to take themselves particularly seriously.
The public, for example in Germany, are very sceptical - not without reason - about membership of political parties.
I think that it is only 3% in the Federal Republic who take an interest in politics by joining a political party.
Nevertheless they are still democrats.
They get involved in society through other organisations of civil society, such as citizens' action groups and non-governmental organisations.
I want to say that the European party should not be denied the right to exist.
Those political forces which consider mergers of this kind to be right and necessary should also be able to proceed with them.
Quite apart from that, I am convinced, personally, that European parties, as it states in Article 191 of the Treaty, do actually constitute an important factor for integration.
That is why I support Mrs Schleicher's report and would also thank the Commission for its initiative.
Against the background of the criticisms made by the Court of Auditors, I think it is necessary for clear conditions to be established.
Legal certainty, financial discipline and transparency are indispensable, and I think that in particular the proposals on the statute, and especially the requirement for complete transparency of finances and any donations, should definitely be included in the Regulation.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, speaking on behalf of my group, I must, of course, say that the positions I express here do not represent the whole group, in which there are two different feelings on this subject.
I would come back, however, to questions of principle, which I believe we should examine thoroughly.
Firstly, I regret that, in the various stages of the debate in which we have been engaged, the majority, whose strength we have never doubted, has never taken the trouble or care to respond to the legality issues.
We should like to know how Article 308 is to be implemented.
How can it be brought forward with regard to the Treaty of Nice?
How can one jump from the equality of political parties at European level to the creation of restrictive entities: the European political parties?
There has never been a reasoned response.
I should also like to take the opportunity to reply politely to Mr Poettering and Mr BarÃ³n Crespo.
We are not against Europe.
We are against the bulldozing of rights, especially in the case of fundamental rights in Europe.
Neither are we against political parties!
On the contrary, we believe that this Regulation is against political parties on a totally illegal basis, because it is not provided for in the Treaties.
We are against illegal discrimination against parties.
Besides, it has been mentioned that our concern is to respond to the concerns of a court: the Court of Auditors.
Given the ups and downs that this Regulation has been going through, it would not surprise me if, when the Court of Auditors first dealt with the matter, it raised the questions of the lack of legal base that have been discussed here itself.
I should also like to draw your attention to Article 191.
The Treaty says this: 'Political parties at European level are important as a factor for integration within the Union.'
It does not authorise any discrimination between them.
The only discrimination that may exist in this European Parliament is brought about by the power of the electors, the democratic vote, and not by any other kind of instrument that may favour some to the detriment of others.
Mr President, SOS Democracy and the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities unanimously rejects the proposal to use the flexible clause of the Treaty, Article 308, to finance supranational parties at EU level.
The Treaty of Nice introduces a special legal basis for aid to parties and thereby demonstrates that there is no legal basis in the Treaty of Amsterdam.
The Court of Justice has laid down that Article 308 cannot be used instead of Treaty changes.
Therefore, the basis of the proposal is clearly unlawful until the Treaty of Nice has been approved in all the Member States.
The content will, unfortunately, also be unlawful following the Treaty of Nice because the latter does not deal with supranational European parties.
It deals with political parties at European level and, in a special declaration, rules out discrimination.
The Schleicher report would provide some parties with special aid not available to other parties.
