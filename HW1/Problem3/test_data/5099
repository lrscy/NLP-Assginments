The broad guidelines of economic policy for 2001, adopted at Gothenburg last June, are very clear on this point.
The principle is accepted without discussion in a favourable economic climate.
Hence, better than expected economic growth inevitably leads to a greater improvement in nominal budgetary figures. For this reason also, a pro-cyclical budgetary policy, together with a decrease in spending which could lead to overheating, is not permitted.
The question that now arises is to establish whether this allowance for cyclical variation can be implemented in a similar way in periods of poor growth or recession.
The Belgian Presidency is convinced that this is indeed possible. The broad guidelines of economic policy for 2001 confirm our belief.
In a less favourable economic climate, the balances already taken into consideration within the framework of the Pact, should also be adjusted in line with changed economic circumstances.
Nominal balances can therefore be affected by worsening economic conditions. However, they can only fluctuate according to those same economic conditions.
In these circumstances, a pro-cyclical policy should not be used.
Consequently, a decrease in revenue should not be then compensated for by an equivalent reduction in spending.
Cyclical adjustments must be reliable in order to assess the budgetary positions correctly.
The agenda of the Belgian Presidency therefore allows some time for us to refine effective methods to calculate the disparity between production and potential growth.
These methods should be used in future stability programmes.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, all these issues will doubtless lead to some long but interesting discussions at the next meeting of the euro area.
Mr President, I, too, would like to offer a warm welcome to the Moroccan delegation with us today. I shall also endeavour to analyse two issues confronting us, namely the Growth and Stability Pact and the informal ECOFIN Council and shall attempt to report on both during my first speech.
The Liege Council on 22 and 23 September 2001 focused on the economic impact of the terrorist attacks on the United States.
I should like to refer to three aspects of this impact discussed at ECOFIN. Firstly, the economic situation.
The opportunity was also taken to discuss the Growth and Stability Pact.
Secondly, the financing of terrorism.
Thirdly, the problems airlines are experiencing with regard to insurance.
I shall also comment on two other important matters raised at Liege, namely preparations for transition to the euro and issues related to globalisation.
Concerning the first point, I should emphasise that the attacks on the United States have strengthened our conviction that international cooperation on financial and political issues is essential. Further, coordination of economic policies within the European Union must be strengthened.
As from last year, the slowdown of economic activity in the United States and the rest of the world has been having a greater impact on the European Union than was originally anticipated.
The tragic events in the United States have increased uncertainty and the negative risks for anticipated general growth.
We cannot act as if nothing had happened, but at the same time it is very difficult to produce an accurate estimate of the potential impact of those acts.
Within the European Union, growth will be well below 2% this year. We are however still hoping for a gradual recovery of internal demand in the coming quarters.
There are a number of reasons for this: lower inflation, recent tax reductions and more favourable monetary conditions.
The risks should therefore be manageable. We must, of course, monitor economic changes very closely so as to adjust economic policies as necessary, both in the Union and in each of the Member States.
Following the events on 11 September, political leaders showed their determination to act swiftly and appropriately to eliminate the risks of a lengthier slowdown. To this end, we must also maintain our medium-term objectives, and move through our agenda more swiftly.
I have in mind in particular the Lisbon agenda.
We need to modernise our economies quickly so we can reverse the slowdown as soon as possible and increase our capacity for growth.
As I stated earlier, the declaration following the informal ECOFIN confirmed the commitment of Member States to the framework, rules and implementation of the Growth and Stability Pact.
As the presidency has pointed out, slower growth will affect the nominal value of budgetary positions. Departure from the objectives ought, however, to be limited.
The Growth and Stability Pact is a suitable framework for budgetary policy in times when the economy is developing well and in less good times.
It makes it possible to implement the most appropriate budgetary policy for each set of circumstances.
It is possible to resort to all the possibilities provided in the pact.
The automatic stabilisers will be more effective if the slowdown is greater than anticipated.
The manner and extent to which these stabilisers operate will depend on the situation of each Member State. Those states closer to balancing their budget will obviously have more room for manoeuvre.
Current budgetary situations result from compliance with existing budgetary rules, and have enabled the European Central Bank to adopt a flexible monetary policy. In particular, they have made it possible for the Bank to take the right decision quickly and reduce interest rates by fifty basic points on 17 September.
An increase in deficits over and above what can be justified by the operation of the stabilisers would reduce the options open to the Central Bank as regards possible future cuts in rates of interest.
The European Council requested the Commission to submit a study of the likely evolution of the economic situation together with the recommendations it envisages to the forthcoming European Council at Ghent.
The report will have to be viewed as an ongoing systematic exercise allowing for adjustment of the assessment of the evolution of risks and the possible consequences.
My second comment concerns action to combat the financing of terrorism.
The ECOFIN statement gives prominence to a number of specific actions.
Firstly, the matter of the review of the directive on money laundering. This is currently under negotiation, as you are aware.
I should like to emphasise once again, on behalf of the Commission and in line with the ECOFIN statement at Liege, that we attach great political significance to the swift conclusion of this process.
It will send out a clear signal of the Union' s commitment to stamping out criminal activity supported by money laundering.
I should also like to highlight the Commission' s approval of the draft regulation on specific measures to freeze the assets of individuals or entities involved in the financing of terrorist activities. We hope the Council and Parliament will deal with this as a matter of urgency so that it can be implemented immediately.
It gives a clear indication of our political determination to grant no respite to those who attack political coexistence and the freedoms of all citizens.
The ECOFIN Council also agreed general guidelines on government intervention concerning the insurance problems facing airline companies.
The ECOFIN statement invites the Commission to broaden the remit of the ad hoc group set up in the framework of the Transport Council to include insurance problems.
The statement also specifies that the Commission must be notified of any measure taken by governments, including financial amounts.
This will enable the Commission to discharge its responsibility of ensuring that such measures are compatible with Community legislation and to ensure consistency between the responses by the various Member States.
The Commission is drafting a report on the impact of the attacks on 11 September on the air transport industry.
There was also an opportunity at the informal ECOFIN to pursue the discussion on preparations for the introduction of the euro. Such discussions have been held at regular intervals.
The Commission is drafting a report on the subject for the forthcoming European Council at Ghent on 19 October.
At Liege I appealed to the Member States to pay particular attention to three aspects which seem to me crucial at this juncture. Firstly, the problem of supplying small traders in advance.
They need to be informed and convinced of the commercial advantages of advance supply.
It is also important however to find ways of helping them to work with the banks. The latter should offer fair debit conditions for the amounts in euro received by small traders before 31 December 2001.
In addition, it is essential to provide specific training for small traders and for all those working on the tills in any kind of business.
The third issue causing us concern is monitoring of the prices of goods and services over the period of the changeover to the euro.
We cannot go through the process of calculating the harmonised consumer price index every week, nor would it make sense to do so. Nonetheless, we can however provide the citizens with information on the evolution of certain key prices in a transparent manner.
As this exercise is to be undertaken by government agencies, transparency and objectivity will be guaranteed, and the sample chosen will be appropriate.
The informal ECOFIN also agreed with the Commission' s proposal to establish a common European network to organise exchange of information during the period when notes and coins are to be introduced.
This network will start to operate at the beginning of December in close cooperation with the European Central Bank' s Cash Changeover Committee.
The last issue I would like to deal with is the debate on globalisation.
The Commission has followed the public debate on globalisation closely, including the debate on the so-called Tobin levy or tax.
We have taken note of ECOFINs interest in receiving a report on these issues.
This debate focuses on two clearly relevant objectives on which we share the concerns expressed by many of the participants in the debate on globalisation.
Firstly, to avoid excessive fluctuation in the rates of interest which could prevent the hoped-for economic development of developing countries. Secondly, to find sources of additional finance to combat poverty.
There is no single instrument allowing us to attain both these objectives at once.
The Union and other countries, international institutions and other groups have developed a range of instruments and policies in an attempt to work towards these objectives.
More and better action could of course be taken, and the Commission is prepared to explore new possibilities.
As originally defined, Professor Tobin' s idea of imposing a tax on foreign currency transactions was intended to put a damper on international monetary markets.
It was put forward as a second best solution to put the brakes on short-term speculative movements.
The Commission has already made its point of view clear on a number of occasions.
A tax on monetary transactions is not an effective way of dealing with the problems arising from excessive volatility of financial flows or with inequalities between countries.
A wide range of instruments should be drawn upon. The Tobin levy or tax is not the magic wand allowing us to deal with all the challenges which have arisen.
We need to consider a wide range of instruments in our efforts to attain financial and monetary stability.
A global approach to the financial edifice is called for, both at internal European Union level and at international level. This should include regulatory frameworks, institutions and the problem of money laundering.
A wide-ranging approach to the financing of development is also required.
Different instruments can be used to deal with poverty, debt reduction, the supply of international public goods and the protection of the environment.
The Commission is prepared to make an active contribution to the debate on the instruments to ensure coherence between globalisation, sustainable development and world governance. I am sure we can also count on support from Parliament and the Council.
These issues are of course beyond the Union' s strict sphere of competence. We should tackle them together with other countries and institutions.
The Commission is ready to respond to the Council' s invitation to continue working on how best to respond to the key objectives I referred to. In any case, part of this work is already under way within the Commission.
We are currently preparing a report on the external dimension of sustainable development. This is due next January and is aimed at the RÃ­o+10 conference to be held in Johannesburg next year.
Ladies and gentlemen, these are the key issues I wanted to share with you.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, why did my group demand this afternoon's debate on the Stability and Growth Pact?
The reason given was that we were disturbed by certain utterances we have heard emanating from the ranks of socialist governments in the past weeks and months.
The statements made by Mr Eichel, Mr Jospin, Mr Fabius, and other things that were said, all went along the same lines.
For a start, they asserted that it was necessary in the present situation to soften the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact.
That was the first demand.
The second was that the Heads of State and of Government must be accorded the right to prescribe annual stability objectives to the European Central Bank.
We take the view that both these proposals are extraordinarily dangerous, for the Stability and Growth Pact and the independence of the European Central Bank are the twin pillars on which rests the European Union's monetary system.
These pillars must not be shaken.
My group will always speak up in favour of maintaining the independent European Central Bank and the Stability and Growth Pact in their present forms.
Let us turn now to the resolutions on the table before us.
Jointly with the Group of the European Liberal, Democratic and Reform Party, we have submitted a motion for a resolution.
We negotiated with the Group of the Party of European Socialists, which stated that it was unable to agree to our resolution.
What, though, is so bad about our resolution?
It states that the Stability and Growth Pact should, in quite simple words, be 'retained'.
Why can they not agree to that?
Then they said: We want to put its principles fully into practice.
Why not just agree to it then?
We need measures against money laundering.
You spoke about that, Commissioner.
We need measures to destroy the financial background for terrorist acts.
Why not agree to that?
We must also be consistent in reducing monopolies in order to strengthen the competitiveness of our European economy.
Why can they not agree to that?
Now for the second question: what counter-proposal does the other side have to offer?
They put forward essentially the same ones over and over again: that the European Central Bank should cut interest rates.
Or, on the other hand, that the Stability and Growth Pact, or the Member States' budget policies, should be relaxed.
That is the Socialist policy mix.
That is the potion concocted by druids to cure all the ills of our economy at a stroke and without effort.
It would be nice if things worked like that, my dear Christa!
But in reality they do not.
Take a look at Japan, where this policy was applied and where it does not work.
Consider the stock exchanges in the United States today, where it can be seen that it does not work.
Look at economic history, where we see from the past that it has never yet worked.
So I would like to urge you to reject these demands and support our resolution.
Mr President, Commissioner, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in the light of the grave global situation, I have no desire to enter into a puerile argument with my fellow Member, Mr von Wogau.
Mr von Wogau has just accused the Socialist Group of having the worst of intentions.
This is certainly not the policy we are defending here.
We must bear in mind that the attacks of 11 September have not only caused great human suffering. They may also have far-reaching consequences for civil liberties and for the global economy.
Before 11 September, the United States was clearly already experiencing a slowdown and Japan was already in a bad way. However, before 11 September a slowdown was already evident in Europe.
It had proved necessary to revise some forecasts downwards. Furthermore, it is clear that the situation in Europe and worldwide will be worse during the third quarter than it was during the second quarter.
What we need to do now is prevent a recession.
As we are all aware, a recession is defined as negative growth for two consecutive six-month periods. According to Mr von Wogau, we must now wait six months to see if we are really in a recession.
However, I believe that we must respond by pursuing a pragmatic policy.
I think that Europe owes it to herself to respond to this threat of a recessionary spiral with a proactive economic policy. This should be achieved within the European Union by improving the coordination of economic policies.
The Council representative said just this to the House. The European Union should also increase political cooperation with all its economic partners, including developing countries.
We would like to establish a pragmatic policy like that of the United States, although, as far as I know, the United States does not have a Socialist government...
We should of course take account of the Growth and Stability Pact. We should not encourage Member States to exceed budgetary deficit limits, especially the 3% threshold.
Nevertheless, as the Council representative has said, we must assess the long-term viability of public finances. The Growth and Stability Pact states that public finances should be balanced, or almost balanced.
We must also respond in the short term.
Economic stabilisers can have a role to play.
We are experiencing the consequences of a negative external event. The Growth and Stability Pact allows for us to respond to negative external events.
I do not wish to engage in ideological debate.
Mr von Wogau' s interpretation of the Growth and Stability Pact is merely theological. We are not calling for state aid.
Nor are we calling for quick-fix solutions. We are calling for selective measures to support sectors badly affected by the current economic situation.
Ladies and gentlemen, lastly, I would like to stress that we are not facing a war between different civilisations. Terrorism does not represent any civilisation.
Terrorism negates everything that is human. We need a coalition against terrorism, but we also need a coalition against poverty.
The World Bank has recently published information on the consequences of the attacks on New York for developing countries.
We must not only deplore the loss of thousands of lives in New York and Washington. We must also lament the fact that there are tens of thousands of other victims amongst the children of the poorest countries in the world.
These are the people we must respond to.
Mr President, on behalf of the Liberal Group, I wish to say that we believe the Stability and Growth Pact is an essential pillar of economic stability in the euro area and in the Union more widely, and should be respected in letter and spirit.
We do not recognise the view, apparently emanating from the Socialist Group, that the SGP currently incorporates unnecessarily restrictive fiscal rules.
For the 11 countries whose budgets are in a sustainable position - those which, in other words, can face a normal recession with a fall in tax revenue and continue to respect the 3% limit on budget deficits - there is no need to raise taxes or cut public spending and the automatic stabilisers can and should be allowed to play.
Moreover, for many of these countries, this is the first slowdown since the first oil shock in 1973 in which the automatic stabilisers have been able to work fully.
Previously, financial market worries have been a serious constraint on governments.
So monetary union, the Stability and Growth Pact and fiscal consolidation have given back to Member States a useful policy lever which has been out of the policy box for too long.
For the four euro-area Member States whose budgets are not yet fully compatible with the Stability and Growth Pact - France, Germany, Italy and Portugal - it is wholly reasonable that they should continue the process of putting their underlying budget positions right.
This means allowing some effects of the slowdown on the deficit, but certainly not all.
In our joint motion with the PPE-DE Group we urge the proper respect of the SGP.
We point out that it would be particularly useful in a year like this one - in which many stability programmes were drafted in expectation of 3% growth, but the out-turn is likely to be less than 2%, as the Commission has said - if there were a commonly agreed measure between the ECB, Ecofin and the Commission of the underlying budget balance, stripping out the impact of the slowdown on taxes and cyclically determined spending and, perhaps, interest rates as well.
Such an underlying budget balance would allow better between-years monitoring of the fiscal position, underpinning the discipline of the Stability and Growth Pact and reassuring the financial markets that the fiscal stance is not being eased, even if the nominal deficits are inevitably somewhat larger.
Similarly, such an underlying budget balance would discourage finance ministers from fiscal easing in upturns, merely on account of cyclically buoyant revenue.
I urge us to respect the Stability and Growth Pact and add to its ability to check finance ministers' discipline.
Mr President, Madam President, Commissioner, much has already been said about the issue of the Growth and Stability Pact.
I think that the main difference between the two joint motions for resolution submitted to the House is the fact that the motion for resolution signed both by my group and the Socialist Group lays greater stress on the possibility of implementing a contracyclical policy. This policy would promote growth, while keeping within the limits of the Growth and Stability Pact.
If I understand the declaration made by the presidency correctly, it seems that the presidency supports this idea that the Growth and Stability Pact should allow the European Union to implement a contracyclical policy to promote growth.
That said, we must not be under any illusions. There is relatively little room for manoeuvre within the terms of the monetary and budgetary policies.
I would now like to comment on one aspect of the debate. This has not yet been mentioned but I, at least, am concerned about it.
As you know Commissioner, Madam President, practically all Member States have engaged in a structural reduction of government revenue (as a percentage of GDP) through fiscal reductions. This is being done within the context of fiscal harmony between Member States, especially through corporation tax, and within the context of weak growth.
This type of policy entails the risk of downward pressure towards a structural reduction of public spending. This could lead to insufficient spending, given the solidarity mechanism we endorse.
Alternatively, it could lead to inequitable public spending.
This is why it is important to debate the development of other tax bases. It seems that the presidency has alluded to and taken heed of this possibility.
In this regard, the Tobin tax may also contribute to widening the range of tax bases. However, Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to find out from you about the progress of work within the Prima Renault group, and about the state of discussion on the issue of corporation tax.
I believe that it is urgent for the fifteen Member States to find a way out of the impasse they have got themselves into. The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is no longer informed on how this work is progressing.
When we do hear rumours on this subject, all we hear is that no progress has been made. When growth is slowing down, I believe that, as a matter of urgency, the European Union should pull itself together and coordinate work on the development of corporation tax.
Secondly, I would like to comment on the problems of terrorism and money laundering.
The principal elements concerned are the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) and the issue of the directive on money laundering. Experts in this field judge progress made so far on international cooperation on this area to be limited and not very effective.
Signatory countries are not obliged to implement the series of recommendations the FATF has produced.
In October 1996, European magistrates signed the Geneva Appeal, which called for certain international conventions to be ratified, and for banking secrecy to be lifted when proceedings have to be started.
One of these magistrates has recently repeated this appeal, calling for an international conference to consider these matters. The conference would define the rules on economic transparency, including lifting banking secrecy and abolishing tax havens.
It would also increase judicial cooperation between states and set up a system of sanctions to be imposed on countries that failed to comply with these provisions. I urge the President and the Commission to see that the Belgian Presidency acts upon these requests magistrates are making.
Indeed, the head of FATF has reiterated these same demands, as I have read in the press this morning. Work on these issues should proceed more quickly and FATF recommendations should be made binding.
This would be a very useful role for the European Union to play, both in its capacity as the Chair and a key member of the FATF.
I believe that we will be able to turn words into actions.
I also believe that, as regards the fiscal package, which includes binding provisions to regulate tax havens and low-tax areas (some of which can be found within the European Union), we can combine the fight against financial crime and the European tax on savings programme. I believe that we must seize this political opportunity to step up work on these issues.
Unfortunately, the informal meeting of ECOFIN had to announce, yet again, that no progress had been made in this area.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the dogmatism and apathy dominating the economic policy of the European Union are causing great concern.
Unemployment is rising once again, there is a threat of recession and the conditions for lasting growth are not in place. However, so far, the Council, the Commission and the European Central Bank have come up with platitudes and have convinced themselves that everything is fine.
The euro does provide protection against currency speculation but it offers no protection whatsoever from financial crises. We are involved in financial globalisation up to our necks.
The main cause of the current apathy is the fundamentalist approach of those opposed to state intervention.
Those who subscribe to this view try desperately to promote fiscal competition, as Pierre Jonckheer reminded us. They reduce public spending but welcome turgidity on the stock exchange and its requirements to produce financial returns.
This results in a lack of public and private investment.
Another reason for this apathy is that social-democratic visions for Europe are somewhat lacking.
I think it is time we recognise this.
You advocate strengthening coordination between national policies.
I am in favour of this, but we must recognise that basically this has come to be equated with the Growth and Stability Pact. I am sure you will confirm this.
The debate must not remain polarised between the 'fundamentalists' and those who want to make the Growth and Stability Pact more flexible.
We advocate an action plan to get us out of this rut.
Firstly, as elected representatives at a European and national level, we must come to a consensus and call for a revival of the European economies. We must send a message along these lines to a meeting of the European Council in Ghent and to the Commission.
In order to achieve economic revival, we must favour public spending and credit as opposed to tax cuts. Funds to promote investment should also be established.
Secondly, we believe that we must carry out an in-depth revision of the Growth and Stability Pact. This Pact has remained unchanged since 1992, although the global situation is now very different and the euro has appeared.
I appreciate the idea of starting to make it more flexible, as mentioned by Mrs Neyts. However, we want something more than this.
We want reform.
Two principles should guide us in this. Public or mixed economy choices should balance market forces.
Must I point out that President Bush used Keynesian policies to revive the American economy, after President Clinton refused to cut taxes to increase his popularity?
Furthermore, the criteria of state intervention should allow for decision-making at national level and for solidarity.
Restricting public deficit to a maximum of 3% in no way succeeded in preventing the exacerbation of differences.
Consequently, the new Growth and Stability Pact would be based on common criteria for effectiveness, relating both to taxation and public spending.
Taxation should combat the volatility of the financial markets and government stocks by taxing financial products and revenues.
Spending should create the necessary conditions for lasting growth, employment, security and solidarity.
We also want the Pact to include taxation and budgetary tools appropriate to the European Union. Fortunately, the Belgian Presidency has suggested this.
Thirdly, the Laeken declaration must include a commitment to establishing Community powers in relation to macro-economic policy.
Madam President, I welcome the opportunity to make a few, but important, points on the Stability and Growth Pact.
There is a role for economic policy coordination, but it must be applied in a sensible and balanced manner in all Member States.
There are, however, serious policy differences between what the Commission is now proposing and what was agreed at the Ecofin Council in Helsinki in 1999, when it was agreed that Member States 'determine their budgetary policies in consistency with the Treaty' , but that this commitment leaves room for domestic policy choices.
This week the Commission published a welcome White Paper on European governance, the thrust of which reflects the need for EU institutions to listen, rather than dictate.
There is a clear signal coming from EU citizens that while they continue to support the thrust of EU integration, they want it to happen in a manner which reflects the independence and the integrity of each Member State and its citizens.
There are those in this House, and indeed within the administration, who are blindly rushing towards the creation of a federalist Europe.
They are in my mind doing a disservice to the vision of Europe's founding fathers and will, I predict, be stopped in their tracks by citizen reaction.
Events in the real world can rarely be dealt with by means of a predetermined, prescriptive set of rules.
Over-regulation stifles initiative and, therefore, progress and prosperity.
Mr President, yet again the European Union is not keeping pace with the situation in Europe, as it wishes to keep European economies within the shackles of the Growth and Stability Pact. We all know that the criteria of this Pact are now completely obsolete.
The Growth and Stability Pact is dead, Mr Von Wogau; it did not die in New York. It was killed off by the European Central Bank.
The Bank' s policies were always out of line with reality. Its forecasting errors are now legendary, and it has an irrational fear of inflation.
We are all aware of the results. We have to contend with the highest interest rates in the world, a consistently weak euro and the threat of recession.
The outcome of pursuing monetary policy in the manner of a frightened old man is clear. Sooner or later, governments will be forced towards budgetary expansion.
It would be ridiculous now to blame them for doing this. Many members of the committee have made this abundantly clear in all our conversations (if you can call them that) with Mr Duisenberg.
Once again, the European Union is unworthy of the powers it has assumed from legitimate governments. It has proved this by failing to order (this is a euphemism) the European Central Bank to make available to the countries of the euro area the resources entrusted to it by Member States.
As far as we know, the ECB does not own Europe' s currency and should not act like Scrooge.
I would also like to point out in passing that it is unacceptable for the ECB to decide whether or not to issue euro notes and coins before 1 January.
I have to say that I really cannot understand why some governments do not wish to take the initiative and bring the date of distribution forward.
Yet again the European Union cannot keep pace with its ambitions and assertions. It has failed to take up a position at the forefront of the drive to promote economic growth and employment.
This is the only battle that matters to the people of Europe.
Lastly, Commissioner, Madam President, let me add that the hypocrisy surrounding the issue of the Tobin tax added nothing to the intellectual standing of the European Union. For once, the European Union had the opportunity to show that it intended to have an effect on world affairs, to become more than what it actually is, simply one more piece of the jigsaw of liberal globalisation.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the Italian Radicals supported the resolution of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party because they consider it of vital importance that Parliament confirms the validity of the Stability and Growth Pact and its principles.
I feel that rigorous budgetary and monetary policies are not incompatible with growth, provided that we have the courage to act in the areas of structural reform, privatisation, liberalisation of the markets - particularly the labour market - and public spending, and provided that we have the courage to resolve the complex issue of pensions expenditure, which is an excessive burden on the budgets of many European countries and, because of the way these systems are organised, creates situations which are extremely unfair towards the young generations of workers.
I am quite aware that the European countries - I refer to my own country, Italy, in particular, but also to others such as Germany - rested on their laurels during the economic boom, putting off reforms which were necessary in order to consolidate public finances and make businesses competitive and giving way to pressure from trade unions and employers' associations demanding more State aid.
Thus, they failed to prepare the European economies for the inevitable subsequent slowdown, which will be particularly severe in the wake of the events of 11 September.
Mr President, in my opinion, the fiscal burden in Europe is still too high: although it has fallen somewhat, it is true, the figures show that the fiscal burden in Europe is still significantly higher than it was in the early nineties, for example.
Derogating from the constraints of the Stability and Growth Pact now and resorting to deficit spending means storing up fresh tax increases for the coming years which, in my opinion, the European economy, the European workers and the European unemployed can on no account afford.
There is one danger which must be highlighted - Mr Goebbels mentioned the confusion following the events of 11 September - and that is that Europe will use the current economic crisis and the crisis in the United States as an excuse to go back to expansionist, deficit spending policies such as those experienced by Europe and its citizens in previous decades.
This is not the right response to the situation.
The argument that the United States is also reacting with an expansionist policy and that it is going to spend an additional 1% of its GDP disregards the fact that the United States is supported by healthy, buoyant public finances and therefore has the capacity to do so reasonably effectively.
The same would not be true if we were to implement similar policies in Europe or to support State airlines which have drained public resources and hampered the liberalisation of the European markets.
I would like to stress one last point relating to the fight against terrorism and its funding.
Something which is now increasingly being emphasised by expert analysts - recently even by the winner of the Nobel Prize for Economics, Gary Becker - is the fact that the multinational terrorist organisations are financed by drug trafficking, particularly where Afghanistan and Pakistan are concerned.
We must also explore the possibility of cutting off this channel of terrorist funding at source through drugs policies not based on prohibition.
Mr President, the debate taking place today on the supposed choice between the Growth and Stability Pact and budgetary expansion seems somewhat bizarre. In fact, we do not have a choice between these two alternatives.
On the one hand, the Growth and Stability Pact is too rigid an instrument, despite offering some opportunities for derogation, because it does not make proper provision for the time-lags between the economic cycles of the various Member States.
We have consistently pointed this out.
However, the Council has just suggested that it might eventually be possible to make adjustments according to the economic climate, and using a bit of skill and the excuse of the attacks, we can therefore expect the Pact to be more flexible.
On the other hand, budgetary expansion in countries that have suffered the biggest slowdown, like France and Germany, has had three main effects.
Firstly, these countries already have significant budgetary deficits. This limits their margin for manoeuvre and has already acted as a stimulus.
As is the case with drugs, a greater stimulus is needed to achieve the maximum effect.
However, eventually the dose will have to be reduced.
The second effect of this expansion is that the excessive undervaluing of the euro has led to an increase in exports. This is due to the fact that the euro is an artificial currency.
This has been unfair on our partners but has boosted internal growth. However, I am not sure that this might not have contributed, to a very small degree, to the slowdown in the United States over recent months.
The third effect of budgetary expansion is the dispersal of cash people have been hoarding, prior to the introduction of euro notes and coins on 1 January next year. No one ever mentions this, but it is nevertheless happening.
This laundered money has been reinvested in the economy in very significant amounts. The figures for France total FRF 50 billion this year.
This is already causing revival.
Further budgetary expansion would have no purpose. It would only lead to the eventual introduction of new taxes which would make the situation even more difficult in future.
The real question we should be asking ourselves is: given the three linked elements necessary for economic revival I have mentioned, why are we not experiencing an economic boom?
Apart from the unexpected effects of the attacks in America, which have yet to be firmly established, I think there are two reasons for this.
The first reason is that the economies of Europe are overburdened with many different taxes and rigid regulations. The policies of the Socialist French government, especially the absurdity of the 35-hour working week, made these problems particularly acute in France.
The second reason relates to the perverse effect of the euro. I have said this before, but I will mention it again.
The euro may to some extent prevent some fluctuation in internal exchange rates, as supporters of the currency take great pleasure in explaining time and again.
However, on the other hand, it imposes a single monetary policy on countries which find themselves in very different situations.
This 'one-size-fits-all' policy, to quote one economist, is not suited to the present situation of France and Germany. It is having a recessionary effect in these countries.
It seems clear that the recessionary effect of standardisation today rather outweighs the benefits of eliminating internal exchange rates.
If we consider the situation as a whole, the euro is not protecting us from recession but rather encouraging it.
Should we put up with greater budgetary deficits to compensate for the euro?
That would be truly paradoxical!
In any case, Mr President, given the direction Europe has taken, we will have to endure several more years of problems and tension before governments recognise this essential truth: all countries fare better if each can benefit from an economic policy suited to its individual requirements.
Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, the present political situation in the world, and the war against terrorism that has begun, have a host of features that are creating long-term uncertainty for the EU economy.
That is why economic policies to create confidence will perhaps have an unparalleled impact on the behaviour of consumers and investors, and, hence, on how long the period of slower growth will last. There are also certain positive signs, from the point of view of restraint and the stability of currency values.
The price of crude oil is falling rather than rising and the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank have, since 11 September, been taking prompt action and acting in accord with one another.
Now, after the Federal Reserve' s drop in interest rates yesterday, all eyes are on the ECB.
It is no good waiting.
May the approach to the solution remain in the hands of the independent ECB, but the future of the policy on interest rates in Europe must also be made clear quickly.
Firm commitment on the part of every country to the Stability and Growth Pact will create just the sort of confidence the pact itself seeks and the economy now needs.
Budgetary discipline must not be allowed to slacken in the EU countries on any pretext, not even on account of any possible expenditure to increase internal and external security.
Equivalent savings will have to be found: we cannot rely on some hoped-for continued growth of income.
Switching to the euro will mean slightly increased costs for all points in the production chain.
There is no denying that.
However, they will be one-off increases and will only raise prices slightly.
They should not be used for scaremongering and thereby increase inflationary pressures.
The best long-term policy for stability and growth now is to adhere closely to the decisions of the Lisbon Summit and make the European Union the world' s most competitive area, removing internal barriers to competition and giving encouragement to innovation and research and development.
The commencement of a new round of WTO talks is now vital for international cooperation in matters of the economy to steadily gain strength.
Mr President, representative of the Council, Commissioner, in my view, our economic policy is a combination of success and failure.
The success, of course, is the euro, the failure is the actual economy, where there are two, interconnected problems.
The low rate of growth and the high rate of unemployment. The reason for both is the same and lies in the low rate of investment in capital equipment during the last decade of the last century, accompanied by the collapse of public investment.
Some people maintain that this collapse is a virtual collapse because it is due to a simple change of name, in that the private sector is investing where the public sector used to invest.
But how are we to believe this when overall investments have fallen so low?
Did public investment have to be throttled in order to support the euro?
Did unemployment have to reach its present rate, albeit not as high as just two years ago, although it will no doubt rise again, Commissioner, in order to support the euro?
I do not think so, but although no one admits it, this was the official policy up to the European Council in Lisbon.
That was where the line was taken to adopt the new economy which is supposed to find a modern solution to Europe's economic problem and bring back full employment on the new basis of more advanced technology, the most advanced technology in the world.
Nice words, nice ambitions, nice vision.
Unfortunately it failed because this was when the bubble burst on the American stock exchange, especially in the new technology and telecommunications sector, which was supposed to lead us into a new era and which is now threatening to drag us into one of the biggest slumps of the twentieth century.
It seems to me that these events have drawn a line under the Lisbon vision and that we need to go back to the drawing board.
There is no way someone can have a full plan to present to you, not when all our study institutes deny the need for us to change our economic policy.
But some things seem to be self-explanatory.
The European economy needs investment, the private sector is not investing enough because we insist on preventing the public sector from supplementing its investments - is that how we are going to revive the private sector's interest?
By refusing to make use of the possibilities offered by the Treaty and exempt investments from the definition of deficit in the Stability Pact?
I heard Mr Della Vedova refer in trepidation to 'deficit spending' .
Things may have got out of hand in the era of 'deficit spending' but, let us not forget that, in that era, the rate of growth was 5% and unemployment never exceeded 1 to 1.5%, while our current economic policy, based as it is on a high degree of liberalisation of the markets, is a long way from being such a success.
America came close in the last five years of the last century in a climate of excessive speculation and look where that has got us now.
Also, I should like to ask you, Commissioner, as you did me the honour of allowing me to ask you in private: what is the scientific criterion for refuting your position that will make you tell us that our position has been refuted and that we need to change economic policy?
As I am sure you know, without refutability there can be no scientific standpoint.
We keep getting caught in a huge tautology and I am afraid that this is precisely the economic policy which you support.
Mr President, so as to appease the Commissioner and the other honourable Members, may I state for the record that I am not a fan of deficits, of increasing public debt or of inflation.
However, that is not the issue.
Are we forecasting a slump, yes or no?
Some say, wait and see what happens.
But if it does happen, then it will be too late.
Others say, wait and the problem will resolve itself.
Some take cold comfort in the belief that our economy will rally once the economy rallies in the United States and totally ignore the fact that, with globalisation, if that happens, others will benefit from the recovery.
All the wrangling, as a number of honourable members have already said, is about avoiding the notion of public intervention in the economy.
I fail to understand why.
What is the point in being dogmatic, when you have specific problems and, more to the point, the problem of a slump in front of you?
Some of us can imagine various scenarios which marry public intervention with economic stability, that is, increased earnings, without creating the alarming fiscal competition which some people are projecting?
The problem is, we need public expenditure, we have the potential to generate public earnings which do not affect the productive structure or development of the economy or its competitiveness.
Surely you do not mean to tell me that you would have a problem if someone somewhere did something about annuities or the international speculators throwing hot money around on the stock exchange, or even about the excessive wealth and the frantic consumption of our inflated upper middle classes.
We have no scientific answer. We are dogmatic.
No to the public sector and no to a Europe which, if it did all this - because only Europe can do all this - would be a federalist Europe.
Well, I have never heard such dogmatism in my life!
Mr President, the tragic events in America have sent severe economic shock waves through the world.
No country will remain immune to the economic impact of the horrendous terrorist attacks in America.
Those attacks were so severe that it will be some time before the extent of the economic fallout is fully known.
We are already seeing the first economic ramifications of 11 September, a day that will be etched on the memory of us all for evermore.
Job losses are mounting in the airline industry.
The jobs shed at many European airlines will never be filled again.
These job losses in turn affect nearly every aspect of an economy.
Consumer and investor confidence is waning, the value of global and stock markets is down too.
The one encouraging sign is that the euro currency is surviving strongly.
We can now all see the importance of the single European currency and the fact that there are 12 currencies participating within the single European currency regime is lending stability to the European economy.
There could be nothing worse than having 15 independent floating currencies operating within the European Union at the moment.
This would be a recipe for international speculators to come in and play one currency off against another.
We all recall the devaluations which took place in 1992, when the international currency speculators played havoc with the European stock markets.
Thankfully they are not in a position to do so again now, because we have a stable currency operating in Europe and surviving the recent economic shocks.
The terrorist attacks will not affect the timetable for the introduction of euro notes and coins, which will proceed as planned.
It is also clear that the European Central Bank and the various national euro changeover boards have done an excellent job in marketing the new euro economy.
While I have no doubt that there will be some teething problems, we shall overcome them and by the end of the changeover period the citizens of Europe will be fully cognizant of the value of the new euro notes and coins.
Mr President, the resolution by the ELDR Group and the PPE-DE Group has received my backing.
I have always been in favour of strict compliance with the criteria of the Stability Pact.
In this time of uncertainty, extra alertness is called for.
Various Member States are entering the danger zone.
A major advantage of budgetary discipline is manifesting itself: room for automatic stabilisers.
I would like to note in this connection that increasing expenditure is no solution.
What will prove decisive is the quality of the Stability Pact in combination with the necessary reforms in the economy as a whole.
The resolution mentions that the distribution of authority between the Member States and the Union leads to negative action at Member State level.
The reverse is also true.
The Union' s monetary decisions can adversely affect a Member State, for example, in the form of high inflation due to an unwelcome drop in interest rates.
I welcome the attention that this area of tension is receiving.
Thanks to the EMU' s favourable effect, the European economy can become more stable.
Time will tell whether this is proportionate to the loss of custom-made solutions for the Member States.
Budgetary discipline will be crucial in obtaining this stability.
- (ES) Mr President, by this stage in the debate it seems to me that three things must already be clear to us.
Firstly, we know that the European industrial sector is currently experiencing a graver crisis than the one it went through as a result of the 1998 financial crisis.
Secondly, we know that the crisis currently afflicting the world economy is far more serious than the one it underwent in 1993, after the Gulf War. This is because for the first time since 1929, the three largest economies are affected, namely the economies of the United States, Europe and Japan.
Thirdly, except for Mr Abitbol we all know that nowadays the European economy is far better prepared to cope with such a crisis.
As stated earlier, we now have a single currency to protect us from exchange rate crises.
We also have a policy to protect us from exorbitant price rises. In addition, we have a Stability Pact to safeguard us against the munificence of public administrations.
We do not know for certain but we suspect that this crisis is not demand led, like the post-war crisis. Nor is it a supply driven crisis like the one following the Yom Kippur war.
Rather, it is a crisis of confidence. As such, what distinguishes our motion for a resolution from the one put forward by the left is not that they wish to grow while we do not.
Obviously, we all want to grow.
Nevertheless, some recipes will move us forward whilst others will put us into reverse. We believe that our recipes will move us forward.
Allow me to explain the reasons why I think as I do.
If this is a crisis of confidence, it would be a fundamental error to relax monetary policy and allow price rises. That would hole consumer confidence below the water line.
Secondly, because revising the Stability Pact would amount to indicating that we wish to pass this burden on to future generations, and that is certainly not a confidence booster.
Thirdly, if we relax the budgetary policy enshrined in the Stability Pact we shall prevent interest rates from being lowered, as the Americans are doing.
A vessel is not assessed according to whether there is a storm around or not, but according to how it weathers a storm.
In my view, it is now clear that we should change the way we navigate.
The European Central Bank may be driven to reduce interest rates, but it must bear in mind that its ultimate aim is to maintain the dogma of price stability to maintain consumer confidence.
It is likely that some governments who have done their homework will be able to allow the automatic stabilisers to operate. They will not need to compensate for fiscal reduction by increasing taxes or reducing expenditure.
Unfortunately, governments who have failed to do their homework and behaved like prodigal sons will not find themselves in such a fortunate position.
Thirdly, as the Commissioner has said, though previous speakers failed to mention it, it is time for Europe to move ahead and take a determined step forward to get the Lisbon process under way. This process aims to create a modern, innovative and competitive society.
Regarding the Tobin tax, the Commissioner was far more convincing in the interview he granted the Vanguardia Digital, when he said it was a useless tool, than in his speech today. Today the Commissioner stated it was one more potential tool.
Previously the Commissioner stated it was not possible.
Now it begins to appear probable. I endorse what he said to the newspaper but not what he said in the House.
Mr President, all possible measures must be taken to ensure that Europe can provide a real answer to the consequences of the horrendous terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, and a part of that, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, has in fact already been done, namely a joint response from the EU finance ministers.
I think this symbolises Europe's ability to close ranks when the chips are really down.
I believe that this policy should also be pursued further in relation to aid policy.
However, it should also give us the flexibility we need, so as to demonstrate that Europe does not want the economic downturn to be further exacerbated.
We do in fact have a Stability and Growth Pact that gives us many possibilities, because on the one hand we wish Europe to be a Community of stability, and on the other hand we also want to promote growth and employment.
It is no accident that when applying the convergence criteria, exceptional circumstances have sometimes been applied and approved which allow the definition of an excessive deficit to be deviated from.
I do not mean by that to speak in favour of a 'Community of instability' .
Just the opposite in fact, I wish to call on the Belgian Presidency and the Commission to contribute to further coordination in this area, by taking advantage of the fact that stability programmes can be updated.
I would like to see updated stability programmes for the euro countries which make it clear that the data has significantly changed.
What is needed in this context, as you quite rightly said yourself, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, is for us to avoid procyclical policies in Europe, in both the expansionist and restrictive senses. However, we can only do that if we can compare cyclically neutral budget data with structural deficits in updated budget figures.
I think that it would be helpful if the excitement that this debate has generated in this House led to further progress being made both in economic policy and in stability policy.
I say that because the European Union needs both monetary stability and employment and social stability.
Firstly, I would like to thank you for giving me the floor.
Unfortunately, I cannot remain in the House for very long as I have a meeting at 4.30 p.m. with your contact group to debate the development of the Members' Statute. I regard this as an important subject and this is an important meeting.
I requested it myself. I will be back here in the House at 5.30 p.m. to respond to the many questions you wish to put to me.
I would therefore like to thank you very much for listening to what I have to say now.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am sure that you all appreciated the importance attached to every word of my speech, and the significance of every adjective I used when I spoke on behalf of the Presidency of the Council and the Council itself. Please excuse me if I do not now try to interpret my previous speech further.
I was speaking on behalf of the whole of the Council.
Consequently, I think I explained clearly how our thinking is developing. I also defined the limits ECOFIN and the ministers themselves have already set.
I then described the nature of the ongoing debate. Those of you, you are all here, will certainly wish to have experts available to monitor the development of this debate closely.
Of course, the conclusions of this debate are considerably more important.
I believe that we are, at last, more or less in agreement with the objectives we wish to achieve, even if there is less agreement on the best means of achieving them.
I am sure that this debate will continue.
However, I would like to make two brief observations of my own. Mr Berthu, a longstanding colleague of mine, said that everything was so much better when each country had full control of its financial and economic instruments.
However, I must disagree with you on this point, Mr Berthu.
I have been around long enough to know that the reality was very different, and it was at that time too. Europe has experienced very serious financial and economic crises, and has found it extremely difficult to overcome them.
This is my first point.
I would now like to move on to my second point.
I shall not quickly forget the time in the 1970s when people sang the praises of the deficit spending policy. This was a time of economic slowdown in my country, and those in positions of responsibility praised the policy of deficit spending to high heaven.
It took us fifteen years to recover from the effects of this policy. I do not wish this policy to be implemented in the European Union.
However, everything I have heard here goes quite in the opposite direction. I am sure that you will make it your business to monitor this situation very closely and will be extremely vigilant.
Thank you very much for your attention.
Thank you for informing the House of the reason for your absence, Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck.
Be assured that we wish you every success with such a sensitive matter.
Mr President, we are living at a time when it is becoming clearer that the Stability Pact functions as an obstacle to development and to economic and social cohesion: by considering monetary and nominal convergence as a priority, by making restrictive budgets mandatory, it prevents those countries with major difficulties from being able to engage in a policy of investment, particularly public investment, in a period such as the present one of slowdown in economic activity and the threat of international recession.
In various countries and from different sources warnings are being issued regarding the need to amend the Stability Pact and the priority being given to the monetarist policies of neo-liberalism.
This situation is being felt both in the more developed countries and in those where situations of the greatest inequality prevail and/or where threats of social tension are emerging.
In a country like Portugal, which has the lowest salaries, pensions and reforms in the European Union and the highest rates of premature school-leaving, accidents at work and poverty, the application of rigid timetables and deadlines and major restrictions on public spending and investment is unacceptable, because this will impede the country' s development and obstruct the way to economic and social cohesion.
The need for the immediate suspension of the Stability Pact is, therefore, very topical.
In a European Union that claims to be concerned with social problems, committed to the creation of jobs and the fight against social exclusion and poverty, maintaining monetary stability at any cost cannot continue to be considered as a priority, when we know that the consequences will be more unemployment, more salary restrictions and more poverty.
It is not a question of merely calling for some flexibility in the criteria of the Stability Pact and the implementation of the growth and stability programmes, which each country has had to present.
It is essential to engage in an in-depth revision of the objectives, criteria and foundations of the Stability Pact, starting from the premise that the budgets of the Member States must reflect the needs of each people and each country and not the interests of the financial groups that the European Central Bank is seeking to convey.
Mr President, Commissioner Solbes, we need more Europe, and the Stability Pact is a tool for building Europe.
It is a complex and anomalous tool, not found in textbooks and universities; in fact, it replaces a true economic and budget balance policy on a federal scale.
But in order to be effective, such a tool must be credible and based on definite rules and obligations that are respected by all.
Changing the rules during the difficult process of convergence, less than one hundred days before the birth of the euro proper, would therefore be a serious mistake.
The Stability Pact must not, therefore, be relaxed or have its deadlines or targets changed; any such approach would be merely short-sighted opportunism and disastrous for the building of Europe.
The Stability Pact should, rather, be strengthened, improved and made more efficient; targets that only refer to budget balances are no longer enough.
Budget balances are a necessary but not sufficient objective, because there will be a growing need to aim at quality in public spending and the medium to long-term sustainability of public finances in the individual euro countries; in this connection, it is sufficient to think of the pension deficit.
Commissioner, even a Stability Pact interpreted in the most responsible, far-sighted manner possible would do nothing for the credibility of our currency if there were not a massive acceleration in the process of completing economic union at the same time, with greater genuine convergence, greater social cohesion, greater development, greater liberalisation, and a greater market for services and energy.
Though we need therefore to comply with and value the Stability and Growth Pact, as much attention should also be devoted to the subject of the Lisbon agenda.
Unfortunately, the Stockholm European Council was a step backwards in this respect.
Commissioner, Minister, for the sake of the euro and our Europe, let us avoid similar steps backwards in future.
Mr President, Commissioner, Europe is not technically in recession, but it is clearly experiencing a situation of slower growth, and we cannot yet predict all the economic, political and social consequences that this will have.
Within this framework, many people are questioning the validity of the restrictive and fundamentalist way in which the Growth and Stability Pact has been interpreted and the consequences that this interpretation may have on the very process of development and cohesion in Europe.
The Stability Pact is a global commitment, which combines the realism of a specific macro-economic scenario with a healthy concern for the consolidation of public finances.
The Pact should be interpreted in its entirety and, obviously, if one of the terms of the equation is altered, the other term must be adjusted and made flexible.
I do not want to get into an argument with the followers of the school of single thought, who have, unfortunately, come to play a leading role on the European economic policy scene.
But I cannot refrain from stating that any true defence of the Growth and Stability Pact requires, first and foremost, an understanding of it.
Now, understanding it means that it is correct to agree, in an unfavourable international situation, to accommodate the unavoidable loss of income and the consequent increase in the public deficit, provided it does not exceed 3%, as Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck rightly stated.
This cannot and must not be confused with any laxity or inefficiency by the revenue authorities, much less with relinquishing in the medium term a policy of adjustment supported by budgetary procedures and a serious and ongoing effort to control public spending and improve administrative efficiency at every level.
Controlling and streamlining public spending are worthy objectives.
We are not, therefore, talking about a revision or cancellation of the Stability Pact.
Consolidating spending does not mean irrationally demanding a linear reduction of deficits.
It does mean considering that in the medium term budgetary balances from one year should be balanced with those of the next.
Mr President, stability and growth are objectives of economic activity that everyone wants, whichever party or group in the European Parliament they belong to.
However, when it comes to defining these concepts and in particular when it comes to how we should achieve these objectives, then there are considerable differences between us.
A purely fiscal interpretation will not help us to solve the present problems, which are reflected in falling economic growth and consistently high unemployment.
The market economy as an economic concept is fine, but it is unacceptable as a social policy tool.
Or to put it another way, the market can and should regulate the economy, but not society.
We see the priority as being not a supply-oriented economic policy, but a demand-oriented one.
We do not believe that liberalisation is a panacea.
We need not only commercial competition, but also a linkage with economic and social criteria, in order to achieve the highest possible level of social security, sustainability and justice.
Balancing budgets is fine, but not at any price.
In contrast to the President-in-Office, I wish to call for an anticyclical economic policy.
In times of recession, increasing public expenditure on investment in new capacity and in education and training are essential.
We have the euro area, but we do not have a European economic, fiscal and social policy.
That cannot work.
It is not just a matter of achieving price stability alone, which is the ECB's remit, we also need to achieve socio-economic stability.
A more flexible approach to the existing convergence criteria will not solve the problem, it will just shift the burden to those who meet the criteria.
We need a new version that takes into account additional parameters such as the employment rate, the value-added ratio and the investment ratio, because these indicators reflect economic strength and development.
Mr President, Commissioner, the dark clouds of recession are looming in the west, in part due to the piercing of the asset bubble of the US stock market, but further exacerbated by the tragic events of 11 September.
The US Federal Reserve has now dropped the federal funds rate to 2.5% - a 39-year low.
This is the ninth rate cut this year.
The ECB may respond shortly, but almost two years since the euro's launch, there is as yet little enthusiasm for its future role as the major international reserve currency.
This is in part the result of exchange-rate weakness and, in part, because the notes and coins are not yet in circulation, so it cannot yet be heralded as an unqualified success.
It remains to be seen if the one-size-fits-all model of interest rates will work in all the countries of the Union, in particular countries like Ireland.
These concerns and the added concerns about constitutional implications and loss of sovereignty leave my country, the UK, happy to remain outside for the time being.
Although clearly we all wish the project well, it has frankly confounded many pessimists including our former Prime Minister John Major.
Some years ago, the Commission in its McDougal report concluded that central tax-raising powers of at least 7% of GDP would be needed to allow counter-cyclical spending and transfer payments to make a single-currency zone function properly.
This would, of course, have been anathema to Member States, so they decided instead on strict spending, borrowing and inflation limits in Dublin in 1996 as an alternative.
Recently, there have been calls to make these Stability and Growth Pact ceilings more flexible.
This is unwise in my opinion, as I believe firmly that a prudent approach to public finance and borrowing is a good thing.
Furthermore, the British economy is linked to and becoming more convergent with the euro zone, so we all have an incentive to stick to the guidelines and we must not allow the US crisis to be an excuse for new, big government tax-and-spend policies.
The Stability Pact includes mechanisms designed to operate in recession and Article 2.1 on the excessive deficit procedure could be used in exceptional circumstances to justify higher military or security spending.
But Member States should concentrate on structural reforms, particularly in their labour markets, as the way ahead.
Otherwise, we would only have high inflation and massive increases in the mountain of national debt.
Mr President, by a diabolical coincidence, it is aeroplanes that illustrate what sort of a world we are living in today.
There was the tragedy in New York and there were the events yesterday in another dimension, at another level, in the airports around Switzerland.
It may have been Swissair but it could equally easily have been Sabena or Olympic Airways or another airline.
You could say that we are dogmatic in the European Union about refusing to see what is going on around us.
That is our right.
But I think that to be dogmatic to the point where you refuse to see what even Mr Bush's government with its ultra-conservative economic philosophy and Mr O'Nill in the United States can see is taking things too far.
To refuse to see the 15 billion given to the airlines, to refuse to see that, for both political and economic reasons, international movements of funds need to be controlled somewhere along the line if we are to have both economic and political stability, to refuse to see that governments need to stop being petty and to take things in hand.
In this sense, I think that to abide dogmatically by a Stability Pact decided under different circumstances ten years ago is a big mistake.
Mr President, in the spring, the Council took a clear stance in favour of the Stability and Growth Pact.
Around the summer recess, a few finance ministers considered it necessary to express as their own personal opinion the fact that more scope was required in the Pact as a result of a declining economy.
This was apparently not an official government view because the requirements were not repeated on the platforms eminently placed to deal with this, including the ECOFIN Council.
Quite the reverse, in fact. On those occasions, warm words were spoken about the Pact.
Despite these fine words, President Duisenberg considered the talk of relaxing the rules very worrying.
Commissioner Solbes Mira even addressed Italy, France, Germany and Portugal in a stern manner and urged them to translate the agreements into action.
And he is right.
It is not acceptable for governments repeatedly to adopt a high tone and demand reductions in the interest rate from the Central Bank when they have failed to do their own homework.
If all Member States, when economic growth allowed for this, had taken the required structural measures, the Central Bank would now be able to be more flexible in its interest policy.
After all, there is a direct link between the budgetary policy and the interest policy in the policy mix.
Various MEPs have spoken about 11 September and Mr Herzog even went so far as to claim that the euro does not protect us against financial crises.
I think he is very much mistaken.
After 11 September, the Central Bank took action in an admirable manner and has most definitely shielded us from a financial cash crisis.
Some time ago, Ireland was severely punished when it gave another stimulus to an almost overheated economy, contributing further to high inflation.
As far as I am concerned, Ireland might serve as an example, but we should also be courageous, and level criticism at large countries.
We should especially target those countries that fully deserve the criticism.
And let us be aware of the fact that the financial markets are closely monitoring the way in which the Member States are currently handling their government budgets in a declining economy.
The current situation is a test of how sound the euro construction really is.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have had a very in-depth discussion of this subject today.
I have gradually been sensing that this debate has made it clearer and clearer how justified the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats was in taking the initiative to table this motion, and how important that was.
There are 89 days to go until the euro notes and coins come into circulation, and on top of that challenge we are living in very uncertain times.
At the same time there have been reactions in some governments around making the Stability and Growth Pact an issue. We have already heard the names of certain people in some governments who have not done their homework properly when it comes to the Stability and Growth Pact.
For that reason it is particularly important in these uncertain times and with 89 days to go before the euro comes in, to convey a sense of clarity and calm to the markets and also to consumers.
Europe's Stability and Growth Pact will not be shaken.
That is why it is necessary to counter the idea that weakening the Stability and Growth Pact is a way of acting to prevent a recession.
It is simply not true that inflation can create jobs.
And it is not true that the Stability and Growth Pact did not allow enough leeway for hard times.
The Member States that have the greatest leeway are the ones that have done most of their homework.
So I can only urge you not to play with fire.
It is irresponsible to add to uncertainty at a time when things are already uncertain, and the Stability Pact is a requirement for the stability of the euro.
Mr President, the object of the Stability and Growth Pact is to achieve lasting stability in the financial markets, which have remained a national responsibility since the beginning of the single currency.
This means that the Stability Pact is a necessary counterpart in financial policy terms to the policy of monetary union and it is a financial policy substitute for political union, which did not come into being at the same time as monetary union.
The objective of the pact is to ensure that there is sufficient leeway in budgets when times are good and to make provision for bad times.
Some Member States, including Germany, have failed to do this recently.
However, no sooner have the first difficulties appeared than people have started talking about how the criteria are interpreted.
The usual criticism is that although the pact promotes stability, it also acts as a fiscal straitjacket and thus exacerbates weakness in monetary growth.
This criticism fails to take account of the facts.
The commitment made is to balance budgets in the medium term and to limit deficits, and it cannot therefore be thrown up in the air as soon as growth subsides.
That is why a clear signal is needed from ECOFIN, especially after the discussions that have taken place.
With just three months to go before the euro comes into circulation, as Mr Karas mentioned, we need a sign of stability.
The problem is that we have failed to achieve the Lisbon objective of becoming the region with the strongest growth in the world.
But we can only achieve that objective if the Member States do their homework.
They cannot blame this on the European Central Bank.
I would also like to take issue with Mr Tannock for suggesting that the ECB has not met its objectives during this period of crisis.
The ECB in particular has reacted very well since 11 September, and the euro has held up.
However, the fact that we were already discussing the Stability and Growth Pact before 11 September meant that we were playing with fire, as Mr Karas put it, and causing uncertainty.
If we had not done that we would be able to debate the future of the euro in a far calmer way now.
Mr President, with only a few days before the introduction of the euro, I believe we should most of all avoid the risk of confirming a contradiction between convergence and stability policies on the one hand and, on the other, policies aiming at sustaining the processes of growth and lasting development, in accordance with the objectives of the Lisbon Summit.
Bearing in mind the implementation of planned and existing automatic stabilisers, I think the objectives set in the Stability and Growth Pact should not be presented or seen as obstacles to growth or the need to respond - politically too - to the consequences of a downturn in the economic climate like the one we are now going through.
Furthermore, I believe it would be just as wrong to present compliance with the Stability Pact objectives as being a sufficient or, worse still, the only possible reaction to a context with a clear risk of recession.
I believe that in such circumstances there is once again a need especially to speed up progress towards two goals.
The first is to specify and perfect tools of analysis and control, to ensure that public finances are used consistently and concomitantly in support of selective investment programmes that are strictly targeted and as such useful in an absolute sense - and even more necessary when compensating for the economic downturn.
The second goal, confirming the positive nature of the Stability and Growth Pact, is to adapt and consolidate it so it remains in operation beyond the time when it should have reached its objectives, thus improving the conditions and strengthening the tools for an effective Community economic policy.
Mr President, rather than talk about the Stability and Growth Pact I want to comment on another subject which was raised at the informal ECOFIN and with which this debate deals, and that is the Member States' ministers' call for Parliament's agreement on the Money Laundering directive.
I would like to echo that call for both colleagues across the European Parliament and governments across Europe to reach an agreement on this directive as soon as possible.
This has been made all the more crucial by the tragic events of 11 September.
Terror that day struck at the heart of the global financial system.
The terrorists were clearly prepared to use all the mechanisms and tools that the global financial system gave them in planning that attack.
Let us turn those tools against them.
Many bankers and finance workers died in that attack.
Let us enlist the help of those bankers and finance workers in responding to it and preventing a repetition thereof, because this is a concrete step that we can take in the war against terrorism.
No-one is going to ask us to go and die on an Afghan hillside, though others will be asked to pay that price.
But we too can - and should - make a contribution, because the bankers, brokers, cleaners, IT technicians, investment advisers, lawyers and caterers who spill off our trains into city centres in Frankfurt, Paris, London and Brussels are just the same as those 5000 or 6000 people who turned up for work in New York one day and will never ever come home.
The time has come to stop quibbling about lawyer confidentiality.
I call on this Parliament to agree to a directive which will help starve the terrorists of funds.
I call on it to agree to the freezing of assets of terrorist organisations, because someone, somewhere, is banking bin Laden's money.
We can help starve him of funds, which is as important a task as the military operation which we know will soon follow.
Mr President, Commissioner Solbes, ladies and gentlemen, at a time of particular international tension, I believe I can state that the Stability and Growth Pact is like a guarantee of our will to uphold all the restructuring plans and growth programmes that underlie the building of an economically strong, cohesive and genuinely competitive Europe.
Any idea of waiving or relaxing established plans would undermine the future development of the whole of Europe.
There is now an aspect that should also be given due consideration: the massaging of budget balance data so as not to reveal any anomalies that may still persist in certain public accounts.
Unfortunately, in this respect, we in Italy have had to face a sad legacy from the centre-left.
This is not the right attitude, certainly worse than that of failing to bring the economy into line with the required parameters. While the former case involves fraudulence, the latter is, it is hoped, just a momentary, temporary difficulty.
Such massaging of data should be clamped down on with no half measures and penalties can be imposed where appropriate.
In the context of the Pact and the general awareness that it should be observed, it cannot be ignored that certain areas or even entire regions - southern Italy, southern Spain, southern and part of northern France, and eastern Germany - are certainly behind the rest.
While the Member State as a whole must observe the pacts it has signed, it is also true that special relief measures for these areas - I refer to differential taxation, the use of unused Structural Funds for tax credits, new types of aid after 2006 for countries excluded from Objective 1 - should not only not be considered censurable but should be seen as desirable by all.
Mr President, I should like to thank all those who took part in the debate for their comments and contributions.
I shall start by pointing out that our economic situation is different from that of the United States.
The European Union' s point of departure is quite other from the United States' : our balances are not the same either, what has taken place in the United States has not taken place in Europe and, furthermore, our institutional framework is not the same.
In my view it would be unrealistic and undesirable to try to apply the American model to Europe.
It has emerged from the debate that some of you feel our main concern is to prevent public sector involvement.
That is not at all the case.
We have never conceived of this issue in terms of a public sector versus private sector debate.
There is scope for more public investment. There can be more public involvement, always of course within the rules laid down in the system we have created for ourselves to ensure more effective operation of the balance between monetary and fiscal policy.
The ECOFIN decision on airlines and insurance cover as a result of the political risks involved is a good example of the swift effect of public action.
The debate then moved on to focus on the Growth and Stability Pact.
Some of you are of the opinion that those of us in favour of the pact are adopting a fundamentalist position, others find it dogmatic. Some of you have even mooted the possibility of doing away with the pact altogether.
I would be inclined to side with the presidency and with those of you who have referred to something I consider crucial.
The Growth and Stability Pact is intended to serve as an instrument to facilitate anticyclical action by the public finances.
That was its original aim and remains its essential nature.
Hence there is no question of dogmatism or fundamentalism.
We could discuss whether our past experience, gained from implementing the pact during periods of growth, has led us to the conclusion that it is only applicable to that end.
True, in times of growth we were not particularly dogmatic as far as exhausting the possibilities of the pact with regard to reducing the public deficit in certain Member States. We may well be regretting that just now.
Returning to the logic enshrined in the pact, the pact does allow anticyclical actions.
There is no doubt that the pact' s flexibility is due to two fundamental elements.
The first concerns exceptional circumstances and it is not relevant to analyse these now, as exceptional circumstances are only invoked in times of deep recession or when growth has fallen below certain levels. The second element concerns the normal implementation of the pact through the operation of the automatic stabilisers.
In the specific case of the automatic stabilisers, the element of flexibility is contained in the pact itself. I can state quite clearly that in no way are we amending any position.
Rather, the nature of the pact provides accordingly.
In the code of conduct adopted by ECOFIN last July it was already stated that one of the fundamental elements of the Growth and Stability Pact is the medium-term objective for the fiscal position. It is made quite clear that assessment of the objective for the various countries should take explicit account of the cyclical position and its implications for the budget.
Clearly, as some of you have pointed out, this element will therefore have to be taken into account when adjusting Member States' stability programmes.
On occasion, the Commission has insisted that the cyclically adjusted deficit position should be included in information on the stability programmes. You are well aware, ladies and gentlemen, that we are experiencing technical difficulties.
The latter relate not only to the concept but also to the method of calculating this structurally adjusted position.
Obviously, rather than making us more flexible, this will allow us to apply the pact to a reality different from that which prevailed when the various stability programmes were defined.
It further implies as I said in my first speech, that in the Commission' s interpretation nominal objectives must not be considered set in stone.
The nominal objectives are linked to certain assumptions on growth.
Consequently, as I stated, there are no problems, there is flexibility and no dogmatism. Rather, we have moved on to a different stage as far as implementation of the Growth and Stability Pact is concerned.
Would an approach involving greater spending resolve the problems?
I do not believe it would.
Our position is that given the European experience in recent years, involving a rather procyclical approach to this type of decision, and having observed the difficulty experienced in regaining balance, it is not a wise option.
As I said in my opening speech, we therefore remain of the opinion that the best choice is to opt for more Europe. Some of you have argued along the same lines.
More Europe means Lisbon.
In the context of Lisbon, more Europe means increasing our potential growth.
More Europe means more efficient systems.
More Europe also means taking greater account of the impact of the crisis on the international markets. It also means taking into account factors as significant as international commercial negotiations on development aid, and all those related factors which will doubtless allow us to improve the context.
In conclusion, more Europe can also mean progress on issues linked to fiscal competence which some of you have referred to, ladies and gentlemen. There is no doubt about that.
More Europe will certainly mean progress in the fight against money laundering. All this is undoubtedly essential if we are to cope successfully with the tasks we have set ourselves.
A debate such as today' s warranted a much longer reply. Unfortunately however, we are running out of time.
Nonetheless, I was anxious to comment quickly on these ideas to make the Commission' s position on this final item quite clear.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
I have received seven motions for resolution, pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon.
Television without frontiers
The next item is the report (A5-0286/2001) by Mrs Hieronymi, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on the third report of the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament and the Economic and Social Committee, on the application of Directive 89/552/CEE 'Television without frontiers' (COM(2001)9 - C5-0190/2001 - 2001/2086(COS)).
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the objective of the Television without frontiers directive is to establish an EU legal framework to promote the free circulation of audio-visual broadcasting services and to guarantee certain particularly important interests, such as pluralism, cultural diversity, and the protection of consumers and minors.
We have before us today the Commission's report on the application of the directive for the period 1997 to 2000.
The key points to emerge from this report are as follows.
The main objectives of the directive have been achieved, but a thoroughgoing revision of the directive is needed.
The five main points of the report, very briefly, are these: firstly, the directive has been implemented in 12 Member States, with three yet to follow suit.
Secondly, the television sector experienced an overall phase of continuous growth between 1997 and 2000.
This applies both to the number of television channels and also to the total turnover of radio and television broadcasters and to the advertising turnover of both state-owned and private broadcasters.
Nevertheless, the report indicates that when it comes to trade in television programmes, Europe has a deficit with the United States of some USD 2.9 billion, while the overall deficit of the audio-visual sector is some USD 6.6 billion.
Thirdly, the 50% quota for European works was clearly exceeded, except in Portugal, falling in a range between 53% and 81%.
Fourthly, although the provisions on the protection of minors were complied with overall, there needs to be better coordination in future.
Fifthly, four countries have so far made use of the new provisions under Article 3a about broadcasting events of particular importance to the community, and four others are planning to take advantage of those provisions, particularly for sporting events.
The committee noted shortcomings in the report with regard to implementation in the candidate countries and in the analysis of trends in media concentration.
The digital era is now on the way, and the integration of television, PCs and the Internet requires a fundamental revision of the TWF directive so as to create a European legal framework for broadcasting audio-visual material with various degrees of regulation.
The cornerstones of this should be as follows: first, the rules on advertising should be reviewed and made more flexible; second, the quota arrangements should be reviewed to see if they can continue to be a suitable instrument for promoting European works; third, we must guarantee open and compatible standards for various systems covering rights of access; fourth, there is a need for stronger and more effective self-regulation, particularly as regards the protection of minors; fifth, the trends in vertical and horizontal integration of the media should be analysed, and sixth, a review of the arrangements under Article 3a and how they are to be dealt within future is required.
I can therefore give my full support to Amendments Nos 2, 3 and 4 which have been tabled here.
The preparations for this review process should take into account the exceptional impact of television and new technology on democracy and society, particularly in the digital era.
The process of gauging public opinion therefore needs to be carried out openly, in a way that takes account of both experts in the audio-visual sector and the views of the public.
So I very much welcome the fact that the Commission has provided for a broad communication process, and we hope, Commissioner, that in view of the speed with which digital technology is developing you will bring forward your proposed review as soon as possible.
However, I would like to make an appeal to everyone: we must take advantage of the opportunities for dialogue over the next 18 months to demonstrate that the European Parliament cares about what matters to the public, especially when cultural issues are involved.
Mr President, I declare an interest as a director of a television documentary company, in which I am now not very active; but I retain my concern for the quality of our broadcasting and television.
I welcome Mrs Hieronymi's report and salute her for it.
It goes to the heart of the cultural diversity that we prize in Europe.
We defend public service obligations - however the service concerned may be financed - and the principles of universal access, which constantly come back in all of our debates now about technology.
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has taken heed of the imbalance in the European audio-visual market place, and I hope the Commissioner will be able speak on this.
Since 1999 the revenues of European television companies have grown by an average of 46.3%.
In that time, public-service broadcasting hardly grew at all and creative television production in the five major producing countries of the European Union was sluggish or, in some cases, falling.
At the same time, US programme sales to Europe - programmes which, as we know, are reaping their tertiary reward, having already cleared their primary and secondary rewards in the US market directly and by satellite and cable - grew massively.
That is not a healthy situation.
The protection of the diverse market in Europe remains crucial.
The imperatives of the technology should be linked to what consumers need, as well as what the production empires want to sell.
Article 3a, referred to earlier by the rapporteur, shows what can be done to keep the widest audience for special events.
I too support Mrs Junker's amendments and others on the same point.
It was a major change for the better and it showed that we can intervene here and in the European Union.
We need to return to the issue of media concentration and how that relates to the public good, not just in terms of diversity but also in terms of raw political power.
Finally, we ought to be able to say to the applicant countries: do as we do and not merely as we say.
That means having rules that are observed, for them as well as for us.
Mr President, this directive, which was devised in 1989, bears the highly suggestive title 'Television without frontiers' , but one could not really have imagined that it would also be without time limits.
This area, which was subject to innovative legislation thirteen years ago, has clearly changed radically and to an amazing extent.
The same even applies to the update we passed in 1997: everything has been left behind by the driving force of new technologies and also fashion.
We are thus increasingly sure that the review of this directive, until now expected for 2002, will be brought forward to the beginning of next year, without waiting for too many months to go by.
The last five years have, in fact seen a veritable revolution in the television sector; the old TV has now become a supporting actor, a technical tool in the service of digital innovation, the webcasting invasion, the Internet and interactive relationships between user and broadcaster.
A global, up-to-date review is also needed because of all the other problems that directly or indirectly surround the world of television, such as the increase in turnover of the networks, the steady and increasingly disturbing invasion by advertising, the explosion of private broadcasters, and the growing social and moral implications of certain programming.
The scope of the directive needs to be broadened to embrace not only the subjects mentioned above but also others that are already included but are insufficiently developed, such as the problems of intellectual property, respect for children as often unsupervised users, the cultural levels of programmes - taking into account not only the interests and requirements of those who make them but especially the feelings of those at whom these products are targeted - and lastly the confrontation with American productions, a subject on which there was quite a harsh confrontation in 1997 but which remained to a great extent unresolved.
Lastly, on this subject, I also hope we can again discuss the so-called 'right to information' , a right which, because of equal opportunities, should clearly concern not only the citizens of the European Union but also all those living outside who receive programmes produced inside the EU.
It is not enough just to guarantee the great sporting events, as we did in 1997, since man does not live on football alone - if you will forgive the pun.
We must distribute constantly updated information, based on culture and constantly updated, not only to those who live within the European Union but especially to those less favoured by geographical location or social and economic status.
Everybody' s 'right to a satellite dish' is not enough: you need the money to get one.
Imagine what can come into houses through a dish in the remotest parts of the world.
The most precious aid is that reserved for the production of programmes designed to report, safeguard and make proposals, in the sense of safeguarding regional and local cultures.
Finally, let me renew an invitation to the Member States.
The rapporteur, whom I congratulate, and whose amendments and positions I support, reminded us that only twelve Member States have so far implemented the directive.
Well, Commissioner, let us take this opportunity to give the Member States this message again: believe in this directive, because it will become increasingly urgent, current and important, and if you believe us you must first of all implement it!
Mr President, we agree that revision of the Television without frontiers directive is urgently needed.
Firstly, it is needed because the context in which the televisual market operates, as it has been described, is so different from what it was when the directive was last revised that it does not seem feasible to retain the latter for a further two or three years.
As an estimate, we could say that at most, the directive only covers some 50% of the problems currently experienced in the sector.
Secondly, revision is required because we need to come up with solutions which were not provided at the time. Television remains the main source of information and entertainment for most Europeans.
In my view, apart from the issue of the low quality of content, it is beset by three main problems. Too much advertising is broadcast, with no thought for its suitability or the ages and timings involved.
Only rarely are European films broadcast, which is an affront to European culture.
The business of digitalising programmes so they can be shown on subscription channels has taken off.
Doubtless these problems already existed in 1996, but the situation is now critical. This suggests that although the directive has been successful as far as the free circulation of television services within the Community is concerned, it has failed in other important areas.
The Commission' s communication does not allow us to assess the efforts Member States made to redress the situation in the three years under scrutiny.
Suffice it to say that three Member States did not even transpose the directive into their legislation.
Most probably, the results for the remaining Member States were not identical, but the Commission has not made such a comparative study available.
There is little detail on the situation in the candidate countries. This should feature prominently in the new directive.
For all these reasons, Mrs Hieronymi has refrained from launching an in-depth debate in her report. I believe she was wise to do so.
This debate should take place when the directive is revised, and she has requested such a revision.
A number of guidelines to inform the process have been laid down. I should like to refer to just a few of these, namely the urgent need to introduce new services based on new technologies, the need to stimulate and accelerate the transition to digital technology and the coordination of the new directive with the revision of the directive on electronic commerce.
The Socialist Group will therefore vote in favour of the report and endorse two amendments tabled by Mrs Junker. Regarding these amendments, I would like to highlight the need for Community legislation to ensure that events or shows of great interest to the citizens should be protected from digitalisation so that they can be made available to all social classes free of charge.
Mr President, Commissioner, while I would like, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, to thank the rapporteur for this report, I would also like to echo the previous speaker in drawing attention to the future.
The Commission' s report states that the next report on the directive must also address issues which are important to the consumer, such as operational compatibility, conditional access and how the transition to digital broadcast technology will take place, but the world may already have moved on by the time the next report is drawn up.
I would like to remind everyone that, when debating the 'telecom package' , Parliament approved by a large majority the fact that we should demand an open, common standard for TV transmitters and receivers, the only one so far approved in Europe and known as the MHP standard.
This standard would guarantee a situation in which all consumers knew what applied and one in which they had the confidence to acquire the necessary equipment. It would also guarantee that vertically divided markets did not arise.
A large majority of Parliament backed this view.
But what has happened since then?
The Commission does not support this decision, and the Council has entirely ignored the issue, which I believe is of immense importance if we are to achieve what is known as Digital Update and promote digital technology in all TV markets.
I therefore hope that the Commission in its entirety can start to support the demands which have been made by Parliament and which we in the ELDR Group would like to clarify a little.
The rapporteur has already pointed out this requirement, but I would like to repeat it in order to make it clear to all the services of the Commission.
Some have said that 'Television without Frontiers' is a loaded title for the directive.
There is also a special set of problems in this context.
In many cases we see that the directive has not functioned in the intended manner with regard to opinion-formers or individual consumers who wish to view TV from another country.
The Commission has found that the way in which copyright is handled prevents it from doing so.
I hope that this issue too will be debated in greater depth in the future.
Mr President, there are many who believe that this report does not go far enough in analysing the potential problems facing us as we embark on the revision of the Television without frontiers directive, expected in 2002 as we are all aware.
However, it raises some very important issues and it is important to start that dialogue now.
My personal concern is the role of public service broadcasters in this important agenda.
It is important to recognise that today's public service broadcasting needs to adapt to the changes.
Today's radio and TV sector is a competitive one and the market forces which largely govern it cannot be ignored.
Public service broadcasters have a crucial role to play in the digital world.
Public service broadcasters make programmes of high quality in indigenous languages reflecting indigenous cultures.
They also have a crucial role to play in encouraging people to use and understand the new digital media.
I agree with the Commissioner's statement in a recent communication that broadcasting and culture should remain within the WTO's services category and that this arrangement should be respected.
Having established that, we then need to be absolutely certain that there is sufficient scope for national and EU legislation to protect public services and cultural entities.
Robust and determined early regulatory action will be needed to create the open environment we all seek, and one which is in the real interests of all citizens and economies of Europe.
Europe has to compete in the digital world where consumers and citizens can wander freely and where competition delivers diversity and choice.
With its complementary mix then of private and public service broadcasters, the European audiovisual model guarantees pluralism of information, cultural diversity and access for all to information, education, entertainment and the arts.
I will be voting in favour of the report and look forward very much to the forthcoming debates as we look to the future.
Mr President, I would first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur on the work she has done and also the Commission on such an appropriate initiative.
Nevertheless, I would like to highlight three aspects which seem to me very important.
The first is the importance of the audiovisual sector in promoting sport.
We must not forget that sport contributes to forging an identity and bringing people together, as well as uniting sportspeople and spectators by offering the latter the opportunity to identify with their nation.
Furthermore, sport is one of the fields of activity which most affects and touches on the citizens of the European Union regardless of their age or social origin, and therefore sport cannot and must not be discriminatory and all the citizens of the European Union must be able to see sporting events.
They must not be a privilege for the few, since these events are of great importance to our society.
The second issue is the need to control advertising slots, and I therefore fully support the rapporteur when she backs the Commission' s strategy of carrying out a study on the repercussions of television advertising and TV shopping techniques on minors.
And the third issue I would like to highlight is my total support for the rapporteur' s request that the Member States strengthen dialogue and cooperation on all issues relating to the protection of minors and young people.
We cannot aspire to a world without violence when our future adults spend the day watching increasingly violent animated cartoons, films and news items.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in 2000 there were 152 households in the European Union with television sets able to receive over 580 different channels.
That implies a growth of around 180% in just four years.
These figures alone should be enough to illustrate that the conventional television market, which only covers a small part of the overall audio-visual sector, is a major growth sector.
The Commission report shows that the Television without frontiers directive, which was originally highly controversial in my own country in particular, has proved its worth.
It provides sensible conditions for international broadcasting.
In the period covered by the report, 50 channels were already aiming chiefly at markets outside their local area.
The TWF directive closed various regional legal gaps and created binding standards for areas including advertising and the protection of minors, thus creating a level playing field in terms of equal opportunities and competitiveness.
I welcome the way the Hieronymi report sets all this out.
However, it also makes it clear that we need to embark as quickly as possible on a new review of the TWF directive, if we are to keep pace with the fast-moving developments in the audio-visual sector in a time of increasing digitalisation.
That applies not only to the provision of all kinds of multimedia services, it also involves an appropriate approach to the trend in concentration of the media, which is also progressing at a pace that is hard to follow.
The other side of the coin is the need to ensure freedom of information, diversity of opinion and pluralism, and to establish an essential multimedia foundation to promote European cultural diversity.
Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate Ruth Hieronymi on her excellent work on this issue.
Her achievement has been demonstrated by the wide consensus she has obtained on this important but extremely sensitive subject.
I agree with the general philosophy of her report and with the proposals it contains.
As regards the method used, I think it is regrettable that the results obtained were not evaluated in relation to the set objectives.
This would have produced a better picture of the real cultural and economic implications of this directive for each of the Member States and candidate countries.
On the other hand, I support the wish of the rapporteur and the Commission to propose a revision of the directive, and to do this in parallel with the revision of other directives, after initiating three in-depth studies.
Only an overall approach will lead in the medium term to the development of a coherent and forceful policy. Please note I am talking about an approach.
This is something that the directive does not at present provide. The audiovisual sector has undergone profound changes.
New services have necessitated new technologies and have also led to an increase in the number of broadcasters. As a result, the sector has been completely transformed.
Consequently, if we want to ensure the continuity of our audiovisual sector, we must now widen the scope of the directive. I have a number of concerns on this matter.
There continues to be an imbalance between European cinema production and imports from the United States.
European films rarely reach a European Union audience outside the country where they are produced. Six per cent of European films are shown outside their country of origin.
Of the total volume of programs, 74% are fictional works imported from America and only 14% are European in origin. As well as simply exporting programmes, major industry players are promoting the export of American thematic television channels to Europe.
These are sold both to digital grouping operators and cable satellite channels. In addition, Europe lags considerably behind the United States in the development of the digital sector.
These are the difficult issues confronting us.
This is why I believe that the only possible response is global and proactive action by the European Union. Over and above the economic and financial issues, which are clearly very important, is the key issue of our cultures, identities and the values we hold dear.
Mr President, in a previous life you also held the important position of Deputy Mayor of Madrid, so I am sure you and this House in general will be interested to know that we have a high-level deputation from Germany's cities in the public gallery.
We should offer them a warm welcome.
We agree with you.
I see that you are very well informed by a Spanish compatriot of mine.
Mrs Reding has the floor on behalf of the Commission.
Mr President, to begin with, I would like to thank Mrs Hieronymi very much for her excellent report, and for her commitment to television and cinema.
This commitment demonstrates that Parliament understands the importance of the Television without frontiers directive and its implementation.
I would like to remind honourable Members that Mrs Hieronymi' s report does not deal with the development of television in general, nor is it about cinema. It deals with the Commission' s report on the implementation of the Television without frontiers directive between 1997 and 2000.
I completely agree with those Members who deplore the state of European cinema, and are critical of both the quality of films and the industry' s economic role. I would like to remind them that last week the Commission published its report on cinema.
Mr President, I am sure Parliament will have the opportunity to begin a wide-ranging debate on the development of cinema in Europe.
I wish it well. However, the issues relating to television are slightly different.
I would like to draw your attention to the promotion of the distribution and production of television programs (as outlined in Articles 4 and 5 of the directive). It can be seen that the weighted average of European programmes broadcast by the major channels is between 53 and 81%, with the exception of one country.
It should also be noted that the majority of Member States have introduced more rigorous legislation than that provided for by the directive.
Fortunately, the situation is far better for television than for cinema.
Therefore, Mr President, I propose that we discuss the subject of cinema seriously for once in this House.
It is very important that we hold this debate.
Several Members have spoken of the need to revise the directive.
This process is already under way.
It began this year with a wide-ranging consultation with the industry.
The process will continue next year.
I am sure you know that we have begun three studies on different aspects of the directive on the Audiovisual sector.
We have ensured that these studies are undertaken by experts who are independent. They are therefore impartial studies, benefiting from the input of the industry and providing an objective assessment of the situation on the ground.
The consultants involved have organised workshops bringing together people from the industry, from government and politicians.
Members of Parliament were also invited to these workshops. Plans are afoot for further workshops.
Surveys of the views of interested parties will, of course, be followed by assessment and drafting work.
The findings will be brought together in a series of reports which our consultants should make available to us at the end of this year or January next year. The Commission will then begin its own consultation process with the publication of a working document, to which everyone will be invited to respond before the summer of 2002.
Mr President, Parliament will therefore have plenty of opportunity to reconsider the avenues explored in Mrs Hieronymi' s report. Most importantly, Members will also be able to examine possible future directions.
On the basis of the work undertaken, and depending on the results obtained, this will lead to an institutional debate on the directive and, if necessary, on the Commission' s proposals for a new directive, between now and the end of 2002. I would like to point out that I agree with Members on the need to reform the directive.
It is clear that the process in which we are engaged is extremely complex. The views of Parliament will be taken into account at each stage of the process.
Mrs Hieronymi' s report devotes much attention to the revision process, while also illustrating the complexity and importance of the debate.
Mr President, if I may, I would like to examine two parts of the report presented to Parliament. I wish to comment on Recital H and Article 1 e).
According to Recital H, the directive is now obsolete and applies only to generalist, free-to-air television, for which purpose it was originally created.
This is an inaccurate assessment of the situation.
The directive has a much wider scope.
It applies to broadcasting in general, including subscription and thematic broadcasters, and also to digital and analogue broadcasting. The comments made in Recital H are therefore mistaken.
They constitute a serious error as the directive does not apply to the Internet as the Internet did not exist when the directive was drafted. Appropriate provisions should therefore be included in the revised directive.
At present, it is risky to say that the directive is obsolete for the simple reason that this could play into the hands of Member States that have not yet implemented the directive.
Your rapporteur underlined this point: why implement an obsolete directive? This would result in no action being taken and no further pressure could be applied.
The final outcome would be the opposite of the wishes of Parliament.
This may also pose problems for candidate countries. They are currently experiencing considerable difficulties in transposing the acquis into their own legislation.
I shall say more about them later. Are we going to force them to implement an acquis that Parliament considers to be obsolete?
In the interests of this matter, Mr President, it is therefore extremely important to amend this part of the text.
We must also ensure that we do not give a negative impression to Member States implementing the directive, or to the candidate countries transposing the acquis. Rather, we must remind them that the directive continues to provide legal certainty to European audiovisual operators.
Some Members have already, quite rightly, highlighted this point.
Point 1) e) of the report deplores the fact that the Commission has provided insufficient information on the efforts made by the candidate countries to implement the acquis relating to the audiovisual sector, and has not stressed the need for them to increase their efforts.
I would like to remind you that the report drafted according to Article 26 of the directive deals solely with the implementation of this directive by the Member States of the European Union.
It does not deal with the adoption of the acquis by the candidate countries.
It therefore follows that there are no details on the adoption of the acquis, or of recommendations for these countries.
That said, I have some good news on this subject as the overall situation regarding the adoption of the acquis has improved since the end of 2000.
All candidate countries, except for Romania, Hungary and Turkey, have provisionally closed Chapter 20 relating to the audiovisual sector. This clearly shows that the national legislation of the great majority of the countries concerned complies with the acquis.
Mr President, I would like to thank Parliament for always having supported me very strongly in my efforts to try to make progress to benefit our cultural industries, and also our cultural diversity.
I can but say to Parliament that our work has only just begun. Revising the Television without frontiers directive will be a considerable and highly complex task in which I will continue to need the resolute support of Parliament.
On the basis of past experience, I feel you will not fail me.
Thank you very much, Mrs Reding.
We are also grateful for this impetus you are giving to the revision of directives.
I am sure that the Commission and the European Parliament will work together to bring us up to date.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Question Time (Council)
Question No 1 by (H-0689/01):
Subject: The 'Republika Srpska' What policy is the Council Presidency pursuing towards the so-called 'Republika Srpska' in Bosnia-Herzegovina, with particular regard to cooperation with the International War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague and to the return of expellees?
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council has repeatedly and consistently stressed the great importance the European Union attaches to compliance by the countries participating in the stabilisation and association process with the international obligations relating to the International Criminal Court for the Former Yugoslavia and to establishing a lasting settlement on the issue of refugees and displaced persons.
This forms part of the European Union conditions of the stabilisation and association process. The countries of the Former Yugoslavia subscribed to these conditions at the Zagreb Summit.
On 11 June the Council approved a report assessing the progress achieved by the countries of the region in relation to these conditions for European integration. The report also contained specific proposals detailing how the countries can continue working towards this aim.
On that occasion, the Council concluded that Bosnia-Herzegovina had not cooperated sufficiently with the International Criminal Court for the Former Yugoslavia, especially as regards Republika Srpska.
None of those indicted for war crimes had been arrested by the authorities of Republika Srpska.
The Council therefore ordered Bosnia-Herzegovina to take further measures to ensure that it complies in full with the Dayton-Paris agreement and collaborates fully with the International Court.
On that same occasion, the European Union expressed its view that the process of the return of refugees and displaced people throughout the whole of Bosnia-Herzegovina should be speeded up. It was also stated that measures to create the proper conditions to enable people to return should be strengthened.
The European Union also expressed its hope to see the governments of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Republika Srpska implement all the recommendations that have been made.
The Council will ensure these matters are monitored.
This monitoring process will also allow the European Union periodically to assess compliance with the criteria established as part of the stabilisation and association process. This will enable us to assess the level of the relations established, and to decide if the level of technical and economic assistance can still be justified.
We could certainly use this tool to apply pressure on the governments of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Republika Srpska, should it prove necessary to do so.
Madam President-in-Office of the Council, I have two short additional questions. First, I would like to know if Council has asked the Republica Srpska how many expellees and refugees have now returned to the Republica Srpska.
Are any figures available on this?
Secondly, I would like to ask if cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia has had any repercussions on the finances of the Republica Srpska.
As regards your first question, I am unable to answer this at present but we shall check and see if more accurate figures are available.
I believe I have already given the beginning of an answer to your second question, in that the Council has clearly indicated that, if the situation does not improve, it may consider revising the funds placed at the disposal of the authorities, both in Bosnia-Herzegovina and in the Republika Srpska.
Question No 2 by (H-0690/01):
Subject: European regions, subsidiarity and reform of the treaties Under the weight of so many treaties (the first being Rome and the latest Nice), Europe can no longer be regarded (as far as either individuals or the public as a whole are concerned) as something 'international' ; it is now something 'internal' , not just in economic or market terms but from all points of view.
The Flemings and the Walloons cannot look upon us Basques (nor the Catalans upon the Finns, the Scots or the Welsh) as foreigners.
We are all citizens and peoples who belong to Europe.
Does the Council therefore support the idea put forward some time ago in Belgium by Mr Dreze concerning the setting up within Europe of Euro-entities, that is, non-state political bodies which would be granted EU legal personality so that they could establish and maintain direct relations with the Committee of the Regions, the Commission, the Court of Justice, etc., and conclude valid agreements with other public authorities anywhere in the EU, as an extension of European law?
Does the Council not think that this issue should be specifically pursued as an initiative relating to the future of the Union, to be considered under the procedure for debating the reform of the treaties which is to be established at the Laeken European Council?
On behalf of the Council, I would remind you that the Union, in accordance with Article 6(3) of the Treaty on European Union, respects the national identity of the Member States, while Article 48 of the same Treaty stipulates that the Intergovernmental Conference has the task of establishing by mutual agreement the amendments to be included in the Treaties.
During Question Time in July, I was given the opportunity to reply to a number of questions - I believe there were ten in all - about the possible added value which an active and institutionalised participation of so-called sub-state groups would give to the debates at Union level.
I then said that the Council, without denying the incontrovertible political impact of the Committee of the Regions, was at the time unable to give a detailed response to questions concerning the role of the regional units in the Union' s structures.
The Council obviously knows the different viewpoints and is carefully following the developments around topics directly related to the balance of power within the European structures, starting with the concept of subsidiarity itself.
At this stage, on behalf of the Council, all I can do is look to the very near future, that is to say to the forthcoming meeting in Laeken, where the European Council intends to adopt a declaration which will form the basis for creating conditions to guarantee the Union' s future.
And at that meeting, I have no doubt that the tone will be set for the way in which the preparation of the IGC 2004 will have to be structured and how participation will need to be extended.
Moreover, I would like to refer you to the very thorough explanation and reply which Minister Michel gave this morning on behalf of the Council, and in which he has already given a few quite specific indications in this connection.
Madam President-in-Office of the Council, in the Councils of Ministers, decisions are often adopted which affect the exclusive legislative competences of historic nations such as the Basque Country, Catalonia or Scotland, of regions such as Flanders or Wallonia, of federal states such as Bavaria, Baden-Baden, Rhineland, etc.
Do you not believe that, in the event of a conflict of competences resulting from decisions adopted in the Council without the presence or acquiescence of the historic nations, regions or federal states affected, the latter constitutional entities should be empowered to present their case to the European Court of Justice, since that Court has the power under the Treaty to hear and pass judgment on these conflicts?
Do you not believe that the European Council at Laeken should include these issues in the future debate on the Union and the distribution of competences between the Union, the Member States and the other institutional bodies?
Mr President, Mr Ortuondo Larrea, although this is an issue about which I am extremely passionate, I do not feel that it would be advisable for us to resume the debate which took place in this House last July.
I did, I believe, at that point in time answer in a comprehensive manner, partly on behalf of the Council where possible, and partly in my own name.
Allow me therefore to refer you to the Minutes of that sitting in which you will find all the replies to the questions you have just asked.
Question No 3 by (H-0691/01):
Subject: Working languages in the European Patent Office On Thursday, 31 May 2001, the Council published a common position on the Community patent. With regard to the language regime used at the European Patent Office, the text simply notes that translation costs must be limited.
It is a fundamental principle of the European Union that everybody should be able to address the institutions in any of the eleven official languages.
Does the Council agree that it must be possible for an application for a patent to be submitted to the European Patent Office in any of the eleven official languages of the EU?
If so, how does the Council guarantee that individuals and businesses may submit applications for a patent in any of the eleven official languages?
If not, how can the Council justify a position which is so at odds with the official line?
Does the Council support the Greek government' s plan to lodge a complaint against the language regime used by the Community Trade Mark Office in Alicante?
It is correct that on 31 May 2001, the Council adopted a common position on the Community patent with the aim of furthering future discussions on this subject.
With regard to the language regime used at the European Patent Office, the common position posits that it must be based on a number of principles which apply universally, including the principle of non-discrimination.
In order to curb the cost of translation, further consideration must be given to the various suggestions made in this connection, including technical translation aids, without ruling out other options a priori.
Having regard to these guidelines, the Council recently started discussing the provisions presented in the Commission proposal for a regulation on the Community patent, as well as the other solutions which have been provided for consideration by various Member States.
In any case, the honourable Member will understand that the Council is not prepared at this time to adopt a clearer position concerning this motion for a resolution, including the linguistic aspects involved, as long as the European Parliament, consulted in accordance with Article 308 of the Treaty, has not issued a recommendation on the matter.
The Council would remind the honourable MEP that the language regime of the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market is established by the Regulation on the Community Trade Mark. This regulation was adopted unanimously by the Council following the agreement reached at the Conference of government representatives at the level of Heads of State and Government on 29 October 1993.
Moreover, with regard to the steps taken by the Greek government in case T-120/99, the Council is taking note of the judgment pronounced in this case by the Court of First Instance. This judgment rejects the appeal, as well as the arguments, of the requesting party against the language regime of that office.
Madam President-in-Office of the Council, as we have come to expect of you, you are being extremely polite to the European Parliament.
It is very considerate of you to refer to Article 308.
We all know that Article 308 concerns a unanimous decision taken by the Council following a recommendation from Parliament.
So that is why you are waiting before adopting a clear stance.
I can understand that, but despite this, we must all realise that there appears to be only a few Member States, including Portugal, Spain, Greece, Finland and Italy, which are strongly opposed to the exclusive use of French, English and German.
All the other Member States, including my own country, unfortunately, agree to the very limited application of this language regime.
I would now like to ask you whether it would not be preferable to guarantee that the key elements of such a patent, namely the conclusions, which hardly take up two to three pages, are at least made available in all the languages.
That would considerably enhance the legal certainty of the citizens and business people in the European Union.
There would then be no need to translate twenty or thirty pages, rather only the conclusions.
I believe that we would thus bring Europe a little closer to the citizen.
Some time ago, I was given the opportunity to look into this matter more deeply.
The suggestion by Mr Staes is one of the suggestions which are currently being tabled.
President-in-Office, European industry is losing its competitive edge in regard to reaching the targets that you and the Council set for it at Lisbon by the extreme cost and time delays involved in obtaining patents in Europe.
I believe the Belgian presidency undertook to make a special effort to have the Community patent installed and implemented during its presidency.
I would be interested to know what progress is being made and whether you really are resolving the language issue in the European Patent Office.
Efforts are under way.
The Council Presidency has decided to consult each government individually and confidentially in what is called in French la procÃ©dure du confessional, in order to see whether it is possible to proceed, and with the firm desire to reach an agreement by the end of the year if at all possible.
Of course this matter does not rest with us alone.
There has to be agreement across the board, and we are working on this.
I should just like to underline Mr Staes's point on the importance of the language regime, while not ignoring the importance of the point my colleague, Mr Purvis, has made about the need for speed.
Nevertheless, the whole business of taking research on to the development stage is important.
If we are to have good research in all the universities and all the areas of the Community, it is really important for people to be able to work in their own language, even though, of course, most scientists work in English much of the time.
We take note of your statement, which is not a question.
Mr MacCormick, did you want to add anything?
My question was implicit: does the Minister agree?
Yes!
Question No 5 by , which has been taken over by Mr Bautista Ojeda (H-0696/01):
Subject: European Maritime Safety Agency Has the Spanish government submitted a proposal for the siting of the European Maritime Safety Agency?
Has the government suggested that the Agency be sited in Galicia, in view of Galicia's strategic location as far as Atlantic traffic is concerned and its importance as a maritime centre?
The Commission' s proposal concerning the establishment of a European Maritime Safety Agency, presented at the end of last year within the context of the 'Erika II' package, is still under consideration by the Council authorities, and the question of where this future agency is to be based remains unanswered.
To date, the Council has not received an official proposal from the Spanish government concerning the agency' s headquarters.
Madam President-in-Office of the Council, you have not commented because clearly, as you said, the Spanish State has still not made any formal proposal.
I would like to refer to an objective fact: Spain has always had a great maritime vocation and enjoys a privileged situation in terms of both Atlantic and Mediterranean maritime traffic, and I believe that some of those Spanish coastal territories meet all the appropriate conditions for being the location for the headquarters of this European agency.
Thank you very much, Mr Bautista Ojeda.
I would remind Members that this is Question Time and not a time to make statements or advocate certain proposals.
So in the future please try to ask questions.
At least give the impression of asking a question.
Mrs Korhola has the floor for a supplementary question.
Mr President, I would like to ask the representative of the Council what the general timetable is for deciding to establish planned agencies such as the Maritime Safety Agency and, in particular, the Food Safety Agency, and is the intention to take the decision on all of them in one go or separately for each agency?
As I have pointed out, this question is still under discussion.
As you know, this question relates to decisions concerning several agencies.
On this extremely sensitive issue, as you can well imagine, we aim to reach agreement on all the unanswered questions by the end of the year, and I hope that we are successful in achieving this aim.
Question No 6 by (H-0699/01):
Subject: Illegal immigration into the European Union through Morocco What action is the Council planning to take in order to control illegal immigration into the European Union through Morocco, with a view to preventing any recurrence of the tragic events which have occurred this summer, involving the loss of human life in Community waters?
Illegal immigration into the European Union via Morocco is permanently on the Council' s agenda.
For that reason, the Council set up a High-Level Group in December 1998 to deal with asylum and migration issues. This group is responsible for drawing up action plans for a number of countries of origin of asylum seekers and/or illegal immigrants.
With a view to drafting these action plans, the group has pursued a cross-pillar approach which takes account of a number of aspects related to foreign policy, economic development and the management of migration flows.
One of the countries that has been earmarked for such an action plan is Morocco.
In October 1999, the Council adopted an action plan which provides for measures that pertain, inter alia, to the fight against illegal immigration.
The European Council of Tampere subsequently approved the action plans and expressed the wish that the measures it contains be carried out in the framework of a partnership with the countries involved.
At the initial session of the Moroccan-European Union Association Committee in Rabat in February 2001, it was agreed to set up a working party on social issues and migration.
This working party, established by decision of the Association Council of 4 April 2001, met for the first time in July and has indeed set up an informal group for migration between the European Union and Morocco.
At that meeting, three topics were flagged as priority topics for cooperation in the field of immigration.
The first topic was socio-economic cooperation and, in particular, assistance for micro- enterprises and for small and medium-sized companies.
Secondly, there was the topic of guidance concerning legal migration to the European Union and the fight against illegal immigration networks, including transit-migration from countries south of the Sahara.
For each of those topics from the High-Level Group' s action plan, a dossier will be drawn up concerning the projects to be carried out jointly.
Each dossier will contain a description of the project, an indicative description of the resources to be deployed, the budget line which will be required and a timeframe for the implementation of the project.
Each dossier will be communicated through diplomatic channels to the other party, which may then add its own proposals.
The Association Council which meets on 9 October will exchange ideas on migration and will add renewed momentum to the cooperation efforts in that field.
In the light of the particularly tragic events which have unfolded in recent weeks in Morocco and the EU countries, this is a weighty matter indeed.
Finally, Morocco will, in the person of its Minister for Justice, Mr Azziman, also be taking part in the Ministerial Conference on migration, which will take place on 16 and 17 October at the European Parliament in Brussels, an event which I will be attending as well.
Madam President-in-Office of the Council, I thank you for your detailed reply, but I would like to ask a couple of supplementary questions because I put this question before the tragic events of 11 September.
The Council is aware of the current security problems on our continent.
So I would firstly like to ask whether the Council is aware that we have an open border across which the European Union' s security cannot be guaranteed?
And in this regard, whether the Council is aware that every day hundreds, and every month thousands, of people are losing their lives as a result of maintaining this deceptively open border, because many of those who try to cross it die in the process?
That is to say, what can the Council do to prevent this human tragedy from continuing and to guarantee the security of the citizens of the European Union?
Mr President, I can only say to Mr Medina Ortega that we are of course aware of all the aspects, both on a human scale and in terms of security, which contribute to the gravity of the situation.
As I mentioned just now, I myself was only recently in Morocco, in Tangier, where I really saw the extent of the problem caused by illegal immigration across the strait, which in certain places really earns its name as it is barely 12 or 14 kilometres wide at its narrowest point.
Of course, we are aware of this problem and this is why all these initiatives have been implemented.
I also know from the contacts I made whilst on my trip to Morocco, which was not on behalf of the European Union but in my role as Belgian Minister, that the Moroccan authorities are also acutely aware of this problem.
They too do not watch with a light heart as members of the population embark on such perilous missions.
What does, however, occasionally upset the Moroccan authorities, and this I can understand, is that we sometimes tend to establish a little too easily a link between people from Morocco and security risks.
Madam President-in-Office of the Council, in 1998 this House adopted my proposal for a common European border police. However, by the beginning of this year neither the old Italian government nor the German government had adopted this.
I would like to ask you if the Council has made any further progress with this issue of a common European border police or if anything is planned in this area under the Belgian Presidency.
What I can tell Mr Posselt is that the question of border security concerns us intensely and that this is actually one of the priority areas on which our presidency is to take action, certainly in view of the fact that enlargement of the European Union will mean a corresponding extension of these borders.
This is therefore an extremely significant goal to which we attach a great deal of importance and progress towards which we are monitoring extremely closely.
The same sort of illegal immigration is taking place on a huge scale via Turkey to the Aegean and the Greek islands.
First, do these plans for Morocco include Turkey?
Secondly, has the Council taken any action vis-Ã -vis Turkey, which has been granted candidate status and therefore has an additional obligation towards the European Union to guard its borders properly?
Hordes of illegal immigrants can hardly pass by unnoticed.
What has the Council done about this?
I can only repeat what I have just said.
This is an issue of very great concern to us, the more so because my country is one of the preferred countries of destination for illegal migration.
We are fully aware of the problem in all its aspects and we are working very hard on it and addressing all third parties on the subject.
Question No 7 by (H-0705/01):
Subject: Illegal conferral of Greek citizenship and a large number of violations of Community law established by a formal administrative inquiry A formal administrative inquiry held in the Greek Embassy in Moscow has uncovered not only a number of breaches of discipline, but also evidence that offences were committed with the purpose of illegally granting Greek citizenship.
In view of both the large number of 'repatriations' (some 150 000 processed by the Moscow Embassy) and the fact that significant information was concealed by officials of this Embassy, a further judicial inquiry is now being sought to shed light on this matter.
It should be pointed out that all these violations have taken place despite Greece's full participation in the Schengen acquis.
Given that in the elections in the Year 2000 votes were cast by persons who were not entitled to do so, which creates a serious political problem, will the Council say:
What is its position on the illegal naturalisations in question and the large number of illegal 'repatriations' on the basis of the Schengen acquis?
Will it bear these findings in mind, given that, according to the answer to my Written Question E-1438/01, the Greek government has not so far provided any information about the number of illegal naturalisations and 'repatriations' for 1999 and 2000?
What measures does it intend to take to prevail upon the Greek government to provide these figures and to put an end to the practices in question, to ensure transparency and to annul all the illegal naturalisations?
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the questions raised by Mr Trakatellis concern the naturalisation of citizens in a Member State of the European Union and the repatriation of these citizens.
Mention is made of suspicions surrounding practices which are currently the subject of an inquiry that the public prosecutor has been asked to carry out.
Lastly, the question conjures up a presumed link between these practices and the Schengen Agreements.
I must point out that the Council is not qualified to comment on the circumstances in which Member States may or may not grant citizenship.
In fact, naturalisation policy falls within the competence of the Member States.
Therefore, in the case in question, the application of these provisions falls within the competence of the Greek government, which Mr Trakatellis should address directly for the answers to the questions he has raised.
Finally, the Council feels that, for details of immigration and statistics concerning the number of naturalisations, Mr Trakatellis could usefully refer to the reply given to him in July by the Commission in response to question E-1438/01 concerning the years prior to that mentioned here and ask the Commission to provide him with the figures for 1999 and 2000 as soon as these are available.
Thank you for your reply.
I shall take your advice as regards the figures for 1999 and 2000 which, I should point out, the Commission was unable to give me even yesterday because it did not yet have them, even though it is 2001 and the Member States naturally have a duty under the Schengen Agreement.
I should like to ask you specifically: if and insofar as a Member State naturalises a person or persons, can that person, once they have obtained a passport or an identity card from the Member State, live anywhere in the European Union?
If it later emerges that they should not have been naturalised, is the Member State which naturalised them obliged to pass this information on to the other Member States so that the person who has no right to live in the European Union can be located?
And if it has this duty towards Europol and the other Member States, my question is this: has the Greek government provided this information?
We have proof that there are people who have obtained Greek nationality but were not entitled to do so.
I can only repeat what I have just said.
The granting of nationality is an exclusive competence of the Member States.
That does not answer my question.
I do not dispute the fact that nationality is granted by the Member States, my question is: what happens when it should not have been granted and the person is living in another Member State?
How will that person later be located?
What practical method do we have for locating him or her?
Again, as the granting of nationality falls within the competence of the Member States, it is up to the judiciary of the Member State concerned to decide whether the obtaining of nationality by illegal means, if proven, warrants any given action.
That is a matter for the Member State.
It is not for the Council or the European Union to decide what should happen.
If one holds a passport, one can use it.
Question No 8 by (H-0715/01):
Subject: The EU's most federalist country According to press reports, the Belgian Prime Minister, Guy Verhofstadt, has called Finland Europe' s most federalist country.
Does the representative of the country holding the presidency stand by this definition, and on what measure of familiarity with Finnish affairs can it possibly be based?
Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck, I invite you to answer the question by Mr Esko Olavi SeppÃ€nen.
I believe that it refers to Finland.
I am sorry I missed that one.
I understand quite a lot of Spanish but not everything.
Sometimes I think I am fortunate not to understand everything.
I thank the honourable Member for his question, but as the quoted statements were not made by Prime Minister Verhofstadt in his capacity as President-in-Office of the Council, it is difficult for me to comment on them on behalf of the Council, which I represent here today.
Mr President, Minister, when Sweden held the presidency, the custom was that if the Minister did not answer the question asked him or her in this session the possibility of providing a written reply also existed.
I remember Sweden' s European Minister very often replying in writing to questions on which he or she, as President-in-Office of the Council, did not want to take a stand.
I would therefore ask Belgium' s representative if she could continue the policy adopted by Sweden in this matter and reply to me in writing, in her capacity as Belgian Minister, stating the answer to this question, and also which country Belgium considers to be the most federalist state in Europe; the totally unfounded claim has been put forward that this country would be Finland.
This claim was made by the Belgian Prime Minister, at a press conference during the Belgian presidential term, to be exact.
I can only repeat what I said.
The statement was made by Mr Verhofstadt in his capacity as Prime Minister of Belgium, not as President-in-Office of the Council.
Therefore I cannot, on behalf of the Council, comment on those statements.
Question No 9 by (H-0717/01):
Subject: Cooperation agreement with Iran and legislative reforms in respect of women With reference to the political dialogue between the European Union and Iran and to the most recent meeting (in September) of the Troika in Tehran, will such cooperation and dialogue lead to any improvement in the legal situation of Iranian women?
What progress is expected to be made?
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the main aim of the European Union's policy towards Iran is to encourage internal reforms in that country.
The issue of human rights is an important point in the political dialogue with Iran.
Any future trade and cooperation agreement with this country must also include human rights clauses.
During the recent round of political dialogue which took place in Tehran on 3 September, the European Union raised the topic of human rights along with the issues of judicial reforms and democratic rights, including freedom of expression and the press, the death penalty and recent cases involving the stoning of women.
As regards the situation of Iranian women, improvement not only of their legal status but also of the concrete reality of their situation is a specific aim of the dialogue.
The European Union noted with interest the efforts of the Iranian government and Parliament to introduce new legislation geared towards women and girls.
I am referring, for example, to the draft law designed to raise the legal age of marriage for girls to 15 and to the draft law giving women the right to unconditional divorce.
Unfortunately, the Council can, to date, only regret that these efforts have still not come to anything due to opposition from other Iranian bodies, most notably the Council of Guardians.
At the last session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, the European Union took the initiative of tabling a resolution on the human rights situation in the Islamic Republic of Iran.
The Swedish Presidency submitted a draft resolution on behalf of the European Union at this session.
This resolution was adopted on 20 April this year.
The Commission on Human Rights, according to the terms of this resolution, welcomes the improvement seen in the area of women' s education and health and their participation in democratic life in the Islamic Republic of Iran, as well as the efforts made to improve the situation of women and girls, particularly by means of laws designed to raise the legal age of marriage and lift the ban barring unmarried women from studying abroad. However, the Commission is also gravely concerned by the fact that these drafts have yet to be enacted in law.
Enactment would be a way of putting an end to the systematic discrimination against women and girls in legislation and in practice and a way of removing the obstacles preventing women and girls from exercising their fundamental rights fully and equally.
Madam President-in-Office of the Council, thank you very much for your reply, which I believe offers hope in an area in which there are serious difficulties.
I would like to ask the Council whether it would be in favour of carrying out monitoring, even of agreeing a timetable on the progress made in relation to the situation of women in terms of laws, because the Council is aware, like us, that if these improvements are not introduced into laws, they will not be consolidated.
I therefore believe that the Council is working very seriously and in agreement with the European Parliament in this area, but does the Council not believe that at some point it would be good to agree a timetable for introducing this progress and these improvements into laws since that is the only way to consolidate them?
Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, I would like to reply by saying that you have of course made an interesting suggestion.
I believe that the main thing as regards the development of the situation is that the political dialogue now seems to be well under way and, moreover, in a serious fashion, and I believe that we must all, each at our own level, endeavour to keep this dialogue going, to broaden it and, above all, to continue and maintain it in order to encourage those among the authorities who are working for progress to continue to make headway in this direction.
Question No 10 by (H-0719/01):
Subject: Repatriating Mobotu funds While welcoming the Belgian law allowing individuals to seek the arrest of suspected war criminals visiting Belgium, would the President-in-Office of the Council indicate who had been tried for the crimes committed in the former Congo and will he indicate what measures have been taken to repatriate funds lodged in Belgian and other banks in the name of the former 'President' Mobotu of Zaire and the steps that have been taken in order to confiscate former family assets in Brussels?
