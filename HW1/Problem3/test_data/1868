Removing such limits provides an open invitation to business as usual.
Aviation and the other industries will be able to continue to increase their emissions without constraint by merely buying up the supposed reductions made elsewhere, and, considering recent reports that up to half of reductions from CDM and JI projects are questionable, this will fundamentally undermine the integrity of the entire scheme.
Tomorrow the European Parliament faces a serious test of whether it really wants to take real action on climate change, and, if it is going to show genuine leadership, then it needs to support the Green amendments.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (GA) As the shadow rapporteur for the GUE/NGL Group, Jens Holm, is absent, please accept his apologies for the fact that he cannot be here with us for tonight's debate.
It now falls to me to outline the GUE/NGL view.
It is time for airlines to become involved in the efforts to combat climate change.
Greenhouse gas emissions from international aviation have doubled since 1990 and account for between 5% and 12% of carbon dioxide emissions in the EU as a whole.
The EU's leaders committed themselves in March of this year to achieving a 20% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions - compared with the 1990 level - by 2020.
We now have an opportunity to show the wider world that we will meet those targets.
The Commission proposal recommends that the aviation sector should not have to comply with the average for the years 2004 to 2006.
That is more than 90% above the 1990 level.
The Commission is also recommending that auctioning should account for no more than about 3% of the allowances.
Airlines will have no incentive to lower their levels themselves if they can get their carbon emission permits free of charge.
The auction percentage should be 100% - as we ourselves as well as the Greens are advocating - since this would be consistent with the 'polluter pays' principle.
The GUE/NGL Group believes that the proportion of allowances to be allocated should be 20% of the average for the years 2004 to 2006; this would limit the amount of allowances that the aviation sector could buy from other sectors or under the ETS scheme; and the auction rate could rise to 100%.
Airlines are a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and throughout the world.
It is time to put an end to special treatment and take into account the impact on the environment and on climate change.
Mr President, climate change is a transboundary environmental problem and the EU is an important actor in the global climate work.
Emissions are rising globally and time is short.
The Swedish June List therefore supports the main thrust of the proposal we are debating this evening.
Integrating aviation into the EU's emissions trading scheme is an obvious and cost-effective step in the climate work.
However, it is not the trading in itself that leads to reduced emissions, but the total emissions ceiling which we choose to establish.
The scheme needs to be broadened to include other climate-impacting sectors in order to achieve the climate goals we have set ourselves.
We are in favour of the Committee's proposal of a single start date for the Directive.
It is unacceptable that the Commission has allowed itself to be influenced by international political pressure aimed at delaying the climate work and distorting competition.
The Directive should also apply to everyone.
We cannot allow exceptions for particular persons or events.
Our Heads of State must pay for their costs like the rest of us.
Anything else would be unreasonable.
Finally, I would like to point out that common environmental goals should not be used as a means to introduce a common tax policy.
The revenues from the action should not be transferred to the EU as proposed by Amendment 14.
Each Member State must be allowed to decide for itself how to use the revenues from the sale of emission allowances.
Mr President, we propose to bring a new industry, aviation, into the European emissions trading system (ETS), yet that system is spectacularly failing.
It has not reduced carbon emissions at all, yet it has created a whole new stratum of bureaucracy, administration and expense for industry.
It has transferred large sums of money from countries which have been responsible with initial allocations to those which have been profligate, notably from Britain to France and Germany.
Within Britain it has had the perverse effect of transferring funds from hospitals to big oil companies.
The ETS has created a complex web of politically influential vested interests and rent seekers who have lobbied to manipulate the system for their own ends.
The Commission's plans to get tough over allocations will simply move the problem on.
With lax limits on allocations bought in from outside Europe, EU funds will flow to countries like China, where regulation is minimal and records may not be accurate.
So big foreign polluters will make vast profits for little effort, great damage will be done to European economies and CO2 emissions will continue unchecked.
Mr President, it is quite simply scandalous that we propose to bring a new industry into this failing system.
I say to you that you must put your own house in order before you think of extending it.
(DE) Mr President, it is always interesting to hear how some Members refuse to accept reality.
I find the Commission proposal good.
I also believe that Mr Liese has further improved it.
This is a classic case of the internalising of external costs.
Markets can function only if we create the right framework conditions.
We have all undertaken to apply the 'polluter pays' principle, but this also means that those who bring the costs into being must also pay the price.
This means including all costs, and that includes the environmental costs brought about by the CO2 emissions of aircraft.
I also believe that we must bring more courage and ambition to this matter.
We all know that for all of us, including many people in the United Kingdom, doing nothing in this case would be much more expensive than taking this step.
However, we must also be fair.
All sectors must contribute to this system.
We know that CO2 emissions at a great height have a much more damaging effect than CO2 emissions on the ground.
This must also be taken into account when we are talking about including these aircraft emissions.
In addition, this is a sector that is characterised by very high growth rates.
Secondly, we must also say that we have the potential to introduce various management measures to further limit these CO2 emissions.
That must also be taken into account.
The Community has an obligation to function as a role model in the international arena.
We cannot expect other countries to get on board if we are not setting a good example.
I also believe that we have significant opportunities here to build on the competitive advantage in this particular sector that we already have to some degree, so we should provide innovative companies, in particular, with the support they require.
(NL) Mr President, first of all, my compliments to Mr Liese, who has prepared a superb report.
My compliments also to our shadow rapporteur, Mr Groote.
Aviation, like other sectors, must make a contribution to the fight against climate change.
We cannot achieve the climate objective of a 20 or 30% reduction by 2020 unless everyone makes a contribution.
The aviation industry is utterly opposed to receiving excessively tough action, but we hear this from all sectors, and if we appease everyone, absolutely nothing will come of our climate policy.
Thus, it is a good thing that the Commission wants to bring aviation within the ETS, but it has been rather too generous in terms of the number of emission allowances it plans to allocate to the sector.
In my opinion, 80% of emissions should really be the upper limit.
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety rightly wants to see a gradual decrease in this ceiling, in line with the European climate objective of a 20 or 30% reduction.
Aircraft operators have promised a 50% increase in the efficiency of aircraft engines.
The Committee on the Environment intends to hold them to this, and that is a good thing: the more economical the better.
A third important point concerns the auctioning of allowances.
In my view, as many as possible should be auctioned: 25% is really the minimum.
The proceeds of the auction must go towards combating climate change and, in particular, to adapting developing countries to climate change.
The least developed countries make hardly any contribution to climate change but have to suffer its gravest consequences.
This legislation enables us to do something about this.
Mr President, I have here a letter from General Motors complaining about Parliament's position on reducing carbon dioxide emissions from cars.
I have another letter from British Airways - another bit of special pleading - complaining about this measure and how the extra costs will mean it will be more difficult for them to invest in the lower carbon technology in planes that they wish to have.
I do not believe a word of these letters!
Just special pleading from one industry after another.
Have none of these executives read the United Nations report?
This report says that, within 20 years, up to two billion people will face severe water scarcity, partly because of climate change.
We have to do something about this.
Michael O'Leary of Ryanair may be the unacceptable face of public relations for the airline industry, but he speaks a lot of truth when he says, very clearly, that he does not give a toss for the environment so long as he can stuff his pockets and those of his company full of gold.
Well, we have to provide some balance.
We have to ensure and facilitate the position of our constituents who enjoy travel, but we also have to make sure that the concerns for the environment are properly addressed.
Now, this measure here goes a small way towards slowing the spectacular growth of the airline industry.
It will encourage the industry to invest in abatement measures.
It will ensure that at least the basic principle that the polluter pays should be incorporated into our approach.
But above all we have to ensure that we have a cap which encourages measures to be taken, a cap which, I think, must be at least a little bit more ambitious than that currently proposed by the Commission.
- (PL) Mr President, Commissioner, may I thank all the rapporteurs.
We are faced with a complex problem.
On the one hand we have environmental considerations relating to our atmosphere, while on the other we have to contend with the development of air travel, an important source of economic activity, embracing transport and tourism and operated in a very competitive market.
Decisions on this matter must be prudent and unambiguous, but in no case should they discriminate against European carriers, including those from the new Member States.
This could be very damaging to European aviation without achieving the goal of a reduction in harmful gas emissions.
It is obvious that the earth's atmosphere knows no borders.
Inclusion of carbon dioxide emissions from civil aviation in the EU scheme must therefore be recognised as legitimate.
In addition, I am of the opinion that we should take account of emissions of other gases too, such as toxic oxides of nitrogen.
I feel that the most important actions are those that will effectively restrict harmful gas emissions through the use of innovative solutions in the aircraft engine sphere, the design of aircraft with better aerodynamic parameters, and a radical improvement in air traffic control that limits unnecessary time spent airborne.
I see emissions trading at this time as something of a substitute.
I would see it as sensible today to accept a baseline period of 2007-2009, to set an emissions ceiling at a level of between 5 to 10% over 100% in view of the rising interest in flying, and to include in addition non-EU carriers operating within the EU.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, climate change is one of the most serious problems we face.
If we want to safeguard our future, we can no longer ignore the environmental question and we must be ready to change our lifestyles, particularly in terms of mobility.
Transport is one of the sectors that contributes most to energy consumption and the one that relies most on the use of fossil fuels.
Within this sector, aviation is playing an increasing role.
In 2004, greenhouse gas emissions from aircraft in the EU rose by 87% compared with 1990.
Europe is responsible for around half of CO2 emissions from aviation.
This trend is no longer sustainable and it is essential that we take proper measures, for example by cancelling the tax benefits for this industry.
I believe that the Commission's proposal for a directive on emissions quotas for aviation is a vital tool for tackling head-on the problems relating to climate change and we welcome the report by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety that reinforces the original directive.
However, and it is important to underline this, we need to maintain some qualifying points in the debate and vote that will be held tomorrow.
Of these, I think the Community emissions trading system should apply to all flights, both to and from the EU.
This cannot be put off until after 2010.
It is also important that a significant proportion of quotas are allocated by auction and the proceeds of these must be used to subsidise the cleanest forms of transport, for example by abolishing taxes on environmentally-friendly transport, in order to create low-cost tourism that uses less polluting forms of transport such as trains.
We also need to encourage research into more efficient aircraft engines and more effective air traffic management.
I hope Parliament will not devalue the compromise put forward, which will allow Europe to become a leader in the fight against climate change.
(NL) Mr President, I am speaking here on behalf of my colleague Mr Blokland.
The proposal to incorporate aviation into the emissions trading scheme should be a clear signal from the European Union of the need to contribute to the ambitious reduction targets agreed at the start of this year.
In the light of this, the parliamentary committee responsible has endorsed the Commission proposal and even pushed for it to be tightened up.
Last week it seemed we were on course to reach an agreement at first reading.
This hope was reinforced by the Council Presidency but proved to be unfounded, as no mandate could be obtained from the Council.
This week it is important, in my opinion, that we do not settle for a dilution of the Commission proposal but strive for a proposal with clear ambitions in order to be consistent with the course charted this spring with regard to emission reduction.
Thus, I wholeheartedly support the course charted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.
(DE) Mr President, I agree with the points that almost all the other Members made.
I say 'almost' all the Members, and will concentrate, therefore, on three formal aspects.
Point 1: We do it over and over again in this Parliament, and today we are doing it again: we relegate important legislative proposals to the evening sitting.
That way, we ensure that as few people as possible are listening and that, with only a very few exceptions, there is nobody sitting in the visitors' gallery, and we ensure that journalists, who should be reporting all this, are most likely already giving their attention to other things in the evening.
Secondly, we are always hearing, and we have heard in this debate too, that we, the European Parliament, have to stick our necks out at first reading and take particularly demanding positions, as the Council will subsequently put the brakes on anyway, and in the end we shall not get where we want to go.
I caution against this position: it was true for a long time but is increasingly no longer the case.
We saw it in relation to the air-quality regulations, for example, where there have been and still are initiatives where the Heads of State or Government, and even the Ministers for the Environment, have gone a long way with us even at first reading.
With the results we have decided upon, that will mean that in 10 to 15 years, in Central Europe, we shall have to cordon off all cities between Nuremberg and Bologna because we cannot keep within the values that have been set.
Thirdly, here in the European Parliament, we must implement a viable working relationship to achieve sensible joint solutions.
In what has occurred in relation to this Directive over the past weeks and months, I see a successful path and a successful attempt to do that.
Environmental, transport, economic and industrial matters are not yet included in a wise compromise, but they will be, I believe, after the result of tomorrow's vote.
Now all we have to do is persuade the rest of the world to join in and do something for the environment.
Mr President, first of all, I would like to say that it is lovely it is to see Mr Dimas back.
It is pretty much accepted that the carbon emissions in relation to aviation are currently a very small proportion of the overall carbon emissions of the EU.
But you would have to be a fool not to see the incredible growth in the sector in recent years and to recognise that the industry's own plans for expansion are enormous.
Currently, the technology for alternative, less polluting fuels are limited in relation to aviation.
This is why it makes absolute sense to accept that aviation is likely to continue to grow, but we need to ensure that this growth is offset in other sectors of the economy which do have alternatives in terms of reducing carbon emissions.
That is why it is essential that aviation is brought into the emissions trading scheme (ETS).
I would also like to underline the point that the EU has a principle that it is the polluter who should pay.
Under the current ETS, far from the polluter paying, we have seen many polluters making windfall profits thanks to the ETS.
This has to stop.
It is right, therefore, that many of these carbon creators should be auctioned, especially when the wholesale reform happens.
Perhaps one of the most interesting aspects of this debate is the question of where ETS auction money should be spent.
In the forthcoming ETS review, there is potentially EUR 200 billion which could be raised if we went for full auctioning.
I am sure many of us could think of countless ways to spend that kind of money, but I believe it would be sensible if we could steer this money via the EU budget, if possible, to spend on climate change initiatives which could include transfers of finance to the developing world including, for example, to pay for reforestation in developing or emerging countries.
But, also, there needs to be recognition that even in our own Member States we are likely to see a huge increase in terms of energy poverty.
Perhaps we should think about steering the money in this direction as well.
So the decisions we make tomorrow will give an indication of where we should go, in terms of the ETS reform as a whole.
(NL) Mr President, instead of all manner of ineffectual taxes and charges, the Commission is proposing the present market-based instrument; a choice I endorse wholeheartedly.
It is environmentally effective, economically efficient and eminently suitable for broader application; at least, it has the potential to be all of these things.
It became clear quite early on that opinions in this House are somewhat divided.
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety ended up diametrically opposed to the Committee on Transport and Tourism.
My colleague Mr Krahmer has said all that needs to be said about that.
Compromise amendments have now been drawn up, and tomorrow's vote will show whether or not emotion leads the way.
Climate issues are hot, and voting Green is extremely sexy.
There is not so much wrong with that in itself, but as I see it, a stranglehold on the European aviation sector and the associated employment cannot be the intention.
I consider it counterproductive to attempt to artificially diminish one particular mode of transport, in this case aviation, in favour of another.
All the evidence suggests that demand for high-speed transport outstrips supply.
We need all modes of transport; we really cannot manage with trains and buses alone.
The aim was to develop a model that was as workable as possible and could be extended and/or copied worldwide - and, yes, if we really want to be environmentally effective, the latter is of vital importance.
If not, our efforts will remain just a tiny drop in the proverbial ocean, and that is what I should like to avoid.
Mr Rack put it so aptly when he said just now that, to be effective, we have to persuade the rest of the world, as only then will our action be of any use.
(PT) Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as a Member elected for one of the seven outermost regions, I must inform this House of the immense concern in those regions regarding the implementation of the directive under discussion.
That is for one simple reason: the outermost regions are almost exclusively dependent on air transport and any increase in the price of that service, which would inevitably arise from the implementation of the directive, will make access more difficult, increasing their isolation, which was a determining factor in granting the outermost regions special status at European level, as enshrined in Article 299(2) of the EC Treaty.
On the other hand, the increase in air transport costs will result in an even greater competitive disadvantage for those regions, penalising tourism, the main economic activity for the majority of them.
We can expect a reduction in the number of tourists and/or in the amount each of them spends, which could lead to a drop of at least 2% in GDP according to studies carried out by the Government of the Canary Islands.
Yet improving the accessibility of outermost regions to reduce their isolation, and promoting their competitiveness, are two of the three major EU policy priorities for the outermost regions set out in the Commission communication, 'A stronger partnership for the outermost regions', which Parliament fully supported.
We have to highlight how contrary to and inconsistent with those priorities the implementation of this directive will be.
I think that, for the first time we have before us an EU legislative act which would have the effect of increasing the isolation of these regions.
Certainly Amendments 5 and 6 tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats following a compromise between the rapporteur, Mr Liese - whom I must congratulate on his excellent work - and Mr Jarzembowski and Mrs De Veyrac, do to some extent offset the effects of the directive, but they are not enough.
I therefore call on the three institutions to try to find better solutions, in the next stages of the legislative process, to lessen the impact of this directive on the outermost regions.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the rapidly growing aviation sector must be integrated into the emissions trading scheme as quickly as possible.
That will mean that this form of transport also starts making a contribution to the reduction of the anthropogenic greenhouse effect.
From the point of view of transport policy, our legislative task now is to refine the framework conditions.
These framework conditions must be defined in such a way that the possible impetus for savings is provided via an appropriate price per tonne of CO2, without drastically limiting the number of flights.
To achieve this, when the airlines are first issued with allowances, for example, this must be done in such a way that the lack of such allowances can be realistically balanced out on the market, otherwise flights would have to be cancelled, and I do not know how much of that we and our society could cope with.
Even if airlines were issued with 100% allowances upon entering the scheme - and none of us is asking for that - an annual growth in aviation of 5% would require an equally high volume of savings in terms of CO2 emissions.
That is no small challenge.
The greatest potential for reduction is in the realisation of the Single European Sky, which means that it depends on the political will of the Member States.
The airlines' only option for the time being, therefore, is to update their fleets, if there is sufficient capital left over for this purpose after the planned auction sums are taken into account.
That will hardly be the case for regional airlines.
Mr President, bearing in mind that politics is the art of the possible and that sometimes the best can be the enemy of the good, I would like to thank my colleague Mr Liese for the tremendous effort he has put in to reach a position - an agreement - not least amongst all of us in the PPE-DE Group but also with colleagues across this House.
International aviation is outside Kyoto obligations, and the complete lack of progress in ICAO over the 10 years that they have been mandated to address emissions makes it important that the EU takes the lead.
The proposed emissions trading scheme should apply to all flights, including from third countries, from a common start date for competitiveness reasons.
I would now like to concentrate the remainder of my two minutes on one point that I do not think any other colleague has raised.
It is a point that is a very serious national problem for Ireland.
Under the proposal, fungibility or convertibility of aviation allowances to Kyoto allowances free of charge is proposed.
An airline may demand conversion of its aviation allowances to these Kyoto-backed allowances, and the issuing Member State must comply.
This is a huge problem for us in Ireland, because, if airlines were to convert free of charge, we would have to replace these Kyoto allowances by those that the Irish state would have to buy on the market at full market price.
The Irish registry will carry a disproportionate share of flights on our books due to the size and geographic spread of some airlines, as the airlines, particularly Ryanair, are registered with the Irish Aviation Authority for all of their EU operations.
The success of Ryanair means that they have 20 operational bases across the EU serving almost 130 destinations and, yes, increasing.
But they operate only a small proportion of those flights in Ireland.
I would like the Commission specifically to say whether it will accept Amendment 47, which deletes those particularly difficult sentences.
The polluter-pays principle cannot be interpreted to mean that the Irish taxpayer pays for pollution in our fellow EU Member States.
(FI) Mr President, urgent action is needed to fight climate change and, just as has been said here, all industries that release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere have to be involved in that action.
Aviation cannot be given a free ride.
The greenhouse gases from air traffic are increasing fast.
This is important to remember, as it is often said that air traffic only accounts for two or three per cent of greenhouse gas emissions.
As said before, greenhouse gas emissions from aviation have increased by as much as a half since 1990.
The idea now to include air traffic in emissions trading is specifically an EU proposal.
The purpose is also to establish a global system over the longer term, one where air traffic also shares the burden.
We might now learn a lesson from the drawbacks of the general emissions trading directive and increase the proportion of auctioned allowances in the initial allocation of rights.
The initial allocation, and the system as a whole, must encourage a reduction in emissions, so that short air journeys are replaced with train journeys, and that would suit especially well those regions with a dense urban network and population.
On the other hand, we have problems in areas where there are fewer inhabitants and which are a long way from urban centres, and it is important that the European system should take account of remote areas in a balanced way.
(NL) Mr President, by introducing emissions trading into aviation, Europe shows ambition, the ambition to tackle CO2 emissions and combat climate change.
After all, nowhere in the world to date - not even in California - has such an ambitious approach been proposed.
Even compared to the emissions trading scheme for industry, this is a very ambitious plan.
However, what did our Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety do?
It tightened up this proposal considerably on the key points, and thus we have flown past our objective.
Europe must show leadership, but leadership means not only taking the lead, but also persuading others, winning them over - and this in the extremely competitive environment of international aviation.
Therefore, the new regime should on no account lead to high costs and bureaucracy, particularly for Europe's airlines, but there must be a gain for the climate.
A net climate benefit must emerge, preferably worldwide.
I am pleased, therefore, that amendments have now been tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and also by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, which I expect to steer us onto a realistic course tomorrow.
This is necessary in order to promote cleaner flying in practice, too, as having to go through the bureaucratic mill of an auction - even with clean aircraft - is hardly salutary.
As regards the number of available allowances, too, I look forward to a more realistic outcome tomorrow.
However, this proposal alone will certainly not suffice.
The Commission and the European Parliament must stand shoulder to shoulder to bring about the Single European Sky, as five times more environmental gain is to be achieved from that.
Mr President, I hope that we can step up the pressure on Member States in this regard, too, as only then can we make a real difference to the climate.
Mr President, tonight, for once, Parliament really can lead the way in protecting the environment.
I think, as Mr Belder said, the Commission was really a bit timid in its original proposal.
The European public, I think, will be looking to this Parliament to set the highest standards and ambitious targets.
As a member of the Committee on Transport, and along with my colleagues in the PSE Group, I did not support Mr Jarzembowski's line that was pushed through with, I regret to say, the support of the Liberal Group, the ALDE Group.
We wanted to strengthen the original proposal, not to water it down.
So I say congratulations to Mr Liese for his report, and I quote, 'we do not just inherit this planet from our ancestors, our parents, we borrow it from our children'.
And, like Ms Lucas, I appeal to all the groups in this Parliament to think about how they vote tomorrow; be prepared to compromise, be sensible, be realistic, but above all, be positive, because Parliament has a chance to be at the forefront of protecting the environment for 500 million citizens and their descendants.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, many thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Liese, for his good report, and to Mr Jarzembowski.
I believe that, overall, the compromises are very workable.
Politics often depends on symbols, and we are sending a clear signal here: it is the first legislative proposal since the Spring Summit.
Thus we are beginning actively to implement climate protection.
The seven key points of this report - the commencement of emissions trading, the reference period, the number of permits, the use of the proceeds, exceptions for smaller aircraft and the method of calculation - have, in my view, been sufficiently and reliably addressed in the compromises.
I do not wish for any derogations, although I do believe a special additional arrangement for the outermost regions is required, so that these areas are not disadvantaged.
I believe that the proposal is very good and that competition has been sufficiently acknowledged.
We should not forget: even if 100% of the allowances are auctioned - purely theoretically, as we have just heard - that is a sum of EUR 2 billion, definitely a manageable sum for the airlines, which will, no doubt, have an effect on the setting of prices.
However, I do not envisage any problems with this, including in connection with the large number of flights.
I should like to see the EU push further ahead with this in the context of climate protection, and I hope that we can convince all the other major competing airlines to join this agreement.
Mr President, civil aviation seemed to be a luxury in the past, when mostly the rich and the so-called jet society used the advantages of quick flights.
Nowadays, at least in the European Union, civil aviation is a necessary part of our life, without which the Parliament and the Council simply could not work.
If the distance from Brussels is more than 1 000 km, there is no realistic alternative to flights in the absence of rapid trains.
With the accession of the new Member States and the boom in low-fare airlines, we have two or three times more flights than before the enlargement of the EU.
International aviation is not yet covered by the Kyoto Protocol.
However, direct emissions from aviation account for about 3% of the EU's total greenhouse gas emissions, and this is increasing fast.
I think that the quantity of the three allowances should have been based on the emission rate per capita of greenhouse gases in the different Member States, as there are large differences between them.
I feel that it is unfair that western European countries have the right to emit around three times more greenhouse gas from aviation as Hungary and other new Member States.
I think this principle should be applied in other environmental policies requiring a total amount of decrease instead of a percentage decrease.
Otherwise, those who polluted less in the past will be punished.
- (SV) Aviation must pay for its environmental costs, and therefore this proposal is good.
Aviation cannot be exempt from environmental costs which other means of transport pay.
But I have a problem with the frenzy against aviation permeating this debate as if it were the greatest environmental villain and the best thing would be if we stopped flying completely.
That is quite simply not true.
Aviation accounts for five per cent of carbon dioxide emissions.
A full aircraft uses less fuel per passenger kilometre than a car.
It can and must be made even better, but through us making tough demands on the aviation industry which drive developments forward, not through us stopping flying.
Travelling and meeting people from other parts of the world is important.
I am convinced that Ryanair has done more for understanding among the peoples of Europe that the EU's cultural projects together.
Less travel must therefore not be an end in itself. Isolating people takes us back in history to a dark period.
The Commission's proposal is heading in the right direction, but it has a cynical perspective - that it is someone else who should fly less.
An attempt has been made to exempt flights by Heads of State or Government, while at the same time citizens are required to act responsibly.
Proposals like this cause politicians to be held in well-deserved contempt, and I am glad that we on the Committee on the Environment have removed these particular formulations.
Equally cynical is how a number of Left colleagues are demanding that we reduce aviation by more than half in only a matter of years.
Those who make such proposals are unlikely themselves to take the train from, for example, Stockholm to Brussels.
It is as if their own journeys are invaluable but others travel just for fun.
With that kind of irresponsible proposal it will be ordinary people who are forced to pay, not politicians and corporate executives, where someone else picks up the bill.
It will be students who can no longer afford to study abroad in order to go out and see the world.
It will be grandmothers up in Norrland who will not be able to see their grandchildren in the city so often.
It takes us back to a time in the 1980s when an SAS cabin consisted only of corporate executives, politicians and union bosses.
Instead we shall vote tomorrow for tough but realistic demands on the aviation industry which force them to pay for their environmental costs, which force the development of better and more environmentally friendly aircraft technology, but which above all make it possible to prioritise, to compare aviation with the real carbon dioxide villains, like coal-fired power stations.
The important thing is that emissions are reduced, not flying.
- (PT) Mr President, whilst agreeing with the Commission's and the rapporteur's proposal, I should like to draw your attention to the fact that it is not in line with Parliament's objectives set out specifically in the report on reducing the climate change impact of aviation; I would draw attention especially to the situation of the most isolated territories which are particularly dependent on air transport, especially the outermost regions.
Nor does it follow the line of the question raised by the Commission itself in its communication of last September on a 'Strategy for the Outermost Regions'.
I quote: 'What measures are needed to prevent the aim of reducing emissions from adversely affecting the accessibility, economy and citizens of the ORs?'
In voting for Amendments 99 and 100 supported by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, Parliament will be addressing the issues raised through possibly setting up an impact assessment and suitable mediating measures to ensure that the outermost regions are included in the emissions trading scheme in the future - a necessary step that must be done in an appropriate way and guarantee environmental and economic sustainability and mobility in those regions, which are totally dependent on air transport due to their geographical situation.
- (PL) Mr President, today we are discussing a draft resolution on the inclusion of European civil aviation in the EU's emissions trading scheme.
In my view, this very important draft was drawn up in haste, without proper consultation with the aviation industry, especially representatives of the new Member States, and without analysis of the economic and social consequences of its introduction, as well as from the aspect of environmental protection and of the consequences for civil aviation and the threat to Europe's economic development, for example in the sphere of tourism, which is the main source of income for very many regions.
The draft also constitutes a threat to the competitiveness of airlines and may cause a radical deterioration in the already difficult financial situation of many European aviation companies.
I therefore think that the earliest start time for inclusion of the aviation sector in the scheme for all communications is 2012.
I definitely support the scheme's so-called broad geographical scope, in other words the inclusion of all flights from and to the EU, regardless of the national attribution of the carrier.
This is the only solution that guarantees that the required environmental effect is achieved and that does not expose European carriers to a drastic fall in competitiveness.
In my view, the total number of allowances allocated to the aviation sector should be set at Community level by reference to mean emission levels arising from aviation, at least for the years 2005-2007, while the emissions limit should be set at a level of 100%.
Bearing in mind the diverse positions presented during the course of our discussion and the fact that this project relates both to the environment and to the economies of all EU states, as well as to our citizens, we should take decisions that are both measured and good.
Mr President, I guess I come from one of those ultra-peripheral regions, in this case called Finland.
If I was not able to fly here, it would probably take me two days to get here.
This is not by bike: it is by boat, car and train.
That is just by way of introduction.
I think there are really six points here, and I would like to focus on one - but I will go through all six.
Point number one: entry into force - I would go for the EPP-ED compromise, in other words, 2011.
Caps on emission rights: for me, 95%.
Reference, yes, for me: 2005-2007; auction, for me: 25%; profits: partly back to the airlines, and then partly to other good climate change causes.
But for me the big issue is number 6: the allocation basis; in other words, ATK versus RTK.
Now, I realise that this is a difficult issue for many, but for me it is not an environmental issue in that sense.
Really, the cap has already been set.
What we are talking about with ATK and RTK is the allocation between the different airlines.
Neither system is perfect, but we cannot be in a situation where airlines coming from the more peripheral areas will be punished and unequally treated in comparison to those airlines which might be based in Frankfurt, Berlin, London, Brussels or Paris.
Train is not an option for us: it is that simple.
The way in which climate change is going, I am afraid the only place where we are going to have snow in the winter in the future is going to be Lapland.
I know that those flights might be full going up there, but they may not always be full coming down, so we have to be very careful that we do not make this into a race to the bottom.
So I would urge all of my friends and colleagues tomorrow to vote on ATK rather than RTK.
It is a life and death issue for the peripheral areas, but I know it is not a life and death issue for those coming from the middle.
It remains to be seen whether Father Christmas's sleigh will be included in the scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Community.
- (PL) Mr President, I fly here from KrakÃ³w, where it was white over yesterday and snow had covered the entire city, so it is not so bad yet.
Protection of the natural environment and countering negative climate changes have become a challenge for the whole of humankind.
As an EU citizen, I highly value involvement in the protection of the European Union's environment.
However, we should never forget the impact of legislation in this area on the European economy.
In discussing the directive on CO2 emissions in aviation today we have run up against this problem.
Air transport is currently experiencing a sharp increase.
This concerns the new Member States in particular, where this market is developing exceptionally rapidly, providing an increasing number of jobs.
On the macro scale, this is leading to a rise in GDP.
It is consequently my view that the new Member States should have the opportunity to adapt the level of development of aviation to that of the old Member States, which could be achieved by having a very long introductory period for the directive.
The new directive in its proposed form may hinder the development of this sector, which would be contrary to the policy of creating a level playing field in the Community.
A further hazard is a loss of competitiveness among European companies compared with third countries, so it is a matter of importance that the new regulations are accepted globally, not just by the European Union.
I would like to avail myself of the opinion held by scientists and comment that no development of new technologies capable of effectively reducing CO2 emission levels in aviation is anticipated.
It is therefore of exceptional importance to seek restrictions on gas emissions wherever this is feasible.
One effective tool is the modernisation of air traffic control, where, according to analysts, fuel consumption savings of between 6 and 12% may be achieved.
To conclude, I would like to emphasise that in conducting a pro-environment policy we should bear in mind its impact on each Member State.
The baseline period should therefore, in my opinion, cover as far-reaching a period as possible, in other words the years 2007-2009.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow, from 11.30 a.m.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - (FR) The need to act quickly and effectively to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is an obvious fact that can no longer be denied.
Within this context, reducing the impact of transport on global warming will play a decisive role.
The text we are discussing is one of the measures taken to achieve this, and I support this initiative.
This legislation, however, will only be a success if we manage to reconcile the environmental objective with the objective of mobility for citizens, while respecting countries outside the EU.
It is therefore essential that we achieve a reduction in CO2 emissions at the lowest possible cost for passengers.
What is demanded of aviation should be sufficient not to compromise the reductions achieved by other sectors but balanced enough not to penalise the growth of the aviation sector.
That is why I believe that targets for reducing CO2 emissions that are too rapid and too harsh, though laudable from a purely environmental point of view, are out of touch with reality and are in danger of having a counterproductive effect.
I hope our vote tomorrow will take account of these different parameters.
in writing. - (FI) We are to introduce a unique system, with air traffic having its own climate policy instrument.
Emissions trading in the area of air traffic involves risk factors, and I appeal to you all to pay attention to one or two important issues.
Although we are, with good reason, worried about increasing emissions from aviation, air traffic itself is nonetheless the future.
I might even say it is inevitable for the environment.
For example, according to the highly regarded MIPS survey on the overall incidence of environmental pollution, air traffic has its own benefits and would appear to be a solution for the future.
Completely emissions-free aviation would thus solve the problems of emissions from transport, and that should be our priority objective.
For that reason, in the building of compromises I wanted to channel revenue from emissions trading specifically into research and development in the area of aviation.
If the growth in emissions is really worrying, the available resources should be spent specifically on the development of emissions-free transport.
Hopefully, the Council also understands how important this is.
On the other hand, the directive should also ensure that the Union's peripheral regions are able to compete fairly in the emissions trading system.
This is especially relevant in the matter of non-auctioned rights in the allocation system.
The ATK ('available tonne kilometre') model, which is based on an aircraft's maximum capacity, would be the best way to guarantee fairness in emissions trading, and would ultimately be better for the climate.
This is true because the system where non-auctioned emissions rights are allocated by volume of goods and passengers would encourage the use of connecting flights and flying via cities with massive volumes of passengers.
A system meant to protect the climate should encourage a system where air fares tend to be determined more on the actual number of kilometres flown.
At the moment it is frequently the case that longer, and therefore more climate-damaging flights, which also make a stop en route, are cheaper.
That is not rational as far as the environment is concerned.
in writing. - (RO) The inclusion of aviation into the European emissions trading scheme is a positive action, emphasizing Europe's pioneering work in combating climate changes.
The aviation emissions trading should not cause a decrease in the number of flights and an increase in prices, negative consequences for passengers, for the aviation industry and for the sustainable development of transports.
Under these conditions, it is important to solve the technical causes.
The reduction in emissions can be achieved by manufacturing engines with a new design, which would ensure more efficiency in the fuel consumption, by improving the aircrafts' aerodynamics, using new metallic alloys and composite materials for building fuselages.
We also have to take into consideration research in the field of alternative fuels.
NASA has announced the launching of a programme to find solutions for improving kerosene.
Therefore, it is necessary to supplement financial resources for research and development and to encourage private investments in this field, while the funds obtained from bids within the scheme should be used in the fields of research and aeronautical innovation, which are capable of providing concrete solutions.
I also ask the Council and the Commission to continue their efforts in negotiation with the international bodies and the partner third countries in order to obtain all the necessary agreements as to avoid any international litigations in the case of enforcing these legal provisions.
in writing. - Aviation should be brought within the scope of the Emissions Trading Scheme.
The ETS has shown its worth since being set-up two years ago.
It should be a useful means of ensuring that the aviation industry plays its part in the fight against climate change.
However we also need to reform the scheme so that it can fulfil its role effectively.
Of course, none of us believes that this development alone is the answer to the emissions problem but it does represent a significant step in the right direction.
Furthermore, it shows that the political will is there to take difficult decisions for the benefit the planet and its inhabitants.
What we must also see is essential reforms of the way the emissions trading scheme works.
In all of this we must ensure that the consumer is not unfairly burdened with huge rises in the cost of flying and consider looking at other ways in which CO2 emissions from the aviation industry can be reduced.
I am aware that EU Transport Ministers are currently doing this by examining ways of modernising air traffic control and introducing new systems of landing fees related to greenhouse gas emissions.
in writing. - (HU) An ever-increasing proportion of the population of the developed world understands the threat posed by climate change.
However, we need to take drastic steps if we are to reduce our emissions by 20% over 13 years.
Unfortunately, we are hardly seeing any steps to take us in this direction.
It doesn't matter which of the emitting areas we investigate, there will always be 'voices' that want to protect the very industry we are talking about now.
At the same time, we know that we can only meet the target that has been set if we involve every affected area in reducing emissions.
If we make an exception for one, we will have to make up for it somewhere else.
Which one will be the odd one out?
Air travel today is a tiny area, but one that is growing dynamically.
Its growth is closely linked to the global price of raw materials, on which it does itself have great influence.
We as politicians will truly support European businesses from a strategic perspective if we create an environment for them that encourages innovation.
None of this affects passengers, since the measures taken towards reducing CO2 will increase the ticket price for routes within Europe by a sum of no more than approximately EUR 1.
This is a fraction of what we have to pay for anti-terrorism security measures!
Together with this, however, a good-quality railway of 1000 km must compete with aviation and, to achieve this, the airlines must bear the costs to which they give rise, to the same extent as we expect it of railways and road traffic.
Comitology (debate)
The next item is the Commission statement on comitology.
Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, the comitology reform that was decided in July 2006 introduced a 'regulatory procedure with scrutiny', which gives a veto right to the European Parliament on measures of general scope that amend a basic legal act adopted under codecision.
In the framework of this reform, the three institutions concluded a joint statement in which they committed themselves to adapt 26 priority basic acts to this new procedure, and the Commission adopted 26 priority alignment proposals at the end of last year.
It is in our common interest to have these alignment instruments adopted as soon as possible.
The Commission is therefore very pleased to see that Parliament is now ready to vote on several legislative resolutions, after having reached good and fair compromise solutions between the three institutions.
Other important dossiers will be on the agenda of another session of the European Parliament later this month, and I am confident that we will be able to settle these dossiers as well.
I want to thank the rapporteurs from the different committees for their very cooperative and constructive approach.
Consequently, the whole package of the 26 priority alignment proposals could be ready for adoption before the end of this year.
This would be a very good result which will pave the way to the so-called 'general alignment'.
As you know, the Commission made a commitment to review all existing codecision basic legal acts, in addition to these 26 priority acts, with a view to bringing them into line with the new regulatory procedure with scrutiny.
The Commission will respect this commitment and propose this general alignment of all non-priority acts.
It concerns in total more or less 220 acts.
This will take the form of four to five omnibus or package proposals, the first of which should arrive in the European Parliament shortly in November.
The next two omnibus proposals will follow within a couple of weeks and the final proposal just before the end of the year, or very early next year.
A third aspect of revising Parliament's scrutiny rights is the revision of the agreement concluded in 2000 between the Commission and Parliament on comitology procedures.
Here I would like to thank Parliament and, in particular, Mr Galeote and Mr Corbett for the excellent spirit of cooperation which prevailed throughout the negotiations.
I would also like to thank them for recognising that the special procedures foreseen in the agreement will apply in all extremely urgent cases.
I am pleased to announce that the results of these negotiations have been politically endorsed and that the Commission will be ready to proceed to the formal adoption of the revised agreement, as soon as Parliament formally endorses the outcome of the negotiations.
I am confident that the agreement we reach will help our two institutions work more efficiently in the future.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, this discussion on comitology has been going on for a long time.
On the basis of the Basel II report, the European Parliament has finally won rights of scrutiny that should actually be normal in a democracy, against huge opposition from the Council and opposition from the Commission.
Now we must attend to adapting the directives accordingly.
Here the focus has been on the question of adapting the relevant directives - and that is understandable.
The question of the extent to which we adapt the directives legislatively is certainly an important aspect.
However, the agreement between Parliament, the Commission and the Council is about how Parliament can be appropriately involved.
The Commissioner expressed her hope that Parliament will adopt the relevant alignments in the current year.
It is important to us that Parliament be informed about the processes in good time and that the exchange of information to Parliament via the comitology committees take place promptly.
The actual implementation phase is yet to begin and time will tell whether or not this will strengthen the rights of Parliament.
The same applies to requests for urgent debate.
To take one example: accounting is next on the agenda, IFRS 8.
Here the procedure was that we in the comitology process were, unfortunately, only informed by the Commission at the last minute.
Then we were expected to take a decision relatively quickly.
The key, apart from the formal alignment process, will be whether the Commission, the relevant Directorates-General, the officials working in this area, are willing to include Parliament in the work in good time.
Only then will effective scrutiny be possible.
This is where it will be revealed whether the Commission as a whole is for this or not.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, here we are, talking about comitology again.
Basically it is a matter, as you said, of implementing the agreement that we all welcomed as a success when we entered into it in July 2006.
There are two aspects to it: the practical aspect, which I will not go over again, but also its translation to each of the directives and, today, we are concerned with the 26 priority directives.
I am speaking in relation to those referred to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
From that point of view, I would like to express our determination that the European Parliament's position, when it examines these 26 priority directives, should be as coherent as possible.
The same comitology agreement needs to be applied to these 26 directives, hence the idea of a parallel approach.
However, as we well know, in these negotiations the devil is in the detail, and we met him during these negotiations on three particular points I would like to mention briefly.
The first point concerns something that, within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs - but not only there - has felt like a kind of provocation.
On the subject of accounting standards, an area in which the European Parliament exercises its full powers and competencies, the Commission presented a proposal that said that urgency should be applied as an automatic procedure.
We did not accept this and fortunately I see that we managed to get the Commission to back down on this point and forced it to give up its demands for systematic urgency, which would have deprived Parliament of an effective right of control in an area where, on the contrary, it has demonstrated its ability to be useful, effective and relevant.
The second point is, of course, the issue of what are known as the 'sunset clauses' or revision clauses.
The Commission and the Council really wanted these clauses to disappear.
They felt that this was an inherent element of the comitology agreement made last year.
In a spirit of cooperation, we have ensured that the Commission will be invited to check the efficacy and democratic functioning of the conditions of transmission of implementing powers regularly, every three years.
I believe this is a good way to proceed and I see that, in the commitment the Commission agreed to sign through what is now known as a revision clause, it is invited to look at the extent of its competence and justify any changes in legislation or the absence of such changes.
The third area is obviously the issue of scope.
What we see is that the Council has not always followed the Commission's proposals, whether on transparency or prospectuses, the definition of cross-border missions or equivalences.
I do believe, however, that in a spirit of cooperation, including on the part of the Portuguese Presidency, we are reaching a result that should satisfy all the institutions and I am pleased about this.
(ES) Mr President, following the speeches from the Vice-President of the Commission and my colleague Mrs BerÃšs, my speech is almost superfluous.
I was responsible for producing the report for the Committee on Legal Affairs and, in agreement with our fellow Members from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, we arrived at the conclusion that the urgent procedure that the Commission was asking for in Article 6(2)(2) was unnecessary, because at the moment cooperation between Parliament and the Commission, and also the Council, is excellent.
Consequently, the report by the Committee on Legal Affairs asks for this article to be removed and adopts two further recitals, two further changes to the recitals, aimed at highlighting the flexibility of the procedure.
After the adoption of recitals 1 and 2 in committee there were negotiations between Parliament and the Commission, which Mrs WallstrÃ¶m referred to, and we tabled a final amendment, Amendment 4, which replaces the current Amendment 2, and establishes a formula for cooperation between the three institutions.
In other words, what is important in this text is the final sentence, which says that the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament need to act diligently in order to ensure that these rules and interpretations can be adopted in time, in order not to undermine the perception and, ultimately, the confidence of investors.
I think that, at the moment, this formula of compromise between Parliament, the Council and the Commission could help to solve the problems without us having to resort to the urgent procedure that the Commission originally proposed.
Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, thank you for your constructive comments at this late hour.
Let me just make two short last comments.
First of all, on the register, I think you are absolutely correct in underlining the need to have information about the procedure, to be well-informed about the progress of different files, and one of the measures that we have agreed on is, of course, to update our comitology register as well.
This we have agreed between the institutions, and the Commission is investing in this and we are sure that it will be in place by March next year.
So I think at least this will help, but we will also encourage, of course, our services to work as closely as possible with the Parliament.
The other comment is simply to say that I hope that we agree that the whole idea behind this particular procedure is to ensure that we have a consistent and coherent application of the new rules.
That is also why we have proposed this sort of package or omnibus proposals, and that is, I think, the way forward: to make sure that we follow closely what has been agreed and that we can, between the two institutions, handle it as effectively as possible as well.
The debate is closed.
International accounting standards (debate)
The next item is the motion for a resolution on international accounting standards.
Chairman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, there is a certain logic in the sequence of discussions we are having because, in this debate, we have to decide whether or not to adopt the so-called IFRS 8 standard at European level.
In a previous debate on 25 April 2007, when Parliament had to decide on this standard, we were unequivocal in stating that we felt the conditions were not in place for us to be able to do this.
There were two reasons for this.
The first was that we had just given the European Commission and the Council a very clear message that we felt that the convergence process the European Union was entering into with countries outside the EU for the recognition of their accounting standards could not simply amount to a cut-and-paste of their standards with the international standard.
We also felt that the convergence process should be a mutual process.
When it came to the IFRS 8 standard, we had the impression that this was not the route that was being followed by the international organisation and we wanted to alert the public to this.
The second reason for doing so was that many people were warning us, quite rightly I believe, of the fact that this accounting standard was being proposed for all users, namely auditors, investors and supervisors, without an impact assessment having been carried out first.
Now, we know the obsession of the Commission chaired by Mr Barroso with having these impact assessments carried out regularly as part of better regulation, which it uses as a roadmap.
It seems to us that what applies at European Union level should also apply to the self-regulating international standardisation bodies We have therefore asked the Commission to conduct this impact assessment itself, in the absence of any assessment by the international body.
The Commission met its formal commitment by presenting the conclusions of this impact assessment to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in early September, as agreed.
Nevertheless, in future, we need to acknowledge that the scope of this assessment and the way all the parties were interviewed undoubtedly needs to be reviewed to improve the spectrum of those interviewed, so that it is not only those known as the preparers, that is those who draw up the accounts.
Through its desire to move forward with this debate and perhaps also to contribute to the international standards becoming the reference throughout the world, Parliament still wants to adopt the IFRS 8 standard today and this demonstrates both its sense of earnestness in the procedure for adopting the accounting standards and also its sense of responsibility.
As important discussions begin with the United States to establish the conditions for its own adoption of the accounting standards, it seems important to us to show our determination to do so ourselves in a lucid and responsible manner.
I hope this Parliament will adopt the IFRS 8 standard tomorrow, while stressing that when it is revised - and this is already in progress at the IASB, the International Accounting Standards Board - account is taken of the need for precise financial information about the reality of group activities.
Many NGOs in particular are sensitive to the fact that through this information, a clearer picture of the activity of groups - for example, mining in a particular geographical area or country by country where this is significant - can be given to those affected by these activities.
Finally, as my last point, I would like to say again to the Commission that we feel the result of this procedure is a very important call to respect the European vote, as a matter of equivalence, and that, when impact assessments are carried out, these enable all parties to express their points of view.
I would like to point out to you that the vote will not take place tomorrow, but on Wednesday.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to warmly thank the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for the excellent work they have carried out regarding the adoption of International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 8 - Operating Segments, the new standard on segment information.
After the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issued the standard in November 2006, a debate ensued concerning the suitability of IFRS in the European context.
This debate was useful.
We had to make sure that the European Union would not adopt a new accounting standard just for the sake of convergence with the equivalent US standard, but mainly because it improves the quality of financial information and is conducive to the European public good.
Before reaching a final decision, the Commission and Parliament agreed in May 2007 that the Commission's services would carry out an analysis of the potential consequences of adopting IFRS 8.
They ran a public consultation during July and August and gathered the views of stakeholders on the cost/benefit implications and the overall impact of adopting IFRS 8.
On the basis of almost 200 contributions, my services have prepared a report which was provided to Parliament on 10 September 2007.
The report's main conclusion is that the benefits of adoption of IFRS 8 would outweigh its costs.
Further, many constituents stressed that a swift endorsement of IFRS 8 would remove uncertainty about the treatment of financial statements for the period ending in December 2007.
Let me stress that we did not ignore the concerns that had been raised regarding the introduction of the so-called 'management approach', which gives management more leeway compared with the existing standard on segment reporting.
Some constituents were concerned that IFRS 8 lacks strict requirements on detailed geographical information because it allegedly does not require sufficient detail on a country-by-country basis.
Discussions with constituents revealed, however, that IFRS 8 is rather expected to improve this kind of disclosure.
Further, it seems that particular concerns in this area, in our view - and in the view of the majority of respondents to our consultation - cannot be resolved through a financial reporting standard on segment information.
This could be better done through a further development of a framework regarding corporate social responsibility aspects.
We agreed that IFRS 8 should not be adopted solely for the sake of convergence, yet we believe that it is crucial to see the issue also in the broader context of the European Union adopting a set of standards which are truly global.
A couple of years ago we all agreed that Europe should not opt for its own set of standards but rather support and promote the development of a high quality and global set of standards like IFRS.
We are working on improving the governance of the IASB.
On 7 November the European Commission, the US Securities and Exchange Commission and the Japanese Financial Services Agency made a joint statement announcing their agreement to seek certain changes to strengthen the institutional framework of the International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC) Foundation.
These changes are intended to strengthen the accountability of the Foundation's trustees, in particular by replacing the current self-appointment process for the appointment of the trustees with a process in which public authorities are responsible for the final approval of trustees.
The joint statement also recognised the importance of further strengthening the IASB's due process, including by carrying out impact assessments.
This agreement provides a strong basis to address the concerns expressed by this Parliament.
It also reflects the issues identified by the Commission's two monitoring reports to ECOFIN concerning the IASB's governance.
We will work with the IASC Foundation and the international partners to develop more detailed proposals in the coming months.
We will, of course, maintain a close dialogue with the European Parliament throughout this process.
I am confident that the outcome of this process will ensure that standards respond to European needs and are easily acceptable and applicable by all stakeholders in the EU and also globally.
Let me conclude.
The swift adoption of IFRS 8 is important for two reasons.
It improves the quality of financial information and it provides certainty to all market participants.
The discussions of the last months have demonstrated that a stronger involvement of the European Parliament in the endorsement process is necessary.
The Commission will also continue to work with the IASB and the IASC Foundation and with our international partners to ensure that the process of developing international accounting standards is fully accountable, transparent and meets the needs of European stakeholders.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, the IFRS 8 process is symptomatic of where we stand today with regard to implementation, endorsement, of IFRS in Europe.
I should like to say very clearly from the outset, to those who perhaps always assume the opposite of Parliament, that the majority of the European Parliament is in favour of IFRS, of a global standard, and of taking the same course on this, the right course.
We ought to examine this IFRS process, in particular, in relation to whether all is well with it at the moment: the Commission presents the European Parliament with a standard at short notice, the Commission and industry are expected to implement it relatively quickly, pressure from industry gets stronger and stronger, and those who have the duty of justifying it to citizens on the ground are not given any opportunity to form an opinion on it.
The Commission has prescribed an appropriate phase, but we are going to have to do some straight talking about what has happened now, as the implementation phase is now being postponed retrospectively.
To avoid this happening in future it is vital that the legislative institutions, such as the European Parliament, are informed about the work in good time.
I welcome the announcement last week by the Commission, with the SSI, the Japanese and IOSCO.
What the IFRS organisation then presented - regarding providing its own governance - is a correct, but long-overdue step towards appropriate legitimisation and governance.
We, the European Parliament, shall pay particular attention to whether democratic rules of play are observed.
That does not mean that the European Parliament must be directly involved, but only if the process is working correctly shall we be able to ensure that it operates optimally in future when each individual standard is implemented - and in future we shall be consulted about each individual standard.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, adoption of the IFRS 8 standard will enable our companies to use the standard for the current financial year and put an end to uncertainty.
The management approach will enable our companies to report publicly, with the same structure used internally, thereby reducing the burden of reporting.
Users will have access to information that was previously kept internally.
So IFRS 8 is a win for both the companies and the investors.
But I have some concerns about the impact assessment that follow a pattern about which I have spoken before.
Respondents this time seemed predominantly producers rather than users, and with regard to users there were no questions on comparability.
A more pro-active approach may need to be taken with respect to impact assessments generally, and it certainly cannot have helped in this instance if one hoped-for sector of respondents does not have key questions posed.
Further, some of the justifications in the report do very little to justify.
Indeed, to me they look more like the type of document that is written ahead of meetings in the hope of reaching agreement.
I am very British about this and prefer my minutes and responses and reports to look like they were drafted after events.
I regret that European companies have been kept waiting for our endorsement of the standard, but Parliament should not be expected to give its assent, on a say-so, without time and proper information to make an assessment.
However, I am pleased that there has been an improvement in cooperation recently, and I look forward to that continuing.
Mr President, the importance of appropriate accounting standards cannot be exaggerated.
In today's world there is a growing need for clear, comparable and sufficient information for investors as well as facilitating business by reducing compliance costs.
Therefore, I agree with my colleagues on the importance of prudence in the question.
Decisions should not be taken lightly, and I really think that the views of all colleagues who have mentioned timely impact assessment as an important tool to find balanced solutions and make sure that all stakeholders and their opinions are considered are very important.
Parliament should, of course, be kept duly informed.
Of equal importance is to ensure that the EASB governance system is reviewed and adjusted so that regulatory authorities can support its standard-setting process and its result.
It is, after all, the only body we have to do a cross-border account standards setting process.
However, while the process has not been perfect, we must not let this delay our work to close the gap between us and our economic partners.
Today's world is much more interconnected, and it is in our interest to make it function as smoothly as possible, and compatible standards are vital to this end.
Within the Transatlantic Economic Council, both sides are eager to make this work, and IFRS standards and financial reports are an important tool to find this mutual recognition of standards.
For now, the IASB is the best way we have.
European stakeholders must be involved and the functioning of the IFRS should be monitored.
It can and should also be changed to correct possible mistakes, if we make mistakes.
Democracy, of course, takes time but sometimes it is needed to correct mistakes.
Many of my colleagues have mentioned that it was very important that Parliament was able to raise some concerns and make improvements to the process.
The debate is closed.

Commission legislative programme and work programme for 2008 (debate)
The next item is the debate on the Commission Legislative and Work Programme for 2008.
President of the Commission. - Mr President, the next 12 months will be of vital importance to Europe for our future effectiveness, for our place in the world, for the confidence of our citizens in our ability to meet their expectations.
We have every reason to be confident.
The agreement on the Treaty of Lisbon was very welcome, but so too was the manner in which it was reached.
There was a refusal to be distracted from the primary purpose of equipping the Union with the tools it needs for the future.
There was a real determination to get down to business.
At the same time, our economic agenda has brought results in terms of growth and jobs, helping to offset the risks of added turbulence this year.
We are tackling the big issues: from energy to migration, from employment to development aid, namely in Africa, and in just a few weeks we have an opportunity to underline our global leadership on the fight against climate change in Bali.
In short, the European Union is delivering.
It was able to overcome the very difficult situation we faced in 2005.
The twin-track strategy proposed by the Commission in 2006 has paid off, focusing on concrete results for citizens, and at the same time investing in a solution for the institutional settlement.
The Union, I believe, is on track for 2008.
We need to use this to best effect, implementing our commitments, taking forward key proposals already on the table, keeping up the momentum with new initiatives and, at the same time, keeping long-term challenges on our radar screen.
In addition, of course we must respect and promote the process of ratification of the Treaty and show citizens what the European Union can offer in the run-up to the European parliamentary elections of 2009.
I therefore welcome this opportunity to set out the Commission's contribution to a successful 2008 by presenting our Legislative and Work Programme for 2008.
In doing so, I would like to thank the European Parliament for its active involvement in the work of developing this Programme.
In particular the comprehensive summary report prepared by the Conference of Committee Chairmen and endorsed by the Conference of Presidents helped to shape our programme.
Many Commission proposals are a direct match to the priorities set out in your summary report.
But first allow me a quick word on the implementation of the 2007 programme.
This time last year we discussed a targeted list of strategic initiatives for delivery this year.
To cite just a few of the most visible initiatives, this has meant a series of key actions like the Strategic Energy Review, the recent proposals on labour migration, flexicurity, the wine market, market access.
By the end of next month, all the strategic initiatives will have been adopted, with just one exception.
This is the Emissions Trading Directive, which I have decided to put back one month to January. The reason for this was to ensure no distraction from the crucial talks in Bali - where I want the European Union to appear united.
It will also give us the time to finalise the consultations needed on how to realise the European Union's agreed targets on greenhouse gas and renewables.
I am sure that you will agree that this makes sense and in fact that it can represent time that we gain because the preparation will allow, I am sure, a better possibility of a consensus with our Member States.
In addition to the strategic initiatives, we undertook to deliver a large number of priority initiatives over an 18-month period.
Many of these are now coming forward.
The coming weeks will see proposals on mortgage credit, Trade Defence Instruments and reducing CO2 emissions from cars.
We should see a delivery rate of 70 % by year end and at, or close to, 100% by the end of the 18 months, next June.
2007 is also proving a crucial year in preparing for the future.
In particular, next week we will launch a set of key proposals for the Union's economic and social future.
The single market review will gear up the single market as a strong, innovative and competitive market, bringing direct benefits to consumers and entrepreneurs and positioning Europe to shape globalisation to best effect.
Alongside this, we will adopt a vision on how to promote opportunities, access and solidarity in the Europe of the 21st century, to be backed up next year with a full communication on a modernised social agenda.
We will be paying particular attention to how we will be able to use the Treaty of Lisbon and its protocols to move forward on services of general interest, using these new opportunities to see how we can bring real added value to ensuring the role of these services in improving the quality of life of all Europeans.
I very much look forward to the reactions of the European Parliament and the Council to the internal market review and the social vision.
I believe that, taken together, they give us the balance needed to move ahead in key areas of our economic and social agenda.
They show that Europe has the right tools and offers the right platform for our citizens to adapt to and to shape globalisation.
Let me now focus on the Commission Legislative and Work Programme for 2008.
This is our political programme for 2008.
It sets out our main initiatives and builds on our commitment to provide added value to Europe's citizens.
We have sought to strengthen both the policy content and the process.
As for 2007, the work programme for 2008 concentrates on a limited number of new policy initiatives, including 26 strategic initiatives grouped together in 12 packages, which the Commission commits to deliver during the year, and 61 priority initiatives, grouped together in 49 packages, to be delivered over a 12-month to 18-month period.
We will centre our initiatives in five areas, which are of direct relevance to everyone in Europe: growth and jobs, sustainable Europe, managing migration, putting the citizens first and Europe as a world partner.
We are also determined to strengthen our commitment to better regulation with a guarantee to deliver what we promise.
We have noted with particular satisfaction that the European Parliament's summary report agrees with the key areas of central importance we identify for 2008.
Close cooperation among institutions and Member States will be essential to realise our goals.
For several of the areas mentioned in your report, concrete initiatives are either already adopted or planned to be adopted still in 2007.
For next year, I am pleased to be able to note the inclusion in the Programme of a number of initiatives highlighted as of particular interest to the European Parliament.
Just to list some of the key areas: the Lisbon Strategy for growth and jobs, which we agree remains central to our goals of a more prosperous, environmentally responsible and socially inclusive European Union; climate change, with this year's stress on mitigation, complemented by a new approach on adaptation; greening of the transport sector; a Small Business Act for SMEs (in fact it is a package of measures for SMEs); legislation to strengthen consumer protection regarding contractual rights and a new Consumer Scoreboard; better access to justice for citizens; improving the regulatory environment in Europe with a strategic review of better regulation.
On the bulk of our agenda there is a large degree of agreement between the Commission and Parliament on the need to act and on the way forward.
It is true that there are some suggestions in the summary report where we cannot give a definitive answer at this stage.
For example, we are working actively on intellectual property and financial services, but feel that it is premature to fix now the form and level of ambition for specific initiatives.
On waste management, we would accommodate the issues you have raised through the Action Plan on better implementation of waste legislation, rather than a new initiative at this stage.
Let me make one point clear: what is not included in the list of new initiatives is not being neglected.
The Commission's essential work of implementing Community law, of executing programmes, and of negotiating international agreements, will continue and is made more visible in other parts of the Programme's text.
Also a new chapter on 'shaping new policies' seeks to reflect the multiannual nature of most of the activities of the Commission.
We have also inserted in the Work Programme the communication priorities, but have added a novelty in this respect: we propose a number of those priorities to the other institutions so that we can work together to promote them.
But this is not about centralisation - quite the contrary.
We believe that a common understanding of priorities offers the springboard for 'going local', adapting communication to best fit different needs in different parts of the Union.
We also believe that in this communication area partnership is crucial if we really want to connect Europe to its citizens.
The Commission looks forward to a lively and fruitful debate reflecting the strategic dimension of the Commission's work programme and a strong political message to our citizens.
The year 2008 is indeed a crucial year for Europe.
Together the European Commission and the European Parliament can build on our excellent work together in 2007, can make the difference and can make, I am sure, 2008 a great year for Europe.
(Applause)
Commission President, I would also like to extend a very warm welcome to the many members of the Commission who are present for this debate today.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, may I start by saying to you, Commission President, that having heard your minatory words last year about the attendance of Members of this House, there are more Members than Commissioners in the Chamber today, and I trust that you have noted that fact with gratification.
On behalf of the PPE-DE Group, may I also voice some words of encouragement: we encourage you, during the coming year - the crucial year for the ratification of the new Treaty - to utilise your Commission's most important competence, namely the right to bring forward legislative proposals for Europe, in a way which ensures that you address the issues of serious concern to citizens effectively and utilise the opportunities at your disposal to narrow the gap between citizens and the European Union.
We support your general approach as set forth in your programme, as well as the priorities you have chosen, from growth and jobs - whose success is crucial to underpin social cohesion in Europe - to many other detailed aspects, up to and including migration and research.
My colleagues will focus on individual issues.
We welcome the fact that you have indeed taken up various proposals arising from the structured dialogue with the committees.
We would like to see this dialogue being intensified even further.
We would also welcome it if your planning were not only to cover the first few months of 2009 but were perhaps to encompass a two-year cycle which could be developed further on a year-by-year basis.
What we feel is missing is an indicative time schedule, and we also see a gap between your programme and the budgetary procedure, which it would be sensible to close.
You intend to bring forward a total of 79 legislative initiatives and around the same number of non-legislative actions.
If we look at this in terms of your stated intention to reduce bureaucracy, I am not sure whether you are genuinely serving that objective.
The items of legislation whose repeal you have announced notably include many which would have expired anyway.
To that extent, reducing bureaucracy is more about 'talking a good game' than achieving a real and effective objective.
Next year is the year of the new Treaty.
You have the opportunity - and I am confident that this Treaty will come into force - to incorporate this Treaty into your programme already at this stage.
The Treaty will bring in important new elements: operability, transparency and democracy. It will also bring in an element which is vital for us and to which I recommend you devote some attention, and that is the principle of subsidiarity.
A new debate on subsidiarity is starting in Europe, and the main partner for that debate is you, Mr President, and your Commission.
A storm of protest erupted in some parts of Germany a few days ago over the issue of fruit and apple wines.
I do not want to discuss the public reaction to this issue in detail, but let me say this, Mr President: what sort of spirit is at large in an administration which, at one bureaucratic stroke, obliterates regional traditions which go back hundreds of years, and does so in such a cold and insensitive way?
There is a problem with this approach, and it is your problem, Mr President.
It is a problem with your Commission.
You now have an opportunity, in the spirit of the new Treaty, to create a new culture of subsidiarity.
That is the opportunity - the great opportunity - for your Commission to achieve more consensus among the population at large, and it is an opportunity which we in the PPE-DE Group would expressly encourage you to seize with both hands.
(Applause)
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commission President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, may I also welcome you very warmly on behalf of my Group.
Much of what the Commission President has said and which is included in this document meets with our approval.
I would like to focus on two points which are crucial, in our view. These points are addressed at the end of your programme.
I would have liked to see them included at the beginning, but their location in the text does not make them any less important.
The first point is communication.
I can only endorse what Mr Nassauer has said.
We must convey a clear message to citizens about what Europe is all about and what we are trying to achieve with our various legislative proposals; otherwise, we are wasting our time.
I am very pleased with the approach to the issue of communication - which also lies in the hands of Madam Vice-President - and the proposals she has put forward, which envisage a joint approach with Parliament.
However, it is also a question of the language we use when we communicate with citizens and how we convey the message about what we are trying to do.
Last year, we dealt with a number of items of legislation which improved the legal position of consumers, notably in telecommunications and other sectors.
However, we have still not managed to convince our citizens satisfactorily that we are here for them and that we are not an elite group of people working away somewhere in Brussels.
We need to do more here.
I hope, Madam Vice-President, that you will be able to say a few words at the end of this debate about what you are planning in specific terms, for it is our common goal, and that is a message which we must convey in 2008 in particular.
There is another important sentence which is also to be found towards the end of the document. It talks about social problems and the social dimension of the EU in the context of globalisation, in particular jobs and migration and citizens' concerns.
Unfortunately, Mr President, the document you have presented to us does not contain many answers to these questions.
This is not just a matter for the Social Affairs Commissioner, who is also doing good work.
This dimension must be addressed by the Commission as a whole.
Indeed, it is a matter for the President of the Commission himself.
He, too, must focus on achieving this social Europe.
There are many areas involved here, and I would like to cite just two of them.
One of them is international trade.
Is it not a scandal that there are still European companies which are reliant on child labour in India and other countries?
What are we doing to tackle this?
This situation creates fears here in Europe and exacerbates poverty. That is borne out by various studies: it exacerbates poverty in countries which are our trading partners.
In other words, trade policy must also include a social dimension, perhaps by means of social clauses.
(Applause)
As to immigration policy, your document talks about 'an integrated approach to migration'.
Would it not be better to say: 'no migration without integration'?
Indeed, should the Commission not have been sending out a much clearer and unequivocal message here?
Yesterday, we discussed this issue with Commissioner Frattini.
His initial comments about the situation of the Roma population in Rome, for example, were not very encouraging.
His statements yesterday were much clearer and more helpful.
Is it not the case that the Roma issue is also one which we have often neglected, not only in the new Member States but in the old ones as well?
Mrs Merkel and Mr Sarkozy are saying 'no migration policy without integration policy'.
Surely this is an approach which the Commission should have adopted long ago?
I doubt that Mr Sarkozy and Mrs Merkel mean the same thing as we Social Democrats do when they talk about integration.
Nonetheless, the basic message is absolutely correct and the Commission must adopt a much clearer approach here.
(Applause)
Combating right-wing extremism is therefore not only about addressing the issue on an ideological level; it is of course about social issues as well.
Unemployment, social exclusion and anti-social elements are still present in our society and are being exploited by the extreme right in their campaign against Europe.
For that reason, Europe and the European Commission must take action here.
My colleague Mr Schulz, the Chairman of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, has often said that we want a social Europe.
That is our primary goal and it should be the primary goal of this programme as well.
You have said that we can make '2008 a great year for Europe'.
We think that 2008 should be a great year for social Europe.
My plea to you, Commission President, is this: please, take the lead in achieving this social Europe!
(Applause)
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, this is a political programme which suits a year in which the pace of integration is going to quicken dramatically with the completion of the Reform Treaty process and the expansion of the Schengen and the euro zones.
But preparing for the bringing into force of the Treaty will be our principal task and here the Liberal Group have two principal concerns.
First: that in building the area of freedom, security and justice the integration of the third pillar with the first should be as fast and comprehensive as possible.
And secondly, with relation to the CFSP, reaching a first class agreement between the Council, Commission and Parliament upon the setting up of the external service promises to be fairly exciting and quite tricky.
To explain and justify the Treaty to national parliaments and to public opinion, we ought to put greater stress on the social and cultural dimension of the single market, such as migration policy, as well as on the fight to combat climate change.
These things will assist us to sell the Treaty.
The CAP Check should be directly associated with the future reform of the financial system through an expansion of a cofinancing of the CAP.
Finally, I should be grateful to hear the college's assessment of President Sarkozy's plan to establish a further 'ComitÃ© des Sages' to brood on the future of Europe.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FR) Mr President, President of the Commission, Commissioners, you have presented us with 26 strategic initiatives and 61 priority initiatives.
I am not going to comment on all of them in four minutes.
In debates of this kind it must always be borne in mind that the Commission has a responsibility and a quite special role to play in the Community decision-making process.
It is you who have the monopoly on legislative initiatives and it is you who wield the power by screening the various amendments, whether they come from Parliament or from the Council.
You have huge responsibility for the type of result that we are able to obtain as far as Community legislation is concerned.
I can therefore assure you that, as ever, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance is probably the most united of all the political groups in its support for this Community procedure, because I believe that the Commission has been entrusted with a formidable task in having to confront not only national interests but also the sensitivities of the various national governments.
To get straight to the heart of the matter there are three points that I would like to raise.
The first is energy policy: 2007 has been a big year.
The Nobel Peace Prize was awarded and the March European Council adopted a number of objectives that in our view could have been more ambitious, but which we supported nevertheless.
As you have pointed out, 2008 will now be a year for implementation.
This is where some real vigilance will be called for on our part.
We were really disappointed by the results on vehicle emissions.
We believe that your approach to biofuels ignores the negative impact that this type of technology is having on our environment.
We are of the view that in the second phase of emission permits we should be moving towards a bidding system rather than freely distributing what amount to nothing more than new financial assets.
We are somewhat surprised that as far as the internalisation of transport policy costs is concerned you have only announced what amounts to no more than methodological studies.
It appears to me that the economists have been debating this for at least 15 years and that the Commission could follow the example set by good national experience.
We also think that this thinking needs to be applied to all aspects of energy policy, and that you should resist the idea of making too much use of so-called 'soft' instruments in order to please different lobbies or to meet different governmental requests.
We need to employ restrictive instruments because the example set by the car industry shows us that voluntary agreements do not really work.
As regards renewable energies we do not believe it is a very good idea to introduce flexible arrangements between the Member States.
Everyone should do their bit.
The second subject that I wish to raise concerns immigration policy.
This is one area for which you have supreme responsibility.
I recall the speech that Kofi Annan made to the European Parliament several years ago.
It would be wonderful if the European Union could win the Nobel Peace Prize for a successful immigration policy.
We are counting on you to see to it that such an immigration policy, which you have included in your work programme, and which has already commenced, does not result in the introduction of a common biometric passport for all Member States.
I think that as well as creating a disastrous situation for people here, that would also damage the EU's credibility in the eyes of the rest of the world.
Finally, the last point I wish to raise - and this surprises me, Mr Barroso - is the fact that your programme does not include anything on the international financial markets.
If you want the citizens of the Community, or at least a large majority of them, to be more positively disposed towards globalisation and its various issues then the European Union, and the Commission in particular, cannot dissociate itself from the situation in the financial markets, the continued investigation of tax havens and our inability to debate issues surrounding the exchange rates between the euro, the Chinese yuan and the dollar.
I believe that people are waiting for the European Union to deliver ambitious initiatives that will ensure that the financial markets operate for the benefit of the economy and society, not the other way round.
I am reminded of the debates that Parliament held on this subject at the start of the current legislative period.
Various people now appear to have lost all sight of this.
For this reason it seems important to me that you should re-launch such an initiative with the backing of Parliament.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FR) Mr President, President of the Commission, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, along with my fellow Members I listened closely to what Mr Barroso said.
He set out the Commission's strategic objectives, with growth and employment naturally being at the top of the list of priorities.
Nevertheless, I noted that, as in the communication from the Commission, there was something singularly missing from his presentation and I would now like to ask the Commission President quite specifically about this.
Is it true that on 23 October the College of Commissioners debated a proposal that had been put by Mr Mandelson concerning European firms and businesses that had moved their production to third countries where wage levels were low?
This proposal was possibly aimed at exempting the said companies from the anti-dumping duties that apply to products exported to the Union at prices that are significantly lower than their normal value.
Is it true that this proposal received a large measure of support and that the Commission is to take a formal decision on this subject after 5 December?
How do you respond to those who see in such a measure nothing more than a financial subsidy for relocating production?
Would such a move not be totally inconsistent with those sections of the Commission communication that we are discussing here today, including the following:
Recent research shows that the main concern for EU citizens is 'the social dimension of the EU in the context of globalisation (in particular jobs and the fear of unemployment).'
Or else: 'The global competitiveness agenda contributes to creating lasting growth and jobs at home.'
(FR) Why was there no mention either in your presentation or in the Commission communication of the legislative programme for 2008 or of any project relating to major political issues such as the promotion of employment in the EU, industrial policy and, more generally, the benefits that the Community can derive from the current phenomenon of globalisation?
Finally, is it true that, foreseeing the major disruption that such a subject could cause during a vote in Parliament, not to say in the Council, you are planning to bypass the legislators by opting for guidelines instead?
I believe that my Group is not the only one here hoping for a clear response from you to these questions, failing which each of us will have to consider what form of reaction would be the most appropriate.
If you enjoyed the manner in which the House mobilised its efforts against the Bolkestein Directive then you will certainly love the outcry that will be caused by the Mandelson Regulation.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - Mr President, with your permission, I would like to start my speech in Irish.
(GA) I approve of the Commission's projected legislative and work programme.
The Commission is aiming above all to promote job creation and development in Europe; to make the EU come to grips with the problem of climate change; to bring about a common policy on migration; to give pride of place to EU citizens; and to ensure that the EU acts as a force for good all over the world.
And of course the whole issue of globalisation is one that will concentrate our minds over the next number of years - not just in the short term for 2008 - and I welcome the initiatives taken in particular by the Commission to prepare Europe to deal with the effects and impacts, both positive and negative, of what globalisation will mean.
We can see around the world that there is a threat to democracy also, and the actions that we must take with regard to ensuring that we can best deliver not just aid and assistance to those who are in trouble but also the promotion of the values of democracy, the rule of law, the separation of powers.
We have seen in recent weeks that Pakistan, Georgia and other parts of the world are suffering from new forms of resistance towards democratic controls, new threats regarding the freedom of the press, and, most importantly of all, the annihilation of the will of the people to be heard and to be recognised within those networks.
In particular, the continuing crisis around the world - particularly in the developing world with regard to the AIDS, HIV and other areas - requires us to be more imaginative and innovative in how best we can deal with these areas.
But one issue in particular concerns me as we look to the future, in particular the short-term future, and that is the whole question of taxation within the European Union.
Many of us have grave concerns with regard to proposals coming forward from the Commission concerning corporation tax, the common consolidated base for corporation tax and, in particular, the relentless desire of certain Commissioners to drive forward the proposal which we - I and others in this House - believe the Commission does not have the legislative or legal basis to move forward on.
I am delighted that the Lisbon Reform Treaty has ensured that the issues of taxation still require unanimity.
I am delighted at the fact that no changes can be made without the 27 governments agreeing.
There is a place in Europe for ensuring that there is competition, not just in economic and in environmental terms, but also in the whole area of taxation.
This tax competition is healthy, and we must be given assurances that any proposals coming forward will not have a negative impact with regard to economic growth and employment growth, which is so necessary for the peoples of Europe.
Even if you look at America there is tax competition within the states and it appears to be working extremely well there.
The last point that I would make is that, as we look to the future and move forward, the peoples of Europe are not asking for more bureaucracy, they are not asking for more regulation.
They are asking for vision and a rapid response to the real problems that they face on a day-to-day basis, not some abstract ideologies from an ancient past which I hope we have left behind us.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (DA) Mr President, there is an election in Denmark today.
I hope that the new Danish Parliament will have members who take the trouble to read the Commission's annual programme and the EU legislative proposals and consider them.
For it is the EU that determines our laws, and it is sad to have experienced an election battle where the formulation of laws is simply not debated.
Instead, in Denmark there have been discussions concerning municipal and regional matters such as food at playschools, education and hospitals.
The Danish input into the legislative process within the EU is not being discussed amongst the elected people's representatives; democracy is being drained as a form of government.
The Commission's annual programme should ideally be distributed for consideration by all the specialist committees within all the national parliaments and, in connection with this, all parties should take a position on what should be legislated at EU level and what should be kept under national jurisdiction.
Proximity and necessity controls - or subsidiarity and proportionality to use EU jargon - should be considered by the national parliaments, first in connection with the annual programme and then subsequently when the Commission submits the various legislative proposals.
This could connect the national parliaments with the EU and give citizens the opportunity to be involved before they receive a decree from Brussels, which has also promised to comply with the recommendations of the national parliaments, yet very few come.
The national parliaments are asleep on the job, and it is depressing for those of us who are fighting for them, but it is good to see so many Commissioners at once.
(DE) Mr President, o sonho europeo, the European dream, der EuropÃ€ische Traum!
I think that the vast majority of Europeans have a fairly clear idea and generally agree on what this should be.
That being the case, why is there so much mistrust directed towards the Commission in so many countries?
You say that it has to do with communication.
However, a great many citizens, even those who only consider these problems in passing, are saying, no, it has to do with the specific projects, and it has to do with the Lisbon Strategy and its obvious failure to date.
Mr Swoboda says that the social dimension is missing and I must admit that on this issue, he is right.
However, at the same time, Mr Duff has said that the social dimension of the Constitutional Treaty - my apologies, you call it the Reform Treaty - must be the focal point.
That is all very well, but where does it say anything about the social dimension there?
In which form is this Treaty actually readable, and where in this Treaty does it say anything about basic democratic principles such as the separation of powers?
If you actually did what you said and what you apparently intend - namely to convey the message effectively and implement your intentions in a way which is verifiable in hard data - communication would become far less of a problem.
The President of the European Court of Auditors offered you a very clear starting point yesterday evening.
He mentioned very specific numbers for the first time: EUR 4 billion incorrectly disbursed from the Structural Funds alone.
Let me quote from his speech: 'The most frequent errors were claims for ineligible expenditure and failure to carry out tender procedures as well as a lack of evidence to support the calculation of overheads or the staff costs involved.
The supervisory and control systems in the Member States were generally ineffective or moderately effective, and the Commission maintains only a moderately effective supervision of their functioning.'
You need to take action.
Please do not attempt to improve communication about what you are not doing! That is bound to go wrong.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, I would like to address the Commission's agenda, particularly in the economic sector, not only because this is the area where the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs' interest mostly lies, but it is also of vital importance to the Lisbon Strategy.
The Commission must keep its active role in building a genuine single market for financial services.
It is topical for a good reason.
Firstly, the recent financial turmoil has underlined the importance of sound financial regulation.
Secondly, the financial world is more and more intertwined.
We must be able to build convergence with our main allies overseas.
Transatlantic Market initiatives started a very important process which is especially critical to the capital markets.
A few years ago a groundbreaking legislative process in the form of the Lamfalussy procedure was successfully introduced.
The Lamfalussy procedure is the first attempt to shift widely to delegated legislation in the EU.
Even though the first experiences from this procedure are positive, it is crucial to keep on building trust between institutions.
The working relations between the European Parliament and the European Commission in this process are very important.
As for the follow-up, firstly, the Lamfalussy procedure is basically a sound process that is welcomed by stakeholders.
It is also in its early stages.
It is developing all the time.
Therefore no overhaul is appropriate at this point, nor is it the wish of most stakeholders.
Rather we need targeted improvements - particularly Level 3 Committees - there is a lot of scope for improvement in their international cooperation, to challenge each other and explain.
Finally, I would like to say about tax-related issues that the Commission should keep its active role.
Even though taxation might seem a bit difficult, and we all know that it is still beyond unanimity, we must be very courageous in putting forward action in this area.
Enhanced cooperation is a good innovation and the other items of the Commission's agenda in the field of tax are also very important.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Mr President, President of the Commission, I believe that the people of Europe have very high expectations when it comes to the social dimension of European integration and that the strengthening of this social pillar is the weak link, if not to say the missing link, in the Commission's strategy.
We need to stop opposing the strategy for growth, the establishment of the single market and the strengthening of the social pillar.
This is a key factor for the support of the peoples of Europe and it is also, quite simply, an essential condition for the success of the Lisbon Strategy and for strengthening the competitiveness and economic efficiency of the European Union.
In this respect there is a striking contrast with the awareness of the challenges posed by climate change, which effectively seemed to stem from last year's spring summit, and indeed the priorities laid down in the Commission's work programme contain more than a trace of this.
We are a long way from displaying the same enthusiasm when it comes to meeting the challenges posed by social inclusion and the need to create a Europe that works for everyone, a Europe capable of promoting not just more jobs but better jobs too.
There are declarations of intent and there are various references here and there, in the introduction and in the preamble, but these scarcely figure in the action programme, nor are they included in the legislative initiatives.
Take, for example, lifelong learning, which is mentioned and which, as an accessory to the success of the new policy for the reform of the labour market, is essential if we want to have a fair and efficient system of 'flexicurity'. However, there is no grand ambitious programme, something the equivalent, for example, of the old Erasmus scheme, which is not only bearing fruit but has also proved a very effective link via which EU citizens can recognise and acknowledge the work of the European Union.
When it comes to combating social exclusion and poverty, and promoting social protection, the proposals for action are essentially limited to non-legislative initiatives.
We also regret the absence of any progress on the Working Time Directive and Part-Time Work Directive.
Similarly, in the area of taxation, we cannot but note that for want of an initiative on a genuine corporate tax base - which is something that Parliament has been advocating and which the Commissioner concerned was working on - we are still not moving towards a more equitable single market in this particular respect.
Finally, we are impatiently waiting for two initiatives that you announced.
The first concerns the review of the European Works Council Directive, which Parliament has been calling for since 2001, and the second, which you mentioned, concerns maternity leave.
I would like to conclude by referring to two examples of deadlock that seem to us to be absolutely incomprehensible and unacceptable: they relate firstly to services of general economic interest and secondly to social services of general interest.
After so many White Papers, Green Papers, announcements, disputes before the Court of Justice and a number of clear and repeated demands from the Committee of the Regions and the Economic and Social Committee, and even though a consensus was reached between the Member States in the Council on including a new article in the Lisbon Treaty to provide a clear basis for a legislative initiative - in codecision with Parliament - on public services, which are services of general interest, there is still no concrete proposal forthcoming.
Public services lie at the heart of our social model.
The people of Europe are waiting for clarification that competition rules and single market rules will not suddenly just be imposed on them.
Mr President, you should present an initiative to Parliament on this issue.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I welcome many aspects of the Commission programme.
In particular, I am delighted to see the Commission's commitment to bring forward a specific horizontal directive under Article 13 to combat discrimination in access to goods and services, although perhaps I would have preferred to see specific directives in all sectors.
However, I do welcome it.
This is something I and many other colleagues have been calling for, and I look forward to working with the Commission closely on this.
I also welcome the Commission's commitment to a communication on hospital-acquired infections.
We need to work towards a code of practice at European level to ensure best practice is shared and standards are raised, given the stark differences that exist between Member States.
I would also like to see an amendment to the 2000 Biological Agents Directive to protect health workers from contracting HIV and hepatitis C from needle stick injuries.
There are over one million such injuries across the EU each year, and I am disappointed that there is no action planned in this 2008 work programme.
I would urge the Commission to bring forward that amendment as soon as possible in line with the Parliament's request.
I would also say, under health and safety legislation, that I am pleased that you are committed to having impact assessments before any new legislation is brought forward.
But I urge you to make sure that you look at the implementation of current legislation as well.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, I am delighted at the prominence given to energy policy in the Commission's plans.
I would nonetheless like to draw attention to the need to achieve a balance between environmental and strategic aims.
It is very easy to impose new environmental taxes, and easy to demand better environmental standards for construction and industry, but this will not, however, resolve the problem of our energy security.
Political measures aimed at energy solidarity in a crisis are required.
The principles of the common market should be urgently applied to energy proprietors who also control distribution.
This is particularly important if the proprietors hail from third countries, such as Russia, where the principle of subsidiarity is not applied in the area of foreign investments.
Countries at risk of economic blackmail will be more inclined to bear the cost of environmental programmes if the latter go hand in hand with strategic solutions vital to Europe's energy security.
I remain under the impression that we have failed to achieve a balance in this area.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, Mr Barroso this morning sounds rather like a bad First World War general: let us do the same thing we did last week, even though it did not work.
There is absolutely no recognition that the model simply is not working.
I mean, how could he talk about growth and jobs without acknowledging that this wonderful, fabled Lisbon Strategy has been a total disaster?
We have not achieved a single one of the objectives.
And yet we talk about growth and jobs, but what are we going to do?
Are we going to deregulate?
Are we going to lift the burden off business?
No, nothing of the kind.
I wonder how he has got the front to talk about a sustainable Europe when we still have the same common fisheries policy, we are still throwing back, dead, up to 50% of the fish we catch and yet we are going to stick with the quota system.
But perhaps my favourite is the idea that this Commission programme is going to put the citizens first.
That is laughable!
If you wanted to put the citizens first, you would respect their opinions.
You would have listened to what the French and Dutch said and you would give them, with this new Treaty, the opportunity, in free and fair and open referendums, to see whether they share with you the same vision for the future of Europe.
But you are doing none of that.
You are burying your heads in the sand.
You are pretending it is not happening and you are actually destroying your own European Union because the whole thing falls further into public contempt.
(HU) Thank you for the floor, Mr President.
Ladies and gentlemen, the members of the EPP-ED Group who are concerned with budgetary matters have essentially been happy to approve the Commission's plans for 2008, and Mr Barroso has formulated a clear message that reflects political commitment.
However, the work programme itself is rather an endless wish-list.
If we were to debate the legislative programme and annual political strategy right at the start of the year, drawing them together, then the budget could be shaped to our goals, and not the goals to the budget.
Parliament is committed to the Galileo programme and the European Institute of Technology and expects the Commission and the Council to make a decision on these matters that serves to benefit European citizens.
Finally, I would like to emphasise that the Commission not only serves growth and job creation through many programmes but also uses taxpayers' money responsibly and demands similar responsibility from the Member States.
I approve of the fact that, in the event of serious abuse, the Commission is prepared to suspend payments to the Member State in question.
Hopefully, this painful step will not need to be taken but everyone, governments and European citizens, should know that the aim of aid is to develop under-developed regions, and that growth and job creation do not constitute an increase in the bank balances of smooth operators and spongers.
The Commission can also count on the strong support and cooperation of Parliament in this area.
Thank you for your attention.
(PL) Mr President, I am glad that matters relating to growth and employment head the list of the European Commission's priorities for 2008.
This is evidence of an understanding that full employment and preservation of the wide range of social services characteristic of the European social model cannot be achieved without swift and sustainable growth.
Unfortunately, the Commission's document is disappointing because it lacks detail.
The situation will not be improved simply by repeated reference to mantras such as 'the knowledge society' and 'flexicurity', whilst the Lisbon Strategy remains largely confined to paper.
Specific and more determined action is required, so as to encourage European societies to be more active on the labour market, remove barriers within the single market, notably in the area of the free movement of labour and services, and create more favourable conditions for entrepreneurs.
Europe is a world leader in terms of social and environmental protection.
Europe's potential for growth is too low, however, and will not enable it to retain its position.
Action should focus mainly on developing education, and increasing flexibility and readiness for work.
We must move away from a paternalistic social policy that perpetuates inactivity towards a social policy that rewards activity on the labour market.
The common currency has an important role to play in the creation of economic competition.
I welcome the enlargement of the euro zone to include Slovenia, Cyprus and Malta.
The discriminatory treatment meted out to certain new Member States endeavouring to join the euro zone should be cause for concern, however.
Lithuania is a case in point.
Any recurrence of such errors in the future could be detrimental above all for the eurozone.
We trust that the European Commission will present us with specific proposals regarding support for employment and growth, so as to ensure a high and constantly rising standard of living in a united Europe.
(DE) Mr President, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, as far as the PPE-DE Group is concerned, the objectives for the coming year in the field of the internal market and consumer protection are very clear.
Firstly, we want to see the completion of the internal market through the removal of remaining barriers and obstacles.
That is why, Mr Kyprianou, we welcome your proposal for a health services directive, based on Article 95, which would adopt a very broad-brush approach to the health sector.
We also welcome the fact that Mr McCreevy and his Directorate-General will be looking at further aspects of public procurement as a follow-up to the Services Directive.
Secondly, we want to see comparable standards of consumer protection being established in all Member States of the European Union and, Mrs Kuneva, we greatly welcome your review of all the relevant EU legislation in this area.
We are also pleased that we can act on this review in two directives, firstly in a horizontal instrument and then in a revision directive which will cover all the other areas to be dealt with.
Thirdly, we want to help achieve a situation in which we finally have clearer, simpler and therefore fewer rules in the European Union.
I am turning to you now, Mr Verheugen: as Members of this Parliament we will be looking very closely at all the proposals relating to the free movement of goods from this perspective.
The Toy Safety Directive will come, as will the Construction Products Directive, and I am sure we will see some movement on tractors and defence goods as well.
We hope that we will make tangible progress here.
We are also very much looking forward to your anticipated study on consumer labelling.
Sustainable Europe
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, thank you to the Commission.
The Commission's policy is Lisbon.
The Parliament's policy is Lisbon, but Lisbon is not happening.
We want to know why not, we want to see progress and we want to see that monitoring and enforcement.
President Barroso talked about prizes.
Let us have the Barroso prize for achievement each year for the Member State that has made most progress.
Why not?
Give them some encouragement.
Where we do want progress is on some of the things in the programme.
We obviously want it on emissions trading.
We do not want to see it slipping any more than the one month he referred to.
We want progress on climate change, quite clearly.
We want progress both in terms of what we can do through legislative restriction on emissions and so on, but also what we can do to encourage individuals.
So let us have the things like eco-labelling proposals coming forward.
We also want some progress on the information to patients - Mr Verheugen's proposal.
We want to see progress on patient mobility and cross-border health.
That is urgent.
Otherwise, we are going to have lawyers deciding policy for us.
We want to see that coming forward along with measures on patient safety, medical professionals' information, work on hospital-acquired infections, work against the counterfeiting of drugs and so forth. We want to see that mental health proposal which has been promised and has not yet appeared.
It was promised for this year.
Let us have it please.
That is an important step.
Lastly, this week we have the very first World Diabetes Day - the UN has supported this, as have Member States, the Council and the Parliament.
Let us have a bit of support from the Commission on progress on that as they see the symbol that we are going to erect in the courtyard of this Parliament tomorrow.
Let that be a reminder that we want some action to support the many families, and children in particular, who suffer from that debilitating disease.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, I am very pleased to see that climate change remains one of the key priorities of the Commission for the coming year.
Here we have an awful lot to deliver and I think we should focus on that delivery.
I understand why Commissioner Dimas is delaying the publication of the ETS and the other parts of the energy package until the new year, but I hope that does not mean that we are losing our resolve on climate change.
There is a certain amount of scepticism in Washington and elsewhere about how serious the European Union is about climate change.
It would be a real shame at a time when we are seeing changes in Washington, on both sides, Republican and Democrat, where we are seeing changes in Australia and a willingness to begin dialogue in China and India, if we were to stumble on our reform package on climate change.
We had our summit in March but it is not enough to talk about targets.
We have got to implement them.
We cannot just 'talk the talk' on climate change; we have to 'walk the walk' on climate change.
You, as the Commission, cannot do that alone.
You need the governments of Europe to back you, and there will be a tough debate on burden-sharing in the new year.
I hope this Parliament will be involved in that debate, not just watching on the sidelines, and we look forward to seeing how we can be involved.
But you also need the support of this House, and I say to the colleagues opposite and to the Liberals: last month, on cars, you let us down on climate change because you watered down the Commission proposals.
There will be another test later this morning on aviation emissions and I hope that we will have a strong package.
Finally, Mr Barroso mentioned the committee of wise men or wise people, which Mr Sarkozy wants to set up.
Why cannot these wise people - yes I agree they should not be looking at institutional reform - why cannot they look at delivery, that we actually deliver what Europe promises, and then we will begin to make the reconnection with the citizens that is so often talked about.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I welcome very much the emphasis given in the 2008 work programme to the importance of a sustainable European energy policy.
President Barroso spoke out about the greening of the transport sector and, of course, that is vital.
However, to my mind, the really shocking statistic is that in Europe we use 40% of our energy in buildings - in heating, cooling and lighting - even though we have the technology to design and engineer our buildings to have virtually no energy requirements at all.
Therefore, I want to make a plea to the Commission to be radical in its review of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive next year - point 2(c) of the Strategic Initiatives.
Two things are needed.
Firstly, the minimum energy performance requirements for new buildings should be tightened.
We need to move very quickly to a passive house or 'zero carbon' standard, with no net energy requirement.
Thousands of passive houses are now being built in Europe but, unfortunately, only in a few countries and regions.
Secondly and most importantly, we need to get rid of the 1 000 m2 threshold and bring all buildings with a heating or cooling requirement within the scope of the Directive.
That would mean all buildings undergoing major renovation would be brought up to high energy standards.
We have to look at the energy wasted in existing buildings and not just at new buildings, because 75% of the buildings which exist today will still be standing in 2050.
MEPs have been discussing the Commission's action plan on energy efficiency in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, and it seems to me that there is the political will in Parliament for a radical revision of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive.
I hope we can count on the Commission to come forward with some strong proposals next year so that we can stop this completely unnecessary wasting of energy in our buildings.
Mr President, we, too, welcome the Commission's vigorous efforts, the legislative programme and the work programme.
The programme brings out the need to adopt measures in the transport sector that are more environmentally friendly; it highlights the Strategic EU Energy Review, the suppression of biodiversity and the marine environment strategy.
We recognise the EU's major contribution so far to the fight against climate change, about which several Members have already spoken.
My only comment with regard to accepting the inevitable period of climate change we will have to undergo is that I disagree.
Rather than accept it, we should put pressure on our partners to comply with the Kyoto Protocol and abide by the post-Kyoto commitments to reduce gas emissions.
We Europeans should also practise what we are constantly preaching.
The European Commission also emphasises health and proposes numerous legislative and non-legislative packages.
Medical insurance and quality of health services, pharmaceutical products, organ transplants, rare diseases and innovative technologies to fight chronic diseases are among the issues that the Commission intends to include in its programme.
The Commission's targets are very ambitious, but we shall have to wait and see their finer detail.
Lastly, I must mention the Health Services Directive.
Under what conditions will the free movement of patients and health professionals be permitted?
How can we avoid a disproportionate burden on health funds?
These are just some of the questions that we will have to consider in connection with this new directive.
Mr President, I welcome the Commission's work programme and I look forward with keen interest to hearing how the EU is going to meet its extremely ambitious greenhouse gas emission and energy targets.
I was recently in Washington having meetings with the members of the Congress.
They are fascinated to hear about our emissions trading system and are talking about cap and trade but they are rather incredulous about how ambitious our targets are.
I am also looking forward with keen interest to hearing how we are going to further develop the common research area.
As President Barroso is not here, I will forbear from commenting on the European Institute of Technology and move on swiftly to mention the Small Business Act, the Commission communication for small businesses, because there are high expectations in the small business community of this proposal.
But I am bound to say that in my Member State it may cause some confusion since a non-legislative action described as an act is possibly something of an oxymoron in UK terms.
Nevertheless, the small business sector is vitally important for our economy, for innovation and flexibility, for creating jobs, and it is to be supported.
But we do have this habit at European level of being strong on rhetoric and weak on actions in support of small business.
(DE) Mr President, the focus on a sustainable Europe arises, among other things, from our priority to protect the climate.
There have been many references today to excessive bureaucracy, over-regulation and the violation of subsidiarity.
It has also been made very clear that these arguments are invariably advanced whenever a new rule or law is unwelcome.
However, in terms of effective climate protection, it is clear that if we had gone ahead 10 years ago and adopted rules to cut CO2 emissions from vehicles, the European Union would now be in a better position and we would not be under the pressure we are now feeling to bring about the effective climate protection that is required.
It is also apparent from the European Commission's various assessments that one of our decisions, namely to cut CO2 emissions by 20% by 2020, could be attained simply through compliance with legislation which is already on the statute books, and so my question to the Commission is this: what specific steps are being taken to monitor the implementation of existing legislation?
I have another question which relates to risk assessment on genetically modified organisms, which is also mentioned in the Commission's work programme.
My question is this: what improvements is the Commission trying to make in this area?
As we know from many debates, this is also one of the main points of criticism of our work and of legislation in this field.
(NL) Mr President, Commissioner, the cohesion and regional policies function on the basis of the regulations with which we established a seven-year framework in 2006.
A total of EUR 350 billion was earmarked for growth and employment, with priority for the Lisbon objectives, and there was a specific goal in mind.
This is all well and good, you may say, but what is missing?
I am missing the Fifth Cohesion Report in the plan for next year: it was promised for June 2008.
The report must lay the foundations for long-term adjustments to the cohesion policy and for our plans regarding the regions and cities.
In our Member States there is a trend towards renationalisation, which Parliament firmly rejects as it covers a whole range of policy areas: R&D, innovation, regional cohesion and rural policy.
In this context, I would like to address Commissioners HÃŒbner and PotoÄnik.
The PPE-DE Group launched the debate on the medium-term approach with a parliamentary hearing last week, quite rightly to look at the question in more depth and to bring the citizens and regions into focus in the coming years.
Finally, the move to make the new Solidarity Fund more flexible, Mr President, has been blocked by the Council, and we would like to see a breakthrough there.
As far as the Commission is concerned, much more support is required.
(DE) Mr President, very briefly, I would like to list what I regard as the most important points arising from this work programme.
Undoubtedly a key theme for 2008 is the Health Check for the common agricultural policy.
The 2003 CAP reform should be reviewed and simplified, we all agree on that, and to that extent I hope, as rapporteur, that the important contributions that we in Parliament make to this own-initiative report will be taken into account in the ensuing legislative proposal.
This Health Check must help us find the right path towards a common agricultural policy for the post-2013 period.
A further project is the planned Green Paper on Agricultural Product Quality.
Quality must become an even greater focus in agriculture, and this applies to farm imports from third countries as well, which must conform to the same standards as those applicable to EU producers.
I am particularly keen on an initiative to promote the consumption of fruit in schools.
This is something which we in the PPE-DE Group have been championing for some time, and we are gratified that the Commission intends to take up this initiative.
Other key issues for 2008 such as the Milk Package, the 2008-2009 Budget Review, the Action Plan on EU Animal Health Strategy and the Review of Support for Less Favoured Areas will certainly make sure that there is no scope for any boredom in Parliament!
(DE) Mr President, the issue of transport and mobility is naturally also viewed as a priority in the programme for 2008.
Of course, we have very clear challenges here.
We must set priorities in 2008 ranging from economic efficiency, impact on the environment and, not least, the rights of users and their safety: issues which can only be touched on briefly here.
The rules on security controls at airports, for example, were introduced in response to pressure from very topical events at the time.
In the PPE-DE Group, we consider that the relevant directive could now be reviewed.
As to passenger rights, this issue could be dealt with conclusively if we were to focus in more detail on the rights of passengers in international coach travel as well.
That would mean that in Europe, passenger rights would be covered in all modes of transport: air travel, rail and road.
As regards trans-European networks, this is a topic which we have discussed on frequent occasions in recent months.
Here, of course, we face a special situation: too little money and a lot of projects, especially now that the Council has announced several new projects in recent weeks.
We take the view that on the issue of trans-European networks, clear decisions must be taken in 2008, and that transboundary routes must have absolute priority so that the so-called bottlenecks disappear, allowing effective application of the principle of multimodal transport.
A swift decision must and could be reached by taking account of those countries where cofinancing is already envisaged and where the projects have got off to a good start on a technical level.
(ES) Mr President, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, in relation to the Commission's common fisheries policy proposals we again face a number of issues the Commission has not followed up as rapidly as it should have.
Suffice to say we are some years behind in securing a new regulation on technical measures in the Atlantic: this is a fundamental aspect for fisheries management that we hoped to secure by 2008, since it would be the best possible contribution by CFP to the goal of simpler legislation.
We would also like the Commission to make a start on issuing precise guidelines as to how it intends to apply the maximum sustainable yield model to EU fisheries, particularly multi-species fisheries.
We feel it is important for specific legislative proposals to be put forward for eco-labelling of fisheries products since this will have significantly improve the traceability of these products and provide guarantees to prevent the consumption and sale of products obtained from illegal fishing.
Finally, following the Commission's announcement that it intends to withdraw the draft agreement with Tanzania, I must pass on the request from the sector that it do all it can to continue negotiations with this country: they are vital to provide the tuna fleet with fishing grounds in this area of Africa through a number of agreements with adjoining exclusive economic zones.
An integrated approach to migration
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, although we are discussing the programme for 2008, I would like to start by pointing out that we have made major progress in the field of home affairs policy in recent months, and I would like to pay tribute to Commissioner Frattini for that.
We have Schengen, and this week in plenary we have taken major steps forward with PrÃŒm, the Visa Information System (VIS) and data protection.
This is major progress.
We cannot leave it at that, however.
Now it is about the practical work for tomorrow.
