Let me analyse this.
I agree that small businesses are important; large multinationals have all the influence, but create jobs outside the EU.
However, I do not believe there is a shortage of small business opportunities, investment capital, or entrepreneurs who would be prepared to take risks in setting up businesses and taking on employees.
So why is this not happening?
And why, when it does happen, do so many fail?
It is because we have gone out of our way to make it hard for them.
Go and talk to small businessmen.
You will hear the same story repeated everywhere: too much red tape and too many rules, particularly those connected with employing people.
These difficulties occur because the whole spirit of the EU is to use centralised direction in a vain attempt to achieve an idealised society by making laws and restricting activity.
Examples of this include the Working Time Directive and the large numbers of rules introduced to uphold various rights, each of which has the major effects of crushing enterprise and enriching lawyers.
The whole ethos is biased against the employer.
We all want high employment and to live in a compassionate, cohesive society. However, this is only possible when we have wealth.
In trying to achieve our ideals by means of coercion, we kill off the source of our wealth.
The whole model is in drastic need of revision.
My colleagues in the other British political parties still cling to the idea that they will be able to persuade the European Union to change its ways.
In the UK Independence Party we have recognised that this will not be possible.
The only way to preserve some prosperity in Britain is to leave the EU.
We want our EU neighbours to prosper too, but when they fail to do so because of blind adherence to a flawed model we would prefer not to be dragged down with them.
Â Â  .
Mr President, we have all seen the success of the internal market, where there is free movement of goods, persons, services and capital.
It is clearly the case that the single European currency system is operating well.
It commands the confidence both of the citizens of Europe and of the business and investor communities.
For the European Union to succeed, there must be broad economic coordination from the 25 Member States.
This is an integral part of the overall strategy to implement the Lisbon process, so as to guarantee that the European Union becomes the most competitive economy in the world by 2010.
However, EU governments are going to have to hammer out an agreement as to how the rules governing economic and monetary union are going to operate into the future.
The bottom line is that some countries are running up serious budget deficits, which is clearly in breach of EMU criteria.
Some countries want the rules governing the operation of the single currency regime to be opened up and made more flexible.
I feel that this is an issue at which EU governments should look carefully so as to ensure that they can build the necessary infrastructure projects in the transport, energy and telecommunications fields.
I am not taking a belligerent approach with regard to the operation of EMU criteria, but we cannot allow the situation to go on forever where countries are running up large budget deficits and are clearly in breach of so-called strict rules governing the operation of the single currency regime.
That undermines the credibility of the overall EMU framework.
If the broader international investor community is to have maximum confidence in economic and monetary union within the EU, the EU must put its house in order.
We have all seen how volatile currency markets can be.
Either all countries comply with the rules and have confidence in the system or we will have a credibility problem with regard to the issue for an indefinite period.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I believe that the report before us is a further sign of the helplessness that has taken hold of the European Union.
There are signs that things are starting to fall apart because of a wide variety of counteracting trends.
Although the internal market is in place, we are lacking everything that we know is required for a reasonable economic policy, by which I mean the need for a minimum of common principles.
The result is the greatest redistribution of financial assets in peacetime history.
This does not only apply to this continent, although the situation here is particularly difficult, because we have a large middle class that is breaking up.
I am therefore sorry to see that this report does not suggest any real approach for counteracting this.
I believe that enlargement has come too soon, and that consequently we are promoting wages dumping, so that very many things we were warned about are now actually happening.
The first approach to adopt must be to create genuine transparency, so as to ensure that these discrepancies are at least clear for all to see.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, we are discussing the Lisbon strategy and how Europe is intended to become the most competitive region in the world.
We have not managed to achieve that over the last five years, and we have now identified the chief culprit: the Stability and Growth Pact!
People are saying that if we scrap the pact Europe will be better off, because that will enable us to make better progress.
I have not heard anyone talking about the homework that needs to be done at national level, and about where the real culprits are to be found â in the Member States.
Germany even believes that it is worth making higher net payments to Europe in return for the abolition of the Stability and Growth Pact.
Commissioner Almunia, your predecessor, the Spanish Socialist MrÂ Solbes, assured this House on several occasions that the Stability and Growth Pact is sufficiently flexible, and I am bound to agree with him.
What I cannot accept is that we should keep the 3% and 60% criteria and then, as Chancellor SchrÃ¶der has done, seek to have certain factors excluded in the run up to or even after the procedure.
This is then sold to us under the Lisbon banner by saying that we no longer can or must take anything growth-intensive into account in the procedure from now on.
It has to be taken into account.
And Germanyâs economists tell us that we will then end up with an 8% or 10% deficit.
The appropriate sanctions are not being applied here.
If we are to take Lisbon seriously, then we first have to take the Stability and Growth Pact seriously, and not use the argument that ten Member States are in breach of it.
I would be delighted if speed limits were applied by saying that if you get caught too often by a speed trap, we will just raise the relevant speed limit so that not so many people are fined in future!
Rules are there to be respected.
We need to take the Lisbon strategy seriously.
We need to take it seriously when framing EU legislation, so that in future every new directive is checked to see whether it conflicts with the Lisbon objectives or promotes them.
The Member States need to make sure that they do not torpedo legislation on the internal market when it is inconvenient for them, and the Commission must take to task those Member States that are at fault.
The Commission should introduce benchmarking and announce this in the clearest possible terms.
We in Europe have to realise that the world is not flat and that we are engaged in global competition.
We need to finally react to this so that people are aware we are taking this subject seriously.
Â Â  â Mr President, MrÂ Karas is no longer here, but I would like to have said to him that I share the view that the EU is a Community of law.
Above the Stability and Growth Pact is the Treaty, in which there is an article, which has not been changed, calling on Member States to consider their economic policy as a matter of common interest.
Accordingly, growth throughout the euro zone is a matter of common interest and I do not feel that the Stability and Growth Pact in its current form is the instrument that we need.
I would say to Mr Radwan that the question before us is not whether we are exceeding the speed limit, but whether we want to drive slowly in a Mercedes, and it strikes me that, at the moment, this is more or less the case with the Stability and Growth Pact.
I should like to make three comments on the Stability and Growth Pact.
Firstly, I feel that a good reform is one that provides the Union with a macroeconomic instrument with which to implement the Lisbon Strategy.
Against this backdrop, the question of âtaking expenditure into accountâ will be high on the agenda.
This is not a matter of opening street market-style negotiations, in which Member States compete to have their demands heard, but of finding where there can be added value for European growth, and only the Commission can tell us this, because the Commission embodies the common European interest.
Secondly, there are those who say that, for accounting reasons, the manner in which one Member State or another pursues structural reforms in the area of retirement could come under the heading of âtaking expenditure into accountâ.
I feel that this is dangerous, given that, again for accounting reasons, this would lead us into debates that go to the heart of national cohesion.
The third point I should like to make is that, in terms of the way in which we assess the situation in the Member States, it cannot in fact be said that everything takes place on a level playing field.
The economic situation, as regards the Stability and Growth Pact, has a different meaning depending on the size of the country; it is inadequate to say that all Member States are alike when it comes to the Pact.
Everyone in economic circles now accepts âÂ although it remains frowned upon to say this in political circlesÂ â that the impact of using the budgetary instrument varies according to the size of a countryâs economy.
At the moment, two countries such as France and Germany are in a situation in which they are both responsible for and the victim of a state of affairs that no Member State, in the euro zone or in the EU as a whole, is taking advantage of.
It is in nobodyâs interest to see the economy of the euro zone weighed down by weak growth in the main economy of the euro zone.
This runs counter both to the Treaty and to the Member Statesâ common interest.
Â Â  Thank you Mr President.
I would like to say that at the moment we are debating two documents at the same time, which have in essence been prepared splendidly and which complement each other.
They must form an economic foundation for the Stability and Growth Pact, for a third group of documents which we are debating and, you see, perhaps it would be worthwhile considering that if we wish to send a clear message to our citizens, the citizens of the European Union, the business community, and ultimately the international community, then perhaps we should devote more attention to some of the provisions in one document, which would lay the foundation for macroeconomic stability, the Stability and Growth Pact.
It would be naive to think that we can maintain or consolidate the Stability and Growth Pact with some legal provisions or criteria.
I say this with fifteen years of experience of the reforms which my country has implemented.
We must not look for differences, if we wish to implement reforms, we must look for consensus.
I believe that there are four points on which we can agree and our experience of reforms tells us that these may have a positive influence on economics.
First of all we must devote attention to the investment required for productivity, because we need a particular kind of investment.
We must devote attention to structural reforms, however these are impossible without fiscal measures.
As unemployment appears during structural reforms, support is needed, but one cannot devote all one's attention to support alone, as otherwise the budget cannot be sustained.
We must devote attention to the expansion of new businesses, that is we must try to simplify tax administration, so that minor companies and small business can work successfully in Europe.
As for the fourth and most complicated point â we must be aware that cheap goods are pouring into Europe, we are surrounded by cheap manufacturing countries and we must begin to think about how we can reduce taxes, of course without upsetting the macroeconomic balance, because much can be achieved, as our experience of reforms has shown, through the implementation of better tax administration.
It is no surprise that many countries encounter problems with profit transfer and value added tax reduction, however there are many ways to administer taxes better and reduce the burden of taxation, as the experience of our countries shows.
I believe that this is the most successful way to use the knowledge we have accumulated.
Thank you.
Â Â  â Mr President, the reports on public finances in EMU and the state of the European economy do not under any circumstances take account of grass-roots problems which are common to the workers of the Member States in that their cause is the same: the anti-grass roots policy of the European Union.
The fact that these are common problems is clear from the workers' demonstrations being held in most countries against the cost of living, unemployment, low wages, redundancies, the privatisation of the health, education and welfare sectors, longer working times, insecurity and uncertainty about the future.
The rapporteurs, instead of replying to the foregoing, support stricter compliance with the Stability Pact, with extortionate tax and anti-grass roots austerity programmes to combat deficits.
In other words, it is always the workers who pay, never the plutocracy.
At the same time, they are calling for the anti-grass roots Lisbon strategy to be applied quickly, in order to promote greater exploitation of labour through part-time and temporary work, longer working hours, later retirement, the abolition of government participation in social security and the circumvention of collective agreements.
This is the new redistribution of wealth, with even greater benefit for big business and even more inequality and injustice.
They call for the European economy â by which they mean the profitability of the European monopolies â to be invigorated with new, harsher, more anti-grass roots austerity measures and for the workers to make greater sacrifices, for their own good, while demanding that governments reduce even the minimal social spending which remains and make immediate changes to insurance and pension systems which, as they say, are inadequate.
These are the European Union philosophies and policies which cause the workers to express their feelings by staying away from elections, such as the European elections, for which there was a 40% turnout, or the recent referendum in Spain on the so-called European Constitution, for which there was a 35-40% turnout.
These are signs which express the workers' feelings of indifference and that is why they are turning their back on the European Union.
However, the best response is a fight in the form of organised disobedience to this policy and a counter-attack designed to bring about its radical change.
Â Â  MrÂ President, growth in the EU is clearly below what it potentially could be.
The EU has high unemployment; it has a current account surplus in respect of other countries; and the figure for inflation is lower than that aimed for under monetary policy.
As the report emphasises, there is a great need for structural reforms.
The report does not, however, do enough to emphasise quite a few countriesâ need for a more expansive policy.
One cause of the unduly restrictive policy is the way in which the Stability and Growth Pact has been designed.
In my opinion, it is wrongly constructed, which leads to an unduly restrictive policy in certain countries.
The mistake lies in focusing too much upon the budget deficit. Instead, the focus should be on the debt ratio.
A country with a debt ratio of less than 60% of GDP and which keeps inflation below 2% will have a decreasing debt ratio if its economy grows in real terms by one percentage point or more and if the budget deficit amounts to 3%.
If a countryâs economy grows by 5% and if inflation is at 2%, the nominal GDP will increase by 7%.
The budget deficit could, then, amount to 7%, and the debt ratio would be stable in the case of such a deficit.
Such a country would not put any strain on the eurozone.
The increase in debt would be stable and therefore defensible in the long term.
The country ought probably to have a sound credit rating and ought not to constitute any credit risk for the eurozone as a whole.
Such a budget deficit is defensible in the long term.
A limited deficit of 3% means that the national debt is continually decreasing as a percentage of GDP.
Because a debt ratio of 60% of GDP is reasonable in economic terms, there is no reason to force such a financial restriction upon the country.
It is only natural for new, rapidly growing countries to have significant deficits in their balance of current payments and capital imports.
Private savings may perhaps not be sufficient; the state too may have a budget deficit.
The conclusion to be drawn from this is that countries with debt ratios of less than 60% of GDP and with inflation under control should be allowed to grow more quickly and to conduct a more expansive policy.
In this way, the whole of the EU would be given a boost.
I recommend that the Stability and Growth Pact be altered along these lines.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the need for reform of the Stability Pact is also clear from the report on public finances in EMU.
The Pact undoubtedly has an important role in terms of stability, but also needs to act as a stimulus to growth.
We are aware that Ministers at the Ecofin Council meeting are preparing the text for the reform, but Parliament must not opt out of the debate.
It would therefore be desirable, prior to the final decision by the Council, for Parliament to have an opportunity to express its views on the procedures for reform of the Pact by holding a debate on the subject.
Since the debate in September, Parliament appears to have adopted a passive stance, whereas it should instead be exercising a key role in the reform process, above all allowing all Members and groups to give a clear outline of the possible strategies.
We have to be practical and realistic.
We cannot state in our documents that we have to become the most competitive economy in the world, while at the same time the figures are clearly showing growth to be stagnating.
The Pact therefore has to be reformed.
I refer to more flexible ways of applying the Pact during periods of economic difficulty, to the need to give due credit for the structural reforms undertaken by Member States, and, possibly, to allow expenditure on investments in support of the â still remote â objectives of the Lisbon strategy to be excluded.
To conclude, I believe Parliament must resume an active role in this debate, as the only institution directly representing the citizens of the Union.
Â Â  Mr President, the rapporteur, Mr Goebbels, laments the lack of coordination of economic policies.
I agree with that, but I reach a different conclusion.
Without those coordination rules, making the Stability Pact more flexible would be equivalent to breaking it and breaking the Stability Pact would mean neutralising the Central Bankâs efforts to maintain prices, it would mean rises in interest rates, it would mean a delay in growth, which is what we all want, a delay in the implementation of the structural reforms and, more dangerously, a serious threat to the welfare state.
The resources we spend on paying interests and paying off public debt will mean less resources for guaranteeing finances.
What we need at the moment is more employment and more productivity.
More employment, above all, means paying attention to those sectors of the population with most difficulties and we know that they are women, young people between 15 and 25 years old and people over 55.
And more productivity means more investment, more effort in investment and development and more effort in education and professional training with a view to increasing the productivity of work.
The Commissionerâ speech also reminds me â to quote Mr Goebbels once again â of those speeches of the defunct Soviet Union that said that the transition to socialism would inevitably end the following year.
When they became aware that that transition was possible, they concluded that the transition was complete and that they had already arrived at communism.
A few years later the Iron Curtain fell.
There is no need to weaken macroeconomic stability, but it is essential that we continue to insist more strongly, more vigorously, on structural reforms as the only guarantee, the only serious formula, for achieving growth.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, MrÂ Karas said earlier that we are dealing here with decisions about our future direction, and he is quite right there.
However, you can only make decisions about your direction if you can see the horizon.
To be capable of making decisions about future direction, you have to be up to date in your analysis and your proposals, and I can tell most of the Members in the Conservative group that they, of all people, are not up to date with their proposals in these two reports, and not in a position to see the horizon.
You know very well that the Economic Policy Guidelines are the most tedious document to emerge from Brussels year after year.
So what are your proposals in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs to modernise this instrument?
Where is your contribution to a meaningful debate?
Structural reforms, I hear you say!
Quite right!
Europe and its Member States need structural reforms.
But you know very well that structural reforms can only work, and can only lead to more growth and higher employment if they form part of an active industrial policy, part of an active policy for small and medium-sized enterprises and part of a budgetary policy appropriate to our economic situation.
I feel like weeping when I look at your proposals.
You should read your texts through once before you adopt them, that would be a great help!
You want a general reduction in the level of taxation.
It would be better if you were to discuss a decent policy for SMEs with us rather than putting this sort of nonsense in your reports.
You want everyone to work longer hours.
Why not help us to increase the employment rate, so that more people are in work?
Europe stands to gain more from that.
That is why you can only hope to get our agreement if you vote for some reasonable amendments.
Otherwise we cannot support this nonsense.
Â Â  â Mr President, the EUâs economic policy is currently made up of three elements: a platonic ambition â the Lisbon Strategy; a despised constraint â public spending controls; andÂ a demand that has been ignored â support for purchasing power.
The Lisbon Strategy is a platonic ambition.
Who could not support the objectives set in Lisbon?
Who could not be in favour of a knowledge-based economy, of better training for people, of progress in research and development and of an innovation-based society?
Who would not be in favour of these objectives?
Who, on the other hand, cannot see that the term open cooperation is an empty shell?
Open cooperation is nothing but the free policy of States that, from time to time, make imaginary appointments with the European Union, and the Council, the Commission and Parliament are reduced to institutions of comment and disapproval.
We will not win the game this way.
Controls on public spending are a despised constraint.
Behind a supposed dispute between Keynesians and liberals on the issues of the instruments of short-term economic policy and the use of public spending, for 25 years we have seen public spending spiral out of control and systematic deterioration, in a number of large countries, particularly in terms of debt, which prevents our children from taking control of their own futures.
This is tantamount to death, or the past, taking away life, or the future.
The European Central Bank (ECB) stands unjustly accused in this case.
What do we blame the ECB for?
We blame it for excessively high interest rates, yet they have never been so low since the war; and for the policy of an excessively strong euro, a situation that has obviously been brought about by US policies of systematic deficit and not by the supposed good qualities of the Europeans.
The truth is that the ECB scarcely has the resources.
Then there is the Stability and Growth Pact, which is an instrument to be reformed.
What do we blame the Stability and Growth Pact for?
We blame it for being stupid and malicious.
If this is the case, then let us endeavour to make it less stupid, whilst retaining its binding nature.
I shall finish, Mr President, by mentioning a demand that had been ignored â stimulating purchasing power.
Who cannot see that we are currently in a system in which employees have less and less money and purchasing power in comparison with shareholders?
There are potential remedies, such as spreading share ownership and reducing taxes for workers, yet these remedies are ignored.
My fear, Mr President, is that the institutions and the EU will be reduced to being the chorus in a classical tragedy in which the actual protagonists are the national governments.
Â Â  â In light of the reality of the deteriorating economic and social situation in most EU countries, the Stability and Growth Pact is finally being called into question, albeit late in the day, and only when France and Germany have failed to comply.
Better late than never, though.
Unfortunately, the perspectives that have been set out for the 8 March ECOFIN Council will mean more of the same when they come to be implemented.
The so-called flexible application of the Stability and Growth Pact would depend on a countryâs greater or lesser capacity to place at risk public social security, pension and health systems and, as some people have pointed out, public administration reforms.
In other words, the more a Member State implements policies and objectives enshrined in the Lisbon Strategy that we consider extremely onerous, the greater its flexibility to implement the Stability Pact, and this would be unacceptable.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I will not be able to explore the subject in depth in the short time available to me, so I shall merely highlight a number of issues.
Firstly, the money and energy that are being wasted on excessive and all too often absurd bureaucracy represent a major constraint on the EUâs economic development.
Secondly, there should be a thorough study of the tax systems in the Member States, with one of the aims of the exercise being to find out whether the VAT system currently in force is the best solution.
There may well be other more effective taxes, and indeed experience has taught us that this is the case.
Thirdly, a systematic analysis of the economic situation of the EU as a whole and of the individual Member States must be carried out every three or four years and feedback given, in order both to identify any progress achieved and to make it possible to react quickly enough to any problems.
Fourthly, there is a severe lack of funding for research aimed at fostering economic development.
Finally, I should like to turn to an issue that has not yet been touched upon.
All this intense economic debate and all the ever so clever schemes proposed and which have given rise to such concern will be so much hot air unless real steps are taken to prevent the impending demographic disaster in the EU.
I am not making empty threats.
Members of this House need only stir themselves to look at the population statistics.
Although these do not make easy reading, there is no mistaking the warning they contain.
Whereas today there are four persons of working age to support every person of retirement age, in 30Â years' time two persons will have to do so, and the question arises as to whether this is feasible.
We should not forget that the family, which includes both parents and children, is the most basic economic unit.
The 1992 Nobel Prize winner Gary Becker has gone so far as to say that the family, and work carried out within the family, account for as much as 30% of national income.
The French economic Jean-Didier Lecaillon has made similar comments, and I could give examples of others, notably by John PaulÂ II, whose voice carries particular weight.
Charles de Gaulle is recognised by all as a true statesman, and he was entirely serious when he said that if you are poor and have no other options, you must invest in the family. .
I thank you.
Â Â  Mr President, this report provides a host of proposals to do away with the deficit that was created when the Lisbon strategy was carried out.
I would specifically like to express my appreciation for paragraph 7 of the report, which underlines the important role that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) actually play in the creation of jobs and prosperity in general.
It is of major importance that a climate be created which encourages the entrepreneurial spirit among young people, a climate in which the administrative burden and the tax burden are substantially reduced and in which SMEs have easier access to risk capital.
Another conclusion is that the report does not breathe a word about the Commissionâs Green Paper on economic immigration.
That is just as well, certainly in view of the current level of unemployment.
The Commissionâs plea to admit and stimulate new immigration is blinkered, counterproductive, but also totally misplaced, even though the Commission refers to the Lisbon objectives to table that proposal.
Â Â  â Mr President, my fellow members of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will certainly be delighted to know, given the nature of this debate, that Mr Goebbels opened up to the Luxembourg press, saying that their amendments adopted in committee reflected the âfundamentally reactionary and neoliberal nature of these two groups in Parliamentâ.
The outlandish nature of these words has, of course, a somewhat laughable element: it suggests that this House is, at the very least, made up of hardcore reactionaries.
Yet there is also reason to be concerned about these words.
In this House, the Socialist Group willingly cultivates a certain degree of ambiguity when it comes to the principles of economic policy.
With the socialists, this ambiguity turns to actual loathing.
Personally, I do not think it is superfluous to point out in this debate that the conditions for sound, sustainable development are created by sound public finance and by reasonable compulsory deductions.
Stability is not an obstacle to growth; it is a prerequisite to growth.
On our side of this House, we do not succumb to the same weakness for ideological blindness. We show much greater pragmatism.
There are situations in which more interventionist policies turn out to be necessary in order to reinvigorate the economy, but that is not the point here. The current situation in which Europe finds itself scarcely fits into that pattern.
Having discovered Keynesianism a little too late, MrÂ Goebbels would like to bring it into all recipes and all sauces, even when it is not called for.
Increasing supplementary budget deficits does not provide a solution to our current problems.
If this were the case, the countries known for their financial and budgetary slackness would have long since been held up as the example to follow.
Lastly, it is not a crime to say that Europeans have a duty to work harder and better in order to guarantee their standard of living in the face of global competition, MrÂ Bullmann.
The exemplary nature of the French 35-hour week says more than any lengthy discourse on the subject.
Of course, Mr Goebbels put forward a number of good ideas in his report âÂ such as encouraging certain types of investment in social services or in sustainable developmentÂ â but he seems ill at ease with the crux of the issue, which is that economic efficiency follows clearly defined rules and that it is dangerous to overlook them.
Â Â  MrÂ President, firstly, I should like to say how sorry I am that the representative of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, MrÂ HÃ¶kmark, has left the debate.
I believe that the proposal arrived at by the committee is unacceptable for us Social Democrats for three reasons.
Firstly, no general increase in working time is required.
What we need is more people in work, not a general increase in working time.
Secondly, a comprehensive reduction in tax in Europe would not solve the problems.
How can it be that the Nordic countries, which have the heaviest burden of taxation, have the highest growth in the EU?
This suggests that the PPE-DE Group has completely lost the plot.
Thirdly, we need a balance in the Lisbon Process.
Those making the proposal, as it now stands, are even worse than the Commission in the way that, in general, they emphasise only the first pillar of the Lisbon Process when what is required is reciprocity between the pillars.
I share the view that structural reforms are needed, but what is most important is that, in the process, social responsibility should be accepted and both sides of industry involved.
MrÂ HÃ¶kmark comes from Sweden, where his party is nowadays cosying up to the Social Democrats.
In the national debate at home, they do not talk about tax reductions or an increase in working time.
They do so in this House, however.
Sweden has had an extremely successful economic policy during the post-War period, with the single exception of during the years 1991â1994.
MrÂ HÃ¶kmark was one of Swedenâs policymakers at that time.
It would be regrettable if the PPE-DE Group were to adopt this neo-liberal policy and make it its own.
The result would be political antagonism.
We Social Democrats want to see a balanced, rather than a neo-liberal, policy.
A neo-liberal policy will not solve Europeâs problems.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, this is the first time we have ever been faced with a situation in which a majority of Member States, or in other words 13 out of 25, are outside the euro zone instead of within it.
Interest rates in Europe are also at their lowest levels since the Second World War, and yet this is not acting as any kind of incentive to investment.
We need to recognise the fact that the eurozone is experiencing slow economic growth.
We already know that domestic consumption will remain low for the next two years, and this is true for the EU as a whole.
At the same time, since enlargement there has been a significant rise in the economic aspirations of citizens, and in particular of those in the new EU Member States, such as my country, Poland.
These aspirations are at odds with a poor economic situation in which it is impossible to meet consumersâ expectations.
In political terms this may result in a rise in Euroscepticism over time, and indeed this is made all the more likely by the fact that all projections, including those quoted in the Goebbels report, suggest that unemployment levels will remain high in the immediate future.
EU citizens expect the real economic growth they have repeatedly been promised in recent years, for example at EU summits.
Yet they also expect justice and equal treatment for all Member States.
By condoning large budget deficits in countries such as Germany or France, but coming down heavily on other weaker and poorer countries if they dare to have a deficit, the EU is putting into practice an idea familiar to us from Orwellâs âAnimal Farmâ, namely that all men are equal, but some are more equal than others.
This does nothing to bolster the EUâs authority in the eyes of the other Member States.
In short, it is a scandal.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking my colleagues Mr Goebbels and Mr Karas for their work in preparing the reports on public finances.
As we know, growth in the EU has not been as good as we expected.
The decrease in the share of GDP used for private and public investments in comparison with the 1970s is drastic, as our colleague Mr Karas described.
Due to a lack of structural reforms and low investment, growth in GDP is not satisfactory.
However, we cannot rely only on public investment to stimulate growth: we must give incentives to stimulate private investment, which is the real source of sustainable growth in Europe.
At the heart of this debate is the future of the Stability and Growth Pact.
The goal of the Pact was to balance the budgets of Member States and to create budget surpluses by 2003.
The idea behind this was for the Member States to pay off their debts in the good times and to ensure, by reforming the structures of the public sector, that their budgets could be kept balanced in the bad times as well.
However, it is not easy for us politicians to restrain ourselves from increasing spending in good times.
Unfortunately this shows in the poor results of many Member States with regard to the Pact.
I am strongly in favour of the Pact.
The Member States who have done their share and have kept their public finances in check â especially my country, Finland â have to suffer as a result of the irresponsibility of the Member States that just do not care!
Unfortunately it now seems inevitable that some elements of flexibility will be added to the Pact.
However, we should be wary of watering down the Pact.
Three issues should be kept in mind.
Firstly, the rules should be same for all Member States and the criteria should be objective.
Secondly, no expenditure, such as public investments or research funding, should be automatically excluded from public expenditure: these exceptions would provide an opportunity for Member States to interpret them in a very innovative way.
Thirdly, the flexibility accorded to the Member States should be bound to reforms they have carried out in good times.
It is only fair that those Member States that have paid their debts and have reduced their deficits should have some flexibility, but those who have not done anything should not be given any more room for manoeuvre.
I hope that good common sense will win out and that the Stability and Growth Pact will remain; and, if any changes are made to it, at least let us direct them in a favourable direction.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, the proposed changes to the Stability and Growth Pact are intended to make tax rules within the European Union more flexible and practical, whilst upholding the fundamental principle of budgetary discipline.
I believe these changes are a step in the right direction, but I should like to highlight three related issues.
Firstly, the Commission proposals mainly focus on current budget deficit, whilst attaching less importance to public debt.
I believe that the opposite should be the case, as the most important factor determining long-term financial stability is the size of the debt in relation to gross national product, and not the deficit in any given year.
This means that tighter deficit limits should be set for countries with very high levels of debt than for those with low levels of debt.
The latter can afford to run a higher deficit on a short-term basis, and should not be punished for having stuck to the rules in the past.
Levels of debt should therefore be a more important criterion than current deficit.
Secondly, the method used to calculate deficits must make allowance for the particular situation of those of the new Member States that have embarked upon the difficult task of reforming their pension systems.
In these countries, expenditure associated with these reforms has risen on a temporary basis because it is necessary both to finance current pensions and to establish pension funds for future generations.
This expenditure should not be treated as current public expenditure for the purposes of the Stability and Growth Pact, as it does not increase current demand, but instead contributes to national savings.
New Member States should not be punished for carrying out difficult structural reforms.
Thirdly, I should like to suggest to the Commissioner that consideration be given to excluding expenditure associated with payments into the EU budget when establishing the principles according to which deficits will be calculated for the purposes of the Stability and Growth Pact.
Although it is true that such expenditure increases demand throughout the EU, it also helps implement the key principle of solidarity.
Such a solution could also make it easier to reach a compromise on the size of the European Unionâs budget for 2007-2013.
I would note that one of the reasons why certain Member States are calling for a âsmallâ budget is because they are net contributors to the EU budget.
Many thanks.
Â Â  â Mr President, we are talking about competitiveness, but competitiveness relates directly to currency exchange rates.
We have allowed the euro to become overpriced in relation to the dollar.
It has risen from 0.84 to 1.30, causing extensive damage to our competitiveness.
The Central Bank has basically sacrificed competitiveness, where we are lagging behind, in order to reinforce stability, where we are fine.
In other words, we have protected the point at which we are strong and left the point at which we are weak exposed.
Thus, the expensive euro has exacerbated the recession.
The recession has reduced the inclination of companies to take investment risks and adopt innovations.
In other words, what good is the Lisbon strategy?
Look at what the Americans, Russians, Chinese and Indians are doing.
While all our competitors are focusing on competitiveness and growth, we are focussing on waste and debt.
All of them are achieving higher returns than us, while we are wallowing in chronic recession.
Perhaps we should start to question our economic policy mix?
As long as the present mix continues, the Lisbon strategy and the Stability Pact will become more and more mutually incompatible.
Keep the Lisbon strategy, but make sure the monetary policy applied by the Central Bank also helps.
Keep the Stability Pact, as long as the emphasis is on restraining expenditure, not increasing income.
The European Central Bank needs to relax monetary policy so that the Member States can tighten up their public finance policy, especially on the spending side.
Then, whatever active demand loses in public spending, it will gain from increased exports and we shall avoid tax increases.
This is a policy mix that combines prudence and growth but, if we are to achieve it, the Central Bank also has to cooperate.
Of course we need prudence, but prudence is one thing and inflexibility is another.
As long as we confuse prudence with inflexibility, we shall have neither prudence, nor growth nor competitiveness.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I refer to the Goebbels report and would like to congratulate our fellow Member on his excellent approach to the topic, with its focus on striking a balance between the obvious need to revitalise economic and growth policy in Europe and the aim of stability and the conditions for achieving it.
However, during the course of the debate, this balance has been lost and can only be restored if we behave reasonably, as recommended by Mrs Lulling earlier.
It is not reasonable to approve a report which does not face up to the need for greater coordination of the economic policies of Member States, nor can we agree that a statement of this sort goes against the autonomy of the monetary authorities.
It is not reasonable to approve a report which makes no reference to reform of the Stability Pact and its link with the Lisbon objectives, at a time when we are patently moving towards an agreement.
It is not reasonable to state that a general reduction in the tax burden is vital for competitiveness, if we look at the excellent results of countries with both heavy and light tax burdens.
In any event, I wonder if the European Parliament should really be recommending a general and generic cut in taxes when no Member State would consider such a proposal credible in current circumstances.
Similarly, no one would reasonably state that a general and generic increase in working hours would be viable or effective.
Linking the liberalisation and improvement of services too closely with their privatisation only risks increasing resistance to any process aimed at liberalising the market.
To conclude, I believe the document contains some important pointers and is a creditable effort, but on certain issues the balance needs to be restored, leaving ideological claims aside and thereby making a useful contribution to the debate on the economy now being conducted throughout Europe.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the Member States have committed themselves to bringing their budgets close to balance or into surplus.
That is a commitment under the Stability and Growth Pact, and countries such as Germany have breached it by running up deficits.
Although they give cyclical problems as their excuse, they have failed to make the necessary structural reforms.
What the then German Finance Minister Theo Waigel secured agreement to in 1997 in the interests of Europe was a seriously meant guarantee of stable prices, budgetary discipline and the ability to react to structural changes, such as the need to finance a society with an increasingly elderly age profile.
This was not about neo-liberal politics of the left, it was also in the interests of the workforce.
The Luxembourg Presidency announced a modification of the pact, not any easy task.
Berlin wants to abolish the excessive deficit procedure, while the smaller countries in the euro area are quite rightly insisting that this pact should be observed to the letter.
They have done their homework.
Mr Juncker told the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs that there was no question of changing the 3% threshold and the excessive deficit procedure.
I am also in favour of the Commission keeping its powers in this area, from sending âblue lettersâ to imposing fines.
You, unfortunately, have announced an âintelligent interpretationâ of the pact.
Does that not represent a watering down?
You quite rightly said that Greece must be held to account if it again submits falsified data.
Please correct me if I am wrong, but, shortly afterwards, you led the Germans to believe that they could treat the cost of reconstructing the East as a special liability that could be taken out of the calculation.
At that, other countries came along and said that their own investment in education, military installations or infrastructure should also be excluded.
Once you enter the realms of creative accounting in this way, you can relegate the pact to the waste paper bin.
You are just juggling figures and not providing any guarantee to Europeâs citizens.
I support my colleague Mr Karasâ excellent report; we must not play fast and loose with confidence in the euro.
Â Â  MrÂ President, this is a constructive report by MrÂ Goebbels and the committee that presented it.
I also wish to thank Commissioner Almunia for a thoughtful contribution and for his commitment to a reform of the Stability and Growth Pact, as presented.
My contribution in this House today will focus upon two of the most important issues for Europe.
The Conservatives and Liberals here in Parliament focus upon structural reforms â about which we are prepared to negotiate, I should like to say â not only in the European Parliament but also in our individual states.
The Socialist Group in the European Parliament, of which I am the President, does not oppose reforms.
We want to see the correct reforms.
I would add one thing, however: Europeâs main problems do not only include the need for structural reforms; its second big problem is that demand in our countries is too low.
I would make a genuine and urgent appeal to the leaders of the right-of-centre European parties.
My personal experience as a prime minister and as a party president in Europe is that we do not get our peopleâs support for reforms if there is not simultaneous demand and growth in our societies; or, to put it another way: there can be no successful reforms without economic growth, and no sustainable economic growth without reforms.
I would therefore make a very urgent appeal for the European dimension to be introduced.
What is the European dimension?
What the European dimension genuinely involves is our learning to do things simultaneously.
There is a shortage of demand in the internal market, and this is something that we can remedy at the same time if all the finance ministers, together with MrÂ Almunia, decide to invest in the Lisbon objectives over the next four years.
In that way, we should obtain the extra growth we need.
We have documented matters, and it would be fantastic if the right-of-centre parties too here in Parliament could appreciate that we must invest and that we must implement reforms and that we must do these things simultaneously.
Â Â  Mr President, I agree with the analyses expressed here this morning insisting on Europeâs need for more growth and more employment.
More growth to confront the challenges facing us as Europeans: the challenge of enlargement, the challenge of creating jobs for our women and young people.
More growth so that Europe can play the leading role it deserves in the world economy, since, otherwise, the world economy will not have balanced growth.
As MrÂ Rasmussen has just emphasised, that means that European consumers and European investors need more confidence, they need confidence policies, policies, in short, on which to base their consumption and investment decisions.
In turn, that confidence requires healthy public finances and budgetary balance.
Budgetary balance means less taxes for workers and for small and medium-sized businesses, less taxes in order to compete more successfully within the globalised world economy.
Making the Stability Pact more flexible would be a grave error and, Mr Almunia, Commissioner, the press coverage of the debates in Ecofin are not inspiring confidence; the confrontation amongst European governments in relation to promoting the flexibility of the Stability Pact sends a negative message in terms of the confidence of the markets.
Together with a firm Stability Pact, we need structural reforms.
We need a more flexible economy, not ultimately one that is good for the few, but a balanced economy which supports our growth on the basis of flexibility and competitiveness.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr Rasmussen said that reforms are not possible without economic growth.
The reverse is also true: economic growth in Europe is not possible without reforms.
Particularly in Germany and France, which are major states with an excessively high government activity rate, high taxes and overly complex social systems, reforms are a prerequisite for economic growth.
We are today discussing the Goebbels and Karas reports, in which the difficulties we face with a common monetary policy combined with decentralised budgetary and finance policies become apparent.
The Stability and Growth Pact was created as a linking mechanism and as a prerequisite.
The political intention to reform the Stability and Growth Pact will shake the very foundations of the Maastricht Treaty and of European monetary union.
The budget policy rules are among the cornerstones of Economic and Monetary Union.
The citizens of Europe were given an undertaking that state borrowing would be reduced, an undertaking that after just six years is being reneged upon.
The objective of these rules is to maintain credibility and trust regardless of the government in power at any given time.
There is, however, a serious design flaw in the Stability and Growth Pact, one on which you, Commissioner, have repeatedly failed to comment.
Where the monitoring procedure is concerned, the Commission has too few powers and responsibilities.
The guilty parties are sitting in judgment on themselves, which does not bode well.
If the ECOFIN Council does not apply the rules to itself, the Commission is powerless.
If there is no will to apply budgetary discipline, reforms will not help either.
This is not just a question of rules, but also of political will.
The Commission wants to introduce new rules for economically good times.
There may be some justification for that, but it is naÃ¯ve.
If the existing means of bringing pressure to bear do not work, how can we expect this to work voluntarily when the economic situation is favourable?
The Social Democrats and the Communists have failed to understand the changes that the euro has brought about.
Before the euro existed, the market punished highly indebted states in an open and easily understandable way, by means of high interest rates for government borrowing, high inflation rates and devaluation.
As recently as 1992 there were differences of six percentage points.
Just listen, please!
You know I am right.
Six percentage points!
That difference no longer exists.
There are no longer market forces that compel states to adhere to financial discipline.
Unless the ECB tackles this problem by means of a system of differentiated assessment of state loans, the euro will not remain stable in the long run.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to thank all the honourable Members who have spoken for their contributions to the debate, which I have found very interesting.
I would like to conclude by reiterating the Commissionâs analysis.
At several points during the debate, thoughts have been attributed to the Commission that neither I nor the Commission agree with.
The Commission and I believe that the main challenge in terms of increasing growth in the European Union and in the eurozone is to increase the growth potential.
That requires structural reforms such as those the Commission has proposed in its Communication on the review and revitalisation of the Lisbon Strategy.
If we do not increase the growth potential, the medium- and long-term sustainability of our economy and our social model will not be possible and short-term macroeconomic stability and budgetary stability will be seriously jeopardised by the lack of growth.
So that is our analysis and, on that basis, macroeconomic policy, as the Kok report states â and I completely agree on this point â must support a strategy of structural reforms which increases growth potential in order to sustain that growth and in order to prevent the lack of liquidity, funding and demand from jeopardising our ability to take advantage of all the growth possibilities that we have achieved as a result of the reforms.
The Commission believes success in the revitalisation of the Lisbon strategy to be a priority and to this end we have proposed ten priorities and we have considered how to improve the capacity of each of the Member States to implement the Lisbon strategy in accordance with their particular situations, so that we can achieve the objectives we all agree on in all of those states and throughout the European Union.
These objectives have not been reduced in the Commission's communication, and have been confirmed just as they were defined five years ago.
With regard to the Stability Pact, Mr President, I would like to make a few clarifications.
I believe we should understand what is happening over the current few weeks, during which the Council, with the support of the Commission by means of the excellent cooperation with the Luxembourg Presidency, is trying to reach an agreement in order to improve the way we apply our budgetary discipline mechanisms in practice and in order to ensure that the objectives pursued by the Treaty, where it defines budgetary stability as one of the conditions of the Economic and Monetary Union, become a more positive and obvious reality than they are at the moment.
What are we doing?
Firstly, we are reiterating our firm and clear commitment to the reference values laid down in the Treaty.
3% is laid down in the Treaty and the Commission will ensure that that reference value is respected.
I would like to make it clear once again, and I will continue to do so whenever necessary, that neither the Commission's proposal nor the currently unanimous position of all the Ecofin ministers, proposes excluding any category of spending from the calculation of the deficit.
What we are considering, in accordance with Article 104 of the Treaty, is what important factors should be taken into account when analysing why there has been excessive deficit and what should be done in order to recover the situation of balance, the sustainability of the public finances, in order to bring the level of deficit below the reference value.
It is possible to distinguish, as we are doing precisely in this debate, between not excluding any category of spending and at the same time taking into account economic factors, from the composition of public spending, the situation of the cycle, the structural reforms underway, in order to see how the preventive part of the pact is applied, how public finances stand in terms of medium- and long-term balance or, in terms of the excessive deficit procedure, what recommendations are truly effective in terms of a country in a situation of excessive deficit recovering its budgetary balance.
To this end, it is extremely important, and this is the second key element in our discussion, to prevent the application of the pact leading in practice to pro-cyclic policies, both in the preventive part and in the corrective part of the excessive deficit procedure.
One of the most obvious reasons why certain countries have broken the 3% of deficit rule is that, when they were at positive points in their economic cycle, they did not apply pro-cyclic policies, they did not sufficiently consolidate their public finances, and there are instruments in the Treaty such as early warnings, which furthermore are strengthened in the Constitution and directly attributed to the Commission, which must be used more effectively.
Furthermore, each Member State must establish national rules which supplement the peer pressure on those making decisions at national level on the composition of revenue and budgetary spending and thus the budgetary deficit of each of the Member States, which, I would remind you, is still a national competence, although, as Mrs BerÃšs said, the combined result of those national budgetary policy decisions is of common interest, since we are in an Economic and Monetary Union.
With regard to the excessive deficit procedure, and this is the most difficult point in our discussion, we are discussing how that procedure should be launched.
I shall reiterate our position: no spending will be excluded from the calculation of the level of deficit.
But if you read Article 104 of the Treaty once again, you will see that, once the European Commission informs the Council that a certain country is, in its judgement, in a situation of excessive deficit, the Council has full powers, following an overall assessment â Article 104(6) of the Treaty â to decide ââwhether an excessive deficit existsâ.
We are trying to ensure that the criteria the Commission uses when informing the Council that a country is in a situation of excessive deficit coincide with the criteria the Council then uses, in order to prevent any further clashes such as those which have occurred in the past.
So that while respecting the functions and competences of the Commission â and the Commission is not going to give up any of the competences attributed to it by the Treaty â and also those of the Council â which is not going to give up any of the competences attributed to it by the Treaty either â within the context of that relationship, that cooperation, there are no clashes which paralyse the procedure, leading to conflicts such as those which arose just over a year ago.
Governance is very important.
It is very important that there be national rules which complement the ownership efforts of the Member States in relation to the common budgetary discipline rules.
It is very important that we have clear, reliable and accurate statistics, as we have seen recently.
It is very important that there be cooperation between the two institutions, the Council and the Commission, and it is extremely important that there be support and debate in Parliament, such as the one taking place today, and there will undoubtedly be further such debates in the future.
It is very important that we reach an agreement.
You have mentioned, and I share this concern, the credibility of the Economic and Monetary Union and, in particular, the credibility of our single currency on the markets.
The markets will not understand if there is no agreement in the March European Council, and all of us, each according to our respective responsibilities, must make the greatest possible effort to ensure that that agreement is concluded and published on 23 March in the European Council's conclusions.
For its part, the Commission will make every possible effort in that direction.
I shall end by acknowledging the excellent cooperation we are enjoying with the Presidency of the Council, which is firmly committed to achieving that success.
Â Â  The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the recommendation for second reading on the common position adopted by the Council on 21 October 2004 with a view to adopting a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Decision No 1419/1999/EC establishing a Community action for the European Capital of Culture event for the years 2005 to 2019.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, nearly 20 years ago, on 13Â June 1985, the idea of the European Capital of Culture was submitted to the Council of Ministers of Culture at the instigation of Melina Mercouri, the then Greek Minister of Culture, and the relevant resolution was duly adopted.
Her aim was to make specific cultural aspects of the city, region or country concerned accessible to the European public.
After 20 years of the European Capital of Culture programme, we can draw some conclusions, as identified in the Palmer study of August 2004.
There is no doubt that being selected as a European Capital of Culture has a positive impact on the city concerned as regards new cultural initiatives, the expansion of cultural infrastructure, artistic endeavours and trends, its reputation, its international status and the scope for further cultural development.
This goes hand-in-hand with an increase in the number of visitors and receipts, but also in expenditure.
Although the European Capital of Culture has a special attraction for people interested in culture, the European aspect has not totally caught on.
The cultural dimension is often overshadowed by political ambitions, and the European dimension has not always been in the forefront.
The Capital of Culture can only be a sustainable project if it is integrated into the development of the city as part of a long-term cultural development strategy.
A great deal has changed over the last 20 years as regards cultural and artistic development in cities, particularly in the European Union, making it necessary to amend the decision adopted at that time.
For example, the sequence of cities to be nominated up to 2019 does not take account of the 10 new Member States which joined the EU on enlargement in May last year.
However, in order not to upset the sequence that has now been established, there is a proposal that for each year a city from one of the new Member States should be added in, so as to create a balance.
We could not justify making these countries wait until 2019 for their turn.
The common position before us is deficient in some respects and does not meet all the requirements needed to implement the changes in a more open, democratic and transparent way.
However, in order not to jeopardise the preparatory work in hand for the cultural capitals in 2009, 2010 and subsequent years â and especially those in Austria and Germany â I would urge you to approve this common position at second reading, on condition that the Commission, which has already promised this and has started work on it, brings forward a new draft by June this year at the latest.
This new proposal should meet the following requirements: the level of financial resources will need to be adjusted if there are to be two cultural capitals as from 2009; the present level of financial commitment ranges from EUR 200Â 000 and EUR 1Â million per project.
Clear criteria need to be established in order to provide the highest level of funding possible.
At present, an average of EUR 500Â 000 is granted per cultural capital, which in the case of a budget proposal such as that being put forward by Linz corresponds to a contribution of 0.83%.
The European Union is certainly not making a generous contribution here.
I would plead for a fixed contribution of EUR 1Â million per cultural capital if all the criteria have been met.
This should be taken into account as regards the financial endowment and in the cultural programme, and in the 2007-2013 financial perspective.
Furthermore, we regard it as very important for the role of the jury to be strengthened, for tasks to be more specifically defined and for the selection procedure for the applicant cities to be improved in this way.
Clear and objective selection criteria for the cities themselves and the required added value for Europe also need to be explicitly defined and associated with specific points.
The decision as to when and why a city should receive EUR 200Â 000, EUR 500Â 000 or EUR 1Â million also needs to be clearly defined.
Where competition between several cities is possible, that is to be welcomed, but it should not be an absolute criterion.
For example, in 2009 Austria and Lithuania will enter the race with only one city each, but they will need to comply absolutely with the criteria of the selection procedure.
This is very important, and I believe that with Graz, Austria has demonstrated that you can offer very good performance with a single city.
I believe that the European Union should also support greater publicity for the cultural capitals and should bring forward a stronger programme in this respect.
According to the 1999 decision on the European Capital of Culture, the objective of the programme is to highlight the wealth and variety of European cultures â as well as what they have in common â and to contribute towards better mutual understanding on the part of Europeâs citizens.
The new decision is intended to go one step further and to accept and emphasise the challenges of European integration, of European diversity and also that of expanding cultural cooperation within an enlarged Europe.
Â Â  . Ladies and gentlemen, in November 2003 the European Commission adopted a proposal amending the 1999 Decision establishing the Community instrument entitled European Capital of Culture.
This Decision covered the years 2005-2019, which is where we are now.
The sole purpose of the Commissionâs proposal, which you have before you now, is to enable the ten new Member States to participate in this cultural activity as soon as possible from a position of parity with the other Member States, thus applying the principle of equality.
This means that, beginning in 2009, the new Member States will be hosting the European Capital of Culture, both in cooperation and in competition with the other Member States.
In 2009, as already mentioned, it will be Lithuania together with Austria.
In the second phase, as requested by the European Parliament, I am proposing a further change to the Council before this summer, which will mean an in-depth analysis or an in-depth review of the selection procedure for this Community activity.
As was rightly pointed out by Christa Prets, this proposal should include, among other things, the European dimension in cooperation, how to strengthen it, the role of the selection panel, national competition and so on. In actual fact, many of these questions or concerns have already been raised in the first reading and I shall of course take them into account when formulating the next steps to be taken.
The Commission will also take account of the results of an independent study which has looked at the last 10 years of this cooperative venture.
As regards the second reading, I am delighted that the report has also been accepted by the Committee on Culture and Education, thus approving the joint position of the Council, which is along the same lines as the Commissionâs proposal.
This means that this decision can be made relatively quickly, but of course on the basis of correct procedure.
In conclusion, I should like to thank the European Parliament, the Committee on Culture and Education and the rapporteur Christa Prets personally for her close cooperation in these matters and of course I should also like to express my thanks to the Irish and Danish Presidencies over the last year in this matter and to the Luxembourg Presidency for its continuing cooperation.
I am pleased that this change is bringing real results, since its adoption may significantly assist and directly affect relations between cities and citizens in the enlarged European Union.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we would not be having to discuss the European Capital of Culture at all today if back in 1999 the Council of Ministers had not totally â and quite outrageously â ignored the expected new Member States right up to 2019.
Only ministers can come up with such ideas: the Members of this House were already wiser back then.
We therefore have to put matters right today, and we are ready to support that.
In future we will have two cities, one from the 15 old Member States and one from the new Member States.
I totally support that, as it will also mean cooperation between two cultural capitals.
In 2010, for example, that will involve a German city and a Hungarian one.
MrsÂ Prets is of course quite right in saying that the financial resources will not be adequate for this.
Once you have made a mistake, the punishment is that much more severe.
In short, we will need more money for the cultural capitals in future, and that should also be provided under the financial framework.
I believe, unlike MrsÂ Prets, that each country should submit at least two cities to the European jury for selection.
Taking Germany as an example, I would like to remind you just how much excitement and creativity has been generated in the German cultural world over the last few years because ten cities have been competing to become the European Capital of Culture.
We have witnessed enormous inventiveness, with the full range of cultural and economic players taking part in seminars and symposia.
I simply believe that this amazing level of activity will only come about if there is competition between cities.
Germany will now be presenting two or more cities to the jury, of which only one can be selected.
But all the others that applied have stirred up an incredible amount of excitement in their city, in their and in the surrounding area.
That is why I believe this is the right way to go.
I would simply ask that in future the jury should pay more attention to what might be called the beacon effect of these cities.
Europeâs cities are the beacons of our history and of our cultural diversity.
Each cultural capital should particularly highlight this by arranging many and diverse events, not only to support national traditions and tourism, but also to truly highlight cultural diversity.
I hope that the Commissioner will take account of these points in his new proposals, including those on the selection procedure.
Â Â  .
Mr President, I generally welcome Mrs Prets' excellent report.
I also welcome the idea of enlarging the European Capital of Culture initiative to include the new Member States.
Some people perhaps think it would be better to have only one Capital of Culture per year, alternating yearly between the EU 15 of the old Member States and the EU 10 of new Member States.
In this way, we could ensure that all the events are concentrated in one city.
That would be a logical solution, but many old Member States have already waited a long time to enjoy the prestige and to have the possibility of having a Capital of Culture.
This doubling of the possibilities should be welcomed subject to one crucial condition: the two capitals should be equal in every way, including finance.
It is the responsibility of the Commission, the governments and the city councils, as well as of the media.
I urge everyone to understand this concern and make every possible step to ensure equality in real terms.
To have first-rate and second-rate Capitals of Culture could destroy the whole idea and would be a source of frustration and anger.
In 2010, Hungary and Germany will host and provide a site for the Capital of Culture of Europe.
In Hungary, 11 cities are competing for this wonderful chance to show themselves off to Europe.
My home town, Budapest, is one of the candidates.
Frankly, Budapest, even without a title, is one of the permanent culture capitals with its flourishing cultural life, but this possibility would be a special occasion.
It is amazing to see that in all 11Â Hungarian cities, the local politicians, NGOs, citizens young and old, are very active in the common cause of the contest.
In this way, the contest itself offers a chance for common cultural activities in all the competing cities.
Provided there is equality of the two capitals, I welcome the initiative and the report.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I would like to support the previous speakers and stress that the European Capitals of Culture programme has so far been a success story.
You can always find individual areas where things could be done still better, but all in all we have seen that for all these cities the process of self-understanding â with meetings across Europe opening their eyes to European horizons â has helped to strengthen not only the identity of those cities but also a new understanding within Europe.
MrsÂ Pack was quite right to say that we now recognise that it was a mistake not to include Eastern Europe in the decision adopted in 1999.
So we are right to be correcting that error here now and to provide for a new arrangement as from 2009, on the basis of which not just one country from the old Member States but also a city from one of the Eastern European Member States is also included.
I am firmly convinced that this tension between Western and Eastern Europe will lead to good cooperative projects.
We also need to bear in mind that something like a new collective cultural identity is created in the individual cities.
Europe has not just one soul, but many, and that is what the European cultural capitals should demonstrate in coming years.
For that reason I agree with the proposals brought forward by MrsÂ Prets, both as regards resources and as regards clarity about how these cities are to be identified and nominated.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my group supports this Council common position despite its evident shortcomings, because we believe that it lays the foundations for creating a fair system of financing, and because it of course also solves the problem that all the previous speakers have referred to: up to now, no provision at all has been made for the new European Union Member States.
The title âEuropean Capital of Cultureâ provides European cities and their citizens with an attractive opportunity to make themselves known across Europe, and also to display their cultural, scientific, architectural and historical merits and achievements.
Against the background of their application to become a cultural capital, many cities have developed their own development plan, and these development plans, regardless of whether these cities have subsequently been nominated by their countries or not, give a tremendous boost to development.
It leads to work on their infrastructure and to restoration, modernisation and renovation.
Furthermore, it means that opportunities for the development of additional tourism are opened up, opportunities that subsequently also give these cities greater potential for development and a chance to present themselves in an attractive light.
If you take Germany as an example, where 10 cities are applying for 2010, including Potsdam, the capital of my own , Brandenburg, you can see even now, in 2005, the commitment the are showing in their work to present these cities during the preselection period.
I would like to make one comment on the proposal regarding the future competition.
I can very well imagine that it would be possible for each country whose turn it is to nominate at least two cities.
I would not, however, think it would be a good thing to nominate five, six, seven or eight of them â that would be too much.
What we do need, though, is identical preselection criteria in the Member States and in the European Union, meaning that the jury would have to work according to the same criteria.
I think this is extremely important and I therefore think we should pursue this idea.
The title âEuropean Capital of Cultureâ is one that really is tremendously important for many cities.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the idea of a capital of culture is perhaps the best idea within the framework of the European Union.
It is the idea of a famous actress and Greek Minister for Culture who, in her Oscar-winning song 'Never on Sunday', made Piraeus the cultural capital of the world during the 1960s.
I believe culture is the primary product in Europe, taking precedence over the economy, the army and diplomacy.
Come and make history with the proposal which I am going to make to you, Commissioner.
Let us make the 'dead city' of Ammohostos next year's capital of culture, the only dead city on our continent, our continent of grand civilisations, of the Mycenaean civilisation, of the Minoan civilisation, of the Roman civilisation.
Ammohostos has been a dead city for 30 years and is the only dead city in the world.
Come and let us make it the capital of culture, come and let us breathe life into a city which barbarity has deprived of life.
Come and let us make it the capital of culture and win where all the plans have lost including, a few months ago, the Annan plan.
If we make Ammohostos the capital of culture, you will see a Greek Cypriot student marching in procession with a Turkish Cypriot student and we shall all be proud.
We shall be proud because we shall bring peace and we shall bring life to the most beautiful city in the Mediterranean.
It is a good idea: for us to take decisions where diplomacy cannot, for us to take decisions where denial is particularly distressing.
Come and let us give real meaning to this initiative.
It is an important matter; MrÂ Figel opens up this city and the main square will one day be renamed Jean Figel Square.
Try to help us do honour to this idea.
Â Â  .
Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her work on this particular issue and also to thank the Commissioner in advance for his ongoing work and assistance in promoting a very important aspect of European Union life: the issue of culture.
Today I speak as the representative of a city in Ireland that is the present capital of culture: Cork.
Having researched this enormously over the last seven years prior to submitting Cork's nomination, one of the key issues we saw as being important in designating a city as a capital of culture was that it allowed for greater understanding of the diversity of the cultures and traditions which exist within the European Union.
After the most recent enlargement that diversity is even greater and has expanded across the whole continent.
That is why I particularly welcome the decision to have two capitals of culture operating in the east and west, as it were, of the continent.
One key element that is lacking with regard to the overall structure is the financial support available to cities to undertake the necessary infrastructural work required to meet the demands for capital of culture status.
Of course, governments and local authorities can give monies to their own cities, but there is a wider European dimension which requires extra financing at European level.
My last point is relation to these capitals of culture is that when we speak about culture we do not just think in highbrow terms of classical orchestras, ballet and music, although of course these should be included, but that we also recognise the ancient cultures and traditions which exist within each of the Member States.
Â Â  â Mr President, whilst I share the criticisms of the decision taken by the Council of Ministers as regards the ten new countriesâ accession, we must also ask whether the Council of Ministers of Culture still takes decisions by unanimity.
Given that large countries such as Germany have sought to maintain unanimity for all decisions, we have now chosen a complicated system, which will be âÂ although I hope notÂ â burdened with excessive bureaucracy, and will take no account of the juryâs opinion when deciding between candidate cities.
We saw the example of Patras, on 6Â May of last year, which was named European capital of culture for 2006 by unanimous Council decision, despite the juryâs opinion to the contrary.
Perhaps this is more a case of an interinstitutional malaise that goes beyond the framework of this debate.
I should like to congratulate our rapporteur, not least for all the financial benefit that she has brought.
These decisions are now, of course, in the hands of the Commission, which must incorporate new ideas into its proposals.
I suggest that the Commissioners should take greater account of the mobility factor, given that the capital of culture also offers an opportunity to display the culture of others.
The added value to the region, the sustainability of the proposed projects and the groundwork carried out are further factors that should be considered.
Luxembourg objects somewhat to MrsÂ Packâs criticisms, because we have, already for 2007, named the city of Sibiu âÂ a town in another country, Romania, a candidate countryÂ â as partner city.
Luxembourg has expanded its project across the entire region â Sarre, RhÃ©nanie-Palatinat, Wallonie, Lorraine and the German-speaking part of Belgium â in other words, five regions and three different languages.
Analysis of the achievements of âLuxembourg, capital of culture 2007â, based on the concept of culture in a large region and aimed at fostering cohesion among the citizens, will also offer a glimpse of the future.
Thank you, Commissioner, for all your attention in this area.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful for the excellent work that has been done.
During its 20-year history, the Capital of Culture project has proved to be a success.
In many cities, people have become involved who would not otherwise participate.
Lowering the threshold and broadening the cultural arena is therefore a positive thing.
Why do we not broaden the scope of the Capital of Culture idea, however?
Currently, 70% of us live in cities.
The city is our closest cultural environment.
However, cities have all too often been built mainly as traffic hubs.
Noise and pollution levels therefore rise to inhumane proportions.
Most Central Europeans have to put up with permanent noise pollution.
Noise and pollution have become significant cultural factors.
Commissioner, cities should be developed into the cultural hubs of a knowledge-based economy, in accordance with the Lisbon Strategy.
We are evolving into a digital network-aided cultural society.
A Capital of Culture is hardly likely to grow up around a lorry terminal.
For this reason, I do hope that in future the Capital of Culture will organise development seminars and planning competitions for the cities of today and tomorrow.
Models should be built showing what a city in the cultured network society should be like.
Our cities have grown as physical traffic hubs dating from the Middle Ages, but this period ended centuries ago.
Now we are living in a global digital networked environment.
A global digital networked environment.
Should not that mean changing the nature of cities and their cultures, and the models we present of them?
What do you think, Commissioner Figel â are we stepping into the future?
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, at a point in history when it is becoming increasingly important for Europeans to learn more about one another, in terms of human and cultural diversity, the European Capitals of Culture programme is a highly effective means of achieving this aim.
Europeâs increased size following the latest enlargement clearly justifies the idea of designating two European Capitals of Culture per year.
Yet, as the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has already pointed out, Community financing must be adequate and appropriate.
The European Capital of Culture is a highly prestigious award, but the city concerned is not expected to use European Capital of Culture funding from the Community for urban regeneration or other works of that ilk.
The funding specifically earmarked for the programme is expected to help to highlight its role as a European city and as a cultural hub.
Nor is the European Capital of Culture event expected to turn into yet another international festival, however significant.
What we do expect is that visitors should be offered a stimulating, accurate and lively image of the city that is awarded the designation and that is opening its doors.
This image must be one that offers a rich contribution to European culture and to Europeâs relationship with the world, one that provides an insight into the cityâs particular values and history, its spiritual and material heritage, its traditions and customs, and the unique character of its people â that is, the cityâs human side.
I support the report by Mrs Prets and, in general, what has been said by previous speakers.
I should also like to suggest that these points be taken into account by the Commission in the review that it will carry out in 2005.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, the European Capital of Culture is the most readily understood and visible of all the programmes aimed at promoting the idea of a common Europe.
At a time when we are constantly being told of the publicâs lack of interest in European issues, and when the idea of a common Europe is becoming ever more frequently associated only with debts and dull discussions on some technical aspect or other of the way in which the European institutions are organised, the Capital of Culture project is a commendable exception.
Anyone who was in Lille last year when the city held the title of European Capital of Culture, or who has been in Cracow, which shared the title of Capital of Culture with eight other European cities in 2000, or indeed in many other Capitals of Culture, cannot have failed to notice the publicâs enormous interest in Europe and the great enthusiasm demonstrated by the large numbers of citizens who took part in remarkable cultural events.
Such occasions are an opportunity for all the critics of European integration to see the enthusiasm, joy and expectation with which the public greets outstanding cultural events inspired by the quest for common European roots.
Genuine and lively dialogue takes place in European Capitals of Culture, and it is here that inspiration should be sought by those who are weary of their job of building a community on our continent from the Rond-Point Schuman.
The fundamental value of this initiative lies in the fact that it did not come about as a result of an official proposal, and that it was not dreamt up by some Brussels bureaucrat.
It was mooted in Athens 20 years ago as a spur-of-the-moment idea, and subsequently taken up by other European cities.
Although there are no plans for this at present, provision should be made in the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective for a special and separate budget to support this idea.
I was astonished to note that the Network of the European Cities of Culture and Cultural Months (ECCM) was the only one of several dozen organisations not to receive funding from the European Commission.
This specialist organisation brings together experienced managers who are responsible for implementing the initiative in their own countries, and I would ask that this oversight be corrected.
Given that the initiative has been in existence for 20Â years, it is now time for the European Commission to provide significant funding for it in future, and for it to pay due regard to the experience of previous organisers.
The EU should provide technical and artistic support to assist those who will be in charge of organising forthcoming celebrations of the common Europe and its Cultural Capitals over the next few years.
Â Â  I welcome the proposal whereby from 2009 the new Member States of the European Union will also have the opportunity to stand as candidates for the âEuropean capital of cultureâ event.
In my own country of Slovenia we celebrate every 8Â February as a cultural holiday, and this is also a national holiday.
On that day visits to exhibitions and museums are free, and numerous cultural events take place around the holiday.
Nevertheless there is no shortage of people in Slovenia, too, who claim that culture is merely something superfluous and unnecessary, since it brings in no money directly.
However, during the time of the holiday at least, we are more intensively preoccupied with the importance and value of culture, and we attend events that we would not normally find the time to attend.
It is precisely due to the preservation of its cultural heritage and language that the Slovenian nation of just two million people survived all the ravages of the world wars and the aspirations of neighbouring nations to erase us from the ethnic map of Europe.
In a culturally and ethnically diverse Europe it is all the more important for us to establish bridges between us.
Preserving oneâs own culture and enjoying the diversity and richness of other nations must be and must remain our guiding principle, since it is culture that is the least intrusive link between nations that wish to live in peace and mutual cooperation.
The European capital of culture makes it possible for us to forge such links.
At the same time it offers the possibility for each host to make greater investments in cultural facilities and in projects with long-term positive effects.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to thank Members for their expressions of either group or individual support.
This is good for European culture, for the European Union and for the future of Europe.
Mr Paasilinna asked whether we are going back to the past or forward into the future.
The 1999 decision needs to be adapted to take account of the situation in the new enlarged Union.
It is about culture, not so much about geography or economics.
We also need to prepare for Bulgarian and Romanian accession so as not to create the additional question of whether incoming countries are included in this cooperation or given special consideration.
We also need to set up mechanisms for the future relating to finance, city selection and jury criteria.
We must do this to promote the European dimension and many other issues that have either already been raised or will be discussed at a later stage.
I would like to assure you that we can already see added value: Germany has 10 candidate cities and Hungary has 11.
Even before a decision is made, this process is generating a lot of cultural activity and a growing awareness that culture is important and that there is a European dimension for it.
I am glad that there is a high level of understanding for the decision here.
We will continue to work with the rapporteur, the committee and Parliament as a whole with regard to making further improvements.
The spirit of cooperation should be rather broader.
Culture should be seen as a relationship between peoples and nations and all their ancient traditions.
As Mr GraÃ§a Moura and Mr Crowley mentioned, spiritual and architectural heritage and the human dimension should be taken into account.
Cities should not be seen merely as hubs for transport: they are places for living and for culture.
I should like to thank Members for their positive responses and support.
I am looking forward to working on further improvements in the future.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner.
This item is therefore dealt with and the vote will take place at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report by Mrs Ries on the European Environment and Health Action Plan.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, before I do anything else I should like to offer my warm thanks to all of the Members of this House who have shown great interest in this important subject.
I shall first thank the shadow rapporteurs, Mr Trakatellis, Mrs Corbey, MrÂ Staes, Mrs de BrÃºn. I should also like to thank, of course, all of the Members who provided invaluable help while I was drawing up this report.
I appreciate their help.
The debate in all of the political groups has been heated and, I would say, in keeping with the challenges and expectations.
89% of European citizens have said that they are extremely concerned about the impact of the environment on their health, and with good reason.
The figures are revealing and I shall just mention a few of them: one sixth of child deaths and diseases in Europe can be attributed to environmental causes; the incidence of respiratory allergic diseases has doubled over the last 20 years, today affecting one in seven children; almost 10% of workers are exposed to carcinogenic substances; 14% of couples seek help because of difficulty in conceiving.
I could cite more figures and examples, and, indeed, the Members of this House have not hesitated to do this during the course of the debates.
The Commission responded to these figures in June 2003 by launching the SCALE environment and health strategy, which stands for Science, Children, Awareness, Legal instruments, Evaluation.
This initiative gave rise to much hope, which was well summed up by Commissioner WallstrÃ¶mâs statement during the debate in plenary in March of last year.
She said, and I quote, âthere are certain areas where we cannot risk waiting until our knowledge is complete, but need to act according to the precautionary principle, and we shall do soâ.
This European strategy ought to act as a launch pad for the Action Plan before us, for which I am the rapporteur, but this is not this case.
This action plan, as far as I am concerned, does not live up to its name.
It would be more accurately described as a programme to assess the overall impact of the environment on health.
It does, of course, raise a wide range of interesting points which are worth mentioning and I would highlight the following: raising awareness of the risks run by the citizens, training experts in health and the environment âÂ of whom there are far too few â and the introduction of biomonitoring at European level. I feel that there are many interesting initiatives, but these do not dispel the sense of incompleteness that came through when I read the Commissionâs communication.
It strikes me that an approach that takes the paradigm for the 21st century as absolute scientific evidence goes against the precautionary principle.
The 52 European environment and health ministers who gathered in Budapest last June for a conference on the theme of âA future for our childrenâ took this on board when they placed emphasis on the delicate yet necessary balance between more research and the urgent need to take preventative action to protect peopleâs health.
We should endeavour to strike that balance here.
This is why we made exposure to dangerous chemical substances one of the priorities of this report.
More specifically, in paragraph 6, we call for the precautionary principle to be applied to a range of substances that are damaging to health, particularly certain heavy metals, such as mercury and cadmium, six products from the phthalate family used in PVC plastics and four insecticides suspected of being, , endocrine disruptors and at the root of serious malformations.
Reinforcing this European plan is also a matter of drawing inspiration from the ambitious actions already put in place by the Member States, and achieving success.
I mention these in points 23 and 28 of the resolution.
I am also delighted that Members of this House support the approach that I have taken aimed at placing children at the heart of this Action Plan, including the request that the Commission should carry out an epidemiological study on children, from birth to 18 years of age.
A further crucial aspect is the fight against passive smoking.
The Commission has taken this consideration on board, and this is something that we welcome.
It is seeking to designate environmental tobacco smoke a class 1 carcinogen.
Let us be clear on this issue: as far as I am concerned, the message that we send out to the public, covered in point 20 of the resolution, must not be watered down in any way.
Tobacco smoke kills both smokers and non-smokers.
In Belgium alone, 2 000 people a year die from the effects of passive smoking, which is as high as the number of victims of road accidents.
In conclusion, I hope that the Commission proves to be ambitious in implementing this Action Plan for the next six years.
I have no doubt, Mr Dimas, that you will work in tandem with your colleague, Mr Kyprianou, in order to ensure the necessary complementarity between the Action Plan and the European Public Health Programme.
You can, of course, rely on our support in Parliament to obtain the appropriate financing to meet the challenges that I have just spoken about, under the seventh research framework programme and in chapter four of the financial perspectives.
Furthermore, I hope that you are predisposed towards your services drawing up a green paper on pollution inside buildings, from crÃšches to homes and schools, which remains the poor relation of environmental legislation.
All of which is to say that Europe must learn the lessons from the scandals of smoking and asbestos, to name but two.
Europe is involved in a race against time, and against all forms of pollution.
Commissioner, we have a duty, both the Commission and Parliament, to ensure that the health of the citizens â all of the citizens â takes precedence over other considerations.
Â Â  . Mr President, honourable Members of the European Parliament, I fully endorse what Mrs Ries said at the end, that the links between the environment and health are a particularly important priority for the European Commission and Europe.
That is why I am grateful for your committee's help in drafting the report which we are debating today.
I should particularly like to thank Mrs Ries for all her constructive efforts to improve the content of the report, so that the final text constitutes a substantive and useful basis for all further debate.
I should like to start by reiterating the objective of the action plan adopted last June.
We should not forget that we are not starting from scratch.
Indeed, having recognised for some time that environmental protection helps to improve health, we have already done a great deal of work in this sector.
The forthcoming environmental and other legislation, including the REACH proposals and measures which will be taken within the framework of thematic strategies, will be of even greater help in resolving the outstanding problems.
As regards current issues, numerous efforts are being made to reinforce European Union policies designed to improve health and environmental protection and this is something that will certainly continue.
The objective of the action plan is to further promote this work and, at the same time, to determine the agenda for the future.
Thus, possible weaknesses will be addressed and a future environmental policy will be laid down which is more efficient, more focused and more cost-effective.
As regards the conclusions of the report, I should like to start by assuring you that the precautionary principle is an important essential element of our policy and we do, of course, intend to continue to apply it in the future.
As far as biomonitoring is concerned, we agree.
It can indeed be an essential element in our policy for risk evaluation, as the report suggests.
We shall study this view in detail.
Nonetheless, the Commission would like first to carefully examine all aspects of the problem, both technical and financial, in the light of experience gained from third countries, such as the United States.
The cost, it should be noted, is very high.
We likewise agree on air inside buildings.
The possibility of developing a strategy and research agenda on this subject will be examined, so that the relevant problems can be identified and proposals can be made for possible ways of addressing them.
If the measures in the action plan are to be implemented, the question of financing needs to be addressed, as Mrs Ries has quite rightly noted and emphasised.
I agree that this is needed in order to safeguard efficient application of the plan.
For the period up to 2007, the Commission will finance the budgets of the four Directorates-General involved, of the programme in the public health sector and of the Sixth Research Framework Programme.
From 2007 onwards, new headings will be available within the framework of the new financial perspectives.
The Commission is engaged in intensive consultations on the detailed arrangements for applying the various measures included in the action plan.
Another particularly important issue which is necessary for the application of the action plan is the regular submission of reports to the European Parliament.
Of course, the Commission will report to the relevant parliamentary committee on progress with the action plan as regularly as possible.
Of course, progress on certain issues, such as efficiency and the cost-benefit ratio may not be possible in the short term.
Within this framework, all the data and information needed simply do not exist.
Nonetheless, the possibility for more detailed reports will exist as soon as the integrated information system is up and running.
As regards the ban on substances, an issue on which MrsÂ Ries spoke earlier, dangerous substances are an issue which particularly concerns the Commission.
However, the action plan is not the most suitable framework for debating possible bans.
We have already laid down procedures for evaluating and reducing the risk of many of these substances.
These procedures which, as I said, already exist, will continue to progress alongside the action plan.
The Commission is carefully examining the proposal in the report to increase the number of priorities in the action plan.
However, increasing the number of priorities will weaken the focus and results of the action plan, which is why it would be preferable to limit the priorities to those proposed in the action plan, which have been defined in close cooperation with 300 experts and involved agencies.
That is why, on the basis of the contribution of these 300 experts, we have not limited the focus to children alone, because there are directly related issues and we therefore also have to examine adults.
To close, I should like to stress that, if the action plan is to be applied effectively, active and close cooperation is needed with all the agencies involved.
That is why I should like once again to thank Mrs Ries and the European Parliament for their important contribution in this sector.
Our common objective is to promote stronger European measures to improve health and environmental protection for all Europeans, for Europe and for the world.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Environment and Health Action Plan 2004-2010 before us today, combined with the proposals from our rapporteur, MrsÂ Ries, is equal to the heavy demands we are making of it.
Its numerous projects are capable of significantly improving our knowledge about environmental impacts on health, and thus provide stronger scientific foundations for our legislative process.
Furthermore, it could enable our legislation to become preventive, which is perhaps even more valuable.
Maybe I am somewhat optimistic about that point, but we all need to have some dreams!
Some projects will certainly be completed by 2010.
I have in mind, for example, improved coordination between the Member States in the field of environment and health, something that should have been sorted out long ago in the European Union.
Most of the actions will, however, extend beyond 2010.
The relationship between humankind and the environment is subject to constant change and often requires new actions and reactions.
I believe that we should be taking steps now to ensure that this action plan does not come to an end in 2010.
The action plan will, however, be successful only if we do not implement it in isolation from the necessary economic processes and pressures and from peopleâs lifestyles.
It will be successful only if we monitor research results as regards their general validity instead of treating the world like a laboratory.
Our actions must be based on risk analysis and not on ideology.
Paragraph 5 of the resolution contained in the report is doubtless well intentioned, but even the precautionary principle can only be applied if there is an appreciable risk and firm findings.
Legislating on the basis of panic mongering is surely not the way to go and I cannot take this seriously.
Much the same applies to the substances listed in paragraph 6, which are to be replaced by other substances.
I agree with the Commissioner on this: this would breach the principle of the action plan, because we should not be concentrating on things that are covered by EU regulations, such as the REACH programme.
Apart from the fact that available substitutes are costly, we also know little about the risks of exposure to them.
So things need to be weighed up carefully.
As regards smoking, I am in total agreement with the Commissioner: it is not for us in the European Union to be enacting laws in this area; we should instead be encouraging the Member States to proceed in the right direction here.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should first of all like to thank and congratulate Mrs Ries. She has done important work in fleshing out the Environment and Health Action Plan more effectively.
The action programme itself is disappointing.
Whilst I do, of course, recognise the need for research, an action programme also requires strong measures to tackle health problems, and those measures are lacking.
In recent weeks, our discussions have centred around dangerous substances and the conditions under which they can, or must, be removed from the market.
Softening agents in toys are the most prominent, but there are also other substances at issue.
Although our group accepted the text as approved in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, we did actually want a stricter approach.
If a substance is dangerous, it should be removed from the market without delay and without waiting for safe alternatives.
A second subject of discussion was smoking.
Tobacco smoke has a devastating effect on the health of passive smokers.
We would therefore call for active policy to ban smoking in public places.
We urge all Member States to draw inspiration from the Irish and Italian examples.
The environment and health report is topical.
Air pollution, in particular, is an important problem in Europe.
According to calculations and studies commissioned by the Commission, every year, more than 300Â 000 people die prematurely in Europe as a result of air pollution.
In the Netherlands, the figure is 13Â 000.
Little imagination is required to assume that deaths occur more frequently among people living near motorways and industrial areas than in people living in leafy and exclusive residential areas.
Over the past 20 years, Europe has, of course, taken measures that have brought about major reductions in emissions.
The use of catalytic converters in cars has been successful, but too little effort has been made to date, and the statistics are alarming.
What is to be done?
First of all, we should, of course, better observe existing legislation, but more can, and must, be done.
Where, for example, are the soot filters in cars?
Also, we should question whether the limits and limit values in legislation are adequate.
In the report âSignals 2004â, the European Environment Agency noted that there is increasing evidence to suggest that dust and ozone concentrations impact on health below current health protection values.
A European approach is required to protect the environment, health and the consumer.
In the framework of the Lisbon process, ambitious environmental policy is an incentive for technological development and for boosting European competitiveness.
If we do not commit to environmental quality, then not only do we do public health, but also European industry, a huge disservice.
At the Detroit car show last month, a zero-emission passenger car was launched, the like of which we have not seen at European car shows.
Over here, we remain stuck in the question as to who should pay for soot filters.
I prefer an ambitious Europe with adequate measures to protect public health, and we should make those soot filters compulsory without delay.
That is vital.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I hope that you can hear me above the mounting background noise.
Speakers deserve to be treated with a bit of respect in this Chamber!
This report on the European Environment and Health Action Plan concentrates too much on chemicals.
Too little attention is paid to many other things that have an adverse affect on human health.
It is clear that there are risks associated with chemicals, but there is little point in drawing up blacklists and thus stigmatising certain substances such as phthalates.
The report is based on an exaggerated interpretation of the precautionary principle.
It talks about direct and total bans on certain substances without basing them on scientific findings, or without taking account of known scientific findings, as is customary with the precautionary principle.
This report represents another attempt at a zero-risk policy, at what I call the âgreen diseaseâ prevalent in many western societies.
We are trying to apply a comprehensive insurance mentality to environmental protection, forgetting that there are always risks associated with the development of an open society.
The mere existence of a risk and widespread fear of chemicals are used to justify demands for total bans.
Fear is nothing more than uncertainty arising from ignorance.
If you want to counter fear, you must combat ignorance.
To do that you need to promote science and research, and to draw the correct conclusions from your findings.
We should not confuse risks with dangers that are actually present.
The priority objective of environmental policy should not be to exclude risks, but to identify and eliminate dangers.
The report also overshoots the mark when it comes to dealing with tobacco smoke.
As long as tobacco is a legal product, we should hold back from demanding a total ban on smoking.
It is not for Europe to determine where you can and cannot smoke.
In the report we call for tobacco smoke to be designated a class 1 carcinogen, indicating that it has a proven and direct effect.
I would like to remind you that there is as yet no scientific proof for that.
I am not suggesting that the health dangers of tobacco smoke should be played down, but putting tobacco smoke in the same category as substances such as benzene or asbestos is nothing short of environmental populism.
I also believe that we should be holding this debate in Brussels, not in Strasbourg.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I would prefer to speak this evening, or in the continuation, because you cannot hear yourself think here.
I do not think that you can make a speech here now.
Â Â  Your request is accepted.
We shall interrupt the debate to proceed to the votes.
The debate will continue after the oral question on the financing of nature protection policy, so the debate on this item will resume at 4.00 p.m. and the first speaker will be MrsÂ Breyer.
Â Â  The next item is the vote.

Â Â  Thank you Mr President, I would just like to briefly give all the Members of Parliament some information.
Statistics are a boring matter, but business people in your countries will now have to write many new reports, if you vote for this.
I say this in advance, so that you can tell them what Parliament has done to make many of those statistical reports unnecessary.
Business people will have to compile new statistical reports and most likely you and many of your voters will have questions.
Therefore I simply wanted to let you know what Parliament has done in cooperation with the Council and the Commission in order to reduce that statistical load.
We vote with you for the introduction of so-called European sample schemes, where only some companies present reports; small countries, whose GDP is less than 1% of the European Union's GDP, will not be required to supply some of the indices at all; moreover, we shall give governments the opportunity to use administrative resources, that is, social insurance registers, and then companies will not be required to write additional reports.
It is also anticipated that the European Commission and Member States will have to prepare a method of evaluating whether it is worthwhile introducing new statistical reports and whether these would be of value to European business and the people of Europe.
Thank you.

Â Â  MrÂ President, I do not have a great deal to say about the content of this report; this fraud prevention agreement fulfils a request this House has been making for many years, and I hope we will approve this agreement by a large majority.
We are actually dealing here, for the first time, with part of the series of Bilateral Agreements with Switzerland, and I feel that the rapid way we have dealt with this in this House demonstrates that we want to see the positive results achieved finally transposed into legislation.
We have repeatedly supported the Commission in its efforts to achieve an outcome on the fraud prevention agreement.
We are therefore all the more surprised that when it comes to an amount that Switzerland wishes to transfer to the new Member States as a contribution to cohesion, the amount of CHF 1 billion, the Commission has suddenly come up with the pettifogging idea that this ought to be the subject of an international treaty, and that a memorandum of understanding is not sufficient.
I would like to point out to the Commission that we have not been negotiating with a banana republic, but with one of the oldest and most stable democracies in Europe.
So, to make no bones about this, what you have been doing here plays into the hands of those in Switzerland and in the EU who are opposed to closer relations between Switzerland and the European Communities.
I call for this House to adopt a position on this and for you, on behalf of the Commission, to take this message from Strasbourg back home with you.
Â Â  . Mr President, just for technical information with a view to giving consistency and coherence in the final document: if Amendments 19 and 21 are adopted, the other paragraphs which deal with the same issue should be brought into line.
This has been discussed with representatives from other groups and is a technical rather than a political matter.
Â Â  Mr President, to add to what Ms in 't Veld said, that Amendment 20 should have added at the end: 'or by way of an official act that, depending upon the legislation in the Member States, may take the form of one or more legislative or regulatory act or a contract'.
That is part of the arrangement that Ms in 't Veld is referring to.
Following on from that are oral amendments to Modifications 10 and 17 and recital Q.
Â Â  Mr President, to be completely clear, it means that we have oral amendments on recitals Q and paragraph 19 of this document.
They were not written amendments and they completely follow the text proposed in the Purvis amendments.
These have to be introduced on recital Q and paragraph 19.
Â Â  Mr President, concerning this problem, I tabled an amendment referring to 'public authority provide'.
I notice that other amendments - in particular Amendment 3 by the PSE Group - make a distinction between 'run' and 'monitor'.
In my intention, 'provide' is a verb 'monitor' or 'run'.
So I put an oral amendment to all the amendments referring to the tendering process.
Where Amendment 29 by the Green Group, Amendments 32, 33 and 27 state 'to provide' a public service. It should read 'to provide (run or monitor)'.
Provide is to run or monitor.
Â Â  We will take that oral amendment before we start voting on that section.
Colleagues, I am aware that this is a very sensitive report and that it is a pre-consultation offered by the Commission.
It is only fitting that we take time to get it right.
Â Â  Mr President, here we had to vote on one of the compromises of this set of four so this is a bit confusing.
I assume that we have now voted on Mr Purvis's oral compromise amendment?
Â Â  In fact, it was the rapporteur's oral amendment that there were no objections to.
We will get to that when we come to Amendment 19.
Â Â  Mr President, no, because it deals with this paragraph 19 it should come before the other votes.
Â Â  . Mr President, it is very complicated because during the whole process the structure of the report became rather complicated.
I apologise for that.
This concerns three amendments and five paragraphs.
Amendment 20, with an addition, has just been read out by Mr Purvis.
As far as I understand that is what we have been voting on.
The other two amendments are Amendments 19 and 21, also by Mr Purvis, but the contents of those amendments also relate to recital Q, paragraph 19, modification 10 and modification 17.
I can read out the text concerned, because I would suggest that rather than reading it out every single time, I should read it out once, we all adopt or reject the principle and then adapt the four paragraphs concerned.
The text of Amendment 21, which is almost identical to Amendment 19, reads as follows: ' The public service task must be assigned by way of an official act that, depending on the legislation in Member States, may take the form of a legislative or regulatory act or a contract.
It may also be laid down in several acts.
The act or series of acts should specify among other things:'.
This is the same principle as in Amendment 19.
Therefore, if the plenary adopts that principle, it will also apply to the four paragraphs I have mentioned.
I propose that we vote on that rather than reading it out every single time.
Â Â  â Mr President, there is no objection over the substance, but I should not like there to be any confusion over the facts.
This oral amendment is tabled four times: it relates to AmendmentÂ 20, AmendmentÂ 19, AmendmentÂ 21 and AmendmentÂ 15.
In order to avoid any ambiguity, I would suggest, Mr President, that, each time we vote on these amendments, you indicate that they are amendments that form part of Mr Purvisâs oral amendment.
I feel that this would clear up any potential confusion.
Mr Purvisâs oral amendment relates to four amendments.
If you would be kind enough to remind us of Mr Purvisâs oral amendment at each vote, I believe that it would be clearer for the House.
Â Â  Mr President, I think that will be complicated.
The point here is that there are paragraphs where no amendments have been tabled, but they would be equally concerned because after the amendments had been tabled I think we all discovered when we went through the amendments that there were more paragraphs concerned with the same issue.
Now we can simply vote on the amendments, but then there will be a certain inconsistency in the document.
What Mr Savary is suggesting will not work because it is not about the amendments - it is about the paragraphs to which no amendments have been tabled.
If, when voting on Amendment 19 and Amendment 21 plenary twice adopts a principle or rejects it, then it will apply equally to those paragraphs.
That is what I am saying.
Â Â  Mr President, I do not wish to complicate matters, but Mrs inÂ 'tÂ Veld is asking us to vote once and for all on Mr Purvisâ amendment.
You will not know where it will be in the text, but it will be there.
Quite frankly, as there are four crucial amendments, Amendments 20, 19, 21 and 15, I would prefer it if we were asked each time whether we were adopting them subject to the oral amendment by Mr Purvis.
I think that would be clearer.
I understand what Mrs inÂ 'tÂ Veld is saying, but I would like her to tell me exactly where she is going to put Mr Purvisâ amendment, as she has said that it appears throughout the text.
I think this is confused and I do not want us to make a mistake with this vote, because, as you said yourself, this is a sensitive text.
Â Â  Mr President, I hope I can help you.
I agree with Mr Savary that it should be applied to those four amendments, but I also agree with Mrs in't Veld that wherever else in the report there are inconsistencies as a result of passing those amendments, then appropriate adjustments should be made by sessional services.
If that is acceptable then we can go ahead.
Â Â  Mr Savary, I can assure you that appropriate adjustments will be made.
I will indicate when the oral amendment applies.
I now propose to put the oral amendment to the vote.
Mr President, in case we have the same problem as previously, this one is also affected by the oral amendment and therefore my voting list should say in favour.
Â Â  Mr President, this is a slight modification of the amendment proposed by the PSE Group and it would read as follows: 'whereas with a view to evidence-based policy making the Commission should present a sound and exhaustive evaluation of the liberalisation process, taking into account the point of view of all stakeholders involved (users, local authorities, undertakings etc.)'.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, during the debate on the Goebbels report in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe tabled an amendment that was accepted by a majority of the committee, but due to an error was not incorporated into the final version of this report.
I would therefore like to table it once again as an oral amendment.
It relates to the need for structural reforms.
I shall read the amendment in English.
'Recommends that the Member States carry out the structural reforms which have long been needed. In particular, the deregulation of labour markets, the adjustment of social systems to demographic needs, the simplification of tax systems, combining tax cuts and a change in the bases of tax assessment and the abolition of subsidies, so as to bring about an improvement in the investment climate as a prerequisite for economic growth.
Stresses finally that the development of quality jobs will be accompanied by an improvement in labour productivity in Europe.'
Â Â  . Mr President, I am amazed by the way Mr Klinz is acting.
He claims that his amendment was accepted.
If that were the case, he should have made a complaint to the secretariat of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which normally does a good job.
Otherwise, he had every right to table an amendment, which he did not do.
Having listened to him, it is a new report that he is proposing to us, and I invite my fellow Members to reject this oral amendment, which is not an oral amendment, but a novel.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I merely wish to inform the House that a meeting of the coordinators was held yesterday at which the coordinators of all parties, including the committee chairs, confirmed that the amendment just read out had been accepted, but had not, because of a drafting error, been included in the report.
So in the interests of fairness we should vote on the amendment now.
Â Â  If the amendment was adopted in committee and there were no amendments to it, then it is in the text.
I can only ask the services to check this.
Â Â  Mr President, I am sorry that your services did not indicate to you that I had requested the floor at the beginning of Mr Wolf Klinzâs speech, as I wanted to report to you the discussion that we had last night at the meeting of the coordinators of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
I will be very clear: the amendment to which MrÂ WolfÂ Klinz is referring was mentioned and we reported the procedure that was followed, which is the procedure that we are still following.
The Secretary of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs did his job: he consolidated the votes after the vote in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, and sent the result to every political group to be verified.
The Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe has not, so far, deemed it necessary to table this amendment again or to point out a material error in it.
Therefore, and out of respect for the meeting of the coordinators last night, I would ask you, in accordance with what this House has already decided, given that several Members have stood up, not to take on board this amendment.
Â Â  We have to stand by the decision of the House, which was to not accept the oral amendment.
I apologise to Mr Klinz if there was a fault on the part of the secretariat, but Mrs BerÃšs is absolutely right that the position was clear in committee.
Â Â  .
Mr President, as rapporteur, I have to say that a large proportion of my report has been âmutilatedâ by a rightwing majority in this House, which has voted contrary to Article 4 of the Treaty, which requires coordination of economic policies.
You have voted against the efforts of the President-in-Office, Mr Juncker, to make the Stability Pact into something decent, in other words a Stability and Growth Pact.
I therefore invite my friends to vote against my report.
That concludes the vote.
Â Â  . Switzerland is a pocket-sized European Union, entirely surrounded by the EU but itself divided up into 23 states which each have major autonomy and can, consequently, pursue their own tax policies.
That has so far prevented the conclusion of agreements in the area of direct taxes between the EU and Switzerland as a whole.
The separate Swiss cantons are in this respect not unlike Liechtenstein or other small tax havens where postbox firms are based.
Zug and Schwyz, in particular, offer services of this kind.
The responses to my written questions have shown that the former Commissioner Bolkestein preferred to ignore this and wanted to continue to do business with Switzerland as a whole.
As long as those further steps cannot be taken, it is useful that agreements be made in the areas of VAT, smuggling, corruption and money-laundering practices.
It is also important that banking secrecy can no longer be quoted as a reason for turning down investigation requests from other countries, and that direct contacts with legal bodies become possible instead of having to take the route of diplomatic representation.
The rapporteur is right in stating that further steps are required, but it is unfortunate that he fails to mention the most pressing one.
Â Â  . I endorse the report by Mr Di Pietro, which supports and seeks to strengthen the Commissionâs initiative aimed at making improvements of a technical nature to the legislation relating to the exchange of information extracted from the criminal record, and suggests practical ways of remedying the shortcomings in the current systems, which are based on the 1959 Council of Europe Convention.
This is undoubtedly an urgently needed measure, because it has been demonstrated on a number of occasions that the system is not working properly.
It is therefore essential that a computerised system be set up whereby such information can be exchanged between Member States and accessed rapidly throughout EU territory.
This is a further step towards genuinely effective, independent and transparent criminal justice.
I also endorse his proposals regarding shorter time limits, given that the proposalâs effectiveness will depend on speed of access and of updating information,and regarding the need to impose conditions on access to personal data, because a balance must always be maintained between the need for speed in this type of exchange of information and the need to safeguard and protect personal data.
Â Â  . In a Europe characterised by free movement and free trade, security must be shared.
Without prejudice to the various Member States fully exercising their sovereignty, it is widely acknowledged nowadays that different countries must work together to fight crime.
In addition to traditional forms of crime, there is now crime which does not respect national borders and which operates wherever it is most advantageous to do so.
As such, when the law of one Member State is broken, the security of all Member States is put in jeopardy.
Accordingly, I broadly agree with the content of this report, and therefore voted in favour.
Â Â  We, MrsÂ SegelstrÃ¶m, MrÂ Andersson, MrsÂ Hedh, MrsÂ HedkvistÂ Petersen and MrsÂ Westlund voted in favour of the report but wish now to indicate our differing position on one issue.
We cannot support paragraph 1 f, indent 2, which recommends to the Council that it go some way towards harmonising national legislation governing the gathering and assessment of evidence.
The principle of the free sifting of evidence is basic to the Swedish criminal law of procedure.
Quite a few other Member States have rules to the effect that certain evidence is not permitted.
It is thus extremely important to us Swedish Social Democrats that our national system be kept intact.
What is more, it is doubtful whether there is any legal basis at all, be it in current treaties or in the forthcoming Constitution, for harmonisation in this respect.
Â Â  Strengthening mutual trust in decisions by European courts by setting up an evaluation system may appear commendable, even if there now already exists a common framework of reference for the Member States in terms of the European Convention on the Protection of Human Rights and the case law of the European Court of Justice, which lays down minimum standards governing the right to trial by the courts.
The proposal is, however, one more example of the creeping extension of the EUâs competences and constitutes a stage in the attempt to create a harmonised European system of criminal law and of laws relating to judicial procedure â a legal system that, in practice, will be outside peopleâs direct control.
To recommend, moreover, before the draft Constitution has come into force, that use be made of provisions of the Constitution on the grounds that current treaties do not go far enough is unacceptable, as it flagrantly pre-empts the democratic process.
The June List is therefore voting against this report.
Â Â  .
I voted for this report because it makes important steps forward in addressing a key issue deemed important by EU citizens, namely the need for some monitoring of the quality of criminal justice as it is implemented in Member States.
This in no way imposes changes on the way each Member State conducts its criminal justice system.
It does, however, take a step forward in ensuring that important matters such as the effective dealing with criminal gangs, or the way EU citizens may serve their sentence in their own Member State, can be progressed.
EU citizens expect some degree of mutual trust between Member States and a view on the quality of criminal justice, particularly in relation to some new Member States working to improve their criminal justice systems.
Â Â  . Justice is, with good reason, one of the areas that Member States traditionally keep within the sphere of their own sovereignty.
This is particularly true of criminal justice, which should reflect a societyâs concerns in light of its present and its past.
Similarly, Member States are hesitant to allow their nationals, and even mere residents in their countries, to be tried by other Member States.
Nevertheless, we now have the phenomenon of global crime, which is of a cross-border nature, such as terrorism, drug-trafficking, smuggling, sexual exploitation and pornography.
This calls for cooperation in order to ensure that crime is tackled effectively, and harmonisation in order to prevent certain countries from becoming destinations for criminals.
These various factors highlight the need for cooperation, for recognition of legal decisions and for some harmonisation, without overlooking the fact that legal systems must reflect the situation in different societies.
A single European legal system is therefore not desirable.
A European standard of justice, on the other hand, which fully respected the particular nature of the judicial system, would be desirable.
Consequently, I feel that a vote in favour of this report is justified.
Â Â  The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have today voted in favour of MrÂ Costaâs report on the quality of criminal justice and the harmonisation of criminal law in the Member States (A6-0036/2005).
We are, however, aware of the fact that the proposal concerns an area covered by Title IV of the Treaty establishing the European Community and does not, therefore, apply to Denmark, cf. the Protocol on Denmarkâs Position.
Â Â  We completely support the view that cultural diversity is a fundamental right.
The EU is, and must remain, a mosaic of minorities and cultures.
As Liberals, we always put the individual at the centre of all political decisions.
We therefore believe that it is of the greatest importance to strengthen the policy of international cooperation and solidarity with respect to cultural issues and to establish in international law that every city, state or group of states is entitled freely to determine its cultural policy.
We therefore believe that the issue of capitals of culture is not an issue in which the EU should become involved.
The matter of cultural capitals is one that individual cities and states should cooperate on and decide about without the EUâs interference.
In view of this, we choose to vote against MrsÂ Pretsâs report (A6-0017/2005) - the âEuropean Capital of Cultureâ event for the years 2005 to 2019.
Â Â  We are well disposed to its being possible from 2009 to choose two cultural capitals at a time.
The reportâs explanatory statement notes, however, that how this project is to be funded is unclear, and reference is made to the forthcoming financial perspective for 2007-2013.
We cannot, as matters stand, support something entailing financial commitments in the forthcoming financial perspective.
In this situation, there is no reason for hurrying through a decision concerning future cultural capitals.
Firstly, the financial perspective for 2007-2013 must be debated in its entirety.
Subsequently, this report can come up for debate.
The idea of a European capital of culture is a good one.
It is so good, even, that it can be funded in a host of other ways, for example through local sponsorship.
Financial resources from the European Union should not be necessary to enable this project to survive.
We are therefore voting against this report in itself, but are not opposed to the actual idea of the action.
Â Â  . The âEuropean Capitals of Cultureâ programme was launched in 1985 with the aim of bringing European citizens closer together.
The programme seeks to highlight the wide diversity of European culture, while at the same time there is the supreme contradiction of pursuing a European policy of economic, social, political and cultural uniformity.
This programme is just an entertaining expression of your desire to impose a cultural and social model on the European people that they have not chosen themselves.
You want to manufacture a European feeling purely to benefit trade.
As culture is a powerful channel for education, the European Union not only favours anything that can brainwash and demean mankind, but also anything that encourages people to forget the timeless religious values that are the foundations for our membership of European civilisation.
In addition to this policy, there is now another problem, as Europe enlarges and moves further away from its main founders.
In the future, will your attitude mean that Istanbul will have to be chosen as the Capital of European Culture?
This clearly shows the danger of this European construction, which, by forgetting its past, is preparing a difficult future for us.
Â Â  . If we wish to defend a capitalist-style economic model, which stimulates effort, rewards merit and recognises efficiency, we need to have an efficient and effective system of monitoring compliance with competition regulations.
Without competition there is no market, without a market there is no capitalist model and without a capitalist model there is no economic success and development, as history clearly demonstrates.
Consequently, the Communityâs role in regulating competition is of major importance.
Without prejudice to the economic need, or, in some senses, the geographically or sectorally localised need, to safeguard certain activities, in general defending competition is, above all, a matter of protecting the interests of consumers, who do not usually have unions, employersâ federations or other movements to look after their legitimate interests.
I therefore believe that we must applaud and endorse attempts to defend competition, even though we may from time to time disagree with some of the Commissionâs decisions.
I therefore voted in favour of this report.
Â Â  I want to see a more proactive competition policy, but do not want to see supranationalism or competition policyâs forming part of the Constitution.
I therefore chose to abstain, which is the corrected vote following errors in the Minutes.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen.
Regulating the financing of services of general interest without defining those services, or even the general framework applying to them, is incoherent.
Regulating it while leaving it up to the Member States to define for themselves what they consider to be services of general interest amounts to leaving it up to the Court of Justice to harmonise the definitions and replace the legislator.
Basing the regulation on an assessment in purely financial and competition-related terms is a negation of general interest.
Making the financing of public health or social housing subject to the authorisation of technocrats is immoral.
In short, we are not happy with anything in the texts before us today.
They are entirely in line with the policy of the Eurocrats, in collusion with the governments.
Previously, it was about competition between all network public services, electricity, postal services, etc., destroying State monopolies and imposing privatisation.
In the future, the Bolkenstein directive, a local version of GATS, will allow social dumping in services to be introduced into our countries.
Because we reject this vision, which will be worsened by the European Constitution, and because, although we agree that we need to put an end to some blatant abuses, we nevertheless defend the legitimacy of certain public services, we will vote against this report.
Â Â  The June List is well disposed towards the implementation of the internal market and supports both common rules concerning subsidies to services of general interest and demands for fair tendering, including where services of general interest are concerned.
Aid for public activity should, as a matter of principle, also be accounted for and be easily accessible.
The only exception to this rule is in the event of a Member Stateâs having chosen only to make the service available through a monopoly and of its not intending to permit private actors at all (for example, in the event of a Member Stateâs only permitting public health care).
The June List believes, however, that responsibility should mainly lie at Member State level.
If it emerges that one Member State or another is abusing its position and distorting competition, it is important for the party that may have been treated unfairly to be able to have its case examined by the courts.
The June List has therefore chosen to vote against the proposal that the details should be reported to the Commission.
Â Â  . I congratulate the rapporteur.
I should like to highlight the proposed amendment to Article 1 of the Commissionâs draft decision, on the application of Article 86 of the Treaty establishing the European Community.
I would be in favour, however, of extending the range of beneficiaries to cover the outermost regions.
In this connection, I recall that the Commissionâs communications entitled âA stronger partnership for the outermost regionsâ and âA stronger partnership for the outermost regions: assessment and perspectivesâ provided for the introduction of simplified rules for awarding public service contracts in the area of maritime transport serving small islands, with a volume of fewer than 100Â 000 passengers a year.
I also wish to point out that in the outermost regions the liberalisation of services and use of infrastructures were made conditional on the introduction of public service obligations, in order to offset the handicaps due to the physical and other characteristics of the outermost regions.
I should also like to highlight that there are other services of general economic interest of importance to the outermost regions, such as postal services and telecommunications.
Hence the importance to the outermost regions of these two Commission documents.
I therefore feel that the unique situation of these regions must be taken into account in those legal instruments.
Â Â  . Without funding and planning by national, regional and local authorities, we would not have proper public transport, or generally accessible education and health care.
The idea of an authority withdrawing and admitting free competition is pernicious to such vital activities.
If that happens, there will undoubtedly be small privileged groups who consider that they have more freedom of choice and their individual needs are better catered for, but the large majority, and society as a whole, will be worse off.
This report defends the neo-liberal vision, and even wants to set down an interpretation of the Altmark ruling about the possibility of the underhand assignation of concessions in public transport.
The Commission and Parliament have waited for this legal judgment for years, because there was an abundance of contradicting interpretations about authoritiesâ provision of services, about funding and competition.
