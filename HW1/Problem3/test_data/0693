If we cannot do that, we must not be too surprised if the citizens of Europe are rather apathetic about it.
Many colleagues have mentioned the low turnout at the last European elections - 49% overall, 24% in my country.
That is a total disgrace, about which we should hang our heads in shame.
The only consolation I have is that the turnout in the last American presidential elections was only 50%.
So those of us who believe in democracy have a problem.
The solution to that problem is explaining what we do, and that is information policy.
I asked to speak at this ridiculous hour of the night in order to make three simple points.
I speak, not just as a Member of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, which is interested in information, but also as a Member of the Committee on Petitions.
We received a number of petitions from citizens who are not citizens of the national state in which they live.
They are entitled to vote in European elections but they found that in the last elections they had all sorts of problems: a British citizen living in Germany said that there are 6 000 non-German nationals entitled to vote in their district, but that only 40 did so because they had inadequate information; a Dutch citizen made exactly the same point in a petition about the situation in France.
I am not criticising Germany or France.
I am simply saying that if we want people to vote we have to explain the procedures by which they may do so.
There is a responsibility upon Member States.
They should honour that responsibility and explain to everybody entitled to vote in European elections just how they could do so.
The second point I want to make concerns Euronews.
The way people get their information today is through television.
There is one channel in Europe that provides European information and yet, I have to tell Parliament that this is a channel that is on the verge.
It may succeed - and I hope that it does - and it may not.
If people are going to be interested in Europe, they have to know about it.
They learn about things through television, and we have to see that Euronews manages to succeed.
It seems there is no-one here tonight from the Committee on Budgets, but they are the people who can help make sure that Euronews succeeds.
Thirdly, the Committee on Petitions visited the Danish Parliament last year.
The Danish Parliament said that it likes to provide information about Europe from the national parliament rather than from the European Parliament.
If we can encourage the national parliaments and national authorities to give more information, then we have some hope.
If we do it with a lot of stars, people will say it is only propaganda.
So let us encourage the national parliaments to do the job as effectively as the Danes do.
Mr President, at this hour of the night I should not venture to make a statement.
I would just like very much to thank the Members of the House for the views they have expressed and very briefly to address two or three questions that were raised.
First, we are committed to the strategy of having common houses between the Commission and Parliament.
At the end of next month we will provide Parliament with a report on the state of play as far as creating those common houses are concerned.
We will have, on that occasion, the opportunity to discuss the issue that Mr Andreasen has raised.
As far as television is concerned, according to our polls 64% of European citizens recognise that whatever they know about the European Union comes from television.
That is why we have launched a common invitation to tender for an audiovisual strategy to cover the issues concerning enlargement and the future of Europe.
We are pursuing the feasibility study on the Europe channel.
We have been in close contact with the services of the European Parliament and we are also following the evolution of the European audiovisual public sector, including the situation of Euronews, to have an overall picture and a better assessment of what we can do in the audiovisual sector, including television, to provide more information to the citizens.
Finally, as Mr Karas said, the strategy cannot be developed just by the central institutions of the European Union.
The challenge ahead of us is to build a partnership with the Member States, with regional and local authorities, to promote information about the Union.
That partnership requires mutual confidence and a change in the culture of communication.
Of course, as you have said, if Europe is made the scapegoat for everything that goes wrong, it will be extremely difficult to portray what we do in a positive light.
But at the end of the day I hope that Member States will understand that if they carry on with such a strategy, sooner or later, when they have to ask for the consent of citizens for the European project, they will be the first victims to fall to the ground.
Therefore I hope that this strategy will improve step by step.
I am optimistic because, for the first time, the Council has engaged in close interinstitutional cooperation with Parliament and the Commission to develop information and communication strategies on the most important subjects.
That partnership, which is on a voluntary basis, will start producing concrete results.
Those Member States that produce concrete results will be the guiding light for the others to follow.
We will succeed.
Thank you, Commissioner Vitorino.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Announcement by the President
Self-evidently none of these were points of order, but they reflect the deep concern of colleagues and so I was prepared to take them.
As regards today's business, as you know, we are about to begin a joint debate on two reports and ten recommendations, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, with regard to the most ambitious enlargement in the history of the European Union.
It is, in the life of our Parliament, and in the life of the European Union, one of the most significant votes that elected representatives have been called upon to take.
I have to tell you, with considerable regret, that I have been informed by the Inter-Trade Union Committee of the European Parliament that it has decided to organise a strike today at 11 a.m. to coincide with this debate.
I want to tell you that I altered my schedule on Monday night here in Strasbourg in order to meet with the representatives of the Inter-Trade Union Committee.
I indicated to them my willingness to intervene at the highest level with the other institutions to express the concerns that they had drawn to my attention.
I want to point out that they have no dispute at this time with the Parliament as their employer.
Indeed Parliament, as an institution, is perhaps their closest ally in terms of respecting the interests they expressed to me.
Nonetheless, I was not prepared to make this intervention under duress and invited my interlocutors from the Inter-Trade Union Committee to suspend the proposed action.
I was informed yesterday afternoon that they intend to proceed.
It is to be deeply regretted that the work of parliamentary democracy, at a time like this, should be called into question.
I am not sure precisely what will happen at 11 a.m. today.
I would like to appeal to you as colleagues in the House for your understanding and your assistance at that time.
Should it be the case that some of the ordinary facilities which surround our debates are not available, it would still be my preference to ensure that our parliamentary engagement should continue if possible.
I guarantee you that the debate that we have today will be translated with urgency into all the languages so that should there be any breakdown in the ordinary procedures for interpretation - although it would not be optimum nor entirely consistent with the Rules of Procedure - I will use every endeavour to inform people in all languages at the earliest stage.
This is a choice for Members of the House.
Members are entitled to invoke the Rules and insist that the President suspend the sitting in the event that not all the facilities are available.
I do not yet know what the case will be, but in the context of what we are doing today, our political duty, if we can, is to proceed with our business with serenity.
I invite you to cooperate in doing so, in voting at midday as we plan, and to keep our rendezvous with European history.
Thank you, Mr President, for handling matters in this way.
Let me say this in all seriousness to all the staff and officials of this House: where your legitimate interests are at stake, we are on your side, but do not use this historic day, when the admission of ten countries to the European Union is at stake, as the occasion for enforcing interests that may or may not be legitimate.
We have to do proper work today, we have to vote, and I ask you to discharge your great responsibility so that we may be able to do our duty.
Mr President, it is a practice both in trade union and in other negotiations to use one's strength at a time when it is calculated to cause the most difficulty for those with whom one is in dispute.
But in Parliament we rarely have days or votes of such significance as today.
The action being threatened by the unions does not reflect fairly the mutual respect which exists within the House between the different partners, or indeed the good relations that we have generally enjoyed.
You are right to proceed with our business and I would appeal to the staff of the House to assist us in carrying through today's historic task with the maximum goodwill on their part.
Mr President, I would like to support you on behalf of the Socialist Group, while pointing out that we have fought bravely with the groups in this House, in the desire to include the right to strike in the Charter of Fundamental Rights and for this Charter to be incorporated into the European Constitution.
From this point of view, we respect the exercise of the right to strike.
But we also appeal to the responsibility of the workers of Parliament's administration to in turn respect the event taking place today.
We therefore believe, Mr President, that we must continue with our agenda at this historic moment.
I deeply appreciate those sentiments.
With all the respect that we have for staff we must also respect, if we can, our own prerogative as parliamentarians.
I should like to welcome to the diplomatic gallery the ambassadors and diplomatic representatives of all the candidate countries.
They are here to follow our debate.
The next item is the joint debate on the following:

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, please permit me to start my statement with an expression of thanks to the staff of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy and also to the staff of the groups, who, over the past years - just as much as the rapporteurs on the individual countries - have taken such trouble in dealing with this issue in depth, so that we have always been enabled, by broad majorities, to do justice to our task.
Please allow me also to express my appreciation for the good cooperation with the Commission's successful negotiator, and thank Commissioner Verheugen personally for this cooperation.
With the task we have given ourselves today, it is in our hands whether this continent is reunited or not.
It is now for us, after centuries of disputes between them, not to abolish the nation states, but to bring them together in such a way that they will never again be able to wage war upon each other.
We are in a position to extend the area of stability, peace and prosperity, which we have had in Western Europe over recent decades, to Central and Eastern Europe, and to do this, not by any sort of coercion, but by the free decision of the peoples.
At the same time, we are in a position to bring this European continent together in such a way that it will not only have the strength that comes from peace at home, but will also be able, in the outside world, to manage peacekeeping tasks and to defend its own interests.
We therefore wish to specifically remind all present and future Member States of Article 11 of the Treaty of Nice, which contains the obligation to work together on foreign issues too, in a spirit of solidarity.
This point is, I believe, of particular significance at the present time.
Let me also, at this point, make an observation as a German.
This enlargement of the European Union will mean that my country will no longer have an external border, with the exception of the border with Switzerland, and thus no border that could be fought over in war or be the occasion of conflict.
What this, in terms of our history, means for my people is something I do not need to enlarge upon in this place.
I believe that we are thereby fulfilling the wishes of Konrad Adenauer, who once said that Germany had to be led out of its geographical situation by political means.
I believe it to be also the best thing we can do for peaceful development, and, at this time, I would also like to thank those from the peoples about to join us who have stretched out their hands to us.
It is those hands that we grasp in order thereby to bring the peoples closer together, even though governments have not, in all areas, always grasped what that means.
In this context, let me also thank the President of the Czech Republic, Vaclav Klaus, for his statement in March of this year.
There is still much to be done, however.
The candidate countries will be obliged to make further substantial progress in the areas of administration, a competent judiciary, the combating of corruption and the guaranteeing of minority rights.
The monitoring process that is to be set in motion will need to be closely accompanied by the European Parliament, in order thereby to ensure that the acquis communautaire can be adhered to in every case, allowance being of course made for teething troubles and the transitional arrangements that also have be built in.
This will also involve, in the same way, the citizens of the European Union acquiring the same rights, with no possibility of discrimination remaining, with legal protection from discrimination, which also provides a crucial security.
It is for these reasons that it makes sense to bring the peoples of Europe together in this way.
I believe it to be extraordinarily important that I should say, in this context, that the European Union can of course be extended to include more countries, and Bulgaria and Romania are waiting for this.
This enlargement, though, requires of us that we determine anew how large this European Union can become without it taking on too much.
We have created a Union which is something entirely new when set alongside all alliances, that being a Union that makes conflict resolution within a state into an instrument for resolving conflicts between peoples.
Its common legal order and its shared institutions mean that it is no ordinary alliance like those that formerly existed.
If we are to say that the European Union can go thus far, but cannot manage any further, that has to be said after we have seen just what this quasi-State is capable of.
In addition to that, we have to continue with the reflections recently initiated by the Commission, as to how we then organise our relations with our neighbours, preventing the development of new walls in Europe, and enabling those who cannot be Member States of the European Union, or do not want to be, to enjoy a privileged position as neighbours with whom we can coexist in peace.
On behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, I wish to call upon you to approve the accession of all ten countries today.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we managed at the very last minute to reach a compromise on the adjustment of the Financial Perspective for 2004-2006 and thus to guarantee our ability, today, to do justice to our historic responsibility whilst at the same time defending this House's budgetary powers and rights of codecision.
As the Committee on Budgets' rapporteur on the financial arrangements for enlargement, I want again to make it clear that these difficult negotiations have never been about calling into question the Copenhagen agreements with the candidate countries, but about treating them as a minimum to be guaranteed also by us.
So let me say again, loud and clear, that we, the European Parliament, in our previous resolutions - for example in June and September of last year - have, again and again, lent massive support to certain proposals by the Commission, for example the candidate countries' progressive integration into the common agricultural policy, and, for another example, the special cohesion rules for them.
The fact is that we have managed, at the very last minute, to avert an interinstitutional crisis, one into which the Council had manoeuvred us either deliberately or by negligence, by its intention that Annex XV should be given the status of EU primary law.
It would surely not have done them any harm to keep on negotiating, right up to second reading, on the adjustment of the Financial Perspective, or even, if necessary, to go back to Article 272 of the Treaty, but many people out there might have taken this to be the wrong signal.
The compromise before us has been brought about, after a fifth trialogue, by the use of what I have to call legal artifice, and by renovation and repair in a process that we are unable to properly explain to anyone out there.
I might add that this is evidence of how necessary it is to reform the way the institutions act in relation to each other.
Commissioner Schreyer, I would like to state openly that you, on Monday evening, made an important contribution on behalf of the Commission, when your great perseverance helped to make this result possible.
I would also like to express my thanks to the Greek Presidency of the Council, which, as what one might call the hostage of the Council's negotiating mandate, did everything humanly possible to the very end of a difficult process, making it possible for us to come to an arrangement.
One thing, though, will be apparent from Mr Brok's resolution, and that is that if even one word of the joint statement is called into question or broken, then the Interinstitutional Agreement, too, lapses and is broken.
(Applause)
We have found a way whereby it is made clear in specific terms that the adjustment of the Financial Perspective on the basis of item 25 of the Interinstitutional Agreement is being carried out on a proposal from the Commission and jointly with the Council and with Parliament.
We have secured for ourselves in Heading 3 on internal policy the necessary leeway for the codecision procedures that have to be seen through in the course of this year - in programmes with added value for Europe, programmes that are important to the public, such as research, Erasmus, Youth for Europe - so that we can then complete codecision in a proper procedure with the supplementary sum of EUR 480 million at 1999 prices.
We also saw it as important to make clear that if, by way of a de facto revision of financial aid for Turkey, sums are transferred from Heading 4 to Heading 7, that heading must in future be entitled Pre-Accession Strategy.
What has been made clear is that there are here, so to speak, two groups of countries - Bulgaria and Romania with pre-accession aid on the one hand, and aid for Turkey as a candidate country on the other.
We also have to clarify again that, in the 2004 Budget procedure, which will now surely run its course in an orderly way, the issue of adjusting the Financial Perspective can be resolved without any sort of discrimination, in sub-headings or by means of capping, against the new Member States.
In a most difficult process, and on the basis of necessary repair work, we have managed to defend all of Parliament's budgetary powers and rights of codecision, while, at the same time, at the end of this difficult process - even though it was almost a dead end - the European institutions have again been able to demonstrate their capacity to act.
This sends a positive message to the candidate countries and to the citizens of Europe.
(Applause)
Mr President, today is a great day, and proof of this is the fact that we have 25 flags accompanying the common European flag.
You know that I am one of those who would like to see just one flag in this House, but today I believe that the presence of all of them is justified.
The budget is not usually an emotive subject.
But I must acknowledge that, particularly perhaps for those of us who have spent more than half our lives under a dictatorship, reaching an agreement today to fund the democratic reunification of Europe is a sensitive and emotional issue.
I must say that everything was going well, apart from what I would consider a mistake on the part of the Council, which tarnished the end of the process and created unnecessary difficulties; the introduction of Annex XV, which had no precedents in previous enlargements.
And the annex affected the basic competences of Parliament.
There were two equally valid alternatives: to consider the presence of Annex XV as an implicit violation of the interinstitutional agreement and act accordingly, pursuant to Article 172 - and this will explain the final vote of certain Members - or to negotiate with the Council.
This is the option Parliament chose, there were tough negotiations, in which we must acknowledge in particular the skill of the chairman of our Committee on Budgets, Mr Wynn, and as a result of which we have reached an entirely acceptable compromise which I will recommend to the House.
We have achieved the objectives set for us and I believe that in some cases we have gone further than adjusting the financial perspectives for the purposes of enlargement.
As rapporteur for many years in this field I would like to stress that this is the first review of the financial perspectives achieved in more than a decade.
We will therefore have a Heading 3 for internal policies, which can operate in the coming years, which is sufficient if not comfortable.
There will be no discrimination between old and new Member States.
We have achieved a declaration from the representatives of the Member States, those who sign the Treaty.
A declaration of an interpretative nature, which preserves the democratic rights of Parliament and of our future colleagues from the new Member States.
Furthermore, we have achieved a new situation for Turkey, in heading 7, which has a dual significance: it contains a political message for that country and it allows us room for manoeuvre within heading 4 on foreign policy.
Therefore, although, to be frank, I would have preferred to remove Annex XV, I am in a position to recommend to the House that you approve this agreement and I believe it will allow the Union and Parliament to move forward in the right direction.
I would like to place on the record my deep appreciation of the work of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy and the colleagues and staff who have brought us to this point today.
Also, in more recent weeks, in addition to the regular burden of work, I should like to draw attention to the extraordinary negotiations that have been conducted by our colleagues in the Committee on Budgets which happily, at the eleventh hour, has produced a satisfactory, if not ideal, outcome to our encounters.
Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, as President-in-Office of the Council of the European Union, I have the honour and pleasure today of addressing the European Parliament on the highly important subject of enlargement and I consider it a privilege to be present today at this debate.
Today is an historic day for the European Union and the European Parliament.
In a week's time, on 16 April, Greece will have the pleasure, as the presiding country, of hosting the historic ceremony of the signing of the Enlargement Treaty, at the historic site of the Ancient Agora beneath the Acropolis.
Despite the present use of the word 'agora' to mean market, the Ancient Agora in Athens has its place in history for another reason. It was here that the concept of democracy was actually born and developed 2500 years ago and the symbolism of this ceremony, which we have chosen to hold on this particular site, lies in the fact that democracy and the many other values linked to democracy are the common denominator which penetrates every corner of the European Union.
We are a community of values and, if the Union and enlargement are a success, it is because these values are going from strength to strength.
The countries about to join the European Union share our common history, heritage and culture.
Their accession marks the end of the artificial division of our continent.
Today we are putting our objective of building a Europe founded on the ideals of democracy, pluralism, the rule of law, respect for human rights and the free market economy into practice.
The European Union has always been committed to this objective.
That is also the reason why, as soon as the Berlin wall fell, the Union responded to the challenge and reacted decisively and proactively to the change in the European political landscape.
It offered a framework and prospects for a unified Europe.
It offered a Europe based on free choice and solidarity between its citizens.
Relations between the Union and the candidate countries have gradually been strengthened through various procedures, association agreements, structured dialogue on a series of issues, accession criteria, accession negotiations and pre-accession mechanisms and procedures.
During all these stages, the European Union's position has very clearly been to safeguard the global, evolutionary and substantial character of the accession process, with all the candidate countries participating on an equal footing and acceding to the European Union with equal opportunities.
At the beginning of accession negotiations, the Union made it perfectly clear that accession implied complete acceptance of the actual and potential rights and obligations connected with the Union and its institutional framework, including in the foreign relations sector, and that accession implied proper, practical application of the acquis communautaire, including the establishment of a reliable working public administration.
Bringing the negotiations to a conclusion was no easy task.
Far-reaching, often painful economic reforms were needed in all the countries which were to accede.
However, thanks to persistence and determination on all sides, these negotiations were conducted in a thorough, efficient and transparent manner and I think that I speak for everyone involved when I say that we are proud of this process and its outcome.
I should like to take this opportunity to offer my special thanks to Mr Verheugen, the Commissioner responsible for the negotiations who is present here today, for his huge contribution to the success of this entire process.
As you know, negotiations with the 10 acceding countries were completed in Copenhagen on 13 December last year.
The terms of accession are common knowledge and are contained in the draft Treaty and in the Accession Act submitted to the European Parliament.
The results of the negotiations do, we feel, reflect the best possible outcome and a fair agreement.
As we pointed out in 1993, the Union must be able to absorb new members without allowing European unification to lose momentum.
The results of negotiations have achieved this institutional equilibrium.
There is a balance between the wish to ensure, on the one hand, that the acceding countries will benefit fully from the various policies of the European Union and the need, on the other, to ensure that the Union will be efficient and competitive within the context of globalisation.
In addition to the Herculean and unprecedented task carried out by the Council and the Commission during this process, I should like to highlight the continuous and important effort also made by the acceding countries.
I should also like to offer my sincere thanks to the European Parliament for the political support it has given us throughout this process.
We particularly appreciate the open and constructive political dialogue with your democratically elected partners in each of the acceding countries.
The work carried out by the joint parliamentary committees was invaluable, as was the work of so many of the parliamentary committees.
It helped enormously in clarifying exactly what accession to the European Union implies for the acceding countries.
Today, all the citizens in the acceding countries are looking towards us.
Some have already expressed their will.
The positive outcome of the referenda in Malta and Slovenia are a clear and decisive sign of their trust in the Europe of tomorrow.
Enlargement gives us every reason to be optimistic about Europe, even in the present climate, with the international economy or the war in Iraq overshadowing developments.
Nonetheless, there are many reasons which justify this optimism.
The European Union as a whole has a healthier basis from an economic and financial point of view, in comparison with much of the rest of the world.
It has succeeded in setting up a pole of relative stability.
It has created a creditable single currency and a common framework within which to exercise a policy which guarantees the reliability of EMU as an international currency pole.
The European Union has developed a Community standard which, despite its diversity, acts as a shield against uncertainty and falling confidence.
The European Union has a unique development model which combines the economic element with a broader spectrum of social elements covering employment, social integration and a whole series of other issues.
The European Union uses delicate manoeuvres to set the renewal of its policies in motion in a series of crucial sectors, such as structural policy or agricultural policy, in order to safeguard its potential for growth, social cohesion and its ability to face up to its international challenges.
The European Union deals with internal concerns by renewing its institutional framework, especially in the sense of extending the process of European integration.
Finally, on a series of issues such as trade, investment flows, the transfer of technology and the movement of workers, enlargement is bringing about new operating conditions for the Union and hence creating new opportunities for the European approach and the European model within the global framework.
I should like to conclude my speech with two comments.
My first comment is that these are tense times.
As Member States, we need to show that we can achieve a rapprochement of views through self-imposed limitations, reciprocal concessions and the political will to support the momentum of the Union, and by strengthening the values of democracy, human rights and solidarity.
Solidarity, of course, means more than negotiating financing under the Structural Funds or protecting the common agricultural policy and other individual questions.
It cuts across a broad range of Union policies.
My second comment is that it is important at this stage for the enlarged Union to succeed on a number of fronts in the immediate future.
We need to repair the damage done by the differences which have arisen in the foreign policy sector and which marked the issue of Iraq.
We need to convince the citizens of the European Union and of countries outside the European Union that we stand for the values of peace, stability, confidence and support for growth and we must make a systematic and sincere effort to repair our relations with all our basic partners.
Ladies and gentlemen, Europe belongs to the citizens of Europe without exception or discrimination.
Everyone has a right to share in this future.
Enlargement brings this vision much closer.
The European Union is ready to receive its new Member States, secure in the knowledge that it is acquiring a new configuration and new momentum, the sort of momentum demonstrated in these countries, during the transitional period, on economic, political and social issues and reforms.
It is incumbent upon all of us to make enlargement a catalyst for faster European unification, a force which will ensure that Europe is able to meet the challenges of a new era of global relations.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, you will today be deciding on one of the most important questions for the future of our continent.
You alone, in the European Parliament, have the right to say yes or no to the accessions of ten new Member States.
No other parliament in Europe will have the opportunity to say yes or no to individual countries; all the others will merely have to ratify the treaty as a whole.
This means that this decision is certainly one of the most important that this House has had to take in all its history.
We are, then, for the time being, at the end of a long, long road, a road marked by the determination to put an end to the division of Europe once and for all.
I am eternally grateful for the way that the European Parliament has never wavered in its support.
I believe that it is worthy of note that the European Parliament was equalled by few in Europe in keeping the open wound of the divided Europe a live issue even during the Cold War, putting the case for a European future in which its peoples could determine their destiny in freedom and by democratic means.
The primary subject of our discussions today is human destiny and the fate of peoples.
Today, we are talking about the people in Europe - over 70 million of them - who have looked forward to this day with boundless hope and expectation, but whose courage and determination have also made straight the way for a free and united Europe.
These peoples naturally belong among us, and they have earned their place in our midst.
These millions of people have for many years shouldered the burden of difficult and radical reforms and changes in order to build modern societies.
If I might take a sideways glance at reform policy or discussion about reforms in one or other existing Member State, my comment is that I wish those Member States implemented reforms with at least some of the strength, courage and determination that we have found in the future Member States.
Who are the peoples we are talking about?
What will they bring to the European Union?
The Poles have their thousand years of history as a European nation that, being obliged to live under Communist hegemony and martial law for many years, never even for one day resigned itself to its fate, but instead defended themselves, becoming the undoubted originators of the great movement in Central and Eastern Europe that eventually led to the total collapse of Communist rule in Europe.
We are talking about the Hungarians, who rose up as long ago as 1956.
Last week, I was speaking in Hungary, and in my speech I said that no doubt all European politicians of my generation still had the cries for help from the leaders of the 1956 Hungarian uprising ringing in our ears, that we could not forget them, and that these cries for help even today, fifty years later, still represented a beacon for the European democracies.
Fifty years had to pass before we could give the right response.
We are talking about the Slovaks and the Czechs, whose attempt, in 1968, to change the course of European history resulted in much suffering for them, and who, with Charter 77, also made a significant intellectual contribution to freeing Europe from totalitarianism and dictatorship.
We are talking about the Lithuanians, the Latvians and the Estonians, victims of the Second World War whom nobody had asked whether they wanted to be part of the Soviet Union, who, for decades worked desperately to maintain their national and cultural identity in the face of a policy of Russification, and who succeeded in doing so.
When one person or another says, as they sometimes do, that we have to take great care not to accept new Member States that might not share our values, I am sometimes tempted to ask who it was who once, unarmed, faced up to Soviet tanks!
That happened in Vilnius, just over ten years ago.
We are talking about Slovenia, a country that tried to go its own way even in the days when Tito ruled Yugoslavia, which, as soon as Communism had collapsed in Yugoslavia, set a determined course for Europe and which, having secured 90% support in a referendum on accession to the European Union, has shown how attractive our Europe still is to young nations.
Lastly, we are talking about Malta and Cyprus, two countries that want to join with us in maintaining and defending our common values and objectives in the Mediterranean.
Those are the countries and peoples of whom we speak.
You, honourable Members, have for many years accompanied these countries on their journey towards the European Union.
I can only confirm what has already been said here.
As regards the strategy and the individual steps, there was close understanding between the Commission, the European Parliament and the Council.
I am deeply grateful for the constructive teamwork that this made possible.
There is no doubt that the success of the project depended on it.
For me, then, to say a word of thanks to you, Mr President, is not a required formality, for I really do feel profoundly indebted to you, to the Group Presidents, to the rapporteur and chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, to the rapporteurs on the individual countries and to the joint chairs of the joint parliamentary committees.
All of you have made an important and indispensable contribution to the success that we have achieved.
You have not always made things easy for me, but that is not what Parliament is for.
I would, though, like to say that your observations, your interventions and also your criticisms have helped to highlight problems more clearly and enable common solutions to them to be found.
The President-in-Office of the Council has observed that we are now on the threshold of signing the Accession Treaties, which is due to be done on 16 April in Athens.
He has already mentioned the great symbolic significance of this place.
It is not only where democracy was given to the world, but also the source of a few other old European ideas, such as the idea that societies must be governed justly, and the idea that it is the responsibility of individuals that holds a community together.
Those are a few ideas that we are not keen to abandon.
However old they may be, they are still tremendously up to date.
In this place, we are showing how Europe's national identities and cultures, which we value so much and which we want to defend, arise and flourish from strong common roots.
Once the Accession Treaty is signed, it will have to be ratified.
I am firmly confident that the referendums to be held in the future Member States will all produce an unambiguous and convincing yes to Europe, showing that the European project is gaining new impetus and new dynamism.
I do not envisage any insuperable political difficulties resulting from the ratification process in the individual Member States, and am confident that ratification will be completed in due time.
I would nonetheless like to reiterate the need for efforts at communicating with the public and informing them to be stepped up, so that the citizens in the Member States may really know what is going on.
While we are not running an election campaign, we are ready to inform, to explain and to answer the questions that citizens are quite entitled to ask.
This is where I have to say something again about Cyprus. It is something I have said before; that it really is deeply sad that we have got to within centimetres of the goal, but have ended up not managing to find a political solution to the Cyprus question.
The chances of resolving the conflict in Cyprus have never been as great or as strong as they are now, but we must not abandon our efforts.
I again want to underline the Commission's willingness to support any further efforts by the United Nations to find even now a lasting political solution to the Cyprus problem.
The Commission will therefore do whatever it can to promote projects in Cyprus that help to reduce and alleviate the increasing disparities on the island and to foster trust between the two - Greek and Turkish - communities there.
The work in the candidate countries is not yet complete.
Reforms have to be proceeded with and no effort must be spared in pressing on with preparations for accession.
I can assure you that the Commission will monitor very closely how commitments made in the course of negotiations are implemented.
Six months prior to the accession date, that is, this autumn, the Commission will submit a comprehensive monitoring report, in which we will list in detail the areas in which safety precautions might be considered if omissions are not rectified in due time.
A first phase of monitoring has already been completed, and its results were, I might add, remarkable when one considers the thousands of undertakings that had been given; having examined these, we found only 25 instances in which we had asked future Member States to take urgent action in order to avoid delays.
That adds up to a very good result. Apart from that, I am able to inform Parliament that in all these instances, the measures requested by us have now been taken.
I have this to say to the future Member States. The development of efficient administration and of a properly functioning judicial system must, even after accession, be continued with and supported.
The fight against corruption and criminality continues to be of fundamental importance.
The upholding of human rights and the protection of minorities are still on the agenda.
Although many countries have succeeded in coming a long way, some issues remain open and there are still challenges of which the enlarged Union must remain aware.
The same applies to the actual implementation of equality of opportunity, an area that still causes me some concern, not only in the new Member States, but also in one or two of the present ones.
This is about what impact the transformation of a society has on its weakest members.
Whilst I am sure that the European Parliament will, today, open the door wide to the ten new Member States, I am also aware that, at the moment of decision, not everyone in this House, and not all the European public at large, will be completely free of doubts about the enlargement process.
Some may wonder what we are letting ourselves in for, and others whether the Union will be put under too great a strain.
To this I would like to respond by saying that it is true that the integration we have achieved to date has been a success, and that we have gained peace, reconciliation and prosperity.
At the same time, though, we in Europe have had to pay a high price, especially those whom the end of the Second World War, and its political consequences, obliged to live behind the Iron Curtain.
It is they who have had to pay for it all, for Europe, divided, knew no real peace and only incomplete freedom.
Only now have we been handed this opportunity by the peoples of Central and Eastern Europe, who never reconciled themselves to being cut off from the free part of this continent.
So I do believe that we must now seize this opportunity to shape the future in such a way that twenty-first century Europe will be characterised by peace and freedom, security and prosperity.
So let me give straight answers to these crucial questions.
Are the new Member States sufficiently prepared, both politically and economically?
To that, I say that this is the best-prepared enlargement in the history of the EU.
The prospect of enlargement was combined with a far-reaching reform process in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, and gave direction to this transformation.
Not everything will be perfect, and I can predict that there will be difficulties, but the Commission is firmly convinced that the Community's policies and programmes will work even when there are twenty-five Member States.
Will the new Member States support further integration, or will integration grind to a halt?
The answer is perfectly clear.
It is in the interests of the new Member States to want a strong Community.
They will strengthen, rather than weaken, the Community idea, and they deceive themselves who believe that we are being joined by Member States who will eventually cause the European Union to revert to being a free trade area.
This is what will not happen; rather, what we will be getting is new enthusiasm, new zest and new dynamism.
Do the new Member States understand that Europe is a community of values rather than a system for transferring money?
To this, too, the answer is clearly 'yes'.
I made that clear earlier when I briefly spoke about the past that the new Member States have behind them.
They do not need us to give them lessons in democracy.
They are also, of course, counting on solidarity, but is not the least consideration that such solidarity is equally in our own interest?
I know that the new members will not pursue narrow national interests.
Will the new Member States allow themselves to be part of a common European foreign policy?
Here too, I say 'yes', an emphatic 'yes'!
The problems we have had in recent months did not come about because the new Member States did not want to fall in line; they arose because we could not answer the question of what was the common European position to which they might adhere.
(Applause)
What this means for the new Member States is clear. It means that only a strong common foreign policy can protect them from such conflicts, and that is why they are all in favour of such a combined approach.
The last question, honourable Members, is one we must ask of ourselves.
Are we ourselves sufficiently prepared?
My answer to that has to be more tentative.
From the technical point of view, we are.
All the decisions the organisation of enlargement requires have been taken, but I do believe that enlargement means that reforms which would have been urgent in any case, have now become even more urgent and must not on any account be further delayed.
That is why the Convention's work is so important and must be crowned with success.
There are those who say that it would have been better to do all this beforehand.
That may be so, but I know that we could not leave the European peoples, who have for thirteen years been preparing for this great moment, waiting any longer.
To them I say that the European home into which they are due to move is not yet ready.
They now have the opportunity to join in the discussions and decisions on what that home should actually look like.
By the time the ten new Member States have joined us, we will have made further progress in negotiations with Romania and Bulgaria.
Both are approaching the goal.
There will very soon be 27 of us, and only then will the present enlargement round be over.
Helsinki, in 1999, saw the door opened to Turkey, which, in Copenhagen, last December, was given the political road map.
The decision on whether or not Turkey meets the political conditions for accession will be taken at the end of next year.
I encourage Turkey to keep on its course towards Europe, and the Commission can be relied upon to make a fair and objective judgment.
The Balkan countries have prospects of accession.
The time it will take to turn these prospects into reality will be dependent on their own efforts to carry out reforms.
Honourable Members, whilst the imminent enlargement does not guarantee Europe political and economic strength, it does improve our chances and make us more able to fit Europe to the challenges of the twenty-first century and to offer its citizens a century of peaceful development, personal freedom and individual opportunity.
Now that, today, the decision is upon us, I therefore ask you to vote in favour!
(Applause)
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Verheugen, ladies and gentlemen, this is a momentous and historic day, a day of great joy and of profound gratitude.
Let me speak personally; it is my privilege to have been a Member of this Parliament since 1979.
If, when Parliament was first directly elected, someone had told me: 'On 9 April 2003, you will decide whether the three Soviet republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, the Warsaw Pact states Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, and Slovenia, and then also Malta and Cyprus, will join the European Union', I would have said in reply, 'That is a tremendous dream, that is a fantastic vision.'
Yet this dream, this vision, is now becoming reality, and let us be deeply grateful for it and rejoice!
We also think back over Europe's history, for we cannot shape the future unless we know the past.
Our thoughts go back to the terrible, criminal years of National Socialism from 1933 to 1945.
We think back to 17 June 1953, to the Soviet tanks in Budapest in 1956 and in Prague in 1968, and cast our minds back to the great freedom movements of the 1980s, remembering Solidarity, the popular desire for freedom in Central and Eastern Europe, and 9 November 1989, the day when the wall came down.
Robert Schuman - whose name our Chamber bears - said, as long ago as the 1960s: 'One day, all Europeans will belong to the European Community, to the European Union, in freedom and in peace.'
Our group has always had that as its objective.
I would like to extend my sincere thanks to all those who have played their part in this, above all to Mr Brok for his work as rapporteur, but also to the Committee on Budgets' rapporteurs, Mr BÃ¶ge and Mr Colom i Naval, and also to all in the Commission, whom you, Commissioner Verheugen, represent.
The candidate countries can now look back on the massive efforts they have accomplished, but there are still more massive efforts ahead of them.
Above all else, we must bring Europe together and reconcile it, both morally and intellectually.
It is for that reason that we would have very much welcomed it if the Czech Government under their great President Vaclav Havel and his successor Vaclav Klaus, had had the strength and the courage to utter even one word of regret and sorrow about the people who were expelled.
We have to use truth to bring about reconciliation, and now we all have to look to the future together.
To those who believe that our European home is not yet finished and that they should therefore not give their approval to enlargement, I say this: we have succeeded in bringing the Convention into being, and we will work hard to get us a European constitution soon, and to set all Europeans on their shared journey into the future on the basis of law.
A quite overwhelming majority in our group - it is almost unanimous - says 'yes' to every one of these countries, bidding them welcome to the European Union, to our community of values.
Let us, together, take into the future this old Europe, which keeps on renewing itself!
That is what we want for our continent.
(Applause)
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I would like to thank you for your work and congratulate your team.
Ladies and gentlemen, today we have a date with history, with our future as Europeans.
We are at the gates of the greatest enlargement we have seen.
My group, the Group of the European Socialist Party, will vote to fling these gates wide-open so that we can take a great qualitative leap forward, allowing the majority of the population and the surface area of our continent to be reunited, thereby increasing its wealth and diversity.
We have put the use of pre-emptive war as a pretext, and wars of conquest, which desolated our continent for centuries, behind us.
We have established peace as our rule and a shared destiny as the solution and this is enshrined in a Union based on common values, respect for human rights, good governance and the rule of law.
It is a secular union in which there is separation between the secular and the religious and respect for religious beliefs.
The President-in-Office of the Council has said that we are going to hold this event next week in the Agora in Athens, which reflects democracy and the market - which is where we began.
I would also like to remind him of our debt to the Middle East - and not just in a religious sense - the oldest legal text we know of is the Code of Hammurabi, from Mesopotamia.
This date will clearly be established as a political milestone in the history of our Union, overcoming Munich and Yalta.
Europe is being reborn as a geographical and political unit, fulfilling the words of Willy Brandt on German reunification 'Jetzt wÃ€cht zusammen was zusammen gehÃ¶rt' [Now what belongs together, is growing together].
I would also like to point out, as a personal memory, that 12 years ago, as President of the European Parliament, I announced the award of the Sakharov Prize to Alexander Dubcek, who was a political prisoner, and a year later he received that prize in this Parliament.
And Walesa, who was a dissident, also visited Parliament a year later as President of Poland.
This is the leap we have taken and now we have to complete it by ensuring that we genuinely have a shared destiny and solidarity.

This is not the end of our journey but rather a beginning, and ours is an unprecedented superproject, an enormous challenge for all of us in which we have to overcome doubts, frustrations and fears, particularly at a time when there is a tremendous irony of history and great concern amongst our fellow citizens about the unilateralism of the Bush administration, which has caused great upheaval in the European Union, even though the United States has been one of the decisive elements in the creation of this Union.
There are some in this House who believe we should recover our unity and repair what has been broken before enlarging.
Others fear that there will be more division.
I would like to say on behalf of my group that we believe, following Copenhagen, that pacta sunt servanda, that we must respect our commitments.
And also say to the new partners that they are not responsible for our internal quarrels, but that what we have to do is to build together with a view to the future, in a spirit of solidarity, overcoming national egotism through Community solidarity.
If the President-in-Office of the Council will allow me to make a proposal, next Wednesday, 16 April, in the Agora, there will be a great ceremony with our Heads of State and Government, the fifteen current ones and the ten who are joining us; why do you not round off this ceremony with a joint European statement based on our values?
That is, propose a common will on the part of all of us to deal with the future of the Iraqi people, firstly through humanitarian aid and then by ensuring their future within the framework of the United Nations.
I believe that would be the icing on the cake to conclude that important ceremony.
I would suggest that you say this to President Simitis, I believe it would be very important.
And this would allow us to make progress with the European project, to move towards a united Europe that really works.
Please allow me, Mr President, to refer to overcoming the budgetary conflict.
I would like to thank the chairman of the Committee on Budgets, as well as the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, and all the rapporteurs who have been able to find a new approach to a problem which could have led to a very difficult situation within this House, and which could, furthermore, have dramatically altered and reduced the powers of the European Parliament.
I believe that if we vote yes this week - and my group is in favour - we will achieve a stronger and more cooperative Europe, reinforcing our foundations by means of a Constitution, which will allow the tree of the old Europe to blossom once again and we will be able to guarantee peace for us and for our children and also consolidate peace throughout the world.
Mr President, this is in truth an historic day.
I feel proud to be able to stand here in the Chamber on this solemn occasion when we are voting in favour of ten new countries' being invited to become members of our European Community.
It is an historic day for Europe.
For the first time, we are uniting almost the whole of the continent by peaceful means - through agreements, compromises and treaties, rather than through war and conquest.
It is an historic day for the European Parliament, which for so long has supported and given impetus to the whole enlargement process.
The number of Member States is to increase from 15 to 25, and the number of MEPs from 626 to 732.
In just a month's time, when our future fellow MEPs come here as observers, we shall be given an initial foretaste of what this will be like.
It is an historic day too for the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party.
We have been passionately committed to enlargement.
As long as three years ago, we began inviting future MEPs here as 'virtual MEPs' so that they might become familiar with our work here in Parliament.
Perhaps we are the only group in Parliament that is unanimously and enthusiastically voting in favour of all ten countries, a fact I am very proud of.
We shall be pleased to welcome our friends as fellow MEPs in order to be able to work together with them for a better future for the people of Europe.
A unified Europe will give us incredible opportunities to work for peace, stability and democracy throughout the continent, to combat environmental pollution and cross-border crime and to increase the prosperity of all our people.
The new countries will bring fresh and novel perspectives and ideas to bear in order to improve cooperation and give it new impetus.
To help us do this, the Convention will, moreover, give us a constitution within the institutional framework.
Despite the fact that matters may be rather chaotic to begin with, something extremely good will emerge if we only have patience.
There is a famous Swedish poem that includes the words 'chaos is God's neighbour', and that is something that rings true today.
The EU will be involved in a constant process of enlargement for many years to come, so it is just as well that we get used to the idea.
In common with other MEPs, we are naturally anxious about the dÃ©bÃ¢cle involving the way in which the Council dealt with the budget and the interinstitutional agreement.
I want to thank those fellow MEPs who have enabled us to find a solution.
It has never been possible, however, to use such matters as arguments for voting against the accession of the candidate countries.
Even if we deplore the fact that we in Europe have not been able to agree upon a common policy where the Iraq crisis is concerned, it would have been profoundly immoral to hold the people of the candidate countries hostage on account of what their governments have said or done.
How can we expect the candidate countries to support an EU policy when no such policy exists?
Despite the fact that we are all voting 'yes' today, we are not uncritical.
There are still a number of problems and shortcomings in the candidate countries, for example when it comes to respect for minorities and the fight against corruption.
That is something emphasised by Commissioner Vanheugen.
We also deeply regret the fact that it was impossible to reach an agreement on Cyprus, so that a unified island might have joined the EU.
We take it for granted that all the candidate countries will use the time remaining before they become full members to tackle environmental issues, to work on improving legal certainty and the protection of minorities, to fight corruption more effectively and to make efforts to combat the high incidence of human trafficking.
Following enlargement, we expect to see mechanisms devised for making sure that all the Member States, new as well as old, respect and comply with the values for which the EU stands.
Liberals will never be silent wherever violations of human rights and the rule of law are committed.
Mr President, the great majority of my group will vote to allow the Accession Treaty for the ten new countries to be signed.
We cannot however approve Mr Brok's report on the conclusions of the negotiations between the European Union and the candidate countries.
You may ask why we are voting in this way.
If Parliament were not to vote in favour of enlargement, the candidate countries would automatically be shut out of the Union, regardless of the views of the citizens of the countries in question.
Whatever we think of the circumstances surrounding enlargement today, we believe the people of each of the countries concerned should have a free choice on the matter.
On the other hand, the Council's show of force on the budget aside, adopting the Brok report would amount to awarding a gold star to the fifteen Member States for the way in which the enlargement negotiations were conducted and concluded.
This is precisely where the shoe pinches.
In our opinion, we will need, sooner or later, to change the fundamental objectives of the current enlargement process and European integration as a whole.
We agree with Mr Brok that enlargement can help to build, I quote, 'an ever-closer union among the states and peoples of Europe'. It will allow disagreements to be dealt with through negotiations within the common institutions, so promoting peace and security in Europe.
Enlargement will also, I quote, 'assure influence for the citizens of Europe' in world politics. We therefore support enlargement.
I am very much afraid, however, that this is merely wishful thinking and that the basic issues concerning the future of Europe are not being addressed.
This is why Mr Brok is delighted with, I quote, 'the consensual outcome of negotiations'.
We should ask ourselves whether the outcome really is a consensual one.
It may have proved consensual in official meetings, but what about the feelings of the people of the countries in question?
Has the House forgotten about the candidate countries' vehement rejection of the stance of the Fifteen on support for agriculture, the obvious inadequacy of credits available until 2006 and the restrictions on the free movement of people?
Has the House never been asked for the liberal acquis imposed on the candidate countries to take better account of their social problems, the employment situation, the fragile nature of their economies and specific national issues?
Each country has its own history.
The Copenhagen criteria require countries to have 'the capacity to cope with competitive pressures and market forces within the Union'. For the sake of this requirement, these countries have in fact been pushed into privatising and jeopardising many industries and into liberalising trade, even if this meant creating a huge commercial deficit.
Low salaries have become a comparative advantage in the competitive market.
The market was increased but people's rights were not.
Where will this leave Europe if we allow enlargement to 25 members to proceed in this way?
Furthermore, if Europe does not have the confidence of the peoples of the Union, how can it hope to have an influence in world affairs?
In fact, this experience compels us to open a great public debate, both in Member States and candidate countries. This debate must engage society as a whole, not just governments.
We must consider what kind of Europe we wish to present on the international stage, faced with the unwavering and bellicose unilateralism of the United States.
We must consider how best to move from a Europe based on liberalism, towards a Europe truly based on social values and solidarity.
The House should also contemplate how to reform our institutions to involve citizens in the great process of the transformation of Europe.
We should take account of these questions when it comes to the main items on the agenda for 2004, namely enlargement, the new treaty and the European elections. We should campaign on them everywhere from Strasbourg to Warsaw, and from Helsinki to Nicosia!
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have been told that we are making history so many times this morning, but given the number of Members present in the House, it would appear we are doing so on the quiet.
There are more people on the terraces than in the Hemicycle itself.
We clearly find these historic moments difficult, but that is another story.
Moreover, it has been said that it is clear that the longed-for unification of Europe currently underway, is the result of struggle of the peoples of Eastern Europe against totalitarianism, just as post-war Europe resulted from the war the peoples of Europe waged against the Fascist regimes that had dominated the continent.
European unification was therefore based on the constitutional and constituent concepts we hold dear, namely democracy and anti-totalitarianism.
I do not believe there is anyone in this House who would not subscribe to this idea. Our group will therefore vote unanimously in favour of all the countries on the list today joining the European Union.
The societies of the countries of Eastern Europe who are about to join the Union are both fascinating and riven by suffering.
These societies are both reformist and conformist.
They expect the European Union to herald a European way of life.
They want a better future.
In part, they hope their democracies will gain the stability they need.
This is why I believe the House must, without any reservations, vote to demonstrate its overwhelming support for enlargement.
The issue is more complicated when it comes to discussing our capacity for enlargement. I cannot fully subscribe to Commissioner Verheugen's proposals on this.
Some members of my group will vote against the Brok report because they do not think we are up to this historic challenge.
We have not been able to establish the deeper Union we need for enlargement to be successful.
There are a number of relevant examples.
At issue are not only agricultural subsidies but also our failure to reform the CAP because of selfish national interests.
We have failed to create a social Europe because of selfish national interests.
We have been unable to come together not just on monetary policy, but also on social and political issues.
On this historic day, it is important to encapsulate the surreal situation in which we find ourselves today into a single sentence.
After what could be termed an 'institutional rape' we have been forced to agree on a historic issue within the scope of a common declaration that in essence says 'in fact it was not too serious and it did not do any harm'.
This is how we are establishing the Europe of tomorrow.
I would stress that it is our future that it is at stake, over and above the turns this three-way discussion that has gone on for days has taken.
Our future can be encapsulated in a single phrase: do we want to be revolutionaries or conservatives?
We cannot have it both ways.
The situation is very simple.
If we want to want to keep the Europe of the Fifteen as it is today, enlargement will cause a crisis. We will experience terrible difficulties because it just will not work.
It would be sheer folly to believe a Council of 25 members could ever reach unanimous agreement.
It would be sheer folly to believe unanimity could ever be reached on complicated matters, and especially on foreign policy. In his report, Mr Brok, explains that transatlantic relations must be strengthened.
I would agree with this, but only on condition that these relations are totally remodelled.
An enlarged Europe will be completely different from that which emerged from the 1950s.
An enlarged Europe will be an independent and autonomous body; and I hope it will be proud to be so.
Such a Europe must make the United States change its attitude on one key issue. The Americans must realise that Europe is not an ally who will unthinkingly and inevitably follow their lead.
They must realise that we will only support them when we think we should.
They have to understand that when we in Europe want to say no, we will say no.
This point is not included in the Brok report. Anyone who has been to the United States will know the Americans find the concept difficult to understand.
I would therefore like to say this: anyone who votes in favour of enlargement today, anyone who supports the need for enlargement, must also support the establishment of an agreement on the fundamental reform of today's Europe.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the worst has been averted.
We have been participants in this psychological drama for a number of days now, a number of weeks indeed.
Parliament was certainly entitled to demand the reestablishment of those prerogatives that had been somewhat limited. Nevertheless, at the same time, I am happy that good sense has prevailed.
If we had not been able to surmount the difficulties surrounding the decision we have to make today, it would have been a real snub for the whole of the European Union. It would have left those countries wishing to join the Union feeling rejected and isolated yet again.
My group responded favourably to the proposal before us this morning.
Almost all members will vote in favour.
Only one member will abstain on the issue.
We are fully aware of the implications of our votes. In voting, we want, on the one hand, to heal the scars on the body of the old Europe, which, as has been said, are the terrible consequence of war.
On the other hand, we also want to put right an old injustice. These candidate countries, which found themselves on the other side of the Iron Curtain after the Yalta conference, lost both their independence and cultural identity.
Now these have at last been regained.
As I have said before in this House, I count myself among those who think that when the Berlin Wall came down we should have demonstrated our joy at this in immediately opening our doors to the countries of Eastern Europe. I am sorry this did not happen; it would have been in line with our traditions.
I was afraid that we would allow ourselves to get bogged down in interminable bureaucratic discussions.
Thankfully, these have now been concluded.
We have therefore arrived at the decision we will take today, that will allow us to heal the old scars.
As I have just said, the peoples of the candidate countries lost their cultural identities under their old regimes. We are glad that these identities have now been re-established and that they will bring about significant change to the European Union when they join.
I do not know if everyone understands the consequences of this. I believe this step will promote freedom and cooperation between countries, but that the concept of federalism will lose ground.
I am delighted at this prospect.
I would like to point out that if, by any chance, we had been unable to overcome the difficulties arising from the latest arduous discussions, we would have been held up for public ridicule.
We must therefore welcome the positive solution we have finally achieved, even if it does not entirely satisfy everyone.
Parliament will have other opportunities to defend its prerogatives.
In any case, what had do be done, will have been done.
Europe will be reunited. In our opinion, this represents European reunion, not enlargement.
Those who are about to join us are our fellow European citizens.
They should never have been separated from us and we are delighted to be reunited with them.
Mr President, I would like to point out that the first objective laid down in the Treaty on European Union is to promote economic progress.
I hope that no one will forget that in relation to the accession of the new countries.
Another thing: these new countries include Cyprus.
Part of Cyprus is occupied by foreign troops.
As long as Cyprus is an independent state, that is a matter for the Republic of Cyprus, but when Cyprus joins the European Union, part of our Union will be occupied by Turkish troops, and I consider that to be unacceptable.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Verheugen, if, as I hope, the European Parliament today votes by a very large majority for the accession of the Czech Republic to the European Union, individual Members' motives for that decision may differ to some degree, but their motives will coincide on one point, namely that with our vote we want to seize an opportunity, an historic opportunity!
I am fully aware how carefully the term 'historic' ought to be used.
But there are situations where it would be a mistake to ignore the actual dimension of events, and we are faced today with one such situation with historic consequences.
As rapporteur responsible for the Czech Republic, I have no reason to react with exuberance, let alone euphoria.
The many unqualified statements by some Czech politicians in the past, statements made with an eye to the various election campaigns, have been too frustrating for that.
We should be careful, though, not to deny the Czech people, a people at the heart of Europe, accession to the European Union simply because some opportunists, whose names will probably be almost forgotten in ten years' time, have been guilty of verbal gaffes.
We are left with the objection that the problem is not so much the many opportunists, both small and great, but the question of the possible continuing effect of the presidential decrees known to us as the Bene? Decrees.
So far as this point is concerned, the Czechs have taken upon themselves the obligation to comply with the Copenhagen criterion that there can be no discrimination against minorities.
Should anyone in the Czech Republic nevertheless be in breach of that after European Union accession, as a community of justice the EU can and will take appropriate action.
The fact that neither government nor parliament in the Czech Republic have so far responded to our Parliament's resolutions is disappointing and regrettable, as our group chairman has already made clear.
President Vaclav Klaus's political gesture should not, however, be played down.
It is an encouraging sign that, a few weeks ago on the anniversary of the German occupation of Bohemia and Moravia in March, the highest Czech representative expressed regret for the expulsion of the Sudeten Germans.
It is a step in the right direction, which we may hope will be followed by others.
In any case, we still need patience in our dealings with one another because coming to terms with history is something on which it is hard to impose a time frame.
No one should think that the Czechs are the only ones having problems in dealing with their past; the phenomenon is not only found in all the countries of the former Eastern bloc, even long standing Member States of the European Union sometimes have problems with it.
There is one thing of which we should be careful when dealing with the past. We are right to oppose collective condemnations, but are not those who do not want the Czechs in the EU simply because a few Czechs are unreasonable doing much the same thing?
Someone has already pointed out today that we are not admitting governments, we are not admitting parties and groups, but we are admitting people, we are admitting nations.
In this case, it is the Czech people that we are admitting, and integrating them into the European Union must and will be the key to developing a new legal culture, the European Union's legal culture, in that country too.
If the Czechs remain outside, we will have gained nothing.
First, if the Czech younger generation in particular is able to move and develop in a wider democratic environment, the wounds that doubtless still exist on all sides will close and hopefully will one day heal completely.
The people in today's Czech Republic, who cannot be held personally responsible for what happened before they were born, should and must be given the opportunity to have a part in the European community of values with equal rights and equal obligations.
Today we are holding the most important vote of this legislative period.
Let us be aware of the historic implications of this vote; let us seize this opportunity by voting for the accession of the Czech Republic by a large majority.
And, as a Member from Saxony, I would like to say to my neighbours: DrazÃ­ p?Ã¡telÃ©, vÃ­tÃ¡me VÃ¡s srde?n?.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as rapporteur for Estonia I am pleased to be able to recommend that this House should today vote in favour of Estonia's accession to the European Union.
Anyone who, like myself, has had the privilege of visiting that country regularly in various capacities for ten years can see the progress Estonia has made since regaining independence.
When you realise what additional disadvantages Estonia had to overcome compared with the non-Baltic former communist countries of Central Europe, it is almost a miracle that Estonia was in the first group to begin accession negotiations.
It was two years late in commencing reforms.
Having been annexed as part of the USSR, it had to start almost from scratch with the building of government structures at national level.
It needed to integrate Russians who had been settled there over decades and to deal with the enormous environmental damage from the Soviet Union's military legacy.
Despite many changes of government, the Estonian reform model has always been and still is a consistent one: in privatisation, in monetary policy, in matters affecting the tax system and in other respects. They said an unreserved 'yes' to the opportunities of technological change.
The willingness with which people in the private sphere, in the economy and in administration made use of the opportunities of modern technology can be described as exemplary for other parts of Europe.
What else can a small country with few natural resources do than make something from a combination of brain and technology?
Estonia's export structure shows that they are now successfully achieving this high-tech added value.
The fight against corruption is proving more successful than in other countries in the region. In its 2002 progress report, the Commission says that 'corruption generally appears to remain a relatively limited problem in Estonia'.
The fact that no ethnic tensions have arisen in Estonia and other Baltic states despite the large Russian-speaking minority and despite the tragic role the Soviet Union played in their history must be ascribed to the level-headed policy of the Estonian Governments and their willingness to follow proposals made by their European partners along the road to the EU.
One thing I would like to say a word about to the Estonian citizens direct is the referendum on 14 September.
If you still have any doubts about whether you should vote in favour, then please consider whether a country the size of Estonia and in its geographical location can stand alone in today's world.
So far as the material advantage is concerned, all experience so far has shown that ultimately everyone involved in every enlargement has profited, which means that Estonia, too, will develop better if it is part of the EU.
I am also shadow rapporteur for Lithuania and there, too, I also share the view of my fellow rapporteur, who will be recommending accession.
Lithuania's reform process has not been quite so consistent or brisk as in Estonia, especially not in the first half of the 1990s, but I am impressed by the speed with which Lithuania has caught up, especially since 1996, and, as in all the countries, there was a lot to be done in every area covered by the acquis.
One particular problem, both in discussions with the EU and with its own public opinion was the task of working out and paying for a plan for the closure of the nuclear power station at Ignalina and giving the people in and around the town of Visaginas a future.
I believe we have found the right way forward together there.
In the matter of a satisfactory arrangement for transit to and from Kaliningrad, the former KÃ¶nigsberg, we must not leave Lithuania alone to meet our demand for Schengen compatibility.
I am not satisfied with how it is actually going.
The thing I warned against several times has happened. Travellers are, in practice, faced with complications and more bureaucracy, and there is scope for tension in relations with Russia.
That cannot be in the interests of either party involved, and, with Belarus being Lithuania's eastern neighbour, there is additional uncertainty as to whether all this will work.
Despite all the problems that remain to be solved, we are, today, writing a piece of European history.
I share the view of many of my fellow Members that this vote on the accession of ten countries is the most important vote of this legislative period.
I am glad that with my vote I can make a lasting contribution to turning the wheel of European history a lot further on.
I say to those who believe they must vote against: history will pass you by and show how false both your pretended and your actual motives are.
You still have the chance to decide for the common future of a greater Europe without losing face.
To Estonia, Lithuania and the others I shout a warm welcome to the European Union: kÃµike head, Eesti ja tere tulemast Euroopa Liidu and viso kogeriausio Lietuva ir sveiki atvike ?
Europos S?jung?!
Mr President, as rapporteur for the accession of Cyprus, it is my honour and pleasure to ask all my fellow Members to give their assent as laid down by Article 49 of the Treaty.
I would like to take advantage of my last speech as rapporteur to thank my colleagues on the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy and the joint parliamentary delegation, who have provided me with a great deal of support over the years.
I would also like to thank the Commission, in particular Commissioner Verheugen, Mr Maurer and Mr Van Der Meer, and the Government of the Republic of Cyprus and its ambassador, Mr Theophilou, who have provided us with full, regular updates on the progress of the negotiations.
We are all sorry that the UN plan for global resolution of the Cypriot issue presented by the Secretary-General came to nothing.
The constitutional structure proposed for the reunited island corresponded to the model of a modern, democratic federal State and fully respected the cultural identity and autonomy of both parts of the island.
It also provided a European perspective for the two island communities.
Those who rejected the plan for global resolution because they are still in favour of the existence of two separate States bear a heavy historical responsibility.
As Mr Kofi Annan wrote in his report of 1 April 2003 to the Security Council, Mr Denktash, despite the profound changes that have taken place, still hopes that the situation 'on the ground' will one day be enshrined in law.
According to the law, however, Cyprus does not comprise two separate States.
Security Council Resolution No 541(1983) declares the TRNC's proclamation to be legally invalid and calls upon all Member States not to recognise any Cypriot State other than the Republic of Cyprus.
After the signing and ratification of the Accession Treaty, therefore, the whole island of Cyprus will, legally speaking, become a Member of the European Union.
In fact, however, for the duration of the Turkish occupation, it will not be possible to apply the jurisdiction of the European Union and the Community acquis in the northern part of the island.
That is why the Accession Treaty contains an enabling clause empowering the Council, at the proposal of the Commission, to negotiate the necessary adjustments for application of the Community acquis in the north of the island once the obstacles to reunification are removed.
The UN Secretary-General's peace plan is still on the table.
The parties concerned - Greek Cypriots, Turkish Cypriots and, in particular, Turkey - are being motivated by many arguments to overcome the barriers which, thus far, seemed insurmountable.
The European Union is prepared to welcome a reunified Cyprus at any time, provided that the rules governing it comply with international law and with our own principles.
In the meantime, the European Union should be proud that it has opened its doors to a country that is indisputably European.
Its cultural and economic contribution is irrefutable and will be further increased considerably when sustainable peace is achieved in the Middle East.
We also anticipate a strong impetus and active cooperation from Cyprus in terms of politics.
In conclusion, I would like to point out that, in the Iraqi affair, Cyprus refused to allow access to its territory for any military operations and stated that it wished to align itself fully with the common positions adopted by the European institutions.
As rapporteur, I see this as exemplary behaviour, which I would recommend to all current and future Member States.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I am able to report to you today on the conclusion of a successful process.
Latvia has satisfied the conditions for membership of the European Union.
I am not the one who should be applauded today for this success.
It is our colleagues in the Latvian parliaments, it is the Latvian Government, it is the people in the Latvian administrations, and it is the population of Latvia whom we ought to congratulate on a magnificent marathon of adapting legislation and preparing for membership of the European Union.
I have simply had the honour of being able to have a part in this success story and of accompanying it a short way emotionally.
For that, I would like to take this opportunity of thanking my colleagues in the Saeima, the government representatives, administrations and the people of Riga, Liepaja and Letgale.
That is to name only a few, but there are many more who took time to discuss with me the best way of shaping this accession process.
It is they who had to cope with a really painful adjustment process, and they did so with no concern to protect vested rights.
Everything was called into question; everything was examined to see whether it was suitable for integration into the European Union.
So the one thing I can recommend is that you vote for Latvia's accession to the European Union.
What is true of other candidate countries is also true of Latvia.
Here, too, there is criticism that important things still have to be made perfect.
I am thinking of the need to strengthen the administration at regional level in particular, so that it can carry out its tasks in enforcing the acquis.
I am thinking of the fact that more still needs to be done to make the judicial system work better; I would also like to see the programme for integrating the Russian-speaking population pursued with greater enthusiasm and the obstacles to citizenship lowered.
Nevertheless, we do not want to deprive ourselves of joining with Latvia, its culture, its language and its willingness to reform, because that is also a gain for us.
But, and here I agree with some of the previous speakers, the problem we have with this enlargement lies with us.
Let us take a look at ourselves here in the European Union.
What has happened to the enthusiasm for institutional reform?
Where is the enthusiasm for agricultural policy reform?
What has become of the courage to reform the Structural Funds?
Where is the courage to tell the public that we have to stop protecting vested interests if we are to reshape a successful Union?
What has become of the honesty involved in admitting that reforms sometimes hurt?
The twenty-five of us must look for new ways together, and I am convinced that it is not Latvia that is putting the brake on, but that we are applying it here.
We must not put the blame on Latvia and the population there simply because the Union is too lethargic to shape this historic process, because Latvia was willing to reform whilst we were not.
That is why we must also see to it that changes are made here, and I am convinced that Latvia's experience, enthusiasm and courage can help us in this.
If Latvia becomes a member of the European Union, if its enthusiastic and youthful population becomes part of the European Union, it will also be part of the engine driving forward reform here in the European Union.
I am highly optimistic about this.
In conclusion, I would like to address a quite personal word to you.
For me personally, today sees a wish come true, namely that our friends the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary, who gave us in the GDR the courage to change, will be able to join us and will be able to help us shape Europe.
To them, too, we owe the unification of Germany.
We should not forget that, and I would like to say that in particular to those of my fellow Members who are thinking of not voting for the Czech Republic's accession.
We owe our neighbouring countries a great debt of gratitude.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, may I start by thanking my honourable friends in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy who, in appointing me as rapporteur for Lithuania, gave me the opportunity to take part in today's extremely interesting and important debate in the European Parliament.
I should also like to thank Mr Gahler, who has just added a number of thoughts on Lithuania, although I was here.
Ladies and gentlemen, as one of the ten countries joining the European Union, Lithuania brings with it the same historical baggage of culture, conflict and history that the whole of Europe carries.
We have all decided from time to time to change this course, to rally all the European nations around values and around principles.
Lithuania has its own problems.
However, now is not the time to discuss how much progress has been made in resolving the problem of Kaliningrad or Ignalina or anything else.
We need to focus on the political reference points we are all adopting.
We have all felt that the Europe we are building is not only a Europe of values, culture, history and adventure; it is also a Europe of the future, a Europe of hope.
If we ask the European nations today what they expect of us, what political expressions they expect of the leaders of Europe, they will say peace, democracy, growth, social justice and freedom.
It is to precisely these values that we have to respond.
Lithuania, I repeat, has had its share of adventure, as we all have.
But today we are treading a path with hope, a path with visions, a path which is expected to prove very interesting along the way.
As a Greek, I am keenly aware that the historic name of Europe which applies to all of us has Greek origins and brings with it overtones of culture and civilisation.
Europa was Zeus's consort. The mother of Minos, Sarpedon and Rhadamanthus.
However, if you study historical developments in conjunction with their mythological aspect, you will notice that they describe cultural, economic and other contacts between nations and citizens in the central and eastern Mediterranean basin in general.
The cultural element has always been present.
The element of quality has always been present.
Ladies and gentlemen, allow me, precisely because of my origins, to say how moved I am that Cyprus will be acceding to the Union at the same time as Lithuania and the other countries, and to thank Mr Poos in particular and all the institutions of the European Union, for doing such an excellent job of addressing such a serious issue and finding the best possible outcome.
Cyprus, the island of Aphrodite, or in the words of the modern poet, 'the golden green leaf tossed into the sea'.
Ladies and gentlemen, today we need to be both serious and optimistic.
We need to put everything we have debated and grumbled about on occasion behind us and realise that we are defining a new perception.
We are all Europe.
Not new Europe and old Europe.
We are the Europe we have built, the best thing man has given mankind.
And a word to the Greek Presidency, given that we all agree it is the element of civilisation that unites us in Europe. There are two important texts, the 'Tomb of Pericles' and the 'Oath of Alexander the Great'; what a good idea it would be to have them translated into all the languages, including the new languages of the European Union, as statements of principles, values and civilisation.


Allow me to close by saying, welcome Lithuania, welcome Cyprus, welcome Malta, welcome all of you who will join the European Union this year and all of you who will join later, in 2007, and everyone else who accepts the principles and values we all share.
Mr President, amongst the countries that have distinguished themselves in their efforts to fall in step with the European Union, with a view to becoming members, we have Hungary, whose development and current situation I have sought to portray with objectivity as rapporteur for this Parliament.
Today, the time has come for the European Parliament, pursuant to the Treaty on European Union and to its Rules of Procedure, to formalise its position on the application of these countries.
We are talking, in the case of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, about States and peoples that are hoping to find within our Union the respect for their identities and independence, the collective security and the economic prosperity that were denied them by the communist dictatorships that subjugated them for almost forty years.
We therefore have a huge responsibility not to disappoint their expectations.
Perhaps this is why, at one point in his report on the conclusions on enlargement Elmar Brok says that accession is not an end in itself, but rather a starting-point for new efforts to be made.
We must acknowledge the truth of this, but it is equally true that the step we are taking today constitutes a historical milestone of the greatest political importance, given the repercussions it will inevitably have, not only for the enlarged Union but for the entire European continent with which, due to its size, the Union is beginning to be confused.
It is therefore to be expected that questions are asked and that fears grow about the challenge of bringing together two worlds which, unfortunately, have experienced such different levels of development in recent decades.
It must also be emphasised, however, especially at this time of uncertainty created by the Iraq crises and also at a time when confidence in our capabilities is waning, that the accession of ten new countries is solid evidence of Europe's vitality, which clearly demonstrates its political will to respond positively and democratically to the challenges that history sets for it.
Mr President, Hungary submitted its application to join the European Union on 31 March 1994.
Accession negotiations for were opened four years later, in March 1998.
From the outset Hungary had been one of the applicant countries where progress, not least in adapting to the requirements of the internal market, had been most striking, and this had helped to maintain the dynamic of the negotiations.
Despite maintaining a high public-sector deficit, the Hungarian economy is characterised by one of the highest rates of growth in Europe, by the lowest inflation recorded over the ten previous years and by a relatively low rate of unemployment. It is consequently one of the most best-performing economies in the region.
Furthermore, Hungary has attracted one of the highest rates of direct foreign investment of any applicant country and its gross national product accounts for nearly 13% of the total GNP of all twelve applicant countries.
This exceptional economic performance undoubtedly counted in Hungary's favour in the negotiations on accession, especially if we bear in mind the speed at which this country has adapted to mechanisms befitting a market economy, after forty years of central planning, and the fact that Hungary has paid the social price that this process entailed for the most disadvantaged.
This does not mean, however, that it was easy to reach agreement on all chapters of negotiations.
In the sensitive areas of competition policy for example, or of cultural and audiovisual policy, or even on budgetary and financial issues, amongst others, we have seen the ongoing efforts that both the Commission and the Hungarian authorities have made in an attempt to overcome the difficulties.
Apart from the technical aspects of the negotiations, however, I wish to recall some facts that have marked the Hungarian socio-political situation during the period in which these negotiations have taken place.
In the resolutions adopted over recent years, Parliament has given prominence to a number of recommendations, in particular those aimed at encouraging the introduction of reforms in the areas of integration of the Roma peoples, improving the social dialogue, efforts to combat corruption and organized crime, strengthening an independent judiciary, increased concern to reduce regional disparities, and, not least, scrupulous adherence to rules governing public-sector tendering.
We have insisted on the need to establish an effective institutional and administrative framework for programming and implementing the structural and cohesion funds.
Progress has certainly been made in those areas, and the contribution by the Hungarian authorities has been substantial and will certainly continue.
Mr President, we have listened to various Hungarian political leaders proclaim that Hungary is determined to move forward on the road to integration, and wants the Union to be strong and united, not forgetting the need to preserve national identities and cultures.
These leaders think they have better prospects of achieving their objectives within the European Union than by going it alone in coping with the impact, favourable or unfavourable, of globalisation.
This is the crucial question that has been asked of the Hungarian people, who in the next few days will express their views in a referendum.
Ladies and gentlemen, the people, as always, shall be sovereign and shall determine their own laws, which we must fully respect.
As for our role, I am sure that Hungary, one of the oldest of European States, will regain its place in Europe, a place that has always been reserved for it, as a member of the European Union on 1 May 2004.
This is why, in my capacity as rapporteur for Hungary in this assembly, I am honoured and happy to ask my fellow Members to support this application, which concludes years of efforts and work and which opens up prospects for a new Europe.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, especially our dear friends in the candidate countries who are keenly observing our decision today, I have been involved in the enlargement process ever since I became a Member of the European Parliament.
I have helped to shape it in a great variety of capacities - as Chairman of the EU-Poland Joint Parliamentary Committee, now as Chairman of the EU-Czech Republic Committee and as rapporteur for Malta.
Like all of us, I am witnessing an historic process that will change the EU permanently.
Never before has there been an enlargement on this scale, with ten new countries of Central, Northern and Southern Europe.
Parliament was therefore right to be mindful, even before the Council and Commission were, that Europe should not again be divided and that each candidate country should be considered individually on the basis of the progress each has made.
I am pleased that today I, together with the entire Austrian People's Party delegation, can give our assent to the results of Copenhagen in the Brok report and to all the candidate countries.
Let me first, as rapporteur, give my reasons for assenting to Malta's accession application.
This small island state is a country in an exposed geopolitical position, one that has been profoundly marked by European culture and history.
Like all the candidate countries, Malta, too, has had to make far-reaching political and economic decisions in order to meet the Copenhagen criteria.
That has, however, resulted and is resulting in a modernisation of the economic and social structures of a country that has made and will make the leap from a sheltered island society to a social economy able to face competition in the European internal market.
In this, the European Union has shown Malta understanding and generosity with, for example, transitional periods in such sensitive areas as shipyards, second residences, even in the question of its desired tax exemptions and of course also with the possibility of agricultural subsidies.
Malta has recognised this opportunity.
It was the first country to hold a referendum, with an extraordinary turnout, voting 53% in favour of EU accession.
But that referendum is not binding.
The Accession Treaty still needs to be ratified in parliament.
The forthcoming election on 12 April will decide whether there will be a parliamentary majority in favour of it.
As rapporteur, I have always tried to avoid interfering in the country's internal political decisions.
That is still my position and I do not in any way want to anticipate how the Maltese people will vote in this election.
Let me just say this much: we in the European Parliament have always supported Malta's application to join the EU and we welcomed the fact that the application, which had been suspended for two years, was renewed in September 1998 and that the Helsinki European Council decided to open accession negotiations with Malta. It is a unique opportunity for Malta.
There will not be a second opportunity of this kind.
I very much hope that we will be able to welcome Malta as an EU member on 1 May 2004.
The enlargement of the EU to take in the Baltic States also has a Northern and a Central European dimension, however.
I am speaking now as an Austrian.
Today, our country has the longest external border in the Union and yet we lie at the centre of Europe.
Enlargement moves Austria from a position on the edge of the EU to its centre, the centre of an area from which we Austrians in particular can expect economic stimuli, growth and employment.
The Austrian People's Party has always supported the European Union and its enlargement.
Today, through the delegation to which I belong, and through the Austrian federal government at the summit in Athens, it will be voting in favour of this enlargement.
We are not looking only for economic advantages from this enlargement, however.
As Chairman of the EU-Poland and EU-Czech Republic Joint Committees, I have always stressed this.
This enlargement is a reunification of Europe.
Above all, we are looking for good neighbourly relations with the countries with which we were associated historically for hundreds of years and from which we were separated as a result of two World Wars and the cruel division of Europe in the Cold War.
I am not taking it for granted that we will be able to solve all our problems with our neighbours as soon as they have joined, but we shall certainly be able to resolve them better and more easily when they have done so.
That is why I am canvassing for assent for all the candidate countries and asking Parliament to give that assent.
It will be an important historical act, an act that will also help us to come to terms with the past and to make it easier for our neighbour the Czech Republic to make the gestures we expect of it.
I am confident that we can count on such gestures, especially after what Czech Vice-Premier Mare? said to our group yesterday.
I am canvassing towards this end on behalf of my delegation and give its assent, in the European Parliament, to the accession applications of the ten candidate countries.
Mr President, today, in this House, we are witnessing an act of moral justice: European countries, countries which are just as European as those which are already part of the Union but which, by a twist of fate, found themselves, through no fault of their own, on the wrong side of an artificial line drawn across our continent, are coming back to Europe, coming back to us.
We welcome their return with joy and admiration, admiration for their endurance in the face of so much suffering, for the heroism they have shown during the long decades of communist dictatorship.
Of all the countries returning to Europe, Poland has a particular role and particular importance, not just because it is the largest country but because it is there, in Poland - as Commissioner Verheugen pointed out, and we would like to thank him for the immense amount of excellent work he has done - that the battle for freedom from tyranny started which subsequently served as an example and encouragement to other countries.
Without Poland and - I would like, if I may, to remember here a leader who is now forgotten - without Lech Walesa, the Berlin Wall might still be standing.
It would be difficult at such an important moment for Parliament not to look back over the four years of accession negotiations, negotiations which were often problematic, often complex, because of the difference and disparity between the respective levels of development.
However, if the Poles have succeeded in overcoming the difficulties and reaching the end of the negotiations today, it is thanks to a huge effort on the part of society, thanks to its enthusiasm and to the commitment of the successive Warsaw governments, all of which, all of them, irrespective of their political creed, have fought to achieve the common strategic objective of their country's accession to the European Union.
Clearly, we have not reached the end of the process.
We must continue to fight and strive to modernise the country so that it can derive maximum benefit from accession.
At this juncture, I must say that we continue to feel some concern, as I have already said on past occasions, regarding the transparency of the public administration, corruption and the independence of the media, but I am sure that Poland will be able to succeed in these areas too.
Parliament too has played an important part, giving powerful impetus to the accession process.
We have sent messages of support and encouragement and occasional warnings, but we have always been consistent and determined, and that is why the citizens of the candidate countries have viewed the European Parliament as a credible assembly which is seeking to reintegrate the part of Europe which had been cut off so that justice is done.
The decision we took to open up Europe to the countries which were already part of the continent was a political decision, not an economic decision, not a decision based on figures and calculations which would not have justified this process, but a decision based on the ideal of justice.
In this connection, it pains me to see that some of the Members of this House do not feel this need to see justice done and are preparing to abstain from the vote today or even to vote against accession, for reasons which we may be able to respect but which I, at least, cannot endorse.
The least acceptable attitude is to vote against accession in retaliation, almost as a way of punishing those countries which have declared their support for US intervention in Iraq.
That would be to deny the candidate countries a right which, thank goodness - and I repeat, thank goodness - some of the countries of the Union have exercised freely.
If I may, Mr President, I would like to end on a personal note, with a parenthesis. I am half Polish and half Italian, and I can assure you that, in this matter - the war in Iraq - I am much prouder of my Polish half, for Poland has had the courage to send 200 troops to Iraq to fight, as on many other occasions in history, for our freedom, for the freedom of us all.
Mr President, new cultures will bring added value and more security to the individual States and the European family.
This may be the time when the glass is half full, a time of optimism and benefits, but the time will, of course, come when there are difficulties, when the glass is half empty.
The European Socialists have consistently and determinedly fought for enlargement.
The countries bordering on the Mediterranean, which are the gateway to Central Europe, have played a major role in this process.
We make it clear that we want to open our doors to those who wish to become part of our European family, but there is no automatic right to join our club. As the negotiators of the candidate countries know, a lot of hard work is necessary before full membership is granted.
I am the rapporteur for Slovenia, the wealthiest of the candidate countries, which also has a European institutional tradition.
The main problem during the preparatory phase was speeding up the judicial procedures and resolving the problems left over from the previous regime.
Thus, Slovenia's situation was similar to but less complex than that of some of the other candidate countries.
Even when Slovenia joins Europe, everybody will still be responsible for making good the undertakings given.
The international organisations' reports on Slovenia talk about a functioning market economy and observance of the Copenhagen criteria setting the standards to be achieved in the field of fundamental rights.
A paragraph was erroneously included in the report relating to combating fraud, corruption and the trafficking of drugs.
These are phenomena which continue to be present but to a much lesser degree than in other countries, and it is possible that the reference to them might, therefore, unbalance the text.
The best solution would be to delete the paragraph.
Another technical point: the term 'denationalisation' I used in the original text was translated as 'privatisation', which is a different concept.
We have now come a long way along the road to the new Europe, and today's sitting is almost a dress rehearsal for how the House will look one day in the future.
Parliament is endorsing the work achieved by the candidate countries, on which the European Council will pass judgment.
The Treaty of Nice established the fast track to enlargement and fixed the schedule to be followed. Despite all the difficulties, thus far it has been observed.
Just as in previous cases accession to Europe brought economic benefits and strengthened democracy and the institutions, we are confident that that will be the case this time as well.
. (NL) Mr President, when, in 1997, the European Parliament appointed me as the rapporteur for Slovakia's EU membership application, some of my colleagues looked at me with pity.
Did that country have any chance at all, given the shadowy, authoritarian style of the Meciar Government?
If anyone had asked me at the time whether the country would accede to the EU at the same time as the other Visigrad 4 countries, I would probably have said no.
Fortunately, things turned out differently, and on this solemn occasion here today I can wholeheartedly recommend that Slovakia be admitted to the European Union.
It is in no way inferior to the other candidates who are on the membership list for next year.
Because Slovakia's failure to meet the democratic criteria meant that it was not included in the first negotiation group, the quality of its constitutional state has been checked and tested more than that of the other candidates.
I have received the occasional complaint about that, but the country has, perhaps more than others, been made aware of the importance of the values on which the European Union is founded.
After the 1998 elections, which marked the end of the Meciar era, there has been a significant improvement thanks to the introduction of a directly elected president, the democratic decentralisation of the administration, the increased independence of the judiciary and the measures to improve the position of minorities.
There are, however, a number of problems that are so stubborn that they are unlikely to be resolved in the immediate future.
In a sense these therefore constitute a threat to Slovak society.
They are not unique.
Other candidates are also wrestling with them, but their seriousness is sometimes underestimated.
We should therefore welcome the fact that the Slovak Government has also submitted a serious approach to the European Parliament.
I am talking about the fight against corruption and an improvement in the position of the Roma.
We have been hammering away quite hard at both points over the last few years - too hard for some people's liking.
We have apparently been too impatient.
It takes time to tackle these problems.
That may be true, but something is now finally happening thanks to our pestering - if I may use that word.
We have been given assurances on the basis of which we can always call the new Member States to account after their accession.
Two more criteria were formulated at the Copenhagen Council.
I have been able to ascertain that Slovakia meets the market requirements.
The internal debate on this subject is at times so radical that I sometimes wonder whether people have actually taken the trouble to find out what the principles of the social market economy are really about.
Slovakia also needs an active government that strives for social equilibrium and makes every effort to support the development of the poorer regions.
As far as her ability to implement all the community rules is concerned, this country is no different from the other candidate Member States.
She has already achieved a great deal, but the task is not yet finished, and a lot has already been said about this today, including with regard to the other countries.
We await the next progress report from the Commission.
I hope, however, particularly when it comes to preparing for the use of community funds, that the Slovakians are ready in time so that they are actually able to absorb this money.
So neither my last report, again today, nor the explanatory note I wrote with my recommendation are completely free from criticism.
In Slovakia, they have gradually come to expect that from me.
In all the years that I have been doing this work, I have tried to present myself as a rapporteur of the European Parliament and not as an ambassador for Slovakia. That is the task of others, and they have been doing an excellent job.
Naturally I am rather biased because of my intensive contact with Slovakia and her people.
They absolutely do not deserve the reputation Meciar has given them.
I admire the way in which one of the youngest states in Europe has been able to wrest itself from a complicated past and the speed with which it has brought itself up to the same level as the others.
The time has now come to go forward together.
Mr President, the European Parliament's Committee on Constitutional Affairs welcomes the outcome of the negotiations with the ten candidate countries.
Whilst it is gratifying that this round of enlargement will enable us to help overcome the grim legacy of conflict and division in Europe, we must also emphasise that the process has not yet been completed.
Above all, we must not take public approval of enlargement for granted, either in the acceding countries or in the Member States.
In this context, we believe that a great deal of information is needed, and we should beware of engaging in propaganda.
Persuasion is the order of the day, and it is important, especially in border areas, that the efforts to persuade people are organised in such a way that they are well received by the general public.
There are a few specific details to be added to these general remarks, particularly as regards the choice of 1 May 2004 as the accession date.
In connection with this decision, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs welcomes the fact that, by that date, observers from the acceding countries will already be attending our Parliamentary sittings.
We welcome the fact that we shall also have new Commissioners and new members of the Commission in general on the first of May.
We consider it right and proper that the new Commission is to take up its duties quite soon afterwards, in November 2004.
We deeply regret, however, that all of these decisions have been taken without Parliament having been consulted at all.
We call on the Council, as a matter of urgency, to provide Parliament with early information on developments in the accession process and to involve us in good time.
In general terms, we expect that many of the solutions which we have not really managed to find so far on the basis of the Treaty of Nice will be made possible by the work of the European Convention.
We are pleased to note that the representatives of the acceding countries are also fully involved in this work.
They will contribute to our consensus, to a consensus that will carry us forward in Europe.
Mr President, in view of the competences of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, which it is my honour to chair, I would like to stress three or four key aspects of this unprecedented event we are debating today.
Firstly, it is important to expand the debate on the European Union's borders, which has recently been launched.
There is absolutely no doubt that successive enlargements lead us to the question: how far?
What are the Union's limits?
Knowing where the Union's borders are is the key if we are to talk about a European identity.
Furthermore, it will determine the Union's future action, in accordance with the possibilities offered by its new shape in terms of expanding the process of integration.
My second point is that enlargement is a challenge in terms of the monitoring and control of external borders.
In the new area of freedom we are building, it is clear that the decisions of one Member State have repercussions for the others, given the disappearance of internal controls.
It is therefore important to help the new Member States to take responsibility for this difficult and costly task, which is a clear example of the organisation of migratory flows.
Furthermore, we must reassess the cooperative relations with the new States which will become the Union's border States.
Thirdly, enlargement is a challenge in terms of combating different forms of organised crime, such as terrorism, human trafficking or drug trafficking.
It is therefore important to promote intense police and judicial cooperation, the exchange of best practices and the compatibility of legal systems.
This will allow the Member States to quickly acquire the levels of guarantee currently enjoyed in all the Member States.
Finally, I would like to make a special appeal for the active participation of the ten candidate countries in the work on the Convention on the Future of Europe.
It is clear that the Convention is planning the form Europe will take in the twenty-first century and it is therefore essential that not just the current Member States but also the future ones, which will represent almost half of the new Union, feel they are co-authors of that Convention.
To sum up, in order to achieve the objective and for enlargement to be successful we must fulfil other objectives which are no less important, such as promoting stability and security, involving all the Member States in its shaping and in the respect for Fundamental Rights laid down in the Charter, and explain European construction to the citizens.
In summary, to lay the foundations for a European identity which is constantly evolving, whose lowest common denominator is essential for the consistency and endurance of what we have been advocating for more than fifty years.
Mr President, your reality actually consists of many years of dreams.
The process of enlargement, about which everybody has fantasised in the past, is now being given flesh and bones.
In a debate such as this, it is appropriate to congratulate the Commission and its services on this formidable task.
We have a Commissioner who has played and still is playing a major role in this enlargement, who has constantly kept us informed about what he was doing and with whom we have clearly always been on the same wavelength from a political point of view.
Furthermore, the Commission has used its best officials for the enlargement discussions, and so it has become a task that we will never forget.
I personally used to dream these dreams with Czech friends, and I am therefore extremely pleased that the Czech Republic will be one of the first ten countries to accede to the European Union.
The Balladur initiative has been on the agenda a number of times in the past, particularly with regard to borders and the rights of minorities.
It is odd that the Balladur initiative still forms one of the cornerstones of the political criteria of Copenhagen.
I would actually like to say something about borders.
This week we voted on the transit problems of Russians living in Kaliningrad.
At the time we thought: they all travel via Lithuania and we must reach agreement with Lithuania before Lithuania's accession becomes a reality, because this is also a border problem.
On this point, Lithuania has adjusted very well to the general pattern of European Union negotiations.
I would, however, like to point out that the report on this is couched in such general terms that Latvia and Estonia are also included in it, and this is an opportunity for the Commission and the Council to take a look at the ratification of the border agreements between Russia and the Baltic republics, who themselves have ratified everything there has been to ratify, whereas the Duma still has this ratification hanging over its head.
Would this now not be a good opportunity to ensure, in the agreements about transit arrangements for Kaliningrad, that all ratifications also become a reality on the part of the Duma?
I am pleased to see the Commissioner nod, and the Chairman of the Council as well.
There is another border problem that has regrettably not yet been solved.
This time, however, it is not the candidate Member State, Cyprus, that is at fault, given the fact that the President of Cyprus very recently approved the mediation of the United Nations.
To our deep regret, and certainly to our surprise as well, it was the Turkish side that did not do so.
Cyprus cannot therefore be blamed for this and can be wholeheartedly welcomed as a Member State of the European Union as long as the country is willing to continue to honour UN mediation as it has been doing in the past.
Turkey's position makes us feel all the more gloomy, because Turkey now has a black mark against an important political criterion in this area.
I would like to call on Turkey to continue to meet the political criteria of Copenhagen, including in respect of this issue, because only then can we regard it as a true candidate Member State that is welcome in our ranks.
Mr President, today is an historic day, as has already been said many times.
The European Union is on the threshold of the biggest enlargement in its history, the fifth since European cooperation started in the 1950s.
The European model of cooperation must therefore be successful.
That was certainly the case when the Wall came down in 1989, when enthusiasm for accession in Eastern European countries was exceptionally great.
Since then, this enthusiasm for the European issue seems to have diminished somewhat in Eastern European countries, although as far as that is concerned, those countries are looking increasingly like the members of the European Union themselves.
As far as I am concerned, they are wholeheartedly welcome.
I regard enlargement as a consolidation of the area of freedom and democracy, the common judicial area and the increase in prosperity that this brings with it.
I would like to say a few words about finance.
As far as I am concerned, the Copenhagen agreements are acceptable.
At least they were acceptable.
It is particularly disappointing that the Council tried at the very last moment to undermine the democratic rights of this Parliament.
It is also a bad thing because we have been setting high standards for the new Member States when it comes to democracy, and the Council chooses now of all times to try to undermine Parliament's rights.
Fortunately we have been able to reverse this.
That has cost the Council money.
I can only hope that the Council will take a more positive stance in future.
The real work, however, is about to begin.
The administrative system in the new Member States is unlikely to be up to the task of efficiently managing the massive flows of money that they will be receiving.
There is a lot of talk of corruption, although, it must be said, not only in the new Member States.
All these shortcomings also exist in the old Member States.
I think that we should take this opportunity to significantly improve administration right across the whole of the European Union.
That means, for example - and we voted on this last month - setting up a European public prosecutor, reinforcing Eurojust and reinforcing Europol.
We must do all we can to fight organised crime and, coupled with that, to put better controls in place at Europe's external borders.
If we make rules, we must also have sanctions to reinforce these rules.
As far as I am concerned, these sanctions are, at present, inadequate.
Particularly with regard to flows of funds from Europe, the Commission should have much more power to tell a country in which things are going wrong - whether it is an old or a new Member State - that we will temporarily stop paying the money until we are satisfied that its administrative system has been put back on track.
I hope that we are on the threshold of creating a Europe that is great and prosperous, and as far as Parliament is concerned, I think that it will cooperate fully in this.
Mr President, the enlargement reports are on the table.
There is much to be said about them, but unfortunately I can only deal with a few points.
As far as the Czech Republic is concerned, we should understand and respect the fact that history can be seen from two perspectives and that the Potsdam Agreement was international law too.
On 4 December 1989, I apologised on behalf of the Government of the German Democratic Republic to the peoples of Czechoslovakia for the events of August 1968, but at the same time I did not forget the 9 May 1945.
We need vision and the courage to let wisdom prevail and to resist any inclination to do what we know to be wrong by swimming against the tide of history and creating new divisions.
As for the general historical context, consideration should be given to the post-war history of the whole of Europe, not only in its political dimensions, and all of us must act in full awareness of our historical legacy.
There are calls for the enlarged Union to speak with one voice.
These calls are certainly warranted, but that one voice must plead for peace; it must uphold the rights of the United Nations, speak out against a new arms race and rally support for the fight against hunger and poverty in the world.
The historical dimensions of the present moment are beyond dispute.
What is questionable, however, is the way in which the European Union is proceeding, whether it is proving equal to the historic mission with which it has now been entrusted in fulfilment of Europe's historical destiny and whether it is taking a sufficiently balanced approach to that mission.
If it fails to do these things, the future development of the Union will be more uncertain than many people are prepared to acknowledge today.
Mr President, the fact that there is such a racket going on outside naturally means that people in here are not paying proper attention, and I think that what is going on outside is scandalous.
Although I have every sympathy for social abuses, I do think that it is a bit steep that the best paid officials in Europe should be expressing themselves in this way on a day on which we are welcoming the worst paid and the least prosperous people in Europe.
Today, however, we are voting for the future of half a billion people, for a future of peace and peaceful coexistence in tolerance and in diversity.
The future does not lie in a world in which one world superpower and a couple of large Member States in Europe call the shots.
The future lies in the self-determined cooperation and coexistence of many small ones.
Today we would like to wholeheartedly welcome all those small ones and the big ones with minorities in their territories.
Although I endorse what our group chairman, Mr Cohn-Bendit, has just said, I would like to place the emphasis on the minorities and their lot.
Legislation that is still in place today as a condemnation resulting from so-called collective guilt should be a thing of the past.
The Bene? decrees are an obstacle in the path of reconciliation between the state and its own citizens, not only in the Czech Republic but also in Slovakia.
Let me turn, secondly, to the Roma minority, which, in many countries, is severely discriminated against and socially disadvantaged.
It is a nation without a country, and its identity and culture must be respected and viewed as a driving force for social and economic development.
My third point is that the Soviet Union's policies have resulted in the creation of Russian minorities in certain Member States.
We are arguing in favour of recognising all languages and all minorities, but we must also continue to recognise the rights of the speakers of historic languages to use them in their own regions and to have them recognised, including as a basis for education.
This not only applies to the accession countries but also to our own Member States.
Recognition of the small ones is our guarantee of democracy in Europe.
Mr President, in 1989 I witnessed the political upheaval in Central and Eastern Europe in person.
Among all the others, one particular cry of joy from that wonderful year has stayed with me: 'God has helped us!'
This superhuman help is still essential, particularly as we are on the threshold of achieving an historical breakthrough in the West.
At the same time, the European Union is struggling with serious diplomatic and economic problems.
In this crucial phase, it will be all the more important for us to take responsibility together for future cooperation between Member States.
Peace and security are the prime objectives in this, not least for acceding countries, given their recent past.
This elementary fact is acknowledged in Paragraph 6 of the draft resolution of the Brok report, and rightly so.
According to this paragraph, the European Union therefore has a particular responsibility when it comes to strengthening transatlantic ties.
That applies in particular to the relationships between the EU and NATO.
Duly noted!
Indeed, in this regard, let the European institutions not dash the legitimate expectations of the citizens of the accession countries, for the sake of a more secure, more just world.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are currently experiencing both enlargement and war.
Both these events lead us to examine fundamental questions, such as who we are and what Europe actually represents.
Europe represents peace but, with qualified majority voting and enlargement, Europe would have voted for war and, today, German, French and Belgian soldiers would be receiving posthumous decorations.
Europe also represents the law, the people's law, together with Grotius, Vattel, Pufendorf, Molina and SuarÃšz.
Poland, however, is taking part in a war in violation of international law and the Charter.
Europe represents, in particular, Emmanuel Kant's law of nations.
The Baltic States, however, which are neighbours of KÃ¶nigsberg, home of the philosophy of the categorical imperative, are failing to respect this law.
Lastly, Europe represents memory, the memory of the tanks of the Empire in Budapest (1956) and Prague (1968). VÃ¡clav Havel and Hungary, however, are supporting the tanks of another empire in Baghdad, which has been turned into a ghetto.
Warsaw has forgotten Europe's memories.
Should we, therefore, enlarge the Union to include these governments which have accepted war, rejected the law that forbids it, ignored the moral case which condemns it and forgotten the history of invasion they have experienced?
Should we enlarge it to include Turkey, on the borders of Kirkuk which is currently being bombed?
That would mean a Europe of adventure with adventurer governments, which, doubtless, is all very well, but these are not the values laid down for us by Article 2 of the Constitution.
Enlargement would mean a Europe of lies.
That is going too far!
Mr President, you are Greek.
Apollo's temple in Delphi bore the inscription: nothing in excess.
Ten more countries is excessive.
Mr President, now that the European Union is to be enlarged by ten new Member States, it is not only an historic moment for the EU, it is a fact that also raises the issue of what our common core values are.
I venture to state before this Parliament that our common core values in actual fact found expression through the way in which Communism and dictatorship in the former Eastern European countries were done away with.
In the end, they were actually disbanded without violence, demonstrating the fact that, as Europeans, we do not need military solutions to unite us.
We have a common culture and community of values, based upon a Jewish and Christian spiritual inheritance and a culture of humanism.
These core values are indispensable to our joint construction of an EU that is to be enlarged to include 25 Member States.
I want to say something about Cyprus, which is the country to which I had a special commitment when it came to enlargement towards the east.
I wish to protest against the fact that the Turkish occupation of northern Cyprus, or 37% of the island, in actual fact threatens the EU as a peace project.
We must never lose sight of how unreasonable it would be for Turkey to be allowed to become a member of the European Union while it continued to occupy a new Member State, in the form of Cyprus.
We must not forget Cyprus, and we must realise the absolute necessity of Turkish troops' withdrawing from northern Cyprus if the Helsinki decision on Turkey's candidacy is to become a reality.
It is important for us now to help realise the desire of the Turkish Cypriot majority for a reunited and unified Cyprus, as expressed in this year's large demonstrations in Nicosia.
Germany and Berlin were divided for 28 years.
Cyprus and Nicosia have been divided for 29 years.
Let there be an end to this.
Mr President, I am cautious about drawing historical comparisons, but it is appropriate to do so today.
A generation of politicians in the Fifties - Konrad Adenauer, Robert Schuman, Jean Monnet, Alcide De Gasperi, Paul-Henri Spaak and others - had the courage and the vision to establish a European Community that would overcome a thousand years of antagonism between Germany and France and begin the unification of Europe in the West.
We, the present political generation, have the opportunity, for the first time in a thousand years, to bring the continent together by peaceful means and on a voluntary basis into a European Union, a union of freedom, peace and prosperity.
If we do not seize this opportunity, we will be failing in our historic mission.
The resolution of the European Parliament on the reunification of Europe will be adopted in one day, but the unification of the whole of Europe is a process, the task of an entire generation of politicians.
Its accomplishment demands strenuous efforts, not only on the part of the acceding countries but also on that of the present Member States, for the Union is not simply becoming larger - it is also becoming a different Union.
The new Member States will be more than a numerical addition to the membership of the present Union; they will give the European Union a new character.
As they themselves are well aware, they are not only entering a market but are also acceding to a union whose desire and obligation it is to become a political union.
They are joining in the Convention's work of building firmer foundations for this.
For both the old and the new Member States, membership of the Union confers rights but also imposes responsibilities, in particular the duty to work with all available means on the development and consolidation of our common future for the benefit of all, for the good of the whole Union, and not just to increase their own store.
Old Europe has fixed its eyes on a new future.
Today we are giving it the green light, and I am deeply grateful to be able to play a part in this.
(Applause)
Mr President, we shall not get involved in contesting the individual points of the Brok report.
We reject it overall for the simple reason that we reject the very principle of enlargement.
There are several reasons for this.
First of all, a logical reason: to us, as sovereignists, the current integration of Europe is so contrary to the interests, principles and civilisations of the nations and people of Europe, so clearly incapable of speaking with one voice in the world, as shown in the Iraqi affair, so poorly organised, weighed down by bureaucracy and, what is worse, by feudality - economic and financial feudality of all kinds - that we have come to wish that our country, France, would free itself from the Union.
We cannot see why we should impose on others this infernal machine that we would reject for ourselves.
There are clearly other reasons, however.
The people of Europe are not ready. They are victims of their oligarchies, which are simply following international conformism which will once again lead to disaster, for we are refusing to accept the facts.
Lastly, the President of the French Republic, Jacques Chirac, said, quite specifically and quite rightly, in my opinion, that the Eastern European countries and, in particular, their oligarchies, only want to move from one empire to another and essentially wish to become part of the US empire, which is the exact opposite of what we believe to be the European Union's only raison d'Ãªtre.
Therefore, for all the reasons I have stated, we shall not vote for the Brok report tomorrow.
Mr President, my approval of the accession of all the applicant countries does not alter my continued rejection of the violation of human rights inherent in the Bene? decrees, which, I regret to say, are still politically significant in modern-day Czech society.
Let us hope that Czech accession will result in the application of the rule of law to an unjust policy, thereby enabling the parties concerned, by which I mean not only the representatives of the Sudeten Germans but also the many Jewish victims who have been scandalously defrauded, to assert their rights on the basis of European law with a greater chance of success than hitherto.
But for all the rationality of this case, let me emphasise that I, like so many others from my country, am speaking as a typical Austrian, with a mother who was born in Prague and a father from Vienna, and so the Czechs should recognise that this criticism comes from a friend rather than seeing every critic as an enemy.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, days such as today are an occasion to look back as well as forward.
We look back to the years of radical change from 1989 to 1991, when the nations of the former Warsaw Pact strove successfully to secure their freedom and independence.
We look back on a difficult period of transformation, which is now giving way to a period of stability in our continent, a political stability that used to be almost inconceivable.
In this context, it is quite rare to hear the applicant countries being acclaimed for having largely fulfilled the political criteria of Copenhagen right from the start of the negotiations.
That is no mean achievement in view of their great economic difficulties, the residual effects of the planned economy and a sense of insecurity among the population.
When I think of Latvia, for example - a country towards which I feel a special sense of affinity and commitment - I wonder how much will-power it took for the Latvians to accept former occupiers as partners and fellow citizens.
I think of the referendum of 3 October 1989, when 53% of the Latvian electorate voted in favour of amendments to the country's nationality laws, amendments which corresponded with European standards and were therefore beneficial to minorities such as the large community of native Russian-speakers.
An important development of recent years that we should preserve in the new European Union is the experience of intensive cooperation across the external borders of the Union.
How quickly Euro-regions materialised!
The cooperation proposals that have yielded such rich fruit in recent years should also be extended to the neighbours we shall have on our new borders.
Proposals to benefit ordinary people on the future external borders of the Union - the people of Russia, the people of Belorussia and the people of the Ukraine.
We must not be deterred by the present difficulties.
Even now we must cast our eyes beyond the external borders.
Cross-border cooperation should become a prime instrument of our future security policy.
Mr President, I should like to say first of all that I support the enlargement process, and I want to see the applicant countries as part of the EU; however, what I am about to say may seem to contradict that.
The Commission proposal for the Enlargement Treaty was changed by the Council with the addition of Annex XV.
This, as primary law within the Treaty, is a direct attack on Parliament's rights.
For the past few weeks, I, as chairman of the Committee on Budgets, have led the trialogue delegation seeking to alleviate the damage caused by Annex XV.
We have come to a conclusion which I consider to be a second-best solution.
The draft declaration agreed by Parliament and the Council includes, in its Paragraph 1, a means of derogating from the Treaty, which I hope will safeguard Parliament's rights.
The simple answer would have been to withdraw Annex XV, but that has not been done, and as long as it remains, then I personally have a real problem with this.
It is bad enough to see the Council trying to take unilateral action on an adjustment of the financial perspective from 2004 to 2006, but to see the inclusion of a guaranteed ceiling on agricultural expenditure up to the year 2013 is totally unacceptable.
I consider the Chirac/Schroeder deal on this to be a shabby affair, a clandestine deal in this age of transparency.
That the other Member States agreed to this in Copenhagen was hard to believe, but for this now to be endorsed in the Treaty is just a step too far.
I cannot therefore vote for enlargement because to do so is to accept Annex XV within the Treaty and that is impossible for me.
I will therefore abstain, with a very heavy heart, on all the final votes.
Mr President, applicant countries all have one thing in common: they are all very young democracies.
Some are former British colonies and others, just over a decade ago, were under the Soviet regime.
Some of those were also once part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. That empire was known as the 'VÃ¶lkerkerker', the prison of nations.
Now it is just the political class of these new countries that want to join this new prison of nations, the European Union.
(Murmurs of dissent)
For the elites, the politicians and the civil servants it is a good deal; it means massive pay increases.
But for the people it means a return to the very system that they have just left - centralised, undemocratic control.
It is the people that will pay the price for their leaders' ambitions.
That is why I will vote 'no' to all ten countries' accession.
These emerging democracies deserve better.
From what I saw in the Maltese referendum the prospectus that is being sold is quite false.
This can only lead to discord and strife in the years to come.
(Mixed reactions)
I had the privilege two weeks ago on Sunday to be in Ljubljana for the result of a referendum where 90% of the people - not the elite - voted 'yes' to Europe.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the spread of democracy and the establishment of pluralism and the rule of law in the eastern part of Central Europe are common objectives not only of the region itself but of the entire continent.
This was said in May 1990 by the then Hungarian Foreign Minister, Mr Gyula Horn, when he received the International Charlemagne Prize in Aachen.
At that time, the three Baltic States were still part of the Soviet Union, and Germany had yet to be reunited.
Today this objective of our entire continent has been achieved, which makes this a momentous day.
In 1956, Hungary bravely rose up against dictatorship.
Decades later, at a time when the Warsaw Pact still existed, East German citizens took part in a pan-European lakeside picnic by the FertÃ¶ TÃ³, or Neusiedler See, an event which our fellow MEPs Otto von Habsburg and Bernd Posselt had helped to organise, before striking out again on the road to freedom, and it was Hungarian border guards who stood aside and let them pass.
Shortly afterwards, the Hungarian Foreign Minister, together with his Austrian counterpart, Alois Mock, cut through the Iron Curtain.
That was the first step in a process which culminated in the fall of the Berlin Wall.
This is why we in this Parliament today shall say 'yes' ten times over.
In the case of some countries, our 'yes' will be more muted, more hesitant.
In other cases, it will be loud, instant and clear.
In Hungary, the European legal order has taken root.
In the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights and Common Security and Defence Policy, the Hungarian Prime Minister voiced his criticism of expulsion orders more plainly than the competent EC Commissioner and more plainly than several other heads of government.
And so I shall say 'yes' ten times over today, but my clearest and most spontaneous 'yes' will be reserved for Hungary.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have a unique opportunity today to bind the bulk of Europe into a single political entity for the first time.
We must not deny this opportunity to the peoples of Europe, for all the people of this continent are entitled to attain freedom, peace and prosperity within a political community - and I stress the words 'political community' - almost 15 years after the collapse of Communism.
My home country of Austria has the longest common border with the acceding nations.
I know what the Iron Curtain meant, and I am also well aware of what an external border of the European Union means today for those on both sides of the border.
I myself am descended from Czech and Hungarian grandparents.
I was born in Austria, only a few miles from Bratislava, the capital of modern Slovakia.
I could just as easily have been born on the other side of the Iron Curtain, in which case I should have enjoyed far fewer opportunities than have been granted me in my life.
Even though the governments of some EU Member States have made it difficult for me through their illegal actions in relation to Parliament, and even though many of the applicant countries' governments have made it difficult for me by supporting an illegal war, I shall cast an unequivocal 'yes' vote, just like all the other Social Democrats from Austria, for I am convinced that the door to the European Union must be opened to the peoples of Eastern Europe and of Cyprus, though it is still divided, and Malta.
And with the same conviction we shall pursue the dialogues that still need to be conducted, whether they relate to the Bene? decrees, to nuclear power stations like Temelin or to other power stations, secure in the knowledge that the pursuit of this dialogue benefits both sides, for enlargement is not a zero-sum game.
We shall emerge as winners, and so will the new Member States.
If European solidarity ever meant anything, it means something in this vote today.
Mr President, I would like to start by thanking Commissioner Verheugen, who has been most assiduous in following the enlargement process.
I would also like to thank Mr Brok and Mr Wynn - I agree with what Mr Wynn said in his speech - and the Greek Presidency.
