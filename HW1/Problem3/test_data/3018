I think that the political groups should discuss the annual policy strategy in exactly the same way as the different committees do.
I hope that the groups will feel the same commitment to this regular dialogue.
The points of view expressed in the summary report and which will be endorsed by the Conference of Presidents in September have to reflect the position of both the committees and the political groups.
I think that this will help us a lot.
We have to realise that we are at an early stage and that, when we come to the legislative and work programme, we will be able to see more of the details and a clearer outline of the specific characteristics of each and every proposal.
I would also like to comment on the issue of migration, because we in the Barroso Commission firmly believe that properly managed labour migration can make a very positive contribution to our economies and to our societies.
As regards asylum, a question several of you also raised, we shall make proposals to approximate the criteria on the basis of which Member States can examine applications for asylum, but this will be done within the limits of the current Treaty and with full respect for the subsidiarity principle.
In the area of visas, which was also mentioned, we shall launch the visa information system, whereby Member States, while retaining responsibility for issuing visas, can exchange information and pertinent data.
This is an important step in the right direction and in coordinating between Member States what has to be done.
I should also like to comment on simplification and better regulation.
Let me start by saying that I have often heard the criticism that the Commission is legislating too little or that it is not ambitious enough in legislating.
We have compiled and checked all the statistics and, if you look at the amount of legislation adopted by the Commission, it has remained remarkably stable.
If we look at the number of regulations, directives, decisions and recommendations adopted over the past 10 years, it has only once topped 550 and has only once dropped below 430.
The average has been some 489 proposals a year, and last year, at 474, we were very close to that average.
So, whatever may be said, those are the facts.
Nevertheless, with the careful consultation and impact assessments we are now carrying out on every proposal included in the work programme, I think that we are making particular efforts to ensure that our proposals are well prepared and of high quality.
It is therefore important to bear these figures and statistics in mind.
We take the whole issue of simplification seriously and, as you know, we have set out a very ambitious simplification programme of 100 proposals, covering about 220 legislative instruments to be repealed, codified, recast or reviewed over the next three years.
On average, there have been about 40 or 43 proposals to simplify legislation or identify legislation which is outdated.
We will continue along the same path and at the same pace in order to constantly review legislation.
In some cases, it means that we can introduce new legislation and, at the same time, abandon or scrap directives, as we did with REACH, where the 40 existing directives were replaced by a single one.
We also have to be careful to ensure that our legislation is up to date and modern and that we get rid of legislation that is outdated.
Therefore, we will continue along the same path and will inform and involve the European Parliament so that we can work hand-in-hand to ensure that the overall political objectives of the Lisbon Strategy are implemented - the four overall priorities that we set out in our annual policy strategy.
Some Members raised the issue of the link between our debate on the annual policy strategy and the budgetary process.
I have noted Parliament's desire to improve this link, and it is important that we continue our dialogue on how to do so.
We see the budget and the policy as complementary and the purpose of the annual policy strategy is precisely to set the political framework in which the annual budget is to be established.
But the institutional framework is such that there is seldom a direct link between the policy initiatives undertaken in a given year and related expenditure in the same year.
There is a kind of mismatch between those processes.
As you know, the 2008 budget will finance actions deriving from legislative proposals presented in previous years.
These were proposals that the co-legislators approved in 2007 or earlier.
That means that the legislative proposals put forward in 2008 will have almost no budgetary implications for 2008, but will come on stream at the earliest in 2009.
Also, many initiatives from the Commission have little or no costs for the EU budget at all.
The Commission strongly believes that the new framework agreement put in place in 2005 actually provides a solid basis for relations.
It has already improved the flow of information and enhanced the coordination of planning and programming.
Now, let me say something more about the political issues raised here.
Some of you referred to the question of fundamental rights.
I am surprised at the criticism of the Commission's actions on fundamental rights.
I do not think that we should doubt President Barroso's commitment, given both his personal history and the challenges that he has faced to assert his rights and to realise his ambitions.
As you know, we have just set up the European agency for fundamental rights and we are in the European Year of Equal Opportunities.
I have already mentioned planned action to reinforce the protection of children and to fight discrimination outside the workplace.
I could give a much longer list of the things that we are doing.
Right now we are fighting, together with the Member States, to keep the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the new Treaty.
I think this is also a very basic provision and making sure that we can defend it will be an important part of the work ahead.
I will pass on to President Barroso and the Commission the idea of holding a chat forum on fundamental rights.
My experience is that we are never afraid of entering into debate.
I think that if we can engage in different ways, we will most certainly do so.
I would have liked Mr Whittaker to stay, because he actually questioned the whole climate change issue.
Maybe he has gone back to where he came from, to the kindergarten school of economics at which he said he studied.
If he had looked at reality instead, he would have realised that we have already become poorer because of climate change.
Climate change is already costing today's society and this is a way to improve our competitiveness, to be in the lead, to say that we can show the rest of the world how we combine the best of environmental technology and the best of our knowledge society in Europe with being ambitious in aiming to use a sustainable source of energy for the future.
By so doing, we can lead the way and be an example to the rest of the world.
We have already shown that this is possible.
That is the path we should also follow in the future.
Let me thank all of you who have given practical examples of what needs to be implemented, because, before we know it, we will also see environmental refugees as a result of climate change and these problems.
Of course, other countries have already experienced that, but, unless we take action, we too will be affected, in ways we can scarcely imagine at present.
So, finally, on communication, let me say that the Barroso Commission is the first to have started sending proposals directly to the national parliaments.
Furthermore, we now send the same documents that we send to the European Parliament and to the Council directly to the national parliaments.
The dialogue that we have engaged in - including more than 350 visits by Commissioners to national parliaments, engaging with their different committees, responding to questions, being heard by the national parliaments - is, I think, absolutely crucial in making sure that the European agenda is also anchored in national parties, in the democratic traditions of each and every Member State.
From a communication point of view, this is very important and we have also now set out communication priorities, including better consultation, better listening and explaining, and being present locally in Member States.
Without the engagement of Member States and politicians at all levels, it will be very difficult, as has already been pointed out.
We also need political leaders in all the Member States to be able to defend what they have been doing at European level and to say why they have come to certain decisions.
We have to engage at all levels and this is of course the intention of our communication policy as well.
We want the European Union to deliver and we want results that respond to the needs and expectations of citizens all over Europe. This means better regulation.
Not more or less regulation, but better regulation.
It means simplification, more focused action; it means clearer communication, informing citizens and listening more attentively to them; and it also means strengthening the European Union's institutions by completing the Treaty revision.
We need stronger institutions and closer dialogue to address the challenges and the opportunities ahead of us and we will definitely play our role in these matters, making sure we can come to an institutional settlement.
In response to the question about renting premises, let me say that we are working together with Parliament, renting a house in London together.
This is exactly how I think we should operate in future, working hand-in-hand to project a single image of the European Union.
Thank you very much for this debate.
I will of course ensure that the whole Commission is made familiar with your ideas and your positions.
(Applause)
Mr President, I should like to draw your attention to the fact that we need the legislative proposal you spoke about very soon, in order to finalise things with the Council before the next election.
There is real urgency in obtaining this proposal, especially as far as energy is concerned.
Thank you, Mr Swoboda, for that comment.
The debate is closed.
EU-USA Air Services Agreement (debate)
The next item is the Commission statement on the EU-USA Air Services Agreement.
Mr President, honourable Members, thanks to the work of your rapporteur, Mr El Khadraoui, and to the members of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, the European Parliament has the opportunity today to make its voice heard regarding what I consider to be a major draft agreement between the European Union and the United States.
I am talking about the aviation agreement reached ten days ago between the US and European negotiators, in Brussels.
In less than ten days' time, I will be submitting this draft agreement for a political decision to the EU transport ministers.
Your involvement has come at a crucial moment, and you can thus make the voice of Europeans heard, not only at the Council, but also within the US institutions themselves.
These negotiations have been long and complex.
There have been four years of negotiations since the Court judgments in the so-called open skies affair.
There have been 11 negotiating sessions, which have caused disruption and turbulence.
However, this long negotiation can enable us to strengthen the transatlantic relationship and to make a positive contribution to the Lisbon Strategy.
Within our reach is the possibility for a European airline to fly from any European location to any US destination, without any restrictions, and the nationality of the European airline does not matter.
Today, if you wish to fly between Brussels and Washington, you can only travel with a US or Belgian airline.
Since Sabena went into liquidation, the absence of a Belgian carrier on that route has meant that you can only fly to Washington with a US airline.
That is why the Court of Justice ruled that these bilateral agreements were illegal.
These agreements discriminate against our European airlines on the grounds of nationality.
With this agreement, we are changing the way in which things are done.
The United States recognises the European nature of our airlines.
All too often we forget that not just anyone can fly to the United States.
Sixteen countries have open skies agreements, but eleven do not.
You cannot fly directly from the Baltic countries to the United States, and the number of routes to the United States from Spain, Ireland and Greece, in particular, is strictly limited.
We are therefore going to open up new possibilities to these countries.
However, from the beginning, the problem has been the balance of the agreement between Europe and the United States.
In November 2005, the Council paid tribute to the progress made, progress regarding the approximation of the European and US rules on State aid, competition and security, and progress in terms of market access, but the Council also requested greater access to the US market.
I should like to explain to you why, at the end of the final round of negotiations, this agreement is more favourable to Europe.
I shall not go into detail about the freedoms of air transport - the fifth freedom, the seventh freedom - as derived from the 1944 Chicago Convention.
They are important, but they are technical.
Any technician will see that, where these famous freedoms are concerned, the European Union has gained more than it has conceded.
My speech is going to focus on the airlines' problems regarding ownership, investment and capital.
Firstly, investment in the United States.
US law, which Congress will not be reviewing in the short term due to intense political controversy, stipulates that foreigners cannot hold more than 25% of the voting shares in a US airline and that they cannot control it.
Against the backdrop of these two constraints, we have secured the right for European investors to hold more than 50% of the total capital, without, however, that being presumed to mean their having control of the airline.
We have succeeded in having the US authorities process investments in a fair and expeditious manner.
We have also secured the right for European investors to enter into franchise agreements.
Lufthansa will be able to add its name, its brand, its colours and sell its know-how to a US airline for US domestic transport.
This is not a theoretical arrangement.
The Virgin group, which freely sells its books and CDs in New York, is currently trying to sell its brand in order to create Virgin America in San Francisco.
The operation has come up against some serious obstacles.
The commitments entered into by the United States specify what action is possible precisely for this type of investment.
With regard to the provisions of the US reform, which failed in 2006 in the wake of some very strong opposition, and which some of you followed closely, it will not be possible to undermine the rights that we have negotiated.
These new rights are set in stone in the agreement and will not be subject to unilateral changes in the United States.
That is all I have to say about investments in the United States.
Secondly, US investment in Europe.
Since the United States cannot change its 25% rule, we have retained the option to limit US investment in European airlines to the same level.
This is about restoring the balance.
Thirdly, European investment in third countries.
Under the current rules, we cannot invest and control a third-country airline without running the risk of undermining its traffic rights for flights to the United States.
For example, Virgin has invested in Nigeria.
The United States disapproves of Virgin Nigeria's operations to the United States because the airline no longer has the right nationality.
With our agreement, the United States will no longer be able to oppose Community investment in European countries outside the European Union - such as Switzerland - and in 18 African countries.
There will be no comeback from the Americans on this point.
They will accept the fact that these third-country airlines may receive substantial investment from European airlines.
Fourthly, third-country investment in European airlines.
In line with what I just said, the United States will not challenge European-operated flights to the United States if European countries such as Iceland invest in their capital.
That will enable us to attract European investment in our airlines and to standardise the air transport industry.
That is why, ladies and gentlemen, this agreement is more balanced, and it is more balanced in the interests of Europe.
We must not overlook this first stage, because we need to complete a first stage before embarking on a second one, in order to lead us to the ultimate objective of an open aviation area.
Admittedly, some of the agreement's detractors fear that there will never be a second stage because the United States will have gained in all areas during the first stage, which is inaccurate.
You are right to request a mechanism that guarantees a shift to the second stage: well, I have obtained it!
The negotiations will start in January 2008 at the latest.
If we do not reach a second-stage agreement by the middle of 2010, we will be able to suspend the elements of the agreement.
Above and beyond reprisals, I personally am convinced that the momentum that we have created will break down the last remaining resistance with regard to ownership and control.
We did not build the internal market in one go.
We built it in three stages, but in less than 10 years.
Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, these 11 negotiating sessions have really made progress possible.
What is at stake behind this agreement?
In five years' time, between EUR 6 billion and EUR 12 billion profit.
One might also say, over the next five years, 80 000 jobs on both sides of the Atlantic, and, finally, 26 million passengers who will have the opportunity to travel between Europe and the United States, in addition to the 50 million passengers who already take advantage of transatlantic flights.
Thus, in five years, the number of passengers is likely to increase from 50 million to 75 million.
These estimates are the outcome of serious studies.
I shall conclude, therefore, by saying, ladies and gentlemen, that this agreement is clearly important and that it may be very valuable where Europe is concerned.
I should like to add that this morning's sitting will also help me to better perceive your expectations, to perhaps answer your questions and, once again, I would say that I am confident that we will be able to overcome this first stage and be secure in the knowledge that the second stage is now also in sight.
There you have, ladies and gentlemen, the information that I wished to communicate to you.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Madam President, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats congratulates Vice-President Barrot, his negotiating team and Mr Calleja Crespo most sincerely on the successful conclusion of this, the first part of the important EU-US air-transport agreement.
Let us also join together to thank the US negotiating team and Mr Byerly, however, as it was no easy task for him, either, to bring these negotiations to a successful conclusion.
There is no doubt that this agreement brings about a large transatlantic air-transport market at long last, to the benefit of air carriers and passengers.
From now on, European air carriers will be able to access the US market from all parts of the EU without national restrictions.
At the same time, we are implementing the 2002 judgment of the European Court of Justice.
The restrictions at London Heathrow Airport contravening Community law will also have to be lifted.
I am sure that the opening of the skies over the Atlantic will also give rise to attractive offers for air passengers.
The reason this agreement is balanced is that the Commission has succeeded in opening up access to US markets for European air carriers a little for the first time.
We could have seen more than market opening, but all the same.
New regulations on ownership and control rights, licensing and branding have been put in place.
I believe that these benefits are such as to justify our calling this a balanced agreement.
It is even more important, from my point of view, that we have set up a joint committee with the involvement of the business community, as this will be able to prevent, for example, the US or Europe taking unilateral security measures to the detriment of air carriers and passengers in future.
The PPE-DE Group urges the German Presidency to lose no time in ensuring support for this compromise in the Council - something that would also have great symbolic value.
I am very much obliged to our friend Mr El Khadraoui for his excellent resolution, which - I believe - will be adopted tomorrow by a large majority in the spirit of our discussions.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this debate is indeed very timely, for the negotiations have just been completed, and the Transport Council will be delivering its verdict next week.
In actual fact, it is only after that that this House will be able to speak out formally about the agreement, by means of a report, which I will then be drafting as soon as possible.
With the resolution, though, which has been compiled on my initiative with the support of the various groups, we want to send a clear message to the Council and the Commission.
In a nutshell, Commissioner, you can count on our support, and we are asking the Council to approve the negotiated agreement.
This agreement constitutes a major breakthrough on the road towards a fully integrated transatlantic aviation market and offers a way of escaping the legal sword of Damocles that has for some time been hanging over the aviation sector.
Opponents of the agreement are right when they say that there is still an imbalance between the rights which US companies can assert in Europe and the rights which we can assert in the USA.
There are historical reasons for this, because the US, thanks to a combination of bilateral agreements, is capable of a great deal more than us.
We should not overlook the fact, though, that the European aviation market was not liberalised in one step or overnight.
We were clearly in favour of one big agreement, but we think that this is not feasible politically speaking.
For European consumers, this agreement is good news.
As you stated before, European companies will be able to fly from anywhere in Europe to anywhere in the United States, which will lead to a greater supply and probably a reduction in prices.
Moreover, the US has made a number of concessions to grant European companies a little more access to the domestic US market.
You gave a few examples a moment ago.
What matters to us, though, is that this should be followed up by a second step.
We also think that if we set up a joint committee, this will allow a permanent dialogue, in which a host of aspects with regard to the social dimension, the environment, safety and security, can be addressed.
We placed quite a bit of emphasis on this aspect in the resolution, because to us, the liberalisation of the aviation sector, with all its implications, both positive and negative, must coincide with the laying down of high standards in the areas I have just listed.
We have noted, for example, that technical cooperation is provided for in the area of the environment so that the most efficient flight routes can be used in future.
This is a good thing.
To the doubting Thomases, particularly our British fellow Members, who are under pressure, I should like to say that in my view, they too stand to benefit a great deal from the agreement.
More than ever, Heathrow airport will be able to develop into the gateway to America, with more direct connections near British consumers.
Finally, Commissioner, we, for our part, will do our best to bring the subsequent stages to a successful end, by, for example, establishing contact with our counterparts from the Congress.
We hope we can count on your continued involvement in future negotiations.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) Madam President, for the moment, air traffic between the US and the EU, the world's two largest markets and together accounting for 60% of all global flight movements, is being regulated in bilateral open skies treaties.
Most Member States have concluded a separate regulation of this type with the US.
With the agreement that was concluded on 2 March last, these bilateral treaties will cease to exist indefinitely.
This represents an enormous step forward, which I very much welcome.
After all, these bilateral agreements form a barrier to free competition if take-off and landing rights are reserved for national airline companies, something which does not benefit industry, let alone the consumer.
This is also how the Court judged back in 2002.
And now, following years of negotiations, a reasonably balanced agreement is finally in place - not a perfect one, but a reasonable one nevertheless.
I should hope, then, that the Council will lend its approval to this agreement as soon as possible, that is to say during the meeting of 22 March next.
I consider the objections, lodged mainly by the United Kingdom, as not very constructive.
Protecting your own market in 2007 is an impertinence and is far removed from the European idea.
What is clear is that the new legal framework for transatlantic air transport will benefit the aviation industry, the consumer and employment too.
Moreover, it offers our European airline companies the all-important legal certainty that they so desperately need.
As I said a moment ago, the proposal is not perfect.
To this day, the US is using arguments such as safety and security to thwart the negotiations with regard to cabotage, as a result of which no progress has been made in that area.
Moreover, the possibility for airline companies from the EU to monitor US airline companies effectively is still restricted, despite extensive provisions of ownership.
Protecting our own market under the guise of safety and security makes no sense and is, as far as I am concerned, an admission of weakness.
At the same time, Commissioner, I am optimistic about the future, for the new framework does, after all, provide for a binding time schedule for a second agreement in which these restrictions will be retabled.
If the US continues to refuse future concessions, the EU must stand firm.
This is what, above all else, must be made clear to the Americans.
I am indebted to the Commissioner and his team for their resolve, and I hope that we will see more of it in future.
I should also like to thank our rapporteur, Mr El Khadraoui, for his drive and current input with regard to the resolution on which we will be voting tomorrow.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Madam President, in 10 days' time the Commissioner will officially present the draft EU-USA open skies agreement to the Union's transport ministers.
There has been a successful outcome to the negotiations, though the latter will actually continue, as some issues have yet to be settled.
The agreement will create an open transatlantic flight area, which means there will be no more arduous bilateral negotiations between the United States and individual Union Member States.
As to the practical implications for consumers, increased competition will obviously mean a wider choice of connections and lower ticket prices for passengers.
The Union has not singled out the United States for special treatment, as 16 similar earlier agreements exist between the European Union and countries in Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia.
The countries concerned include Croatia, Ukraine, Morocco, Lebanon, Singapore and Australia.
The European Union recently concluded an agreement of this nature with Chile too.
The previous speaker was right, of course, when she stated that in a sense this is an exceptional agreement because of the scale and importance of the flights concerned.
Not everything has yet been done to remove barriers and liberalise services.
The next stage, which must be borne very much in mind, is potential consent by the American side to facilitate investment by European companies in the US carrier market.
It is a rare event for an agreement entered into by the European Commission to prove so uncontroversial and so clearly beneficial to European consumers.
Congratulations are therefore due to the Commissioner.
The open skies policy presents an opportunity for better, more frequent and cheaper links between Europeans and Americans.
It will be possible to cross the Atlantic more cheaply and in greater comfort than previously.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, should like to start by thanking Mr El Khadraoui.
Whilst the agreement currently under discussion does reduce - at long last - some of the economic injustices suffered by Europe in the past, in a way it ignores the challenges of the future.
Unfortunately, the issue of air-transport emissions has been largely omitted, even though we must be aware in view of climate change that air transport, too, has to make a contribution to reducing atmospheric pollution.
I still see the unfortunate fact that complete reciprocity is yet to be achieved as a great problem.
We have to trust in a step-by-step plan for this.
If the United States should fail to adhere to this plan, Parliament must ensure that Europe shows backbone.
This goes for investment, and it should and must also go for the issue of the security of data transmission and, in particular, the issue of emission limits.
We must ensure that European interests are not sacrificed to certain sentimentalities, or individual economic interests put above the common interest.
Finally, I wanted to thank the Commissioner, too, for declaring that he supports opening the skies for all - which will please theologians: a very democratic approach that includes sinners.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, air transport between the EU and the USA accounts for around 60% of the world's air transport.
These two partners must therefore reach agreement if we want to make any progress on international air transport.
Such an agreement must primarily be evenly-balanced, acceptable to both sides and clearly specified from a technical point of view.
A further prerequisite is that it must be interpreted in the same way by both parties.
Ongoing negotiations have demonstrated that, just as in other areas, the United States' approach will be discriminatory and lacking in transparency, and, moreover, that the interpretation of the agreement will, over time, alter appreciably.
It is therefore vital to support further talks aimed at reaching the most balanced agreements on behalf of the EU as a whole.
Despite the progress that has been made, it is still too early to talk about an integrated transatlantic market in air transport.
These considerations will also be the basis for our approach to the proposed amendments.
Let us take a closer look at some specific issues in relations between the United States and the EU.
As things currently stand, there is a series of bilateral agreements between individual EU Member States and the United States.
The situation is confused, and if we think we can achieve complete compliance with EU law we are deluding ourselves.
The key problem at this stage is the negotiating power of the two partners.
The US position in this regard is, of course, substantially stronger, leading to unfair advantages for our transatlantic partners.
The first such prerequisite is naturally what is referred to as cabotage.
In the United States, inter-state air transport is classified as cabotage, whereas transport within the Union has yet to be incorporated as such into the Treaties.
This area should be harmonised.
It is likewise necessary to debate the typical protective measures that in the United States prohibit entities from other countries from controlling US aviation companies.
Mr Barrot made some very good points on this matter.
Similarly problematic is the requirement for control of infrastructure, that is, airports.
The discrepancy between the stated aims concerning liberalisation and the reality is even greater in this area.
As regards air transport in the Union, the discussion on the environmental impact of transport is a very topical one.
Among the issues covered are the taxing of fuel, the share of emissions, in particular carbon dioxide, noise and other controversial areas.
If carriers in the Union are to be committed under the Kyoto Protocol to emissions trading, it is essential that the same should apply to the competition, especially from the United States, which is our biggest competitor.
We should be aware that we are setting a precedent in creating new international rules which will establish a standard for the entire sector.
As regards social conditions, I feel that the problems come mainly in three forms.
The first is the obligation to have qualified crew; the second is the harmonisation of working hours, in terms of rotas for flight crew; and the third is requirements on qualifications for the ground staff who perform the pre-flight preparation of aircraft and the checks associated with stopover landings.
We have, in recent times, had to deal with security risks, biometric data obligations, forwarded passenger lists and various kinds of instructions and prohibitions.
Accordingly, we should also remain constantly aware of the recently adopted directive on improving the situation for people of reduced mobility in air transport.
Some measures introduced into airports almost come into conflict with passengers' human rights.
A typical example is the processing of passengers' personal data.
Commissioner, I would be interested to know how this relates to data protection under the Schengen System, which will be extended this year.
Other measures are verging on harassment, including the repeated baggage checks on transferring inside airports.
I believe that these problems will be resolved and I looking forward to working with the Commission on this.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Madam President, last week there was jubilation in some quarters over the major breakthrough in the long sought-after 'open skies' agreement.
I have very mixed feelings about the whole issue.
On the one hand, I think it is good that flying becomes more affordable and that there will be more flights available.
Of course, we will have to match the increase with greater fuel efficiency in order to avoid major increases in emissions.
However, if the cheaper flights wind up funnelling travel into the three major European hub airports, travelling will become more of a nightmare than it is even today.
We have many regional airports with the potential to open up areas of Europe to visitors and business, but I fear that they will be sidelined in the deregulated, competitive environment of open skies, if we are not careful about how it is set up.
The effect on regional airports and their surrounding areas needs to be assessed.
In my constituency, we have for a long time been asking for an impact assessment, particularly in the Shannon area.
Even at this late stage, it is important that we carry out such assessments.
(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, over recent years, we have heard it said ever more frequently, by the people of Europe, and also by many European governments, that Europe is interfering in everything; this criticism is not entirely accidental, and it is, in a number of cases, justified.
The example we have before us today shows, though, that there is a whole range of issues in which we need more of Europe and more of a Community approach in it, too.
Looked at from that angle, then, we can do no other than welcome the conclusion of this prospective Open Sky agreement between Europe and the United States, which will replace a very large number of individual agreements and also serve as an example for many other agreements between the European Union and other parts of the world.
Getting a good result out of the Americans is no easy thing to do, as you, Mr Vice-President, said, and you gave a number of examples.
We are aware that it may, under certain circumstances, be even more difficult to reach agreement with the present Congress, but that must not be allowed to result in the USA unilaterally securing itself particular advantages out of its negotiating position.
I might well turn that around and say that it would be a good thing if the Commission and the Council were to take greater account than they have to date of the desire of the European Parliament, as the representatives of the people, to add its voice here.
One very practical argument in this context - something not directly the subject of the agreement, but having much to do with it - is that safety regulations in international air travel have hitherto been largely, and unilaterally, dictated by the Americans' interests and actions, and this needs to be reviewed, and, if necessary, changed.
Madam President, with over 40% of the EU-US market, this particular agreement is of great interest, of course, to the United Kingdom.
While I accept that the agreement could deliver some benefits to consumers, it has still to my mind failed to address some fundamental issues and has a number of question markets over it.
In particular, the deal falls well short of providing the kind of access to the US market that a number of EU carriers would like.
It does little with regard to ownership of US airlines and appears little different from previous deals rejected by the European Union.
So, in my opinion, those who enthusiastically welcomed this agreement may need to pause a little and examine it in more detail to see what it delivers for the EU.
I know the ultimate goal is to create an open aviation area with the US and I indeed support any agreement that would unlock the transatlantic aviation market.
But the question is: does this deal help deliver that?
To me it is a deal that promises the EU jam tomorrow and gives the US the jam today.
However, if this agreement does go ahead, then we must ensure that a clear timetable is quickly put in place with real and serious incentives on both sides to move forward to a second stage deal that delivers a fully open aviation market.
In short, I do not think this deal is a disaster, but it is not as great as the Commission would have you believe.
It is merely a first step and one that would appear to benefit the US.
I look forward in future agreements to the United States giving something a bit more substantial back and for that country to stop over-protecting its aviation industry.
(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I can express neither enthusiasm nor disappointment, but I feel it is appropriate to acknowledge the pragmatism with which the Commissioner and the Commission concluded this negotiation phase.
Certainly, we would all have preferred a general agreement also covering the ownership, control and opening-up of the US domestic market.
It is clear, however, that this preference conflicts with the highly important fact that we approached the negotiations in question with two aims in mind: an internal aim and an external aim.
These aims reflect a need and an interest: a need to put an end to the discrimination inside the European Union caused by having accepted the existence of such distinct markets and the possibility of bilateral agreements, which create unjust situations within the Community - something that the European Court of Justice has prohibited.
Evidently, this need, which concerns Europe only, to put an end to the discrimination has weakened our ability to negotiate with the United States.
From this we can realistically conclude that this first stage is undoubtedly 'internal', and in this light it is simple to predict the result of any impact assessment: there will be some countries, companies and airports that will be adversely affected by this agreement, and others that will benefit from it.
The fact remains, however, that we are reducing monopolistic powers in favour of an equitable opening to all, in all countries and throughout Europe.
I believe that this must be considered a positive aim.
Secondly, I would like to draw attention to the issue of security and safety, with reference both to ownership and to the opening-up of the internal market.
It is clear that, for the United States, this may represent a valid reason or an excuse.
We must remove any element of excuse.
Agreement on security and safety rules must be paramount, to enable this issue to be resolved, since a solution to this problem would invalidate every other argument on insecurity attributable to the foreign ownership of companies within the United States, or on insecurity attributable to the opening-up of the internal market.
I would also point out that, in the United States, security as a whole comes under the federal budget, and from this point of view it would be useful for Europe to reflect on the way in which we approach the subject.
Madam President, firstly I would like to thank the Commissioner for his statement and, indeed, to give him some credit, which he deserves for moving matters forward.
I am afraid, though, that I am going to have to disagree with some of my friends here, because, although I applaud efforts to open markets, the markets must be opened fairly and I fear that this agreement does not go far enough.
Not only would the current proposals cause harm to British business, but they could also have a detrimental effect on some of our EU businesses generally as well.
What is now on the table will undoubtedly give US companies a substantial share of our unregulated market, while EU companies will be left to fight for the scraps of the US regulated market.
I think we should be fighting harder for reciprocal agreements on ownership rights.
In the current deal as I understand it, US interests can own up to 49 % of the voting stock of an EU airline, whereas EU interests can only own up to 25 % voting stock of a US airline, and I am not sure that is fair or open.
According to the Court of Justice, any transatlantic negotiation should fully honour Member State bilateral agreements, such as Bermuda II, and I think this agreement does not adequately deal with that.
The Commission is seeking to harmonise its policy and has not taken into account the full differences between states.
What we are calling for on this matter is continuing action rather than just dialogue.
I think the Commission has certainly moved things forward, but it is also important that, when we go back to the negotiating table in three months' time - which, again, I welcome - there must be some firm commitments from the United States to take more action in response to our needs in this field.
(ES) Madam President, Mr Vice-President, I am particularly delighted to be able to congratulate you on the Commission's success, supported by the German Presidency and assisted by its efficient services, with something of a Spanish stamp, I think it is fair to say.
Furthermore, this success follows the pressure exerted by, amongst others, this Parliament, which supported the Commission's open skies strategy from the outset, and encouraged it in the face of increasing difficulties, as in the case of these complicated transatlantic relations.
This agreement has the great virtue of strengthening those transatlantic relations at a crucial time for everybody: on the eve of elections in the United States and at a time when we need to make progress with environmental requirements for Europe's aviation sector.
It also helps to strengthen European identity and the European Union's identity as a global partner.
In that regard, I believe that this agreement sends a good message to the citizens.
It is also an agreement that makes a decisive contribution to the Lisbon Strategy and specifically, in the case of anti-trust immunity, to facilitating commercial agreements and the development of alliances amongst airlines, which undoubtedly promote the growth and democratisation of air travel amongst the citizens.
It also contains provisions on technical cooperation with regard to climate change, which I hope will be useful in terms of tackling the impact of the aviation sector.
I am also pleased with the provisions on the control of airlines and, with regard to the security mentioned by Mr Costa, the truth is that I would prefer us firstly to analyse the results of the United States system in depth, since its reliability has very much been called into question on occasions.
We must now finally overcome the remaining resistance in the Council and I hope that the work of Mr El Khadraoui will be of use to you in that regard.
Madam President, the recent agreement of principle between the United States and the EU on open skies is extremely welcome because, from a situation that seemed totally deadlocked a number of months ago, we are now on the brink of an open aviation market.
This will benefit the travelling public.
Competition within the aviation sector has revolutionised air travel.
Air passengers now have choice, and low-fare, no-frills air travel has become the order of the day.
Passengers will benefit even more under the new arrangement.
The ownership issue, which was a problem for the United States, has hopefully been resolved by way of an honourable compromise.
But I would agree with my colleagues Mr Simpson and Mr Kirkhope and I would encourage the Commission to be very tough in future negotiations with the United States.
I commend the Commission for the strong stand it has taken in refusing to allow individual bilaterals between Member States within the EU and the United States.
Such bilaterals would undermine and delay the agreement just reached.
The new arrangement will hopefully offer some protection to Shannon Airport on the west coast of Ireland.
For over 70 years, Shannon airport has been the gateway airport between the United States and Ireland.
All planes travelling to and from the US stopped off at Shannon.
In recent years, this compulsory stopover has been diluted.
But, crucially, the new agreement would incorporate a transition period for airports such as Shannon to enable them to adapt to the new situation.
It is equally important that the open skies agreement be reviewed every few years in order to monitor the impact of the agreement on Shannon and other similar airports.
The agreement is a very historic one. Indeed, it is the most historic since the 1944 Chicago Convention.
I would commend both sides, and the Commission in particular, for rescuing an agreement that a few short months ago seemed doomed to failure.
(PL) Madam President, Commissioner, taken together, the EU and US aviation markets account for 60% of aviation movements in the world.
The EU-USA air services agreement will therefore be beneficial to consumers on both sides of the Atlantic.
It will help deepen transatlantic relations and serve as a model for further liberalisation and approximation of legal provisions the world over.
The Court of Justice ruling states that several bilateral air services agreements between Member States and the United States do not comply with the European Union's legal principles, and that the EU-USA air services agreement is the best way of ensuring full compliance with Union legislation.
The harmonisation of legal provisions, notably in the area of safety, environmental protection and workers' social rights is especially important in this type of air services agreement.
The fundamental issue is close cooperation between the appropriate EU and US authorities concerned with aviation safety, both at EU and US federal level and also at Member State level.
The aim should be to create a single aviation protection area, which implies a single passenger and baggage check at the start of the journey, not at each transfer as well.
I also wish to emphasise that exchange of passengers' personal data between the EU and the US must be undertaken respecting the privacy of European and American citizens.
This has already been made clear in European Parliament resolutions.
The transatlantic air services agreement must be founded on the Convention on Human Rights and on other international acts guaranteeing citizens' rights and freedoms.
Thanks are due to Mr El Khadraoui for his conscientious work on the development of the European Parliament's stance on this matter.
(FR) Madam President, Mr Barrot, well done!
The debates and negotiations have been going on for years now.
Your task was difficult but you have managed to be persuasive and effective.
I should like to pay tribute to the agreement reached because it is a good agreement for European interests.
The liberalisation of transatlantic air traffic is in fact going to boost the growth of our airlines at a time when they are facing an increase in the price of kerosene, increasingly strict security constraints and a forthcoming tax introduced as part of the fight against global warming.
By allowing them from now on to operate flights to the United States from any European city and no longer just from their country of origin, you are generating more activities for our airlines and thus more jobs to offer to our fellow citizens.
More routes and also more freedom regarding the frequency and times of flights will also mean more choice for consumers: European and US passengers will therefore be the second big winners as a result of this agreement.
A third source of satisfaction is the opportunity now provided to European airlines to acquire more than 50% of the capital of US airlines.
One might certainly regret the fact that our US friends are preventing the market from operating freely by refusing to grant more than 25% of voting rights to European airlines, but let us not turn our noses up because things are sometimes best left as they are.
Furthermore, you said, Commissioner, that the agreement stipulated in return the option for the Union to limit US equity investment in our airlines.
Like Mr Jarzembowski, I should like to conclude by urging the European transport ministers to give their full support in a few days' time to the Commission, because it is the interests of one of our largest economic sectors that are at stake, and we need to protect them.
Faced with the United States, this kind of result would not have been possible without the pooling of our resources.
On our own, we cannot achieve much; together, Commissioner, anything is possible.
(ES) Madam President, good relations between the United States and the European Union are crucial to both sides of the Atlantic, although some people would prefer that not to be the case.
Fortunately, it is a long time since Columbus reached the new world in an ecologically acceptable way.
And it is a long time since the monopolistic extremism that brought so much backwardness to Europe.
The European Commission has just reached an air transport agreement with the United States which opens up new prospects for European air companies.
Mr Vice-President of the Commission, allow me to congratulate you most warmly on all of the work you have done.
I would also like to congratulate your director, Mr Daniel Calleja, and, if you will allow me, Mr Vice-President, to mention the spirit that I am sure is contained in this agreement, also your predecessor, Mrs Loyola de Palacio.
I truly believe that this is a significant achievement on the part of the Commission.
I hope that the Council will unequivocally approve this agreement as soon as possible.
Bilateral agreements between the United States and the Member States need to be replaced by broader agreements.
And if the agreement can be applied from October, as the Commission intends, then all the better.
When that is the case, when the single sky is a reality, the European citizens and companies will enjoy many advantages: common rules on both sides of the Atlantic, the possibility of opening up new passenger and goods transport routes, as well as lower costs, which will make our companies and our air transport more competitive.
All of this should benefit consumers in terms of the final price of their tickets.
The ultimate objective of these agreements is the creation of a future area of free provision of air services between the United States and the European Union, which will conform to the Lisbon Strategy and enhance transatlantic relations, which are so necessary.
Madam President, I should like to apologise for being a little late and I appreciate your tolerance.
I was having difficulty with the lifts.
Transatlantic tourism is of vital importance to Ireland, and there is much room for expansion.
Of the nearly seven million people who visited Ireland in 2005, over half a million of them came from across the Atlantic, contributing over EUR 500 million to the Irish economy.
It has been estimated that these numbers could triple if the open skies agreement is ratified, and generate an extra EUR 1 billion for the Irish economy.
With the advent of open skies, we can continue to benefit from the goodwill we have received from hosting events such as the Tour de France, the Special Olympics and the Ryder Cup.
If a small country like Ireland can benefit in that way, what potential is there for the continent of Europe?
Of course we should be concerned about climate change, but the answer is to find new fuels for air transport and make more efficient use of existing fuels.
Protectionism does not benefit the consumer or our economies.
A clear open skies policy not only encourages individuals to travel to Europe but also helps to promote European goods in North America.
Open skies opens up more of the American market to European consumers and business people.
Our ability to travel and trade with more cities can only help to boost our economies and allow us additional access to the strong US economy, especially now, given the current strength of the euro against the dollar.
This bodes well for European business.
In conclusion, the economic and cultural exchanges that will be made possible by this agreement will ensure that the United States and Europe maintain a healthy relationship for years to come, and I urge the Commission and the Council to resist protectionism and self-interest in this matter.
Madam President, I should like sincerely to thank the MEPs and all the speakers for their support and their extremely valuable contribution to this important debate.
There is no doubt that we are on the verge of concluding an historic agreement where transatlantic relations are concerned, historic, too, in terms of moving aviation forward in the world and - as has been pointed out - of making air transport democratic and putting it within the reach of as many people as possible.
I shall not go back over the benefits of the agreement, which have been emphasised by, among others, Mr Jarzembowski and Mr El Khadraoui, to whom I am particularly grateful for his initiative.
Access for airlines from any European country to any location in the United States, without discrimination on nationality grounds, is one of the very important benefits.
That, above all, will enable us, Mr Costa, to resolve certain legal problems that emerged in the wake of the open skies judgments.
Another huge benefit for consumers is the fact that they have more choice at better prices.
Furthermore, we are opening up to 60% of the world's traffic.
We ought not to forget that a joint committee exists that will play a key role with regard to applying the agreement, to debating social issues, to addressing the issues of ownership and control, to competition, to aid and to environmental issues.
Some of you raised the problem of security, not least Mrs Hennis-Plasschaert.
This agreement contains provisions that are crucial in terms of facilitating the controls on both sides of the Atlantic and of eventually having equivalent systems that will allow us to move in the direction of a single form of security control, or 'one stop security'.
With regard to environmental aspects, I should like specifically to address Mrs Lichtenberger in order to tell her that she is right.
We intend precisely to cooperate far more effectively with the Federal Aviation Administration.
On this subject, we are going to review the way in which we operate flights over the Atlantic with the aim of reducing their flight paths.
We are also going to research solutions enabling us to use fuel efficiently and to reduce emissions.
There is therefore an entire environmental section there.
A number of you raised the problem of cabotage, not least Mr KohlÃ­Äek.
The option of operating cabotage services in the United States is much debated; we will not have that option to start with.
Nor will cabotage be permitted for US airlines: thus, a US airline is not permitted to transport passengers or cargo between Frankfurt and Berlin.
Mrs Sinnott, the agreement will also benefit regional airports by opening up new opportunities with the elimination of the existing restrictions.
Mr Rack and several of you emphasised security problems.
The United States has acknowledged the importance of working on common practices and standards in order to reduce as far as possible the differences between the European Union and the United States on these issues, and it will take account of the measures that have already been applied within the European Union.
Mr Simpson, the transatlantic area will clearly not be built in one go.
We are, in fact, talking here about a first stage, but one that has already established a very strong link with the second stage: Europe will be able to suspend Americans' access rights if they drag their feet and if no progress is made.
We therefore have the means to act in order to guarantee that there really will be a second stage towards our ultimate aim.
I should like to say to Mr Kirkhope that, since the United States has not yet agreed to change its 25% rule, we have retained the option of limiting its investment in European airlines at the same level. This is one way of restoring the balance.
Madam President, you asked me to be brief.
I should therefore like to apologise to the speakers to whom I have not had time to respond clearly.
I should like to thank all of the speakers and also to say to those MEPs who belong to Member States that are not covered by the 'open skies' agreements, and particularly to the Irish Members who spoke, that the will exists on our side to extend the benefits of this liberalisation of transatlantic air transport to all of the Member States.
Mrs De Veyrac and other speakers stressed that all of this is the fruit of extensive efforts.
I should like to take this opportunity to remember Mrs Loyola de Palacio, who also did a great deal of work on this first stage, which I feel is important for the future of Europe and of transatlantic relations, for the economy and for employment.
(Applause)

- Before the vote on Amendment 1
(ES) I am speaking simply to propose a minor modification to the amendment, in the name of legal rigour.
The amendment would be worded as follows:
'trafficking and to take an initiative towards the Council for a Communitarisation of European policy;'
(ES) Essentially, the Commission is being asked, within the context of its right to legislative initiative, shall we say, to communitise the law from the point of view of gender violence.
Are there any objections to the inclusion of this oral amendment?
(The oral amendment was not accepted)
- Before the vote on paragraph 30
rapporteur. - (IT) Mr President, I should like to propose an oral amendment: where the text reads 'calls on the Commission to draw up measures, under the Media 2007 programme', to replace the words 'draw up' with the word 'encourage', given that the Commission cannot draw up programmes but can only encourage them.
Are there any objections to the inclusion of this oral amendment?
(The oral amendment was accepted)

Explanations of vote
Interest subsidies designed to offset the Member States' interest charges in connection with the purchase of EU agricultural products are one of many drawbacks to EU agricultural policy, which needs to be radically transformed.
In the interests of consistency, it should, however, be accepted that, where the new Member States are concerned, a certain amount of interest offsetting might take place to prevent mass unemployment from being created in the poorer parts of Europe.
This report concerns an extension to a regulation that has existed since 2004 and that compensates those new Member States whose interest substantially exceeds the EU average.
The cost of an extension amounts to approximately EUR 10 million per year.
It has been proposed that funding be obtained from savings within other budget headings so that there are no additional aggregate budget increases.
The Commission also regards this extension as part of a package in which the removal of subsidies for maize cultivation is also proposed - a step that would mean a significant saving of approximately EUR 35 million in 2008 (with, according to the Commission, a total saving for 2008-2014 of EUR 617.8 million).
In the longer term, a 'no' vote would be in danger not only of having a bad effect on the new Member States, but also of jeopardising the Commission's proposed saving of just over EUR 600 million.
I have therefore chosen, in spite of everything, to vote in favour of this report.
(DE) Mr President, although it is very difficult to give a statement of vote with all this noise going on, I would like to say that I abstained from voting on the grounds that I find this state of affairs unsatisfactory.
Germany and a number of recalcitrant deficit-runners may well now be on the road to recovery, but I do not see that as an occasion for rejoicing, and all the less so in view of the fact that they, while benefiting from the surprising strong economic growth, are nevertheless considering extracting even more money from the consumers' pockets.
It is for that reason that I have abstained from voting.
in writing. (PL) I voted in favour of adoption of the report on the opinion on the Council Regulation repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 2040/2000 on budgetary discipline- C6- 0277/2006-
Mr Lewandowski presented a good report.
Council Regulation (EC) No 2040/2000 of 26 September 2000 became redundant following implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 and implementation of the new credit guarantee reserve mechanism for the period 2007-2013.
Repeal of this regulation will improve the quality of Community legislation.
Doing away with outdated provisions will significantly improve the transparency of our legislation, and facilitate its implementation.
in writing. - (PT) This proposal to amend a number of directives as regards procedural rules and evaluation criteria for the prudential assessment of acquisitions aims principally at promoting cross-border mergers and acquisitions (M[amp]A) in the banking and financial sector.
In other words, it aims at promoting the concentration and centralisation of capital at European level, by improving the penetration ability of foreign capital and the integration of the financial markets.
Prudential assessment is thus seen as an obstacle to cross-border M[amp]A, following a Commission survey presented in November 2005 on barriers to consolidation of the financial sector within the internal market.
Apart from maximum harmonisation, among other technical details, the proposal provides for reducing the periods for prudential assessment by the competent national and banking supervisory authorities from the current 65 days to 30 days.
The compromise proposal extends the period proposed by the Commission but still accepts a reduction to the current period.
We therefore voted against.
in writing. The unanimity of agreement between the committee members who actively considered this report underlines the concerns for shareholders.
Institutional shareholdings by fund managers who sought to repatriate rights to owners of those shares was critical to the success and balance of this report.
Similarly the level of communications and appropriate timing has renewed the connection between share owners and boards of directors, allowing questions to be put without the 'nuisance effect' which could jeopardise effective management of shareholder meetings.
(DE) Mr President, I should like to explain why I voted against the Howitt report.
The attempt is being made to compel people, under the heading of Corporate Social Responsibility, to do what small and medium-sized enterprises have always done in any case, for social responsibility is a major characteristic of small and medium-sized businesses and a permanent feature of their entrepreneurial culture.
The European Union's misguided subsidies policy, though, has for years on end supported big businesses and limited companies for which the worker is no more than an exchangeable item, and which have, slowly but surely, driven small and medium-sized enterprises off the market.
It is for this reason that I voted against this report.
in writing. The UK Conservative delegation voted against the Howitt report in committee, as did the EPP-ED, because it was oppressive and regulatory in tone.
The UK Labour rapporteur had called for yet more EU legislation, rather than inspiring companies to choose to adopt the concept themselves.
As a result of my amendments in plenary this report has been completely turned around.
The voluntary nature proposed by the Commission has been endorsed.
Parliament has accepted that a social EU does not automatically need more EU regulation.
As is increasingly the case, it has been UK Conservatives setting the agenda.
in writing. - (PT) The current trend in the majority of EU countries, with the increase in insecure and badly paid jobs and the exploitation of migrant workers both from outside the European Union and from within the EU itself - as has been happening with Portuguese workers in the Netherlands and Spain, for instance, and now in the United Kingdom - goes to show that companies are accepting less and less social responsibility.
Furthermore, the countless relocations by multinationals, even when their productivity levels are high, just because they want ever larger profits, demonstrating complete insensitivity towards the thousands of people they make redundant, are proof that most large companies practise no social responsibility whatsoever.
It is symptomatic that the proposals that we tabled in plenary were rejected, since they highlight the incongruence between the objectives attributed to corporate social responsibility and the employment policies put forward by the Commission, particularly 'flexicurity', designed to liberalise unfair dismissals, support the proliferation of precarious work and devalue collective agreements and employment with rights.
Therefore, despite the positive proposals contained in the report, little is likely to change in practice until there is political will for change and a proper review of labour law and International Labour Organisation rules.
I see three fundamental contradictions in this report on corporate social responsibility.
The first is the claim that this responsibility is established on a voluntary basis while there is a requirement for frameworks, standards, definitions, controls and incentives to be created that are so diverse and restrictive as to undermine the very voluntary nature of this approach.
The second is the claim that businesses are being encouraged to be socially responsible when all EU policies, and especially competition policy, actually encourage businesses to relocate and to look for the lowest fiscal, social, environmental and labour cost bidder, including within the EU.
The third is the desire to make European businesses act in a socially responsible way, without excessive international trade really being challenged and with our markets continuing to be opened up to imports from countries that practise all forms of dumping, forced labour, child labour and political prisoner labour.
There is a certain hypocrisy to that.
Even if you deny it, you are making businesses bear the responsibility and making them suffer the consequences of your policies, your failures, your powerlessness and your defeats.
in writing. - (FR) Corporate social responsibility is a mish-mash of a concept that, notwithstanding the imagination of the ultra-Europeans, has nothing original to it.
This non-binding gimmick appeared in the United States as far back as the 1950s.
In France, the notion of 'socially responsible companies' came about specifically at the time of the Sudreau report in 1975.
And, in 1982, social objectives were imposed on businesses in the public competition sector in an attempt to shock the people and the executives of triumphant socialism.
Twenty-five years later, CSR is aimed quite simply at humanising and regulating globalisation.
These pious hopes in times of unemployment and social precarity against a backdrop of international instability make CSR seem like a huge con.
We must clearly stop wasting our time and our money on considerations that are aimed merely at sending out polite weedy messages when we are lagging behind the world.
Let us be responsible, first and foremost, for ourselves.
Let us show respect for ourselves by implementing a Europe-wide system of preference and of Community protection for people, production and businesses.
Let us increase, for instance, customs duties on imports of third-country goods that have not been manufactured in accordance with minimum European social standards.
in writing. - (PT) In a perfect market, both the economic performance and the social or environmental impact of a company would be taken into account in determining its worth and its public image.
In a perfect market, consumers would choose the products that were directly best for them and indirectly best for their other interests.
Of course, such a market does not exist.
Those who follow a continually interventionist line will therefore argue for greater regulation and more legislation.
That is not the route that I advocate.
Even though I realise that the market is not and never will be perfect, my preference lies with market mechanisms and with solutions that bring such mechanisms to bear.
Thus, measures that promote and disseminate good practice and, above all, those that foster a demanding consumer culture are preferable in my view.
That leaves the issue of competitiveness.
I am not convinced by the idea that profit, or simply economic viability, always has to be at odds with the environment, employment and social responsibility.
Profit is not an evil: it is a good thing, provided that it is gained in accordance with the rules, particularly those created within the market as a result of greater pressure from consumers.
These are the rules that we must bring to bear.
Not by a long shot is it taken as self-evident, as it should be, that companies should exercise corporate social responsibility.
Companies that consider themselves to be socially responsible owe it to society to reduce to a minimum the negative social and environmental effects of their activities.
Meanwhile, since many initiatives have claimed the label of 'socially responsible', consumers can no longer see the wood for the trees and every inspection becomes an impossible task to the layman.
Moreover, the effects of the free market and the destructive nature of the constant quest for the lowest prices is progressively becoming a matter of common knowledge.
Regulations are needed in this area in order to strengthen the consumer's hand and reinforce the supporting structure of the odd well-meaning company.
Europe can play a pioneering role on the social responsibility front by developing policy that creates, and enforces, standards whilst at the same time guaranteeing a level playing field.
This is exactly what Mr Howitt's report on 'corporate social responsibility: a new partnership' is doing.
It pleads, inter alia, in favour of compulsory reporting, chain responsibility and more transparency where lobbyists are concerned.
It also argues in favour of lending more weight to the social and environmental effects in public tenders.
Since the report quite clearly opts in favour of sustainability, it receives my unqualified support.
in writing. I welcome the rapporteur's own-initiative report.
The concept of a European standard for product-labelling recognising human rights and workers' rights should be supported.
There are still too many people in our world today, many of whom are children, living under modern-day slavery.
With the bicentenary of the abolition of slavery being remembered on 25 March, we need to do all that we can to combat modern-day slavery.
Corporate social responsibility helps us in this battle.
in writing. (DE) My reason for rejecting the Howitt report is that the most essential characteristic of Corporate Social Responsibility is voluntarism rather than dirigisme.
Mandatory social and environmental reporting goes against the Lisbon Strategy and militates against the reduction of bureaucracy to such an extent that I find myself unable to support it.
Such dirigisme handicaps and endangers most of all small and medium-sized businesses, which were and still are the backbone of the German economy.
It is out of concern at this approach that I firmly repudiate the report.
(DE) Mr President, like the Austrian People's Party delegation as a whole, I voted in favour of the Sartori report, since we take the view - and it is a sad and lamentable fact that that view still has to be expressed - that women are no more able than they were to lead a life combining work, career, and children, that is to say, a life in every circumstance of which they determine for themselves what they shall do.
We are in favour of women being given in this respect, once and for all, the freedom to choose, and of policymakers creating the conditions under which women will be able to do just that, particularly with regard to education, vocational training and equal pay for equal work.
(NL) Mr President, for clarity's sake, I should like to say that my vote against the Sartori report should not be seen as a rejection of gender equality.
This is a principle I wholeheartedly endorse and regard as an important achievement of our European civilisation.
It is a principle that is increasingly being challenged in our society due to the mobilisation of Islam in Europe, and this mobilisation of Islam and its effects on our values and our civilisation is indeed something about which a great deal can be said.
Unfortunately, the report does not breathe a word about this.
What I am opposed to, though - and hence my vote against the report - is the compulsory quotas and parities in all kinds of institutions and in the political world.
In fact, I regard this mandatory quota for women as an insult, and I take the view that women do not need positive discrimination in order to claim their legitimate place in society in the way, and when, they want this.
in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the Sartori report on a roadmap for equality between women and men (2006-2010).
Although gender equality is a value proclaimed by the European Union, there is still some way to go, for example regarding equal pay.
In this regard, I endorse the rapporteur's proposals aimed at requesting the application of the equal pay principle so that the 15% gap between the pay awarded to a man and to a woman doing the same job is no longer the rule.
I welcome the implementation of practical strategies aimed at promoting female entrepreneurship.
Furthermore, I am delighted by the proposal in the report that calls on the Commission to speed up the creation of policies aimed at reconciling family and professional life, not least by actively encouraging fathers to make use of available flexible working time options and to take on household chores and family work.
I am also delighted by the measures designed to protect women and children from all forms of violence, including slavery, honour crimes, human trafficking and polygamy.
Finally, I am delighted by the request made to the Commission concerning the adoption of practical initiatives for promoting the emancipation and integration of migrant women.
in writing. (SV) Because we think it obvious that men and women should be equal, we have voted in favour of the equality road map.
We also believe, however, that responsibility for most of the actions taken to achieve equality should lie with individuals.
Because the measures requiring legislation come, more often than not, within the competence of the individual Member States, we have voted against a long list of separate proposals in the report.
We do not, for example, believe that the EU should decide on matters such as childcare, maternity and paternity leave or abortion legislation in the Member States.
in writing. - (PT) All the proposals that we tabled to clarify the causes of the kinds of discrimination that still exist were rejected in the plenary vote.
I would highlight the following:
Emphasises the need to amend the European Union's economic policies so that all women, men and children can live with dignity and without the threat of poverty;
Underlines the importance of establishing Community indicators on childcare facilities and on the gap in wages and other income between men and women, by sector, not least as regards atypical work and part-time work;
Underlines the need to fight for the mainstreaming of gender equality in the economic guidelines, including in the accession process, with a view to avoiding the adverse effects in terms of gender equality that are generated by privatisation and liberalisation processes and cuts in public spending in social sectors, and reaffirms that high-quality public services are essential, calling for an increase in budget funding in social areas so as to prevent social exclusion and combat the trafficking of women;
Fears that policies focusing on increasing EU competitiveness may jeopardise the interests of women in other regions of the world.
Hence our decision to abstain.
in writing. (SV) Gender equality and women's vulnerability in both private life and the life of society as a whole are among the greatest issues of our time.
We have voted against the report, however, because we are confident that the national parliaments of the individual Member States can manage these important issues appropriately.
We do not believe that the EU should express opinions on issues of this type in far-reaching reports resembling political programmes more than anything else, and we object in principle to the general trend whereby the EU institutions endeavour to achieve influence and competence within ever more areas.
The role of the EU in this connection is to ensure that no existing or future Member States offend against the values pertaining to gender equality.
in writing. - (FR) The fact that we are discussing gender equality 50 years after the Treaty of Rome is not an illustration of success.
This principle has been enshrined in the Treaty since 1999.
The legal basis for this policy is therefore sound.
Although this report is useful in terms of making up time, it leaves a lot to be desired.
On the occasion of International Women's Day, the main theme in my country was the tailoring of pension rights to individual needs and the dividing up of those rights accumulated during marriage in the event of divorce.
I am delighted that the roadmap stipulates that social protection systems should allow people to accrue individual pension rights.
I should like to point out that, on the basis of one of my 1991 resolutions, this House adopted a report in 1994 on the sharing out of pension rights in the event of divorce.
The report made some practical proposals to the Commission, which took no follow-up action whatsoever.
Why?
The same goes for my report and our proposals aimed at creating a framework for establishing a status for assisting spouses.
All of this forms part of equal opportunities policy.
We have heard enough fine words from the successive commissioners: where is the action?
in writing. - (FR) Five days on from International Women's Day, the European Parliament is proposing a roadmap for equality between men and women.
Is the timing a coincidence?
The fact remains that women are at the forefront, if not in reality, then at least in the texts.
The report presented to us proposes a near exhaustive list of the measures to be taken to guarantee equality between women and men.
While numerous proposals have been put forward, not least those relating to the measures aimed at better reconciling the obligations of family and professional life, it must unfortunately be said that many worrying and meaningless points feature in this report.
I am talking, for example, about yet another attempt to introduce a system of quotas for the recruitment and participation of women in all economic and political sectors.
We know that this measure can only be counterproductive in terms of the way in which women are portrayed and thought of.
However, I am also talking about the pointless proposal to create a 'Ms Lisbon' in charge of ensuring that the Lisbon Strategy is implemented properly: a kind of 'European superwoman'.
Proposals such as this only discredit the initiatives taken to promote women.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality has approved an ambitious report on the Roadmap for equality between women and men.
Reconciling a fully-fledged job with the other things to which people aspire, such as family, social and personal involvement, is a challenge for the future for both women and men.
The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has voted against certain elements of the report, either because these fly in the face of our political conviction, or because the areas involved should fall within the remit of the Member States rather than that of the European Union.
As we see it, equal opportunities policy is a serious matter, and we take the view that this report, even if it does not contain any legislative commitments, is sufficiently important to take note of what is and is not included in it.
Even though we do not agree with everything that is in this report from the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, we still want to send a message that, in the area of gender equality, 50 years after the Treaty of Rome, a great deal can, and indeed must, be done.
Let there be no doubt about the fact that we too want equal opportunities, for we, too, are persuaded that Europe has a great deal to do in that area, and that is why our group has voted unanimously in favour of Mrs Sartori's report.
in writing. - (PT) We agree in general with the proposals included in this report seeking clarification from the Commission on the recommendation on collective cross-border management of copyright and related rights for legitimate online music services.
The Commission proposal has sown considerable unease in the relations among European collective rights management societies (CRMs), with divisions between the large, small and medium-sized ones.
It must be pointed out that the Commission recommendation would benefit the major operators and the large multinational recording publishers in the online music market and would harm both authors and cultural diversity.
At the same time, it would be an open invitation to concentrate nearly all rights management in the hands of two or three enormous CRMs, which would distort the concept underlying their establishment, which is the concept that gives them legitimacy.
We therefore generally agree with the proposals to amend the recommendation, which aim at making it more effective and fairer, thus safeguarding cultural diversity.
We believe there should be a proposal for a directive on this issue as soon as possible, in order to minimise the damage that the recommendation is causing to relations among CRMs, and between them and their various users.
While the introduction of competition between collective management societies may be beneficial for rightholders and music services alike, it is imperative that it be controlled.
The fact that rightholders may freely select the manager of their choice throughout the entire European Union, and this irrespective of their country of origin, is liable to have various consequences.
In particular, it will help ensure that rights are concentrated in the hands of the largest collective management societies.
It is also liable to have unfavourable consequences for the most modest rightholders, insofar as rights managers will seek to attract the most profitable rightholders, and even to compromise fair treatment for all rightholders and thus to undermine cultural diversity.
Therefore, although the recommendation is supposed to be aimed at promoting fair competition, it is actually in danger of creating the opposite effect.
I voted in favour of adoption of the report by Mrs LÃ©vai on the Commission Recommendation of 18 October 2005 on collective cross-border management of copyright and related rights for legitimate online music services (Recommendation 2005/737/EC).
It should be remembered that a great deal of work was involved in preparing the aforementioned report.
The rapporteur took due account of the serious nature of the problem of copyright, the dangers posed by market monopoly and the issue of protecting consumers' rights.
In line with the spirit of the report, I hope that the European market in online music services will be able to enjoy freedom of development, without detriment to cultural diversity.
I wish to say that I support the request for the Commission to undertake an in depth study of the impact of multi-territorial and multi-range licences on online music services, and for the results of the study to be submitted to the European Parliament.
This House is now right to conclude that the Commission, with its recommendation of 18 October 2005 on 'collective cross-border management of copyright and related rights for legitimate online music services' has gone too far.
Neither the music industry, Parliament, nor the Council have been consulted, and the 'soft legislative approach' proposed by the Commission has already influenced market decisions, which makes it more than a recommendation.
At the moment, companies that want to offer online music services in Europe must organise the rights with copyright organisations and record companies in each country individually.
The Commission is right to say that this can be simplified.
The recommendation, however, opens up the possibility for a completely free market, which could put cultural diversity and local repertoire at risk, as attracting the most profitable right-holders is, indeed, a more viable proposition for collective copyright managers.
Moreover, the Commission rates commercial interests higher than cultural diversity.
This House argues in favour of controlled competition by prescribing a number of clear conditions, such as the equal treatment of authors, a fair and transparent competition structure which prevents the income of authors from going down and a fair representation of all interested parties in the management structures.
This report values unity in diversity, and so it can count on my support.
I voted in favour of adoption of the report by Mrs LÃ©vai on collective cross-border management of copyright and related rights for legitimate online music services.
Mrs LÃ©vai presented a very good report to the House.
Technical progress and the development of our civilisation have resulted in the emergence of a new generation of cross-border commercial copyright users.
These are the suppliers of Internet music services.
It shows how the market in copyright and related rights is evolving and developing, which further confirms the need for the initiatives taken in this area.
As we conduct the debate we are engaged in we should also bear in mind the possibility of responding to future needs resulting from the nature of collective cross-border management of copyright and related rights.
For that reason also, it is essential to conduct an in depth study of the impact of multi-territorial and multi-range licences for online music services and of the effects on the socio-economic situation of the rightholders and on cultural diversity.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
Corrections to votes and voting intentions
Mr President, I rise on my own behalf and on behalf of at least a hundred other colleagues who missed the two roll-call votes on the two Parish reports.
We were here, but, by the time we had got our cards out, we could no longer record our votes.
I would like my vote recorded as 'in favour' for both the roll-call votes on the Parish reports.
I would ask you to take into consideration that literally over a hundred colleagues missed those two votes, as they were scheduled first today and there were no further roll-call votes.
This is not usually the way colleagues are treated.
It is not your fault, Mr President: the agenda was not yours to determine, but I would ask that this be taken into account.
(DE) Mr President, I should like to endorse what Mrs Doyle has said.
I, too, was present the whole time, but did not have my card with me, and so I wish it to be noted that I, too, in the roll-call vote, voted in favour.
(FR) Mr President, I was present for the vote on the Parish reports.
I voted in favour of both reports, but unfortunately I forgot to insert my card in the little box, so my vote was not registered; I should like that to go on record.
You are not all going to do the same thing one after another.
You will make your position known to the services.
(PL) Mr President, my name is Marcin Libicki, and I should like to say on my own behalf and on behalf of Mr KamiÅski that we both voted in favour and the card did not work either.
Mr President, as chairman of the Quaestors, I can say that a lot of Members have already contacted me on this.
We never schedule roll-call votes during the first two items in voting time because we know Members are making their way to their seats and have to find their cards.
I met one Vice-President running down to get his card as he had left it behind.
I think Parliament's services really need to look at this, and I think we need to deem that, today, Members were in their places because this will be a disaster for us.
I can see us getting a hundred requests at the Quaestors from people telling us they were here and they did vote.
So, will you please pass this on to the Conference of Presidents or whoever is responsible?
The Quaestors do not have time to deal with this every time people cannot turn up and we have only two roll-call votes.
The point will perhaps be raised at the Bureau or with the Quaestors.
The fact remains that roll-call votes are shown on the voting lists to which everyone should have access and should consult before coming here.
(PL) I simply wanted to endorse what previous speakers have said concerning the voting procedure and scheduling such important votes that are counted electronically first.
I wish to endorse what those who took the floor earlier have stated.
It was your own group, Mr Buzek, that requested it.
(PL) Mr President, with regard to the report by Mrs Sartori, I wanted to point out that, when the verification vote on paragraph 20 was taken, my machine failed to work and I was unable to vote against the proposed text.
As I have the floor, I should like to take advantage of this opportunity to endorse what previous speakers have said and also to state that, although a formal vote was not taken, I voted in favour of the two reports by Mr Parish.
The machine did not work then either, even though it was the start of the vote.
(The sitting was suspended at 12.30 p.m. and resumed at 3.05 p.m.)
Approval of Minutes of previous sitting
Yesterday's Minutes have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
Mr President, Item 13 of the Minutes refers to a Member changing political group to join the ITS Group.
It makes no reference to Mr Wise leaving the IND/DEM Group and I wondered whether this was a mistake.
I understand his party, the UK Independence Party, has suspended him pending the investigations into alleged fraud in his case.
Does this not mean that his group has also suspended him, or was the press campaign deliberately misleading?
I think your point is made, Mr Corbett.
We will look into it.
(The Minutes of the previous sitting were approved)
Non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament (debate)
The next item is Council and Commission statements on non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament.
Mr President, Commissioner, honourable Members, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and of the means of delivering them has the potential to present what is perhaps the greatest risk to international security, and that is why the European Union, in its comprehensive strategy for combating them, which dates back to 2003, stressed that, in this area, the best way of maintaining security and international order was a multilateral approach combining disarmament and non-proliferation on an equal footing.
So, then, the Treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons is, and remains, the fundamental cornerstone of the global nuclear non-proliferation regime.
The European Union endorses the provisions of the NPT and advocates and endorses measures aimed at further reinforcing them.
Thinking forward to the first meeting of the committee preparing the conference on the review of this treaty in 2010, the European Union has already started to do extensive preparatory work at home.
We are firmly determined to continue, in 2007, to play an active and constructive role in the debates at the preparatory conference, and since our intention is that the European Union should begin the review cycle in a constructive atmosphere, it is strongly endorsing the plans put forward by the Japanese ambassador Amano, who has been appointed as the chairman of the first preparatory committee.
The European Union takes the view that all three pillars of the Non-Proliferation Treaty - those being nuclear non-proliferation, disarmament, and the peaceful use of nuclear energy - must be considered and held in balance in the review debate.
It is that sort of even-handedness alone that will make it possible for the forthcoming review cycle of the Non-Proliferation Treaty to progress successfully, and it is on that, though, that the joint decisions to be taken by the review conference on the reinforcement of the treaty depend.
The Common Position of the European Union, as adopted on the occasion of the 2005 review conference, remains, unchanged, the basis of these even-handed positions by the EU.
The European Union has always attached great importance to the prompt entry into force of the Test Ban Treaty, and this has acquired even greater relevance since the North Koreans tested an atom bomb.
The European Union is already helping to shore up the atom test ban regime by adopting common actions intended, among other things, to further reinforce the treaty's verification system.
The European Union is also calling for a prompt start to negotiations on a treaty outlawing the production of fissile material for explosive purposes, and for such negotiations to be conducted without preconditions.
Conclusion of such a treaty would constitute a considerable step on the road to the control of nuclear weapons and to nuclear disarmament, and would thereby make a decisive contribution to the implementation of the positions agreed on and adopted by the Community at the review conferences in 1995 and 2000.
The consolidation and reinforcement of the provisions of the Non-Proliferation Treaty are still largely conditional upon the dedicated and complete discharge of all obligations arising from it, and particular attention needs to be paid to the regional dimension in this regard.
You will be aware that the EU is actively involved in the efforts to resolve the crisis occasioned by the Iranian nuclear programme.
We are persuaded that a solution can be reached only by diplomatic means, and so the European Union had a pivotal role in shaping the very generous offer made to Iran in June 2006, and I would emphasise that this was supported by the United States, Russia and China.
The European Union will also continue to work towards a peaceful resolution to the crisis.
The European Union is well aware of the risks attendant on any further spread of enrichment and reprocessing technology, and therefore supports efforts towards multilateral guarantees on the supply of nuclear fuel.
Initiatives to this end can also help to persuade countries with an interest in the development of nuclear power that the development of their own nuclear fuel cycle is not necessary, with the effect that they will then freely and voluntarily refrain from acquiring one.
The European Union will be stepping up its efforts at maintaining and further reinforcing the provisions of the Non-Proliferation Treaty in order to be able to meet the challenges I have described, and these include the debate largely initiated by the EU on the strengthening of the Treaty's provisions relating to the consequences of a withdrawal from it.
It is to be regretted that the 2005 treaty review conference was unable to agree on a substantial final document that would have constituted a response to the most pressing challenges to the Treaty.
This experience must be another reason for the European Union to make every effort to make the 2010 review process a successful one.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, honourable Members, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and among them nuclear weapons, is potentially the greatest threat to European security.
Nuclear weapons proliferation is headline news, not least when it concerns Iran and North Korea.
On Iran, we are still at a delicate stage.
We noted with concern Dr ElBaradei's recent report that Iran has not yet suspended its enrichment-related activities and does not appear to have taken the necessary steps to ensure compliance with UN Security Council Resolution 1737.
The European Union's External Relations Council has just formally adopted a common position calling for the necessary firmness to be shown by the international community.
We are serious about the double-track policy which, as Mr Gloser has just outlined, has been cemented also by the recent 'three and three' talks in London.
This means that we may aim at maintaining dialogue and enhancing our contacts with civil society, as well as also exerting pressure.
Discussions in New York are now focusing on moving beyond the existing sanctions towards a new Security Council resolution.
On North Korea, we welcome the results of the Six Party Talks held in Beijing on 13 February 2007.
The EU is consulting with the Six, offering the best means by which we can assist in this process, while remaining committed to the implementation of Security Council Resolution 1718.
We support very strongly the current mission of Dr ElBaradei to North Korea aiming at the return of the IAEA inspectors as part of this accord and I share his assessment that this is a crucial confidence-building process.
I hope that the shutdown of the Yongbyon plant goes ahead by mid-April.
The 1970 Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) established the non-proliferation regime as we know it - with its fundamental balance between nuclear disarmament, non-proliferation and the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
From it then followed several aspects which are of great importance to the European Union, namely the principle of regulated nuclear trade, nuclear safeguards and the International Atomic Energy Agency, which monitors compliance.
Strengthening the effectiveness of the NPT will make the world safer.
States parties should be encouraged to work towards this aim with a view to the upcoming review conference.
While the headlines have focused on the regime's difficulties, we should not underestimate its successes.
South Africa, Argentina, Brazil, South Korea and Libya, for example, have all decided to forego nuclear weapons programmes.
My recent visit to India also gave me an opportunity to stress to the Indian leadership our hope that India will come much closer to the NPT regime and join the comprehensive test ban treaty.
We are looking forward to civil nuclear cooperation with India, once the necessary preconditions are met.
These developments should also increase Pakistan's willingness to cooperate with the international community in the non-proliferation context.
Nuclear non-proliferation is an area in which the Commission makes an important contribution.
Since 1957, the Euratom Treaty has provided the Commission with wide-ranging responsibilities.
The Commission's safeguard activities are closely coordinated with the IAEA, freeing up its resources to be deployed to more troublesome regions of the world.
We are also playing our part in ensuring that the EU's nuclear export controls are as robust as possible, supporting the Dual-Use Regulation 1334 from the year 2000.
We also assist third states in enhancing their export controls and combating illicit trafficking in nuclear and radiological materials.
The Commission is also a major provider of assistance for international non-proliferation efforts.
One important example is the G8 Global Partnership against Weapons of Mass Destruction, where one billion euros have been pledged for assistance in the former Soviet Union, 400 million of which have already been spent.
For more than 25 years the Commission's Joint Research Centre has been working closely with the IAEA, providing it with scientific and technological support.
As I said, in the future we will do more.
Under the new Instrument for Stability we will have resources to continue and strengthen work to enhance our security against nuclear proliferation threats.
In closing, let me take the opportunity to thank this Parliament once again for the support it has given the Commission in setting up a new generation of non-proliferation assistance programmes through a series of pilot projects.
(Applause)
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, from 1970, when it entered into force, until the end of the Cold War, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty made a decisive contribution to restricting the spread of nuclear weapons and to reducing their numbers.
This treaty historically has been of fundamental importance in preventing proliferation and promoting nuclear disarmament and it is for this reason that it was extended unconditionally for an unlimited period in 1995.
As the President-in-Office of the Council stated, the treaty is based on three principles: disarmament, non-proliferation and the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
If we start again from these three principles, adjusted for today's international situation, we can give new impetus to the treaty, remembering that the balance achieved through the application of the treaty by over 180 countries is today in danger.
Today the international community is faced with new threats to its security.
We must strenuously reaffirm the principle whereby the treaty is the single, indispensable, multilateral instrument for maintaining and reinforcing peace, security and international stability, since it establishes the legal framework to prevent a growing proliferation of nuclear weapons.
The European security strategy and the European strategy on weapons of mass destruction emphasise the importance of nuclear non-proliferation, disarmament and the treaty itself, which all the Member States have signed.
Having summarised the situation, I believe it is vital for the European Parliament to be clear about the position for the future.
The European Union must remain committed to the implementation of the treaty, and must present a united front at Vienna, where preparations will be made for the 2010 review conference.
For this reason, it will be fundamental for the European Parliament to vote unanimously, sending out a strong signal to the Council and the Commission, so that at Vienna they can have the necessary authority to play an active role in strengthening the current non-proliferation system.
In order to achieve the objectives set out in the treaty, the European Union must contribute to a structured and balanced review, at the review conference, of the way the treaty operates.
This must include the implementation of the undertakings made by the signatory States and the identification of sectors and methods through which to achieve future progress, as well as further development of the inspection system to guarantee that nuclear energy is used for exclusively peaceful ends by States not possessing nuclear weapons and recognised as such.
We must reaffirm the principle whereby all possible cooperation in terms of the development of nuclear energy for peaceful ends must take place on the basis of the treaty, and it is in this sphere that the European Union can make a decisive contribution, since it is at the forefront of research and production.
The international situation demands that we display a commitment to non-proliferation, to disarmament and to the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
Finally, I hope that Europe can also have a united strategy for combating terrorist organisations that might gain access to weapons of this kind.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, one of the undisputed triumphs of the European Union is the added security that this continent enjoys as a consequence of integration.
The work of reconciliation that brought Europe into the world has also made us a zone in which peace prevails and in which military action between the partner states of the European Union has become virtually unthinkable.
That is the foundation that must underpin the philosophy of a security policy for the European Union, which is that we must take this concept of peace, which we have made a reality at home, and export it to the world as well.
We in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament base this thinking on a concept of security that relies on dialogue, diplomacy, disarmament, prevention, and on sustainable and fair development.
All these elements belong together, and are held together by sustainable conflict resolution, which itself is feasible only within the framework of an overall conception.
While the European Union and NATO have their parts to play in this, so, too, do others - Russia, for example - and that is why we, when we talk about disarmament initiatives - about which I shall have more to say in a moment - have to ask ourselves whether Russia is our partner or our adversary.
In view of what I have just said, I would recommend approaching it as a partner, engaging in dialogue with it rather than marginalising it.
Disarmament is one of the central issues when peoples seek to coexist, and the trustworthiness of parties to treaties is crucial.
If, as we review the nuclear weapons non-proliferation treaty today, we take a really close look, we will have to see that the record is a downright shameful one, for, since it was signed, no fewer nuclear weapons have been dispersed around the world, but rather significantly more of them, and that cannot be attributable to the signatory states, or some of their number, taking this treaty seriously, for the very opposite is the case.


There were many who, having signed this treaty, promptly proceeded to disregard it and instead, contrary to what had been agreed, exported nuclear weapons, or the technology needed to produce them, around the world.
This is where there is a need for a complete turnaround.
Fundamental to any review of the Treaty is the intention to be faithful to it; that is why a primary condition for the renewal of the Treaty is that those who sign it abide by it, and the United States of America have not been alone in failing to do that.
A world free of nuclear weapons may well sound like something out of a daydream, for we do not live in one - the very opposite is the case.
We are having a debate on the spread of the peaceful use of nuclear energy, and on that I think congratulations are in order.
We have just heard from your own lips about the efforts required to prevent the civil use of nuclear energy becoming military, and Iran is a case in point here.
More nuclear power stations are being built all around the world, and then we are surprised to find ourselves lumbered with not just one Iran, but many.
One aspect of any review of military nuclear policy must be asking critical questions about civil use.
The German Council Presidency has the opportunity to put this issue on the agenda of the Council and also of the G8, and critical questions also need to be asked about the anti-missile system that is now, at the American administration's behest, to be installed in the Czech Republic and in Poland in line with the Bush administration's philosophy, the inconsistency of which can hardly be surpassed, the delusory nature of which is demonstrated by many examples, and which is set to cost USD 58 billion.
I have a recommendation to make.
It is that, rather than having us Europeans allow ourselves - yet again - to be divided - for we can say goodbye to any single foreign and security policy if we in the EU cannot agree on something like this, these 58 billion dollars would, rather than being spent on the installation of anti-missile systems, be better invested in sustainable development, which would make more of a contribution to peace than the setting up of a dodgy missile system.
Mr President, the reason why I venture to say that with reference to the non-proliferation treaty and the review thereof, is that these things are interconnected, and I hope that Mrs Merkel, having announced that this issue will be put on the agendas of both the G8 and the EU, will see to it that it is.
(Applause)
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) Mr President, Mr Gloser, ladies and gentlemen, non-proliferation, and above all, nuclear non-proliferation, is indeed the cornerstone of any policy geared towards peace.
Having had a little browse in older documents related to this subject, I came across the 13 practical steps that were agreed upon during the Non-proliferation Treaty review conference in 2000, which is less than seven years ago.
When I read those steps, I, too, cannot fail to conclude that we really have not made any progress at all, and that if anything, we have done the exact opposite.
It is obvious that the brutal attacks of 11 September 2001 and everything that followed have, in fact, brought the serious efforts in the area of disarmament in general and nuclear disarmament in particular to a standstill.
This is something I deeply regret.
I am also - and I am also speaking personally when I say this - very worried about the lack, to date, of any group position on the initiatives with regard to the Member States Poland and the Czech Republic.
I too wonder whether this might not be the start of a fresh arms race, which is surely the last thing we need.
I was pleased to take note of the presidency's assurance that a great deal of hard work will go into a common position of all Member States with a view to the conference this coming April.
I hope, Mr President, that you - or rather the Presidency - will indeed succeed in this, because the poor result in 2005 was attributable to a lack of true unanimity among the EU Member States.
I hope that history will not repeat itself.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (LV) Mr President, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, representatives of the Council, representatives of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I think that everyone is agreed that nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament is a special component of the European Union's common foreign and security policy.
My colleagues just now expressed the opinion in this Chamber that the results of implementing this policy can almost be seen as a step backwards.
When we look at the Council and Commission documents, however, it must be said that they are more optimistic, and in my view, if we assess what has actually been achieved then the progress made by the European Union must be acknowledged.
The European Union's institutions permanently collaborate to coordinate their work.
Of course, the High Representative for the CFSP works actively on nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament issues, we at the European Parliament regularly consider these issues, there are discussions between the institutions and exchanges of information with the European Union Situation Centre and the counter-terrorism coordinator.
This means that work is actually being done, but the cases of North Korea and Iran, the unsuccessful conference in 2005 to review the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty and differences between the United States of America, China and Russia show that much still remains to be done.
I would therefore like to express my appreciation for the advance preparations for the 2010 conference on the review of the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty, and I would also ask the Council to take into consideration the European Parliament's wish to play an active part in this work, as well as the initiative expressed in Parliament's resolution, and in the very near future to include MEPs in this conference to work as members of the European Union delegation.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I wish to thank Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner and Mr Gloser for what they have said, but first let me thank all the Members from the other groups for welcoming the Greens' initiative for this debate, and particularly for making it possible for us, during this part-session, to adopt a compromise motion with which we can all identify, something that I, particularly in view of the current situation, see as a good and important signal.
The Commissioner has already sketched out the various problem areas.
Let me, then, take a brief look back to twenty years ago, to 8 December 1987, when a shock went around the world, for, before the Cold War's nuclear threat had passed, the INF Treaty was signed, constituting real agreement on nuclear disarmament.
Where are we now?
It has to be said, with regret, that we have in some respects gone backwards, for both Kofi Annan and Henry Kissinger have said that the campaign against the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the efforts at nuclear disarmament are on the point of complete and final failure.
What can we in Europe do in this situation?
Do we have enough confidence to raise - multilaterally and in international fora - issues on which we can hope to see progress made?
Would it not be timely to use the forthcoming meeting of the Nuclear Supplies Group in Cape Town from 16 to 20 April as an opportunity to speak out against the planned deal between India and the USA?
If we do not do that, what kind of signal is being sent to the other states?
Are we not then saying to them, 'Build nuclear programmes and nuclear weapons, even outside the NPT, and the USA will even reward and support you'?
What kind of signal does that send to Iran?
I say that quite deliberately, and as one who takes a decidedly different view of these things.
Where Iran is concerned, we are stuck in a cul-de-sac, and we have helped ourselves get into it.
Everyone in it needs to put themselves into reverse gear in order to get back out again, or else the troops will end up being sent in.
We want to help keep this Treaty alive.
On Thursday, we will be adopting a resolution to the effect that a delegation will be sent to Vienna to actively monitor this process, and I hope that we will, there, together, enable these important NPT provisions to give signs of continued life.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, the nuclear weapons non-proliferation treaty faces dangers on many fronts, or so it appears from the latest reports.
According to the 3 March edition of the SÃŒddeutsche Zeitung, the Americans are planning new nuclear warheads, and that is something on which we take a critical line.
In the UK - an EU Member State - Mr Blair, the Prime Minister, wants to spend EUR 30 billion on modernising the British armed forces' nuclear weaponry.
The British House of Commons is due to vote on it tomorrow.
That is nuclear rearmament and puts the non-proliferation treaty at risk; a critical statement from the German Presidency of the Council is called for.
We endorse the protests against the nuclear programme whereby the USA plans a missile defence system in the Czech Republic, Poland and in the Caucasus, with NATO - according to Mr de Hoop Scheffer as reported yesterday - wanting to take part with one of its own.
The German Minister for the Armed Forces, Mr Jung, wants to put the whole system under NATO control.
It is about time the Council and the Commission got round to expressing forthright criticism of these anti-missile schemes, and, together with two colleagues, I have tabled a declaration expressing opposition to this system.
At the same time, according to the former NATO commander-in-chief Wesley Clark, preparations are in hand for a war against Iran.
It is hypocrisy to criticise Iran if we ourselves possess nuclear weapons and are engaged in updating them.
The nuclear weapons non-proliferation treaty requires that all nuclear weapons be disposed of.
The fact is that there are no good nuclear weapons, and what is needed, and right now, is disarmament.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Mr President, the nuclear aspirations of Pyongyang and Teheran constitute a direct threat to the Non-Proliferation Treaty, the NPT, with their respective neighbouring countries in North-East Asia and the Middle East, perhaps feeling obliged to join the nuclear powers.
In addition, in the event of the NPT being eroded, a negative effect is to be expected, similar to that in respect of the biological and chemical weapons.
In short, the entire multilateral arms control structure is at risk of collapsing - truly, a spectre menacing the whole world.
Meanwhile, the question arises as to what sort of authority the UN Security Council is left with, when UN members stock up on nuclear weapons against its express will.
Do the Council and Commission share my view that the crisis of the NPT is also a crisis situation for the highest international authority?
Given this extremely serious situation, I expect them to make a maximum effort to convince the UN Security Council to persuade Pyongyang and Teheran away from their ominous nuclear course, as time is pressing.
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the nuclear weapons non-proliferation treaty was a great achievement, but we see nuclear weapons continuing to proliferate.
We also, alas, cannot fail to see that the review conference has, for the moment, proved abortive, and that is why this preparatory conference in Vienna is so important.
It is also of the very utmost importance that this House should be able to contribute its opinion to it, but the effectiveness of this is conditional upon the resolution being a joint effort, and one reflecting all our views.
I hope that we will achieve that sort of result when we come to the vote.
After the Soviet Union collapsed, we all believed that the days of mutually assured destruction were behind us, but, today, the risk is that, while that may have been banished from the global stage, it may be about to resume regionally.
We must, together, do everything in our power to prevent this from happening.

I would like to say something about one of the proposals, of which there are many, namely the international system for uranium enrichment, something that has now acquired extraordinary importance, but I also want to say something about another matter that is not directly connected with this debate, although it does have to be the subject of public discussion, and that is the issue of the anti-missile system.
Here in Europe, we are currently discussing an American anti-missile defence system and its effects on us, but what must be of real interest to us is the security of Europe.
The Iranian rockets against which the Americans are protecting themselves, are much closer to Europe than they are to America.
We are told, for example, that these Iranian rockets are already capable of reaching Southern Italy and Greece, and that is why we have to have a general debate on the question of whether this sort of system is needed, for if it is, it is we, Europeans, who need it just as much.
That is something else that we in this House must discuss and on which we have to reach decisions.
(NL) Mr President, the Non-Proliferation Treaty is, in fact, the most important pillar underlying the international consensus that the spread of nuclear arms must be stopped, with the ultimate goal, of course, as my group Chairman underlined a moment ago, of bringing about general nuclear disarmament.
Since the spread of weapons of mass destruction forms an increasing threat to international peace and security, we must reassess the treaty, breathe new life into it and strengthen it.
Needless to say, the developments in Iran are causing us great concern.
Despite repeated warnings from the international community, Iran continues its efforts in the area of uranium enrichment.
At the same time, we know that there is a real risk that terrorist groups have access to nuclear weapons or similar.
In order to stop the spread of weapons of mass destruction, an effective multilateral stance is indispensable. What is more, the Non-Proliferation Treaty stands or falls by it.
By acting independently and unilaterally, though, all common efforts in this area are set to be undermined.
This is why the recognised nuclear powers must make a visible investment.
They are, in fact, also responsible for the credibility of the Non-Proliferation Treaty as it currently stands.
Precisely in this light, we are placing question marks by the recent attempt by the US to get Poland and the Czech Republic to agree to the stationing elements of an anti-rocket shield on their territories.
According to the Americans, the rocket defence system offers protection against possible attacks from North Korea and Iran.
This does, in fact, go against the intention to prevent these countries from developing a nuclear arms arsenal.
With their proposal, the Americans are also ignoring the concerns of Russia, which, rightly or wrongly, regards the rocket shield as a provocation, or even as a threat to its domestic security.
A protective shield that subsequently leads to mistrust between the three key partners - the US, Russia and the EU - that wish to stop proliferation, is not exactly the multilateral action we had in mind.
Moreover, we wonder how such bilateral cooperation fits into the European security strategy and the NATO partnership.
For this reason, we have major objections to this course of affairs, and we therefore call on the United States and the EU Member States involved to reconsider the plans and to seek multilateral alternatives compatible with the security arrangements mutually agreed by us in the European Union.
(HU) Let us not embellish things, the NPT supervisory conference 2005 was a failure.
Unfortunately the whole story of the NPT is singularly lacking in success stories.
North Korea has withdrawn from the system, and has launched its own military nuclear programme.
Iran, too, has turned against the system, and we do not know how far along things are, but its intentions are in any case not favourable.
India, Pakistan and Israel show no inclination to join.
Nevertheless, there are some positive developments as well: on 16 February, the Six-Party Talks at Beijing gave rise to an agreement.
We will soon find out what the value of such an agreement is.
Mr El Baradei will visit North Korea tomorrow, and his visit will no doubt ascertain whether the intentions of the North Koreans are sincere.
The current action is very significant.
Respect for the whole NPT is at stake.
We need to combine flexibility with consistency.
We must be flexible in methods and timing, but we cannot be flexible as regards goals.
The goals must be clear and unambiguous.
North Korea must return to the NPT system and immediately put a stop to the military nuclear programme.
The way we handle the problems of North Korea will have a direct influence on Iran as well.
If we are successful in North Korea, then we will also succeed in relation to Iran.
If we should fail to achieve success here, then it is to be feared that we will not be able to keep even Iran on the right path.
Preparations for the review conference will be real and successful if we can thereby face these two great challenges, namely North Korea and Iran, and successfully solve these two problems.
There is now a slight chance of this, but only if we are consistent and consistently represent our principles.
Commissioner, you said that proliferation is potentially the greatest threat to our security, and I agree with you.
How ironic is it, then, that tomorrow the UK Government is likely to take a decision to replace the Trident nuclear submarine system that will precisely accelerate that proliferation and thus undermine our collective security?
When it does so, it will be demonstrating the most breathtaking hypocrisy: maintaining and further developing the UK's own nuclear weapons, whilst waging illegal wars to try to stop others from obtaining them.
What moral authority can the UK Government possibly think it has to lecture countries like Iran about not developing nuclear weapons, when we ourselves continue to do exactly that?
The NPT is made up of two pledges: non-nuclear states agree not to acquire nuclear weapons, provided that nuclear states begin a serious process of getting rid of theirs.
If we do not keep our side of that bargain, if we do not abide by international law, we can hardly be surprised if others do not keep their side of the bargain either.
The UK Government's upgrading of Trident fundamentally undermines the EU's collective position on non-proliferation and, therefore, both the UK and, indeed, France, should be strongly condemned by both the Council and the Commission.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the nuclear crises in North Korea and Iran have once again spread fear throughout the world and triggered suspicion between nations and peoples.
The international debate on nuclear rearmament has again called the future of mankind into question.
We must restart negotiations with Iran and shun any military action, as this would only serve to exacerbate the current crisis.
It is therefore vital to relaunch debate regarding the renewal of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 2010.
The European Union must apply suitable political, economic and commercial pressure on countries such as India, Pakistan, Iran, North Korea and other countries such as China and the United States.
In addition, the European Union must, as a matter of the utmost urgency, promote a Mediterranean free of nuclear weapons.
By means of suitable economic and social policies we must transform the Mediterranean into a sea of peace - an area that is completely non-nuclear.
This is why we must apply the pressure we have mentioned to Israel too, which certainly has the right to look after its own security but which must not be founded upon nuclear fear and the annihilation of other peoples.
In addition, the recent decision by President Bush to install missile launchers in the Czech Republic or new military nuclear surveillance installations in Poland only worsens military relations with Russia.
This decision by President Bush is one that I must condemn immediately.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are all agreed that a renewed commitment is needed against the proliferation of thermonuclear weapons, as Mr Schulz said in his speech, but at the same time we need to start saying more clearly that it is not enough to prevent proliferation, but we must start fighting once again for universal disarmament.
In truth, there will never be a true planetary democracy if some countries can dominate the world because they have the power to destroy it several times over.
In fact, the countries in the nuclear club, and in particular, today, the United Kingdom and France, will have the authority and the moral right to prevent proliferation by other countries if they themselves begin to disarm and if they place on the agenda a ban on all weapons of mass destruction.
Unfortunately, this is not the course which is being pursued, if we look at the unilateral policy adopted by the United States of America - a policy which also runs counter to NATO.
The United States has secretly negotiated with some European countries to host US anti-missile programmes, and we have tabled a specific amendment against this.
We must, therefore, block these plans, saying 'No' to proliferation but 'Yes' to a European initiative designed to achieve universal disarmament.
Mr President, as we look ahead to the nuclear non-proliferation Treaty review conference in 2010 there is no doubt that the Treaty is already under considerable stress, particularly with the debates about Iran and North Korea, so there could be no worse time for a country to send out the message that nuclear weapons are essential for any country's security, however useless they are against the real threats that we face, like climate change and terrorism.
But that is exactly what the British Government is proposing to do and, as we have already heard, tomorrow in Westminster MPs will be voting on whether to renew the Trident nuclear weapons system and take the UK and the rest of the world into a new nuclear age and a new nuclear arms race.
Under the NPT we should be discussing a timetable for disarmament of these illegal and immoral weapons, not their renewal.
I would urge all the groups in this Parliament to support the resolution and the amendments to encourage UK MPs tomorrow to oppose Trident replacement and to honour the commitment made over 35 years ago when the NPT was signed.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the nuclear threat is for real, and, unfortunately, also getting more acute, as you, Mr President-in-Office, pointed out by reference to the two hot spots in Iran and North Korea.
There is no doubt about the need for us to get started, right now, on preparing the review conference in good time, in order, there, to set out our priorities as we need to do, but it is even more important by far that we should be trying, right now, to take measures to reinforce the credibility of the international community and of the European Union where the implementation and enforcement of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty are concerned, for the quality of that treaty will be measured in terms of the successes it actually achieves.
At present, I see the chances of such strategies being implemented as very good, particularly in view of what I see of the situation in North Korea and the contacts we have with both the South and the North of that land in my capacity as Chairman of the Parliament's delegation for relations with the Korean peninsula.
This European Union of ours, and our Parliament in particular, have helped bring about the resumption of the six-party talks, in which we are a welcome partner, albeit not as part of the six-party talks, but warmly welcomed as a facilitator and as an outside source of support, and we have played our part in getting the talks restarted on 13 February.
I am cautiously optimistic.
What is at stake is that disarmament be put into effect; we have been assured that it will be, and now is the time for North Korea to take action, but, contrariwise, it is also necessary that we, as a Union, should play our part in taking action that will help bring about political change in North Korea, by, for example, supporting the food security, regional security and human security programmes, with the ultimate goal of a Korean peninsula free of nuclear weapons, so that the present threat - not least to Europe - fades away.
(PT) The forthcoming conference in Vienna is an opportunity for the European Union to take the lead.
Europe's position should be based on two essential ideas: strengthening the International Atomic Energy Agency and pressing for compliance with Article 6 of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
In this respect, I agree that updating Trident is incompatible with Article 6 of the NTP and, since it affects the United Kingdom, it also affects the European Union.
The European Union must support the multilateral approach to uranium enrichment and ensure that all countries sign the additional protocol to the safeguard agreement.
That may prevent further challenges like those posed by Iran.
In addition, the EU must do all it can to ensure that the 13 steps to disarmament identified at PrepCom 2000 are implemented as quickly as possible.
Unless Europe takes it upon itself to uphold the essential balance on which the NTP is based, PrepCom 2007 may mark the beginning of the end for the Treaty.
Mr President, in this respect the fact that Poland, the Czech Republic and the United Kingdom are unilaterally considering taking part in the US missile defence system is a scandalous threat to European commitments.
What is the point of having a European Union or even NATO if it is not to discuss the strategic future of Europe?
(CS) Commissioner, Mr President, at the end of the 20th century there were two schools of thought regarding security matters.
According to one, the biggest threat to the world was the unfavourable impact of high oil production on the stability of the Middle East, and the second referred to environmental factors and climate change.
11 September and Hurricane Katrina demonstrated that the source of the danger is identical: energy greed and excessive energy consumption.
Ensuring that 20% of the energy we use is from renewable sources will not bring a complete solution; the only solution whereby we could see off both threats, cut emissions and reduce dependence on the unstable Middle East is nuclear energy.
Let us confront the Greens with their now outdated arguments about the dangers of nuclear energy.
We must not let them use the situation in Iran and elsewhere to hold us to ransom on the grounds of the possible misuse of nuclear energy.
We have one instrument at our disposal to counteract this: the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).
One positive result of the 2010 conference will be key security measures.
In our view, the core issues are as follows: uranium enrichment and reprocessing pursuant to Article 4, including debates on regional nuclear fuel distribution centres; and secondly the need to find solutions to unauthorised withdrawals from Article 10 of the Treaty.
We therefore call on the Council and the Commission to take the lead in negotiations at the preparatory committee in Vienna and make a substantial contribution towards a positive result in the 2010 conference.
We also ask you for a implementation report on the 43 measures arising from the Council's common position, which already applied to the unfortunate debate on the Treaty in 2005.
We also urge the Member States to comply strictly with the tough wording of relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions in relation to the NPT, and this includes banking operations and businesses in some southern European states.
Commissioner, one final word, if I may. We must begin to look for a way of inviting Israel to negotiate the revision of the NPT.
Please consult and work together with us.
(PL) Mr President, we have lived with the threat posed by proliferation of weapons of mass destruction for many years now.
We have become even more aware of it in recent times because of the danger that fissile material and chemical or biological weapons might fall into terrorist hands.
This fear has resulted in strategic documents drawn up both by the European Union and by other international organisations.
In particular, I would like to draw attention to the Comprehensive Political Guidance adopted by NATO at the end of last year.
The nuclear aspirations of certain countries, notably North Korea and Iran, have also given rise to concern as was mentioned earlier.
We are pleased to note that some progress has been made in the multilateral negotiations with North Korea and regret the lack of progress in the negotiations with Iran.
It appears that four conditions must be met if the very serious threat posed by proliferation is to be overcome.
Firstly, the current non-proliferation regime in the framework of the Non-Proliferation Treaty must be maintained and perhaps even strengthened in 2010 on the occasion of the review conference.
I endorse the call for the European Union Member States to speak with one voice at that conference.
Their determination and cohesive approach are required.
Secondly, it is important for the alliance between Europe and the United States to continue combating terrorism consistently.
Thirdly, it is important for the negotiations with North Korea to prove effective and to maintain the diplomatic approach to Iran.
Fourthly, contrary to the opinions of certain Members on the Left, it is important to create an anti-missile shield that will defend not only the United States but also its European allies from strategic missile attacks.
It is important for this shield to have an interoperative system protecting against short and medium-range missiles and for the system to be a joint one.
The TBMD project that NATO is to complete by 2010 is therefore of vital importance.
Mr President, Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, honourable Members, I want to say how very grateful I am for your support, for it does after all turn out that we agree on many things.
Taking our present situation as our starting point, we must address ourselves with greater energy to achieving, at this preparatory stage, a common position on the matters in which we, in 2005, perceived setbacks.
I would like to make it clear that while it is not a matter of doubt that the nuclear non-proliferation treaty has come under pressure from different sides, it does - if we take it seriously and have agreed on the 2005 Common Position - offer us a basis on which we can and must rely in the present preparatory conference.
I certainly want to underline what so many of you, including Mr Schulz, have said about the importance of putting an emphasis on the multilateral approach, for we do, indeed, all know from experience that unilateralism gets us nowhere, that we need the multilateral approach, and that the more we demand it, the more necessary it becomes that we, within the European Union, should take up a common position in order to make progress on this front.
The path that the European Union has sketched out in relation to Iran is the right one in both political and diplomatic terms, and the offer reiterated by the Council a few weeks ago is the right one even though some are becoming impatient - not that there are many alternatives available.
We have both - a resolution on security with the relevant sanctions, while, by the same token, the door to negotiations with Iran is still open.
Let me emphasise once more what I said at the outset about non-proliferation and disarmament.
This issue must, in the interests of the peaceful use of nuclear energy, remain on the agenda, even though views may differ to some degree as regards the ways in which the dangers can be minimised.
It is important that we should get support from your House for the forthcoming discussions, which are sure not to be straightforward.
As for the exchange of information between Council and Parliament, and collaboration between them, I am able, on behalf of the Presidency to offer, firstly, a briefing for the relevant committee following the first session of the preparatory conference, and, secondly, a progress report detailing, by reference to the 43 points contained in a previous resolution, which of them have been achieved and which not.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, this was a very useful debate in a difficult situation.
We will study your recommendations very carefully, because the preparatory conference in Vienna gives us an important opportunity to better prepare for the 2010 conference and thus, hopefully, make up for a very difficult conference in 2005.
We know that the seriousness and the importance of the situation as regards non-proliferation goes far beyond what is commonly known among our citizens.
We conclude also from recent Eurobarometer surveys that our people want positive action.
I agree with Mr ZappalÃ  and Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck when they say that the agreement on the importance of the link between weapons of mass destruction, proliferation and terrorism is necessary.
This has to be stressed in the European security strategy, and it is being stressed, but we now have to implement it in the right way.
It is also my conviction that the efforts of the European Parliament to promote coherence and more joint action are absolutely crucial.
Everyone has mentioned that speaking with one voice is also crucial.
Therefore, the Commission needs your valuable support to maximise its impact with regard to the common objective.
Certainly, we will contribute to the work that will be done in Vienna because this will enhance our credibility, as many have said.
I should also like to thank Mr Pirker and Parliament's delegation, particularly with regard to North Korea.
I agree that North Korea is important not only in itself but also as a possible window of opportunity for progress elsewhere.
However, we are still committed to never giving up as long as that is possible.
In our headlines, we see the non-proliferation issues mostly referred to with reference to individual countries.
However, let us not lose sight of the importance of the issue, as Mr Schulz has said, of the international system as a whole on the multilateral approach and effectiveness.
The most important four principles we should try to enhance again at the Preparatory Committee and then at the next review conference are as follows.
Firstly, the question of the non-parties: I think there are three states which have so far refused to adhere to the treaty.
Let us try to bring them in.
Secondly, on the withdrawals in January 2003, the DPRK announced that it intended to withdraw from the NPT - it was the first state to do so.
Several states believe that the DPRK is still legally bound by the treaty and has not followed the correct legal procedures to withdraw.
Let us try to tackle this question on non-compliant parties.
Some states which acceded to the NNWS have, nevertheless, sought to acquire nuclear weapons in the past and this, therefore, needs to be tackled.
Finally, there is the question of good faith.
It has been mentioned a lot around the table that most non-nuclear weapons states believe the nuclear weapons states have not done enough to make progress towards the goal of nuclear disarmament - Article 6.
I think this should be the main bone of our contention at the five-yearly review conferences.
We also see, therefore that a broad basis for a consensus is necessary, and all the big countries, like Russia and China, should be included in such a dialogue.
Pursuant to Rule 103(2) I have received six motions for resolutions.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12.30 p.m.
Written statement (Rule 142)
I believe this is an important debate.
The proliferation of nuclear weapons makes the world less, rather than more, safe.
Whether Israel or India, Pakistan or North Korea, we should pressure them to join the Non-Proliferation Treaty.
Yet we should recall that the NPT talks not only about stopping the spread of nuclear weapons, but about the world's nuclear powers reducing and removing their own capabilities.
The former gets more attention than the latter.
The Socialist amendment condemning the US anti-missile shield is all too appropriate.
As we have seen in NE Asia, with Japan's deployment of Theatre Missile Defence and Theatre High Altitude Defence, these are enabling offensive technologies for the Bush Administration's doctrine of pre-emptive deterrence.
With their deployment, the US will be able to launch an attack on countries with small numbers of nuclear weapons and defend against any orphan missile missed in the initial attack.
I will also be supporting Amendment 1 by the Greens.
I am not in favour of unilateral abolition of Britain's Trident fleet, but I am entirely unconvinced of the need, at this stage, to renew it.
Childcare (debate)
The next item is the Council and Commission statement on childcare.
Mr President, Commissioner, honourable Members, the guiding and overarching principle of our Presidency's programme in social policy is 'seizing demographic change as an opportunity and promoting equal opportunities for all at work and in society', for demographic change is a fact, and something of fundamental relevance to all the Member States of the EU.
We can, however, reverse this demographic trend by working towards the right conditions under which people can actually have the number of children that they want, but one essential condition for people to be able to earn a living is the compatibility of family and work.
The return to work after taking a break to have a family must be facilitated just as much as parallel working and childrearing for both parents, for it has been shown by a European comparative study that countries with a well-developed range of childcare options have overall a higher percentage of women going out to work, particularly where those women are the mothers of more than one child in need of care.
There is also a particularly low birth rate where relatively few women go out to work, while highly-qualified women delay starting a family for a long time or do without children altogether.
Whilst the average hours worked by men increases in line with the number of children they have, women who are also mothers reduce the number of hours they work, and that is why we, at Member State level, must endeavour to arrange things so that equality for women and men at work may improve and to get the conditions for them right.
It is because there is such a great need for action in this area that the German Presidency is the first since 2002 to make childcare one of its priorities, and one important step towards the improved provision of childcare places was taken as long ago as 2002, when the Heads of State and Government, at the Barcelona European Council, resolved that the Member States would have to achieve a minimum provision level by 2010, with childcare available for at least 90% of children between the age of three and the age at which they are required to begin school, and for at least one-third of all children under the age of three years.
This target was, in 2003, incorporated into the European Employment Strategy and reiterated in the Integrated Guidelines for Growth and Employment (2005-2008).
There are countries in which these quotas for provision have already been exceeded, in some cases by a considerable degree; for example, some seven Member States have achieved or exceeded the 33% quota set for childcare services for children under the age of three years, and it is already apparent not only that the other states are lagging behind, but also that the level of provision in some of them is blatantly low.
The same can be said for the proportion of Member States that exceed or fail to meet the Barcelona target of 90% for children between three and school entry age.
What that means is that many Member States have to make much more of an effort in order to achieve the targets set at Barcelona.
The 2006/2007 Joint Employment Report, which the Council adopted on 22 February - just a few weeks ago - enlarges on this point and is unambiguously critical of the slow progress where childcare is concerned.
The lack of progress being made in child care could well have adverse effects on the attempts to raise the average percentage of women in work in the EU to at least 60%, which is another shared goal under the European Employment Strategy.
This means that it is of the utmost importance that the European Council on 8/9 March confirmed the European Alliance for Families, which will inject renewed impetus into the achievement of the agreed goals for childcare and women in the workplace, and will also be the subject of discussion at the EPSCO Council on 30 May of this year.
The European Alliance for Families helps to improve family-friendly living conditions in the European Union, and will create a platform for the exchange of opinions and information between the Member States.
It is closely involved with the actual enforcement of equality, for improved balance of work and family life helps to improve equality of opportunity in the world of work.
It has also been demonstrated that, if we are consistent in going down the road of improving conditions for young parents, of developing childcare and early-years education, of developing - hand in hand with the business sector - systematically family-friendly work structures, then we will be having a positive effect on the 2020-2030 period, the very period that is set to be particularly problematic in economic and demographic terms.
The issue of work/family compatibility presents challenges, however, not only to the state, but also to businesses.
Children are our future; they are the workers, the consumers and the parents of tomorrow.
Consideration of family concerns must become part of entrepreneurial strategy and of business culture; flexible working hours and models of part-time working - for both mothers and fathers - must become standard everywhere, and in this respect it would be helpful if it were to dawn on businesses that consideration of family concerns pays off in business terms, for mothers and fathers cannot give themselves completely to their work unless they know that their children are being looked after properly during the day.
Family-friendly attitudes at work also benefit the state and the social security agencies, for the more mothers and fathers are enabled to go out and earn money, the more taxes and social security contributions get paid.
