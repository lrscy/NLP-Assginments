This inevitably leads to the conclusion, therefore, that in the debate on this report and on future Commission policies in the area of linguistic diversity, we are dealing with an issue which is not just highly topical, but which is at the very heart of the European project.
So congratulations on this good report.
Allow me to comment, however, on a single area of concern: as a Catalan speaker, I am aware of the existence in Europe of languages spoken by millions of people which are not thought of as being minority languages or regional languages and which - despite having official status within their autonomous region - are not state languages and are therefore not languages with official status in the European Union.
To deal with the problem of the institutionalisation, the status and the function of these European languages is perhaps the fundamental key to deciding whether the policy of a future European agency for linguistic diversity or the policy on the European institutions is really going to be faithful to the slogan of the future constitutional Union: united in diversity.
Mr President, I am speaking today on behalf of my colleague Mrs Echerer, who has worked hard to secure the acceptance and recognition of sign language.
Today we have heard many minorities speaking up for themselves.
It is unfortunate that we do not have today interpretation into sign language, as we did with the Lynn Report.
I am grateful to the rapporteur and also to the Committee for finding room for sign language in this report and in this programme, which opens the door to its being recognised.
Several Members have expressed the view in this debate that sign language should be promoted as a health resource.
I think this would profoundly violate the rights of the deaf minority.
Sign language is not a crutch or a wheelchair.
Not only is it a language used by 15 000 people, but we should also bear in mind that it is the only language in which these 15 000 people can carry on a conversation.
For recognising them as a linguistic minority and acknowledging that their language also contributes to the diversity and richness of European languages, I am grateful to all who have had a hand in this report.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
The next item is the report (A5-0251/2003) by Mr Perry, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on Television without Frontiers (2003/2033(INI)).
.
Mr President, I will start by saying that the Television without Frontiers Directive is one of the successes of the European Union and has undoubtedly helped European television.
However, we also have to recognise that the television industry in Europe at the present time is not without difficulties.
I am thinking of issues like restricted advertising revenues, and a significant number of companies are currently facing financial difficulties.
The industry today is greatly different from 1997, when the Directive was last revised, and barely recognisable from the TV industry of 1989, when the Directive was adopted.
In 1989 there were just 47 television channels in the whole of Europe.
Today that figure is 2000.
TV is an important industry, with turnover estimated at EUR 62 billion per annum.
The role of the EU must be to help encourage the industry and in no sense to restrict it.
TV is now facing important technological changes: there is more satellite TV, digital TV, convergence with the Internet and new advertising techniques, such as split-screen advertising.
The directive, however, is beginning to creak, and revision cannot be put off indefinitely.
Indeed, a thorough review is becoming urgent.
I appreciate the Commission's careful approach and congratulate the Commissioner on her careful and extensive consultation.
However, we need to take care: too long a delay in revising the directive will impede progress in the industry.
We should not move away from the fundamental principles of the present directive which relies largely on self-regulation and is not too prescriptive.
We should no more seek to control what people watch than we would seek to control what books they might wish to buy in a bookshop.
Therefore, I am clear that overzealous use of quotas and too detailed definitions would be wrong.
Above all, we should only seek to regulate and influence at a European level that which is of transeuropean concern.
However, there are European issues we need to address.
For instance, events of major importance need to remain free to air, and there is a case for a short European list of such events.
There was a real risk that last year's World Cup would not be freely available in all our countries.
I am as keen as any colleague to encourage European content in television, although primarily that could be helped by the 'MEDIA Plus' Programme.
I also urge the Commission to look at ways to ensure that channels like Euronews and Arte flourish and develop.
They help create a European television identity and help our citizens to appreciate and understand the European dimension in their lives.
Euronews in particular is a very effective means of allowing European and world citizens to get a European perspective on current affairs, rather than an exclusively national or American view.
I would also urge the Commission to find means to protect the diversity of ownership of television and to guard against undue concentration of ownership.
Plurality of media ownership is important for democracy.
In this report I touch on two particular issues which may be seen as minor but are important.
First, the needs of viewers with sensory impairments: these fellow citizens wish, and have the right, to enjoy television.
I hope the Commission will conduct the study called for as soon as possible to enable us to get best practice for subtitling, sign language and audio description in television broadcasts.
Finally, I want to raise the issue of those European citizens - often retirees but not only - who move to a place in the sun.
Spain, Greece, Portugal, Italy and France are indeed wonderful and hospitable countries, but for those people from the north of Europe it is nice to watch television programmes from their own country and even to watch their own country play in a football match.
Many people do this by skirting around the law by watching via satellite broadcasters from their own country.
They often ignore the terms of their contracts or even use pirate technology.
Perhaps that is not a big problem, but, as sensible legislators, we ought to be able to frame sensible laws that allow citizens to lead their lives within the law and not in a grey market.
Therefore, I thank the Commissioner for her commitment to Europe's television.
I urge her to heed this report and to come forward as soon as possible with practical proposals to revise the directive.
Mr President, the Commission congratulates Mr Perry on his work, evident not only in this report but also in the efforts made over the past months to contribute to a reform of the directive that is in the interests of our citizens.
On 6 January, the Commission adopted the fourth report on the application of the Directive and a work programme for its revision incorporating a public consultation.
What did we note in this report on the application of the Directive?
Firstly, we noted that the Directive is operating relatively well.
Nevertheless, recent technological developments call for more detailed reflection.
The aim of the public consultation was to enable the Commission to assess the need to update or adjust the Directive and the report and today's debate will help us in this respect.
As part of its work programme, the Commission organised two series of public hearings, in April and June, and interested parties were invited to participate in public debates by responding to specific questions and forwarding their responses to us.
We received 160 written contributions, which are all available on the Commission's website with the exception of a few whose authors asked for them to be kept confidential.
Based on the analysis of the results of this consultation, the Commission plans to submit to Parliament and the Council at the end of 2003 or beginning of 2004 a communication on the future of audiovisual policy, which will be accompanied by proposals if appropriate.
One of the challenges of the revision is to take account of technological innovations.
I am thinking in this respect of the Council's 1998 Recommendation on the Protection of Minors and Human Dignity and Audiovisual and Information Services, which is the first legal instrument to cover the content of audiovisual services on the Internet.
After the break, the Commission intends to publish a second report on the implementation of the Recommendation based on a questionnaire that was sent to the Member States.
The aim of this report is to ascertain the progress made, to make it possible to make a direct comparison and to include the new Member States.
Mr Perry raises several questions in his report, to which I would like to respond, without prejudice, of course, to the consultations under way.
The first relates to the scope of the Directive, referred to in paragraphs 7 to 12.
Mr Perry calls for the definition of audiovisual content to be extended to take account of media convergence.
However, as long as television broadcasting services continue to enjoy unequal importance and impact in our societies, it would be difficult to reach consensus on the concept of content without frontiers.
This was also borne out by the consultation.
In addition, while information society services are at an early stage in their development I feel that it would be inappropriate at the current stage of negotiations to subject them to the more detailed approach of the Directive.
The very first thing that must be done therefore is to ascertain whether the Directive provides the appropriate regulatory framework for the coming years or whether it needs to be adjusted, and this will be verified in the communication.
As regards the working group of national regulators, mentioned in paragraph 19, the Commission held a meeting with the regulators in March and the next meeting is due to be held on 14 October.
Some Member States do not, however, see the need for an additional committee and have already expressed concern that this committee may duplicate work already being done.
I am not in favour of the systematic participation of public and private broadcasters; I prefer a system of ad hoc invitations like the one we are using at the moment.
With regard to self-regulation and co-regulation - paragraph 20 of the report - I agree with the rapporteur that greater emphasis should be placed on co-regulation.
As a result, in the working documents we have specifically raised this question and I think that we will be able to make some progress in this area.
I would now like to move on to paragraph 28 concerning channels that have a pan-European dimension.
I do not think that it is up to the Commission to take the initiative in this field.
Indeed, given the disappointing results of a study on the possibilities of using digital platforms for thematic channels, it would be difficult for the Commission to finance any new studies on this subject.
Having said that, we are going to contribute indirectly to the creation of pan-European channels by establishing a favourable regulatory framework and by supporting the creation and broadcast of European audiovisual works.
In relation to the question of television for disabled people - paragraph 34 - we must not forget that the Directive deals essentially with the aspects linked to content and the issue of disabled persons is therefore not formally covered in the report on the application of the Directive as it does not fall within its scope.
It is up to the Member States to apply the principle of subsidiarity in this area.
Nevertheless, access to television services for disabled people is very important.
My services have received many contributions regarding these pertinent issues and all of these can be found on the Commission's website.
The website also contains the contributions from associations representing disabled people.
In order to make some progress in this area, we plan to organise a round table on 21 October in association with the Royal National Institute for Deaf People and the Royal National Institute for the Blind in the United Kingdom and to invite the Member States to attend and to report on the situation at national level.
We are therefore going to continue in this way, and I must also point out that the Information Society DG has set up a working group that has been christened 'Inclusive Communications'.
This aspect is thus being taken into account.
Finally, as regards media concentration, discussed in paragraphs 36 to 42, I support the idea in the Perry report that pluralism is an important element in safeguarding democracy.
This idea is fully reflected in the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
I would also like to stress that one of the topics covered by the May 2003 Green Paper on Services of General Interest relates precisely to the protection of pluralism.
All interested parties are invited to submit their comments by 15 September.
The Commission will determine its future policy on the basis of the conclusions of this consultation process.
Finally, I will not be able to comment on all of the changes to the Directive today because we have not yet received all of the written contributions.
We receive new contributions every day and I would like to allow my colleagues to complete their analysis before informing you of them by way of the communication on audiovisual policy.
Mr President, Commissioner, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has done me the honour of asking me to present its opinion.
We cooperated with the rapporteur, Mr Perry, and I am in the happy position of saying that we have taken a common approach.
The Commission needs to pay particular attention to Mr Perry's individual proposals if we are to take another step forward on the interconnected problems linked to the whole of the audiovisual sector.
This year's report has a factor of additional interest compared with previous reports, because it proposes in its annex a programme of work which makes provision for dialogue to develop with the individual national agencies, such as radio and television organisations, independent regulatory authorities etc.
The objective is to reform the directive so that it can monitor rapid technological progress, but it also has other individual objectives.
All these objectives mean that a difficult job awaits the Commission and it must convince us of how it is going to work in order for all the necessary adjustments to come about.
Another conclusion on which we more or less agree is the dual role of the audiovisual media.
They are an economic commodity, which is why they are linked to the issue of competition, to the knowledge society being promoted by the Lisbon policy.
Full coordination is therefore needed here.
At the same time, they are a cultural commodity and their promotion needs to take account, on the one hand, of the public interest, such as protecting minors and safeguarding cultural diversity; on the other hand, however, they must take horizontal account of the European interest, which is to safeguard the European identity against non-European standards, especially American standards.
We need to realise here that the danger from the commercial deficit on the audiovisual media market in comparison with the corresponding American products is directly linked to the future of Europe.
The dialogue has started.
It may be public.
I would say, however, that it needs greater publicity and greater visibility.
In view of all this, the reform of the Television without Frontiers directive must be one of the most serious concerns of all three institutions of the European Union because, over and above clarifying disputed concepts, such as independent producers etc., we need to guarantee the availability of digital options to a wide public and promote the cohesion of the policy of the audiovisual industry.
Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating Mr Perry on the quality of the work he has carried out on what is a vital and extremely sensitive subject.
It is true that he usually deals with difficult issues.
We are all aware of the substantial cultural and economic challenges the Television without Frontiers Directive presents for each of the Member States of the Union and the candidate countries.
That is why we support the Commission, which had the quite right and sensible idea of seeking the opinion of each Member State before taking any decisions on the revision.
Specific improvements to the Directive are no doubt necessary to take account of technological developments, but we must ensure that these adjustments are not premature.
In fact, if we look objectively at the situation of the audiovisual market, we can see that the national markets are adapting bit by bit to the new technologies.
Thus, the recent technological developments have not really disrupted the audiovisual landscape, which continues to be dominated to a large extent by traditional television.
Future changes to the Directive must under no circumstances disrupt its content.
A revision calling into question the cultural objectives on which the Member States had reached agreement, under the pretext of extending the scope of the Directive to include all broadcasting formats, would in reality change completely the initial aims of the Directive, that is, the defence and promotion of cultural diversity.
The main provisions of this Directive must not be called into question.
The key principles must continue to form the foundation of the Community's audiovisual policy: the promotion, movement and broadcast of European works within Europe; the production and broadcast of works by independent producers; the existence of broadcast quotas for television services; the guarantee of protection of minors; and measures to combat excessive advertising.
The Television without Frontiers Directive has proved its worth as a legal instrument and is now being applied satisfactorily.
Its revision can only be justified if it makes genuine improvements to certain elements such as the worrying issue of media concentration, which obviously undermines pluralism.
The Directive must continue to be a useful tool in promoting cultural diversity and must not become a legal instrument providing solely for the promotion of commercial channels where we would see, for example, continuous advertising with disregard for the works broadcast.
Over and above the economic and financial issues, which are clearly vital, is the simple question of our cultures, our identities and the values in which we believe.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Perry has earned our gratitude by presenting a report demonstrating a very forward-looking perspective, and in which he has not left out the areas of conflict that undeniably exist in a dual system in which public and commercial service providers square up to each other and fight over a market comprising 155 million households in the present European Union of fifteen Member States, a figure that will further increase.
There is no doubt that the directive will have to be revised if its objectives for the future are to be achieved.
My Group takes the view that the Commission is too hesitant in this respect.
What is in fact at stake is the safeguarding of cultural diversity, a wide range of opinions and pluralism.
Whilst democratic opinion today is, in essence, shaped by television, this is no longer only the traditional television with analogue transmission.
More and more, we have digitalisation to cope with.
I was recently at the International Broadcasting Exhibition in Berlin, where I could see very well how consumer habits in this area are changing, and that nowadays the technical means of transmission can no longer be decisive when it comes to deciding which is the right way to draft laws for a media service.
It must also be clear, however, that we need to establish a system of graduated regulation, and this is where there will be new demands placed on future legislation.
Not every media service is of major importance in publicity terms, so the determinative criterion for the future must be the extent to which a media service is useful for publicity purposes and in what sense it is not.
If I might put it rather loosely, it is on that basis that legislation can be drafted with varying degrees of rigour.
Much will also be demanded of the rules that will have to be laid down, not only, to be sure, under the television directive, but also in parallel with it, in order to counteract the accumulation of economic power, which becomes media power and, eventually, also political power.
We are dealing here with a development that makes it plain that bounds must be set at European level to contain media concentration, which does indeed endanger pluralism.
As we can see from the example of Italy, national legal resources are not, in any case, sufficient.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, before I make my comments, I should like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Perry, for his sterling report.
It is an important directive, and thanks to the Commission's regular reports, we are gaining a clear insight into its functioning, which enables us to prepare well-considered proposals for a possible revision in future.
I do have some remarks.
First of all, given the current increase in media convergence, both in the present Member States and in the acceding countries, we must continue to hammer away at pluriformity, both in the public broadcasting corporations and in the private stations.
This is crucial to my group, and I assume my fellow Liberal will also stress this in a moment.
Secondly, sound criteria are needed to protect minors from aggressive TV commercials.
In fact, with regard to television programmes too, it is important for children to be able to make informed choices and for their parents to be able to help them in this.
My group is a great believer in self-regulation, which gives me an opportunity to stand up for the Dutch system, 'Kijkwijze', which enables parents and children to make informed choices by means of pictograms.
Finally, I should like to say how pleased I am by the wide support given to my proposal for a pan-European children's network.
It is a good way of distributing European productions for children on a larger scale, since it combines broadcasting licence-holders from the Member States and candidate countries.
Excellent children's films have been made in Europe.
If we now see that in my country, the national production of quality films has enjoyed an enormous boost, which is what I read the morning of the day we returned from the film festival in Venice, that the proportion of Dutch films among those seen by cinema audiences has increased by some 6%, and especially audiences composed of young people, due to an innovative approach whose key aim is to show producers that they are making films for a certain audience - an audience-specific approach, in other words - then I can only be optimistic about the preservation of our cultural diversity in the media, and there is certainly a place for television without frontiers, and, needless to say, for Europe.
Thank you, Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen.
This issue is a difficult one and is undergoing constant change.
I must thank Mr Perry for his work, and yet I am unsure whether or not this Directive needs to be revised.
This has been stated clearly both by those working in the industry and by the Commission.
This current issue comes up against the problem of definition and apprehension raised by the transfer of images, the development and acceleration of which we have not yet managed to control.
What worries me is the absence of a definition of a 'work'.
The Television without Frontiers Directive provides a negative definition.
We know what it is not.
It is not information, it is not advertising, it is not this, it is not that.
It is produced by X or made by Y. I, myself, would prefer - and I believe that some of those working in the industry would also prefer - to know what it is.
That would perhaps make it easier to settle the ongoing debate in France and other European countries on reality television.
The problem is defining the scope of audiovisual works.
Some works are very easy to define, such as documentaries and films, but not all are.
I do not know how to define reality television and this is a serious concern.
The second point raised by this debate is the movement of works.
The movement of works and artists is a recurring problem in the field of culture, as I highlighted in the report on the performing arts.
In the context of Television without Frontiers, it is magnified as a result of concentration and the non-national nature of the sector.
How can we promote non-national works in each of our countries?
We will have to give our opinion on this fundamental problem.
Mr Perry, you paid a great deal of attention in your report to the question of media concentration, which can prevent the movement of non-national works.
I am very pleased that you stress this point as, in my view, it is vitally important and something we must look at very seriously indeed.
Mr President, the fundamental problem in this audiovisual debate is that we do not dare to define the quality we want to protect.
When we talk about European works, for example, we include completely ridiculous talk shows, under the pretext that they are European productions.
Until we have the courage to define what a work is - and that is where Mrs Fraisse is right - in other words, what it is that we want to protect, our television services will be unable to protect European production and European works in Europe for want of the appropriate instruments.
Secondly, as regards concentration, the problem is very simple.
If we do not define what we cannot democratically accept in Europe, there will be more and more concentration and non-European forces will dominate the market.
For both these reasons, I believe that the European Union must have the courage to define what a work is and to define what should be the limit, democratically, between political power and the power of the media.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen. I and Mr Volcic have tabled some amendments to the excellent, and I repeat, excellent, report by Mr Perry, regarding an issue which you have all touched upon, media concentration and, therefore, pluralism.
I listened with great interest to what Commissioner Reding had to say in defence of pluralism as an essential value.
We cannot, however, close our eyes to the fact that, throughout the western world today, market forces, if left to themselves, almost always lead to serious, dangerous phenomena of concentration and that only a political measure can lay down the rules for a liberal society, the essential basis of which is pluralism.
We are, therefore, facing a major political battle on this issue, taking place in the US, where there is a deadlock between Congress and the authority, and in Europe with the grave problems in England that have thrust themselves upon our attention and the problems in Italy that many of you are aware of.
I do not want you to think, however, that the amendments tabled by Mr Volcic, and myself urging Parliament and the Commission to adopt a measure, a directive, in line with what was, moreover, approved by Parliament in November, were dictated solely by Italian issues.
There is truly a much greater, much wider issue here that affects the whole of Europe: it is an issue of civilisation.
If we want to be a Community based on liberal principals, then this is one of the first issues we need to regulate, in a spirit of freedom and respect for all opinions.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am particularly grateful to Mr Perry for his report because, in emphatically demanding the revision of the television directive, he has done so with the objective of maintaining and promoting cultural diversity in Europe in an era of technological convergence.
The fact is that content is no longer dependent only on the medium of television, but, in the same way, on many other technological media, and if we want to maintain diversity, we have to find ways whereby we can achieve common rules in this area, which do justice to the various demands, albeit in a slightly different procedure.
There are two issues I would like to address, and the first is media pluralism.
This Parliament has very emphatically spoken out, most recently on 10 November 2002, in favour of greater support for, and underpinning of, media diversity in Europe and against unhindered media concentration.
I would press upon the Commission the urgent need to do what this vote by Parliament demands of it and put before us the pieces of work that we have asked for.
The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats cannot, however, endorse Amendment No 10, which was tabled today, as it refers exclusively to one instrument, the directive, and because we will achieve a result in this area only if we balance, in an appropriate and proper way, the competences of the Member States and those of the European Union.
Considerations of media pluralism therefore demand the solution that we called for in our resolution in November.
The second point I want to address is the protection of young people.
New technologies require that children and young people be protected in the same way as is provided for in the television directive.
Let us therefore work together towards a new system and new ways of self-regulation with minimum standards accepted by all.
I wish the Commission much success as it travels down this road.
Mr President, Commissioner, we have now heard many answers concerning how the television directive is applied, but also questions, and I think we must and should make some changes.
We must unreservedly guarantee basic principles such as the requirement that the cultural diversity of the media be protected in order to maintain freedom of expression, diversity of opinion and pluralism, creativity and the right to free access to information.
Public broadcasters must perform their educational function, by which I mean that the quota for the transmission of European programmes and works by independent producers could be increased.
This is an aspiration with which I wish to associate myself.
There must, however, be clear, workable and manageable definitions of what is meant by European works and independent producers.
I see the requirement that levels of media concentration be monitored as being the most important.
We have examples of media power and political power being concentrated in one pair of hands.
I believe this cannot be conducive to democracy, and so this is a vitally important area of concern.
We will no doubt have to work towards a directive founded on our demands in the 20 November resolution, and, if all these things come together, I hope that we will be able to do all that media diversity in the European Union requires of us.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen. This directive confirms once and for all that European democracy and transparency is closely connected to the freedom and pluralism of the media.
Therefore, media concentration jeopardises freedom of conscience and is a grave injury to human dignity.
In its Green Paper of 21 May 2003, the Commission calls for specific measures to be looked at once again to actively protect pluralism; in its Recommendation of 28 January 2003, the Council expressed the same concern; in its Resolution of 20 November and the two reports by Mr Sylla and Mr Perry, Parliament said likewise.
We must, therefore, give a specific response through a Commission initiative to this effect.
We are in a constituent phase.
The draft Constitution includes the Charter of Fundamental Rights, Article 11(2) of which explicitly enshrines the right to freedom and pluralism of the media.
What sense is there, however, in adopting a Constitution when that is, itself, negated by the present situation?
Mr President, Commissioner, I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur, our colleague Mr Perry, and say that I am very pleased that the revision of this directive aims to promote values of public interest, that is, cultural diversity and the right of reply.
Above all, moreover, it wishes to promote the development of the European audiovisual industry.
Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the European audiovisual industry must above all be an industry of quality.
As a mother of two small children, I naturally look for children's programmes and cartoons - with a view to finding programmes which do not injure their sensibilities and which are not prejudicial to minors - and I often find that these programmes or cartoons intended for small children are much more violent than anything even I would like to see.
I often remember how, as a child, I heard adults talking about how they believed that cartoons such as Bambi or Pinocchio were not suitable for us, but now that kind of thing is by far the most ethical programme we can find.
If we want a society free of violence, which is what we all aspire to, we must invest in it.
Investing in it means investing in children and young people, who are the future of the European Union.
I believe that showing them violence on a daily basis is not the best way to do so.
I would therefore insist that the European audiovisual industry must be of high quality, strictly controlled and, above all, must be suited to its intended audience.
Mr President, Mr Perry has reminded us of where the directive has succeeded and he has also indicated, very politely, where we have gone too slowly.
We have gone too slowly in tackling the problem of media concentration, the limits to public access and the progress we have to make towards a sensitive, but forceful, restatement of this directive and its contents framework.
I would say to the Commissioner that we are now in the 52nd month of this Parliament and more conferences and discussions simply intended to spin out time until the end of the Parliament are not good enough.
I thank Mr Perry for accepting my own amendments on access in paragraph 44.
Television must empower as well as entertain.
Digital broadcasting can reach those with sensory deprivation just as well as it can reach the mass audience.
In this year, above all, we should make progress to that end.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
The next item is the report (A5-0276/2003) by Mrs Zorba, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on Cultural Industries (2002/2127(INI)).
.
(EL) Mr President, the Constitutional Treaty reformulates in one of its articles the cultural dimension of Europe and this constitutional foundation expresses a clear political position.
Namely that European culture is a fundamental component of the European economic and social model which is needed if the political venture of the European Union is to be completed.
It is the duty of us, as Members of the European Parliament, to convert this constitutional formulation to an active, effective policy.
I consider that, with the report on cultural industries, we are making such a step.
We have expanded our policy horizontally with certain important admissions which have to do with the conditions of production and consumption of cultural products and services by European citizens.
We demonstrated during the preparation of this report and in the dialogue held in the Committee on Culture with all the honourable Members, and I must thank them for that, the central importance of creation and of creators as a basic source of the added value of cultural products.
We took account of the important economic dimension of culture nowadays, its role in the economic development of regions and towns and its contribution to GDP and to the employment sector.
We noted the revolutionary changes brought about by new technologies in many of the sectors of the cultural industries, such as in music, in publications and in the audiovisual sector.
We discussed in detail the importance of the competitiveness of European products, compared with those from other countries of the world, the inequalities of the international trade and the close link between cultural heritage and tourism.
European citizens consume millions of copies of disks and books and buy millions of tickets to the cinema and concerts every year.
All this constitutes their cultural diet, thereby shaping their profile and their cultural identity.
The citizens also watch television programmes.
They receive information and influence on the Internet from a massive quantity of material which we refer to as content.
In these ways they select, cultivate and promote one form or another of art and culture, different aesthetics and quality, in close dependency on education and their personal development.
It is a complex cultural process which characterises the daily life of citizens and we should not ignore the broad political importance and weight which it has.
In addition, enlargement gives Europe an even greater cultural dimension, together with diversity.
The internal market is growing.
Creators' works must overcome a number of obstacles, such as problems in connection with distribution and promotion and extensive piracy, in order to find a way of reaching the European public.
What we are looking for is European added value and that also applies to the thousands of small and medium-sized enterprises working in the various sectors.
In order to address all this, we have made a series of proposals to the Commission.
They are numerous, but I shall comment on just three.
First, the need for a definition of cultural industries and the sectors they include.
We need here to analyse the cultural, commercial and economic dimension in order to include the sectors in the definition of cultural or creative industries, as they are called in certain countries.
I think this will give us a better statistical picture, which we do not have at present.
Our second call on the Commission is to map the cultural industries at European level.
We are calling for it to concentrate on cultural, economic, legal, technological and educational aspects, to include employment, intellectual property, the competitiveness network, new products and exports.
Finally, we consider that it is very important to have a Green Paper in order to promote the coordination of the Member States and the regions in the sector of the cultural industries, so that obstacles can be analysed, solutions suggested and a way found for the public and private sectors to cooperate, to promote competitiveness and to improve European citizens' access to culture.
I would like to believe that this report is just the beginning and that the Commission will respond not only to this specific report but also to the signs of the times, by taking the necessary initiatives with which, it should be added, the Council has also been preoccupied recently.
Mr President, I would first of all like to thank Mrs Zorba for her excellent report.
It has come at just the right time to highlight the importance of the phenomenon of European cultural industries not only from an economic point of view - to which reference has been made - but also in terms of the potential they offer for cultural diversity in Europe.
It is unfortunate, but we are not always aware of the economic significance of European cultural industries.
I am referring to audiovisual, music and publishing services.
A study carried out in 2001 on the employment potential of this sector estimated that 4.8 million people were employed by creative industries in the broadest sense, which accounts for 3.1% of employees in the European Union.
The European audiovisual sector alone directly employs more than 1 million people.
Therefore, in addition to their contribution to diversity, cultural industries contribute significantly to the economy.
They of course differ from other industries in that they have an obvious social and cultural role.
They have to do with creation.
They involve producing and selling not products, like other industries, but cultural goods.
These goods are the expression of an identity; they are reference points.
Therefore, as far as cultural industries are concerned, normal industrial policy cannot play the same role, not being adapted to these industries.
We need to look beyond it.
Cultural diversity presupposes a solid and varied industrial fabric that guarantees pluralism in the cultural supply within a global market.
This phenomenon alone shows the importance that needs to be attached to this sector of activities that relates to our identities.
I would like to mention some key actions to demonstrate to you that Europe is paying attention to this sector, not only within the framework of cultural programmes, but far beyond them.
You are all aware of the MEDIA programme and the work we do for film, but did you know, for example, that in the Culture 2000 programme, the support provided for publishing houses to encourage literary translations has benefited 1 300 translations in the past years?
Did you know that a large proportion of the Structural Funds is used to develop the cultural industry?
For example, in the Swedish town of Hultsfred, the ERDF cofinanced projects aimed at developing the music industry.
Since then, the town has become the rock capital of Sweden!
As you can see, European aid can result in genuine, concerted and concentrated development of cultural industries.
Indeed, in your report, you call for a communication on the Structural Funds and culture, a communication that will highlight these types of actions.
I would like to point out that since 2002 we have also been developing experimental measures designed to support the music and book industries.
For instance, we have the project to increase exports of European music outside our continent.
You can therefore see, ladies and gentlemen, that these cultural industries are being supported only by EU programmes and actions.
I must add that we will soon have a unique opportunity to strengthen this action when we discuss the extension of the MEDIA and CULTURE programmes and the new generation of programmes.
To this end, with Parliament's help, we will have to envisage very systematic action so that the creativity of this sector can encourage economic and cultural diversity and, thus, our European roots.
Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating Mrs Zorba on having taken this very interesting initiative to dedicate a report to cultural industries.
In fact, today we are seeing the emergence of cultural industries with an ever-increasing economic dimension, which also play a vital role in Europe's cultural diversity and identity.
One of the problems raised by this report is the total absence of a precise definition of cultural industries and of any European industrial strategy in this area.
The Commission must look at these issues and put forward proposals to us, perhaps by way of the Green Paper.
In future, we will have to increase aid for cultural industries in projects for the economic development of regions and towns, through the Structural Funds, and also by encouraging private and public partnerships.
Similarly, the European Union will have to establish support measures for SMEs and independent enterprises, which play an important role in the area of artistic creation and production.
Finally, I would like to emphasise here the importance of the printed word, and in particular of the regional daily press.
That is what best guarantees linguistic and cultural diversity and is the most overlooked of the Union's cultural policies.
It is vital that when the Commission is drawing up its Green Paper it should at long last put forward proposals to actively support this sector, which is also essential for pluralism.
In the same vein, the Commission will have to propose specific measures to combat media concentration.
In conclusion, I feel that it is now time to mobilise our efforts to ensure that the proposed UNESCO convention on cultural diversity can soon see the light of day.
More than ever, we must promote a European cultural spirit in order to encourage creation and bolster cultural diversity, without which Europe would not exist nor have any influence abroad.
Mr President, the direct cultural policy of the European Union is restricted, as the Member States have wished, to the modest funding of programmes which, nevertheless, are amongst those most often requested by the citizens.
This deficiency is due, in my opinion, to fundamental causes.
Firstly, the Council's fear of denationalising these policies, which some consider as signs of national identity.
The other reason is the governments', and also the Commission's, fear of using Community resources for subsidies which are not directed towards farmers or large public works.
People avoid talking about culture or art in economic terms when, on the contrary, it should be argued that the cultural industries create employment and generate wealth for Europe.
If we include the audiovisual field and cultural tourism in the culture sector, it is by far the most important sector for the European economy.
I address this, without much hope that they read the Minutes, it is true, to the Finance Ministers and also our colleagues in the Committee on Budgets.
As requested by Mrs Zorba, the Commission must quantify these aspects and consider them when drawing up its policies, not only the directly cultural ones but also the economic, social and territorial ones.
Furthermore, Commissioner, you should demand that your colleagues take this approach to territorial policies.
On the other hand, it is also becoming necessary to restrict the commercialisation of culture.
You will perhaps remember that a few years ago one of the best museums in the world, the property of one of our Member States, was renting out its rooms when the museum was closed - rooms exhibiting humanity's greatest works - for weddings and other social events.
This was a depressing and alarming example.
Within the European Union, the economic exploitation of cultural resources must be compatible with their historical and artistic dignity.
Mr President, these aspects and many others are dealt with in this report, and I warmly congratulate its author on its timeliness and quality.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should first of all like to express my appreciation for Mrs Zorba's sound initiative.
We worked well together and managed, via a poll, to gain more insight into the finer points of the cultural industries.
It is clear that there is much room for improvement, certainly at European level.
The cultural industries are, after all, of great economic significance, and offer much scope for employment.
On this basis, I should like to call for culture to figure more prominently in the Structural Funds; SMEs in particular might benefit from this.
Culture is also, however, an expression of our national identity.
In a united and, soon, enlarged Europe, it is important for us to be aware of this cultural diversity.
Museums in all manner of areas are trying to accommodate this, but unfortunately, they are hindered in most European countries by the sometimes exorbitant premiums they have to pay for the exhibits on display.
This gives museums in countries where this is not the case a major advantage in the organisation of outstanding exhibitions.
This is, in my view, a clear form of distortion of competition, and it must be stopped; it prompts me to urge the Commission to map out the differences in indemnity regulations in the present and future Member States, and subsequently to table a proposal for more streamlined regulations.
It is unacceptable for a united Europe to have an elitist group of citizens who are well-informed on what Europe has to offer in terms of culture, while others have to remain deprived of all the fine things that the cultural industries in other European countries have produced and are producing.
Thank you.
I should therefore like attention to be given to these indemnity regulations.
Mr President, I should like to thank our rapporteur for the serious work she has done; however, I cannot agree with her on the approach which she has opted to take.
In a society in which everything can be bought and sold, culture is in immediate danger of commercialisation, which changes its nature.
Cultural creation is no longer the art created either collectively by society or by gifted people.
It is becoming a product which is produced and sold, so that it can be converted to business profit, as well as a means of ideological guidance of the peoples, by promoting a specific way of life.
Under these conditions, approaching culture in terms of the industry, the market and added value, as if we were talking about cars or oranges, is very dangerous.
Of course, the report expresses a number of concerns about cultural diversity.
However, it is not these that determine its content, it is concerns that the European art markets have lost an important share of the global market, that the European Union has not yet developed its potential as regards the trade in cultural commodities.
Company mergers are considered dangerous not because they result in monopoly control, but because they jeopardise market transparency.
Even piracy is condemned not as theft of intellectual work, but because it deprives these industries of vast revenues, impacting on future investment.
The proposals are in keeping with the concerns expressed.
The report calls for the intervention of the Commission and the Member States not in order to strengthen artistic creation and protect it from commercialisation, but in order to strengthen companies and promote the competitiveness of the European industries.
This sort of intervention will further institutionalise culture and put it under even greater control by the monopolies.
Finally, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to draw your attention to the amendments proposed by our political group, in a bid to mitigate somewhat the consequences of the report.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I can only thank the rapporteur for her excellent work, which is very precise and detailed.
Firstly, I appreciated the principles, the values that are the basis for the report itself, in other words the need to recognise culture as having a principal role in the European Constitution.
Indeed, the motto 'united in diversity' only makes sense when interpreted in light of the wealth and diversity of identities and of cultural and historical roots which are the heart of our European identity.
All too often, however, European cultural heritage is neither appreciated nor exploited sufficiently, even though there is no doubt that it represents an area of great potential, not least from an economic point of view.
I fully agree that it is necessary to begin by detailing a comprehensive study seeking to fix a European plan of industries and of cultural productions and activities and subsequently to implement a genuine inventory of European artistic and cultural heritage.
It would be a step on from the past, even the recent past, when the Commission declared that it had neither instruments nor competence, thus relegating culture to an exclusively national responsibility.
I will conclude by drawing attention to some important points in the report: firstly the reduction of VAT on music goods to boost sales and, in the meantime, to reduce trading of pirate products; secondly, greater focus on young artists, in terms of both training and promotion; thirdly and finally, greater investment at European level and more regulations, not least to facilitate European cultural enterprise financially, for example through the option of deducting the reinvested profits.
Mr President, the report by my honourable friend, Mrs Zorba, gives us another important opportunity to understand the importance which developing the cultural industries has for the economic and political objectives of the European Union and to reflect on our obligations at European, national and local level.
Their contribution to the Lisbon objectives is undisputed.
Apart from creating wealth and jobs, the cultural industries, by their very nature, promote initiative and innovation, which are valuable factors for the competitiveness of the European economy.
Their development can also help in particular in reversing isolation, by developing local societies, because it makes use of their comparative advantages and can easily be linked to tourist development and promotion.
I should also like to point out that the cultural industries have sectors which can create employment opportunities, especially for people affected by unemployment, such as young creators or women and the disabled.
That is why I agree with the rapporteur that use should be made of the cultural contribution of the Structural Funds, especially now with the mid-term evaluation of the 2000-2006 programming period, so that we can take additional or corrective measures, such as promoting vocational training and, of course, promoting education at higher learning level, because in many countries, such as my own, Greece, it is inadequate.
Thank you, Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou.
On behalf of the sittings service, I apologise for the hubbub over which you had to speak.
This morning's debate on the cultural package is closed.
Culture being about listening to one another, I assure you that at times we are not always very polite.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, several journalists have told me that 'Plenum Aktuell', the German-language summary of our debates, has recently proved to be particularly deficient.
The German text contains neither Monday's debate on Basel II nor the debate on the outcome of the Convention, which many of us regard as historic.
Until 11 this morning, there were no reports at all, something that seems to have something to do with the reorganisation of the press service.
I think this bodes ill for the quality of the reports on our debates, and I would be glad, Mr President, if you would set the relevant inquiries in motion.
Thank you, Mr Turmes.
We take note of your statement.
We will make the relevant checks and, of course, we will improve this service if necessary.
WRITTEN STATEMENT (RULE 120)
. (FR) Although of economic importance, culture is above all about citizenship.
The diversity and quality of culture and the capacity to participate in cultural creation are elements of a democratic society that cannot be ignored.
In this respect, public intervention is crucial.
Financial support must be provided for cultural creation and production in order to ensure diversity and vitality and to avoid concentration in the hands of a few, often American, multinationals.
Today, though, systems of public aid are threatened by the thinking that makes the market pre-eminent over everything else.
In the EU, these systems may be considered to be 'State aid' prohibited as being contrary to European competition law, which is sacrosanct.
We must regret, in this respect, the result of the Convention, which leaves the existing texts as they are instead of promoting aid for culture to the ranks of aid that is automatically authorised.
A formidable sword of Damocles thus hangs above our cultural policies.
At international level, we must safeguard the cultural exception, particularly in light of the GATS, by ensuring that the unanimity rule is maintained in relation to trade agreements in the field of culture.
We shall now proceed to the vote in accordance with the simplified procedure laid down in Rule 110a.
Report (A5-0209/2003) by Mr Miguel Angel MartÃ­nez MartÃ­nez, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the Annual Report 2001 from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on EC development policy and the implementation of the external assistance (COM(2002) 490 - 2002/2246(INI))
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Mr President, I would like to point out that in the next report we are going to vote on - the Ebner report - the Spanish version of paragraph 14 of Recommendation 2 of the Annex does not have the same meaning as the original version.
I would therefore like to ask that, when it comes to the vote, we vote on the text of the original version of that paragraph.
Mrs Zabell, as in all cases, the services will guarantee that the version ultimately published will conform to what has been voted for in plenary.
The Spanish version will be corrected.
We shall now proceed to the vote on:
Report (A5-0271/2003) by Mr Michl Ebner, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, with recommendations to the Commission on regional and lesser-used languages - the minority languages in the European Union in the context of enlargement and cultural diversity (2003/2057(INI))
Mr VallvÃ© is requesting the floor for an oral amendment.
Mr President, Mr Ebner, I would like, at this juncture, to bring in an oral amendment.
With your permission, I would like to replace 'in the official language' in the last sentence with 'in the official language or languages'.
[I think that is perfectly clear].
If there are no objections we shall proceed in this way.
(Parliament approved the resolution)
I will take advantage of the Presidency and offer my [sincere] congratulations molt sincerament en la meva prÃ²pia llengua [in my own language].
Joint motion for a resolution
Mr President, I had informed the services that I should like to table an oral amendment after Article 39.
I should now like to ask you whether this is still possible.
That is very kind of you.
We have at the moment a situation in which, among others, the Dutchman, Arjan Erkel is still being held, with no indication as to his whereabouts.
This is why I should like to table the following oral amendment, which is in line with the rapporteur's views.
I will read it to you in English.
It is to be inserted after Article 39, and reads as follows:.
Are there any objections to the presentation of this oral amendment?
As there are not, we shall proceed to the vote.
Mr Wieland, a point of order in the middle of the vote?
Mr President, the right of individual Members to demand that the outcome of a vote be checked is a matter of good practice in this House.
It can indeed happen that a President - and we assume that all Presidents and Vice-Presidents have a good overview of things - from time to time asks whether a check is what the individual Member really wants.
Earlier, though, there was Amendment No 4, when so many Members asked for the result to be checked, that I do not think it was proper of you to ignore their requests.
I continue to regard this amendment as still outstanding and ask you to have a check carried out.
I would say to the honourable Member that as President I have no problem repeating votes if there is really the least reasonable doubt.
I can guarantee that there is no doubt, I have declared the result entirely convinced of this and I am not going to rectify a vote whose result has already been declared.
The rapporteur is going to present a technical modification of paragraph 120 rather than an oral amendment.
I would insist that I believe that this is more of a technical correction.
Does anybody object to the presentation of the rapporteur's oral amendment?
If not, we shall proceed to the vote.
Mr President, there are a lot of very sensitive matters that we are dealing with in this report.
It seems to me that the vote that we took on Amendment No 16 is entirely invalid.
(Mixed reactions)
Many Members of this House asked for a check, which you have refused.
I doubt that you have the right to refuse a check.
(Applause from the right)
I insist that we now have a check on Amendment No 16.
I am sorry, but I have no intention of carrying out that check.
I would insist that the result was perfectly clear.
You have not taken account of the fact that one group has not voted in the same way in both cases.
I am simply applying Rule 19(2) of the Rules of Procedure and I will take the consequences.
Mr President, you cited a Rule that I did not know existed when you made your ruling on the points of order by Mr Wieland and Mr Van Orden.
Rule 138(3) mentions that points of order concerning the validity of a vote may be raised after the President has declared it closed.
Thus Mr Wieland had the right to do what he did.
Rule 138(4) provides that 'after the result of a vote by show of hands has been announced, a Member may request that this result be checked using the electronic voting system'.
You did not do that Mr President.
I know the final decision on all this is yours, but it was a legitimate call by a host of Members of this House.
You said at the very beginning of this voting session that your eyes were playing you up.
I would humbly ask that you take a check on Amendment No 16.
(Applause from the right)
I am going to apply Rule 138(5) of the Rules of Procedure, which gives that final responsibility to the President, and I therefore consider the result I declared previously to be valid.
.
(NL) Mr President, as rapporteur, I would not like to see any ambiguity left about one section in the decision-making process.
I should therefore like to urge you to consider complying with the EPP's request and permitting, at this stage, an oral vote on point 16.
I appreciate that you would then have to go back on a decision, but I should nevertheless like to urge you to treat this report in such a way as to leave no misunderstanding or uncertainty on this matter at all.
I would therefore make an urgent appeal to you now to honour the request.
I am sorry but I am not changing my opinion.
We shall proceed to the vote on the whole of the motion for a resolution thus modified.
(Parliament approved the resolution)
Report (A5-0281/2003) by Mr FodÃ© Sylla, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Rights and Freedoms, Justice and Home Affairs, on the situation concerning fundamental rights in the European Union (2002) (2002/2013(INI))
Mr President, I would like to present an oral amendment to the first sub-paragraph of paragraph 135, which says the following: 'calls on the institutions to provide access to opinions of the Legal Services, respecting the principles established by the Court of Justice'.
I believe that this amendment would resolve the small problem which had arisen.
Mr Turco is requesting the floor. Is it on the same issue?
The mere fact that the staff of the Legal Service and Parliamentary Bureau only let us know at 10.40 this morning which texts we have to submit, how we should vote and which amendments they can accept, gives a picture of the situation in which we find ourselves in Parliament.
I would like to thank Mr Mollar for his efforts, but, as far as I am concerned - being one of the authors of the amendment adopted unanimously by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, an amendment which, moreover, quoted the opinion of the European Ombudsman - I think that we must put an end to this farce.
I will vote against this compromise.
We take note but, institutionally, the correct procedure was to hear the chairman of the committee and you as author of the amendment.
We are therefore going to vote firstly on the proposed compromise by the chairman of the committee.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would nevertheless like to remind those Members who have asked for no less than five or six passages of the report to be deleted that we are not in a supermarket with a trolley.
This is about the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and we are not here to decide what should be retained or completely removed.
It also has to do with the Charter that has to appear in Part II of the text of the Constitution.
So when Members propose removing the right to education, the right of asylum, the right to citizenship, the reference to racism, when Members call into question equality between men and women or on the basis of sexual orientation, I say to them that the next time we should not call this text the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union but the Charter of Random Rights of the European Union.
Mr Sylla, I believe that the amendments have been presented correctly, in time and in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, and what you are making is a political objection rather than a regulatory objection.
Your observation is not therefore relevant.
I would ask the honourable Members not to take it into account.
I believe it is a clarification with regard to the wording and as such it will be taken into account.
In any event it has to be approved.
Mr President, I would very much like to make a brief statement about the next amendment.
My concern is with torture.
It is quite extraordinary that there is no amendment whereby this House can condemn torture in the strongest terms.
(The President cut off the speaker)
Ladies and gentlemen, you are perfectly aware that this is not a debate.
It is not appropriate to speak here about the fundamental issue.
We shall proceed to the vote on the whole of the motion for a resolution thus amended.
(Parliament approved the resolution)
Report (A5-0273/2003) by Mr Paul A.A.J.G. Lannoye, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the communication from the Commission on water management in developing countries: policy and priorities for EU development cooperation (COM(2002) 132 - C5-0335/2002 - 2002/2179(COS))
President.
Firstly there is an oral amendment by Mr Knolle to Amendment No 15.
Mr President, I ask that the following change be made to the amendment on which we are currently voting.
The last line reads: '?the work of private operators'.
I ask that the word 'private' be deleted, so that it will then read: 'the work of operators'.
Does the House agree to this oral amendment being tabled?
Are there any objections?
We shall proceed to the vote on Amendment No 15, including the oral amendment.
The rapporteur is requesting the floor.
Mr President, I had asked to table an oral amendment.
I will ask the Socialist Group to remove a small section of their amendment, which states 'can be sometimes in practice'.
I would propose to them that they remove this part of the sentence.
If they are in agreement, I will support their amendment; if not, I will vote against it.
The Group of the Party of European Socialists does not agree to that omission.
The amendment will therefore be put to the vote in its original form.
We shall now proceed to the vote on the whole of the proposal for a resolution, including amendments.

Report (A5-0276/2003) by Mrs Myrsini Zorba, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on Cultural Industries (2002/2127(INI))
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
.
(PT) The European Union's objective is to ensure that Europe remains prosperous and peaceful.
It is also, however, an important partner in cooperation, in particular with developing countries.
I congratulate the Commission on its Annual Report for 2001 on EC development policy and the implementation of external assistance.
As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, however, I can only underline the fact that questions of gender, development and combating poverty are interrelated.
The Commission should, therefore, incorporate into its development policy specific goals relating to education, health, gender equality and combating poverty.
The financing of female participation in business should be promoted.
Moreover, the reduction of child mortality and maternal mortality, as well as measures to fight violence against women, genital mutilation, rape of girls and trafficking in human beings, should always be included in development policy.
The Commission should ensure a gender-balanced participation in projects, with a special regard for areas where discrimination against women is most severe.
I support the Commission in its reform of the management of external aid, which will allow us to strengthen the evaluation and improve the implementation of development policy.
. (FR) The Martinez Martinez report calls on Parliament to approve the Commission's 2001 annual report on its development policy and the implementation of external assistance.
We voted against the report to highlight both our opposition to the Commission's policy and its justification.
Even the report from the very official UNDP notes that the situation in most poor countries deteriorated in the previous year and that, for some of them, it is disastrous.
Under these conditions, the very title of the report, which refers to development policy, is an insult to these hundreds of thousands of human beings whose situation, rather than improving, is only getting worse.
The fact that the report dares to welcome the Commission's emphasis on poverty reduction is a further insult.
The amount of aid provided is pitiful; it comes nowhere near the amounts the pillage of these countries yields to oil, building and maritime traffic trusts and the countless European enterprises that are growing rich on the meagre wages paid in these countries.
The report calls for specific measures to protect indigenous populations.
Quite apart from the language, which is redolent of colonial times, what the poor countries, and particularly Africa, must be protected from above all, is these predators, the large cartels?
(Abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
Mr President, I was very happy that Parliament gave such resounding support to the Ebner report.
My own ancestral languages in Scotland - Gaelic and Lowland Scots - have suffered severe discrimination and neglect over a couple of centuries.
Indeed, as we know, many of the Gaelic speakers were driven out during the horrible period of the Highland Clearances.
In these circumstances it is a matter for rejoicing that the annual National Gaelic Mod (Am MÃ²d NÃ iseanta RÃ¬oghail) will take place for the one hundredth time in the town of Oban this year.
I am very glad to have a constituency office there.
It is a great tragedy that the languages of Duncan Ban MacIntyre and Robert Burns have become more or less foreign languages to the children of Argyllshire and Ayrshire respectively, and other parts of Scotland.
These are examples from one country of a universal European problem.
I am very glad that at the Convention I had the chance to help put respect for linguistic diversity into the objectives of the Union, if we adopt the draft Constitution.
The Charter of Fundamental Rights is helpful too.
But we need proactive help and that is what the Ebner report promises.
I hope that the Commission will take that up.
I am very pleased with the result of that vote and to have taken part in it.
Mr President, I am glad that this report has been adopted.
The report by Michl Ebner from the South Tyrol is successor to a long line of great reports adopted by this House on this subject since the 1980s, beginning with the ArfÃ© Report, produced by a great Social Democrat from the Valle d'Aosta.
I rejoice in it.
It was the eastward enlargement that made it necessary to send out a clear signal concerning these matters, for a very large number of minorities and ethnic groups will be finding their way to us: Hungarians in Slovakia, Germans and Poles in the Czech Republic, Poles in Lithuania, Lithuanians in Poland, and so on. Taken together, members of the minorities will, numerically speaking, be the second largest Member State in the enlarged EU, after Germany but before France.
That shows the immensity of this issue in quantitative terms, and even in qualitative terms it is of great significance, as these minorities can become either the mortar in the foundations of the EU or an explosive charge.
We want them to be the mortar that holds us together.
. (FR) I am vehemently in favour of keeping, indeed developing, cultural diversity in Europe, particularly at this time when it is being enlarged to comprise twenty-five Member States.
Since languages are the main component of this diversity, then I am in favour of linguistic enlargement, in spite of any material or technical difficulties that may arise from it.
Incidentally, I fear that there is a double game being played by those who are arguing for an increase in the number of languages, with the actual aim of better establishing the monopoly of English.
Therefore, we need to work on the language question, in particular by again giving objective consideration to Esperanto.
The monopoly of English is neither good for Europe nor for Great Britain, whose language will become a mere 'nuts and bolts language'
. (NL) Respecting and safeguarding the linguistic and cultural diversity in Europe is an honourable objective.
Any erosion of this diversity would constitute an impoverishment of our cultural heritage.
Consequently, measures to avoid this, such as the proposed establishment of a European Agency on Linguistic Diversity and Language Learning, deserve every support.
However, the draft resolution is explicitly based on the Council of Europe's Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities.
The Flemish Government has always refused to sign this agreement - with good reason - since French-speaking Belgians who have moved to Flanders want to misuse it in order to have French recognised as an official language in Flanders. This is in conflict with language legislation that has been established with great difficulty and the principle of territoriality in Belgium.
It mainly concerns people who refuse to fit in with the Dutch-speaking character of the region, and who, in fact, turn failure to teach another language - in this case Dutch - into a political point of debate.
Since the report does not propose any measures to prevent groups of relatively recent newcomers to the region from using the Treaty to their advantage in order to cancel out a linguistic balance that has been achieved with great difficulty, the representatives of the Vlaams Blok will be voting against it.
.
(ES) It is my pleasure to explain why I voted for the Ebner report, given the far-reaching significance of promoting, respecting and also, where necessary, protecting the languages which enrich the European Union's cultural and linguistic heritage and which ought to bring to life the motto of the draft Constitution for Europe, 'United in diversity'.
Moreover, those languages are the central nucleus of the linguistic and cultural rights recognised by that draft Constitution and also by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.
With that in mind, I want to draw attention in particular to the need to add the official languages of the Member States to the list of official languages of the Union.
An example from within the Spanish state is Catalan, a language spoken in an area containing ten million inhabitants, and recognised by Parliament, in the Reding report, as deserving special treatment given its importance and standing at the heart of the European Union.
It is a sad fact that successive Spanish Governments have failed to champion the official languages recognised by the relevant Statutes of Autonomy, earmarking for development the principles and rights of the Spanish Constitution itself.
For that reason, it is very important that it should be the European Union that recognises and protects these languages, over and above the positions of governments.
(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
. (NL) The recognition of language diversity within the EU is no folklore.
There are currently 40 million EU citizens who speak a language other than the official national language, and next year they will total 46 million.
For the children and grandchildren of migrants, the language of the environment will become their first spoken language.
This does not apply to stateless peoples or to people who live in pockets of society on the other side of the state border that separates them from those who speak the same language.
Within Europe, there has been a long-term battle for education, administration and work in the citizens' own national language.
People without this opportunity end up in the position of second-class citizens.
The first-class citizens are those who speak the prevailing language at home or who have completely adapted to it.
Within the EU, a stark contrast is starting to emerge between peoples who now have their own Member State and peoples who are treated as minorities within states that predominantly speak a different language.
The language of this latter group is still not being recognised within the EU, unless it happens to be the same of that of the neighbouring country.
For example, the ten million Catalan-speakers will continue to wonder why their language counts for less than the much smaller languages of the Danes, Finns, Baltic peoples and Slovenians.
We will soon face major conflicts unless a solution is found in good time.
.
(PT) I voted against this report, not because I consider less widely-spoken European regional languages to be undeserving of respect, protection and dissemination, but because I feel that the rapporteur's approach to this question gives impetus to separatist tendencies within the Member States.
This will bring about an intensification of political and territorial disputes inherited from nineteenth- and twentieth-century conflicts and the territorial agreements which always followed them.
The tone of the debate on this report provides conclusive proof of what I have just said.
Its prevailing characteristics have been an inability to understand much of what was said, and the clear and conspicuous use of minority and regional languages as an offensive weapon in a brazen quest for vengeance on the part of many national minorities.
Some of these minorities are, notoriously, involved in worrying secessionist or independence movements, some of which have no qualms about resorting to extremist violence and brutality.
I do not believe that the European Union should be allowed to meddle in the structure and internal affairs of its Member States, much less intervene, even indirectly, in their political and institutional balance of power.
I recognise the need to preserve Europe's cultural and linguistic diversity, but I feel that pushing for the establishment of yet another European agency to that end is a signal that ?

. (FR) We can subscribe to some of the joint resolution's exhortations and agree to collaboration between countries faced with disasters, in particular to help countries such as Portugal.
The text as a whole, however, only hides the Member States' responsibility in their incapability of dealing with the repercussions of the heatwave and the forest fires.
Obviously the heatwave itself was not the responsibility of the Member States; nor, generally speaking, were the fires.
Why though, were there not enough staff in old people's homes and in hospitals to deal with the consequences of the heat wave on elderly people?
Why were there not enough firemen, and not enough equipment, to fight the forest fires?
It is because all Member States, even the richest ones, have for years been cutting back the budgets for essential public services.
They are reducing funds allocated to them; they are not taking on staff in sufficient numbers.
Even at normal times, the emergency services at hospitals and the fire-fighting services are at their limits and can meet their obligations only by subjecting their personnel to intolerable working conditions.
In such conditions, what value can be attached to promises - in any case extremely vague ones - that it will not happen again?
(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure).
. (FR) Leaving behind the media stir, there are two issues to which this summer's heatwave in Europe should open the eyes of decision-makers.
We are responsible for the disruption of the climate and for the dangerous world that we are going to bequeath to our children.
For some things, it is already too late.
For others, courageous decisions have to be taken very quickly, even if they are not popular.
The thousands of deaths, often of elderly and sometimes unknown people, reminds us that it is not enough to 'prolong life' but that we need to give the means to live, whatever the situation, the handicap, health and age.
Our society is far from this and worse, it is getting further away from it. (Just look at the French Government's decisions to lower taxes).
.
(DE) In July and August, extremes of heat, drought and forest fires inflicted great suffering on European citizens.
The forest fires, in particular, caused severe damage; human lives were lost, and the destruction of flora and fauna is harming the ecosystem.
The rebuilding of the homes, factories and infrastructure that have been destroyed in the affected areas will take years, and people will not be able to accomplish it on their own.
Dealing with the damage will require the creation of a whole network of relief agencies, and the people affected are in urgent need of solidarity, from the European Community in particular.
I therefore welcome the allocation of aid totalling EUR 31.6 million for the people severely affected as being the EU's first significant response, but we should assume even now that financial support will need to be improved - to what extent, it goes without saying, will be able to be determined only after the full extent of the damage has been precisely ascertained.
It is, at the same time, indispensable that we ensure that it is possible to get the long-term help needed to rebuild the social and economic fabric started promptly and without bureaucracy.
Also, for the sake of protecting the forests in future, steps must be taken to improve meteorological forecasts, thus making it possible to minimise the risks associated with adverse weather conditions.
(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
. (FR) We have not voted in favour of this joint resolution on the heatwave for the simple and good reason that it does not grasp the social, health and environmental measure of the disaster.
The heatwave is not fate and its gruesome repercussions were not unavoidable.
This climatic accident is primarily the result of the greenhouse effect caused by global warming generated by human activity.
Other choices are, however, possible, notably to oblige the industrial powers to respect the Kyoto protocol.
The free-marketeers' choices in terms of energy and transport policies are harmful and criminal.
When will there be a resolution for renewable energies so as to leave behind fossil fuels and nuclear energy?
When will there be a resolution to prioritise rail and piggyback transport, and moreover, one for other choices relating to national and regional development?
Finally, if we continue to reduce public deficit and dismantle public services to abide by the dogma of the Stability and Growth Pact, we will close down social services and hospitals.
If we continue to cast elderly people into precarious situations and poverty by revising retirement schemes and systems of allowances, then we will make them even more vulnerable and we will destroy the social security systems.
This policy has killed more than 14 000 people in Europe.
We need to make different choices for our society.
.
(PT) The final text of the resolution goes a long way towards meeting the expectations of the Portuguese people and provides, at last, a response that is in line with the scale of the disaster that struck Portugal in the form of a devastating series of forest fires at the end of July and August.
I voted for all the proposed amendments to the motion for a compromise resolution and am delighted that they were all approved, significantly improving the high standard of work achieved previously by the representatives of the groups.
Portugal's justifiable request for an increase in the size of its grant from the Solidarity Fund has received a strong vote of confidence here today.
A complementary move is now afoot to reorganise some Structural Funds and Community programmes with a view to dealing with the effects of the disaster; that move has also been given a boost.
At the same time, moreover, the second reading of the draft Forest Focus regulation, which will soon reach this Chamber, has gained considerable impetus.
This is because renewed sanction has been given to the demands already made by the European Parliament for the forest fire prevention programme, as it functioned until the end of 2002, to be properly reviewed.
. (ES) It is heartening to see the Commission undertake to use the Solidarity Fund to help in the case of forest fires.
We are still, however, sending contradictory messages.
We in the European institutions contradict ourselves when we declare, as Mr Barnier did yesterday, that our priority is prevention, and then, conversely, reduce Forest Focus allocations or delay too long in pushing ahead with vital prevention initiatives such as the European Civil Protection Agency.
We heard yesterday that 95% of forest fires are caused by negligence and the actions of speculators.
Is it not also negligent of European governments not to consider the consequences of climate change in terms of desertification and loss of biodiversity in our countries?
All these contradictions make it intolerable that there were surplus credits for the period 1992-2002 which were not spent on preventing fires.
Further, it is even more intolerable that the Commission is seeking to push ahead with its plans for Forest Focus.
Over the last two years, we have lost a regulation specifically geared towards fighting fires; we have lost EUR 5 million, for which no one can account, in the rural development fund; and we may lose even more budget allocations.
These funds will prove vital if the loss of hectare after hectare of forest is not to continue.
.
(PT) The main priorities of the programme for rebuilding infrastructure and regenerating the affected areas should be replanting and reforestation, to be financed by the Structural Funds, the European Agriculture Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF) and the Cohesion Fund.
Fire prevention in southern European countries should be encouraged through binding measures to which the governments of the Member States must strictly adhere.
It should not be left at the mercy of purely economic policies such as those in evidence during the disaster we have just witnessed.
There can be absolutely no doubt that Member States' national, regional and local land-use plans should make provisions for forestry reserves, scheduling initiatives for protecting indigenous species, preventive schemes and natural reforestation schemes, in the interests of safeguarding the character and quality of life of communities in a given area.
I have voted against.
And why?
Because we are barking up the wrong tree with these resolutions.
I would put the question here whether we are not at risk of slipping into totalitarian thinking with the selective condemnation of the Cuban situation, while other countries that are allegedly friendly to us have maintained similar practices, more systematically, and for much longer.
This means that even the European Union is turning into a totalitarian regime that is selective in who it holds accountable and prosecutes.
To what extent has Cuba as a country and the Cuban population over the past 40 years had a reasonable chance of developing its own policy?
It is hypocritical to point the finger only at Cuba.
Instead, what is needed here is understanding and cooperation based on mutual respect.
My thoughts, therefore, also go to Guantanamo, to what is going on there, to all the lies and manipulations that are being disseminated.
Lies are being told, people are even paying other people to lie, and I think that this should stop.
I object to this behaviour.
Mr President, I have voted against the resolution on Cuba, not because I disagree with what is said in it about the situation in Cuba, but because I disagree with what is not said.
I feel that it is intellectually and politically unjustifiable to assess Cuba's position without considering the unremitting aggression instigated by the United States and endured by the island for the last 40 years.
That aggression has been made manifest in all kinds of acts, including terrorist acts, which have been condemned by the international community.
This policy of aggression has intensified recently, giving rise to justifiable concerns on the part of the Cuban authorities, especially now that pre-emptive war has risen to the status of a White House doctrine and the invasion of Iraq has taken place.
The threat of virtual war, endured by Cuba for so many years, has thus grown into the threat of real war.
We might criticise some of the reactions to this threat ? we have done so ? but that does not mean we should not try to understand them.
The Cubans are convinced of two things, and I agree with them: the first is that the European Union treats Cuba differently from any other country in the same economic circumstances as Cuba, and even from any other country with a similar regime to Cuba.
The Cubans are also convinced, as I am, that this discriminatory policy is not a matter of coincidence. Rather, it is encouraged by the United States.
I believe it is essential to rethink our policy towards Cuba, with the immediate aim of regaining credibility and trust among all the Cubans with whom we have dealings.
That does not mean we should hide our worries, our criticisms and our hopes of seeing the Cuban people progress.
It does, however, mean that we should express those thoughts with the same respect, independence and coherence we show other countries, from Israel to Morocco, Russia to Latvia, Argentina to Guatemala, and even from China to the United States.
Only if the European Union restores trust and credibility, shows understanding and solidarity, will it have the necessary influence to help things get better in and with Cuba.
Resolutions like this one do nothing to help us in that task of restoring credibility and trust, either in Cuba itself or in the rest of the developing world, for which Cuba is still an important point of reference.
The debate on Cuba demonstrated that the objective of the ?U is identical to that of the USA: to use various means, to use economic aid and diplomatic relations as a lever in order to bring about a change in the system 'peaceably', methodically, to impose the market economy and to overturn socialism.
It became clear that what the selectively over-sensitive Euro-unifying hypocrites cannot forgive socialist Cuba is not the so-called authoritarianism of the socialist regime or any weaknesses in it, but the fact that Cuba, despite the open war and the forty-year criminal embargo by the imperialists, is maintaining and continuing to improve the standard of living and education of its people, which is the highest in the whole of Latin America, that socialist Cuba and Fidel Castro are a beam of light, a source of fighting inspiration to the peoples in the area and mankind as a whole.
That is why, while they turn a blind eye and acquiesce to the daily executions and the thousands of political prisoners, including Cubans, in the USA, Israel and elsewhere, while they support dismal dictatorships and genocide, they shed crocodile tears about the fate of the paid agents of the imperialists in Cuba.
They cannot forgive the determination of the Cuban people, as expressed on a daily basis with their fighting unity, to defend their socialist homeland to the last.
We stand at their side unhesitatingly and express our admiration and our gratitude to them.
. (FR) We obviously denounce the heavy sentencing and the attacks on freedoms in Cuba, without forgetting, however, the immense responsibility of the US, with its economic embargo, its political pressures, and its military threat, the objective of which is not to ensure more independence for the Cuban people, but to strangle this small country which has dared to escape from its direct hold.
The majority of Members may well have voted for this resolution against the arrests in Cuba, but how many of them remain silent when the great power that they represent supports, finances and arms authoritarian regimes or dictators, in particular those in former colonies, that is to say in its spheres of economic influence now?
Being selective, the virtuous indignation against these attacks on freedoms in Cuba does not merit the slightest credit.
They should start by clearing up their own back yards!
We, though, denounce our own state, France, which, whilst claiming to be a country of human rights, keeps troops in several African countries and defends, with weapons if necessary, as in the Ivory Coast at present, authoritarian regimes that have infinitely less legitimacy towards their own people than the Cuban regime towards its people.
We had no part to play in this masquerade.
.
(PT) The political and social situation in Cuba is hard to understand without a sufficiently broad sociocultural or historical perspective.
Today's Cuban 'socialism' cannot be exported beyond the island's shores.
The Cuban threat, moreover, may have been very real in the 1960s, when at one point Soviet missiles were trained on Cuba's powerful neighbour, but it is now no more than a fiction, a pretext justifying a political confrontation.
That confrontation is at its most bitter between Cubans living in Cuba, who defend Castro's regime, and Cuban exiles in the United States, who exert considerable sway over the Bush Administration.
An EU presence in Cuba is indispensable for monitoring how the Cuban political regime really operates, and to what extent it is hampered by a commercial blockade which has tragic effects on the people while, in some ways, supporting and sustaining the dictatorship.
Even now, after the Cuban dictator took advantage of 26 July to blast European policy, it cannot be said that every door has been closed or every possibility exhausted.
The stance adopted in Parliament by Commissioner Nielson on behalf of the Commission is, therefore, justified.
Since I am in agreement with the resolution's main points but feel it does not go far enough, I abstained from voting on it.
.
(PT) This resolution is one of a range of initiatives responding to the recent escalation in the campaign of interference and aggression conducted against Cuba by the USA over the last 40 years.
The actions of the new US representative in Havana, James Cason, stand out within this process.
They openly violate Cuban sovereignty through their support and funding of 'members of the opposition'.
Their aim is to destabilise Cuban institutions and even propitiate conditions which could act as a pretext for a military attack on Cuba.
The resolution does not say a single word about the terrorist acts and kidnappings which have been carried out as James Cason has continued with his exploits in Cuba.
These represent a qualitative change in the process of intervention.
The resolution does not condemn the US blockade of Cuba because it is illegitimate, illegal under international law and has serious consequences for the economy and quality of life of the people of Cuba.
Rather, it condemns the blockade because it 'is not a constructive approach to promoting change or reform of the Cuban regime'.
The measures adopted by the EU represent a supine acceptance of the Bush Administration's policy.
'Cooperation' should not be used as a means of interference.
On the contrary, the EU should adopt and develop a mutually advantageous cooperation policy, one which respects Cuban sovereignty and independence.
. (NL) In 1955, I saw for myself the abject poverty and inequality in South America.
This turned me into a supporter of Fidel Castro even before he took over state power at the end of 1958.
I still think that the alternative society that has been created since then in Cuba, which has managed to assert itself surprisingly well in the face of American attempts to starve and destroy this alternative, is valuable.
It is neither money nor economic power play the lead in that country, but solidarity and the equality of all people.
This solidarity and equality cannot, however, justify the long-term prison sentences and death penalties that are meted out to silence those who, in the eyes of the regime's supporters, do not display solidarity or who threaten equality.
Even if the present Cuba were some kind of paradise, which it is not, paradise cannot be defended in that way.
Such violations of human rights do not convince anyone, but only lead to bitterness among those who they wish to eliminate.
They are the wrong answer to the undermining campaign organised from within the USA.
Serious violations of human rights cannot be condoned, not even if they are perpetrated by people who originally had similar political objectives.
I have already voted for condemnation during an earlier debate on urgent subjects.
It is a pity that Cuba should unnecessarily isolate itself from its friends in Europe.
. (FR) I abstained in the vote on the resolution on Cuba.
Whilst fully sharing the criticism directed at the current regime as regards its serious violations of human rights, I cannot join in singling out Cuba when things remain the same in dozens of other countries with comparable regimes.
It is high time that the Council, the Commission and the Parliament provide a human rights' policy that is rigorous and uniform, which does not take into consideration the size and geographical location of a country, nor the state of its relations with the European Union or the US.
.
(PT) I voted in favour of the joint resolution on Cuba.
I did so because the Cuban people still lacks the most basic civil, political and human rights, just when we thought we had seen the last of the ramifications of the fall of the Berlin Wall.
The European Parliament had to take a firm political stand against Fidel Castro's regime.
I wanted to contribute to that goal, because the Cuban people live under a dictatorship which has chosen to turn in on itself rather than open up, to imprison rather than set free.
If there is one people still asking to be set free in 2003, then, it is the Cuban people.
The dictator's latest pronouncements, in which he displayed the irresponsible attitude we have come to expect from him by spurning all European Union assistance, are thus all the more deplorable.
More importantly, I would like to conclude by recalling that the European Parliament awarded the Sakharov Prize to Oswaldo PayÃ¡ SardiÃ±as in 2002.
In doing so, it sent a political message to the Cuban regime: we in Europe were also watching to see how matters developed.
In 2003, the regime responded to that message by taking more political prisoners, by continuing to violate human rights and trample the rule of law under foot.
This resolution requests that Mr PayÃ¡ SardiÃ±as come to Europe and explain in person what is happening in Cuba.
The regime will not let him.
It is our duty not to abandon him.
.
(PT) I am delighted with the compromise resolution, which was approved unamended.
I found it particularly satisfying, moreover, to see what we are calling the 'Sakharov Initiative' finally ratified, and thus approved by an overwhelming majority in Parliament, in paragraph 2.
Under this initiative, it is proposed that we once again invite Oswaldo PayÃ¡, winner of the Sakharov Prize 2002, to Europe, and welcome him at the highest level.
This is a joint initiative by the European Parliament, the Commission, the Council and the Member States.
I am proud to have been responsible, together with other honourable Members, for launching this initiative in May.
Little by little, it attracted growing support in Parliament, with 205 individual signatures by July, until its eventual adoption and ratification in plenary.
I hope that the Council and the Commission will now follow it up properly.
Along with many of my fellow Members, I really believe that the great symbolic significance of the support eventually mobilised by this 'Sakharov Initiative', combined with its ratification, may result in a marked, decisive improvement in the situation in Cuba.
It may be just the catalyst for change that has been lacking.
Mr President, today's events during the vote on Mr van den Bos's report were very unfortunate.
It is a pity that the last President, his personal inflexibility or even his pride prevented Parliament from discovering the truth regarding the result of the vote on Amendment No 16.
We all realised that the margin was very narrow throughout the voting session so there were very good reasons for our request to be able to verify the result.
I am making a plea that there should be no repeat of any such situation ever again here.
It was a violation of our rights.
Mr President, for the first time I regret seeing you in your seat, as I would have liked what I have to say now to have been addressed to your predecessor.
I have, out of conviction, voted in favour of the van den Bos Report, but I will emphatically not endorse Amendment No 16.
I am also grateful to the rapporteur for showing magnanimity in helping the President out of a tight spot and finally giving ground, but there was no moving this particular horse.
The President's right to have the last word in certain matters is founded upon him, or the Vice-President in question, enjoying the confidence of this House.
I must say at this point, and to my great regret, that the Vice-President who previously occupied the chair no longer enjoys my confidence, as he abused the trust placed in him in accordance with the Rules of Procedure.
Mr President, I have voted in favour of the van den Bos report, but there are two things I would like to explain.
First of all, I would like to clarify that in the Gujarat massacre of March last year, many of the victims were also of Indian origin.
Furthermore, it is wrong to refer to the threat of increasing Hindu fundamentalism.
This gives a distorted view of the situation in India.
After all, that country is the only country in southern Asia that has opted in favour of a secular and pluralist state model.
A choice of this kind clearly demonstrates tolerance for the different population groups.
There are exceptions in every society, but this is no reason to generalise and brand the Indian society as a whole as fundamentalist.
India is an open, tolerant and pluralist society in which religious freedom forms part of the constitution.
It is on the basis of this argumentation that I have voted in favour of the van den Bos report.
Today, Mr President, we have voted on two reports on human rights.
Even though it is in fact the issue of human rights that leads me to sit in this House, I voted against both of them. The reason for this is the fact that the issue has, unfortunately, been misused for ideological reasons.
My criticism is primarily aimed at the way in which, with the van den Bos report, we have taken an unambiguous stand for religious freedom throughout the world, whilst at the same time treating the statement by Cardinal Ratzinger and the Catholic Church on same-sex partnerships as some sort of violation of human rights.
This just shows the ideological misuse of the issue of human rights.
European society is founded not only upon the inviolable dignity of the person, but also upon the inviolable dignity of marriage and the family, the defence of which is one of our tasks as politicians.
Future reports on human rights should protect marriage and the family, rather than calling them into question.
. (NL) The annual report on global human rights in 2002 and the European Union's human rights policy by Mr van den Bos (D'66) broaches so many topics that it is difficult to see the wood for the trees.
The rapporteur is getting under the EU Member States' feet with the suggestion that human rights policy should be dealt with at Community level.
The report should have confined itself much more to enforcing human rights clauses in association and cooperation agreements, and to assessing their effectiveness.
In this respect, the European institutions - the Council, the Commission and Parliament - should definitely search their own hearts.
The report is right to denounce increasing extremism and fundamentalism, but fails to separate these expressions of perverted religion from religion itself.
Anyone who does draw this distinction need not make a forced effort to keep religion out of political debate.
Moreover, it then becomes immediately clear that the ideologies of socialism and liberalism are also subjective philosophies.
Non-belief - not adhering to any faith - is also based on a choice of faith.
Democratic politics is therefore never impartial.
Finally, it is important to note that international human rights standards, however valuable they are, are not the ultimate standard against which human action will be judged.
After all, the basis of this law lies in the human person, as if man were autonomous and made the law for himself.
This subjectivity puts the universal claims of such law into perspective.
According to my political belief, objective and universal law are only based on the Ten Commandments given to mankind by God, the Creator of all life.
It is fortunate that a huge number of legal standards that apply in our European societies to this day are based on this.
It would be sensible simply to recognise this.
Only then can something positive be expected from an inter-religious or inter-cultural dialogue.
.
(PT) Although there are aspects of this report with which I agree, I feel I must draw attention to what I would describe as the appropriation of a report - on the situation of human rights in the world, of all things - as a tool of political coercion.
In it, countries listed as 'friends' are defended, while those listed as US or EU targets are criticised, thereby applying double standards.
I cannot understand why, for instance, the report makes no mention of Israel's invasion of Palestine, or the invasion of Iraq by the USA and its allies.
I therefore support the proposals for amendments tabled by my group, which condemn the following:
human rights violations carried out by Israel in pursuit of its policy of attacking and oppressing the Palestinian people through murder, imprisonment, destruction of housing and the building of an unacceptable and illegal wall designed to enforce the occupation and colonisation of Palestinian territory;
the concept of pre-emptive war, as well as any resort to war as a means of ending international conflicts;
the invasion of Iraq, instigated by the USA and involving EU Member States, in flagrant breach of international law and the United Nations Charter.
. (NL) Protection of human rights outside the EU ceases to be credible if, in a number of cases, the human rights situation in the EU itself is in poor shape, if a European sense of superiority underlies everything or if others are judged by double standards.
Europe should look at America to see how things are not done.
For years, American human rights policy was geared to punishing countries that strayed off course and to rewarding governments in countries where America had military and economic interests.
In the former case, minor human rights violations used to be put under the microscope while in the latter, major violations were hushed up, denied or glossed over as much as possible.
In the developing world, human rights were therefore put on an equal footing with the ability to follow the 'American way of life', particularly the existence of free competition, to which the involvement of all in democratic government, equality and solidarity were made entirely subordinate.
Oppressive dictatorships were backed for fear of mass rebellion.
Although the European states have not gone to such extremes in most cases, its current relations with the dictatorships in China and Iran are very clearly based on its own self-interest.
For the governments in Russia, Turkey and Israel, it will become easier to oppress Chechens, Kurds and Palestinians when the EU wants to be on good terms with them.
This report is a valuable contribution to change, but will anything actually happen?
This year too, I notice that this marathon report on human rights in the world does not reach any of the objectives that it should have set itself.
Who does not see that the moral lessons addressed to one or another country, the abusive incriminations, the hazardous implications, constitute an inadmissible interference, repeated many times, in the home affairs of the country concerned and, as a result, unlikely to change things for the better?
Furthermore, in whose name does this Parliament judge the diplomacy of Member States in denouncing those who 'support undemocratic regimes in various parts of the world insofar as they serve those Member States' own national, economic, military (?) interests'?
Finally, as the wild remarks about the fight against international terrorism show, a fight stigmatised in this report because it 'has threatened human rights protection significantly', naive, moralizing optimism always prevails over objective realism.
Now if there is any area in which naive idealism often turns out to be disastrous, it is in foreign policy.
It is high time that Europe admits this geopolitical feature by quickly ceasing its futile inquisitorial campaigns.
.
(SV) The Moderate delegation in the European Parliament believes it to be incredibly important that Parliament produce a report each year on the extent to which the EU Member States are complying with human rights.
Human rights are the most important foundation stone for European cooperation.
Obviously, we must make just as tough demands upon our own countries as upon the candidate countries and other countries outside the EU.
It is unfortunate, however, that the report does not only focus upon fundamental rights but also expresses certain other political objectives.
Irrespective of whether or not one shares these political visions, this method is in danger of devaluing the significance of fundamental rights.
That is the reason why we cannot vote in favour of the report in its entirety.
. (FR) The report by Mr FodÃ© Sylla on the fundamental rights situation in the Union, full of extreme proposals, gives an idea of what threatens to happen if the Union were to gain greater competence in this area, which is what the Convention has proposed.
It is enough to list the proposals relating to immigration: expanding the right to asylum, broader legal immigration channels; relaxing naturalisation procedures, expanding the concept of European citizenship to non-EU legal immigrants, granting them the right to vote in local and European elections, and it goes on.
These proposals are accompanied by harsh and peremptory judgments on this or that named European country, which is enjoined to redeem itself by making amends.
In addition, France was asked to ratify the Charter on Regional and Minority Languages that the previous socialist government signed.
I hope that they will never do it.
We can see that if the Charter on Fundamental Rights were to become obligatory then the Union would have, thanks to this Charter and to Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union, the right to impose real enforcement of rights, oriented, or rather disoriented - towards destroying our societies.
. (FR) What the European authorities pompously call fundamental rights is, at best, but the vaguest of notions, the content of which boils down to precious little for workers and the most vulnerable inhabitants of Europe.
Apart from a few rare exceptions, the report does not show any steps forward, but instead steps backwards in this area due, more often than not, to the required policies applied by the States that want to make us believe that they are guaranteeing real rights for the people of Europe.
Those who are denied the most basic of individual, economic, social or political rights by this society are firstly the minorities and those that it is most hard on are women, children, disabled people, the elderly, homosexuals, asylum seekers, immigrants, members of national minorities etc. For millions of workers, the prospects are unemployment, inadequate wages, arbitrary employers, exploitation, and death in the workplace.
For them, where are the fundamental rights on which the European Union is holding forth?
Our vote in favour of the report was motivated by the accuracy of the critical description of the actual state of human rights in Europe, but this does not mean that we share the illusions of its author regarding the capacity of the European Institutions to fundamentally change things.
.
(IT) The serious lack of competition rules regulating conflicts of interest and the concentration of monopolies to protect the rule of law and citizens' freedoms is due to over 50 years of cronyism and over 30 years of complete monopoly by RAI-TV, which has gradually been replaced by a duopoly over the last 15 years.
Even in this last period, this has been the choice of the left alliance, at least as much as the right.
In fact, the world of audiovisual information and its immense power to influence the situation in Italy are dominated by groups of influential journalists, generally centre-left but also far left, who constitute a genuine political force that has dominated RAI-TV to date and is present at the highest level in Mediaset.
. (PT) The European Parliament's annual report on the situation as regards fundamental rights in the EU is an important tool for understanding how fundamental rights are being respected and protected in Europe as a whole and within each of the Member States.
We need a rigorous and effective assessment of the quality of that protection, enabling a clear overview of the current situation as regards fundamental rights.
Then we will be able to take decisions in this field.
I am sorry to say that this year's report does not fulfil these requirements.
The first draft of the report might have met with a broad consensus, but this final version is totally unacceptable.
The rapporteur has opted to draw up a sort of shopping list in which he criticises a selection of EU Member States at the same time as suggesting unrealistic and irrelevant proposals.
The following proposals are completely unacceptable:
granting the right of asylum to victims of persecution by non-government agents;
granting access to education to all children present in a given country, even if they are there illegally;
passing European legislation on homosexual marriage;
allowing third-country nationals to vote in local elections and elections to the European Parliament.
. (FR) The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats was obliged not to vote in favour of this text despite the importance that our group attaches to the respect and protection of fundamental rights.
All of the Charter, yet nothing but the Charter.
Once again this principle, approved by the Parliament, has not been respected.
From the shopping list to the militancy, as well as personal opinions being put forward, this report is a catalogue of ideological yet irrational wishes.
Many of the points raised concern neither fundamental rights in general nor those at the heart of the European Union.
The European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats does not agree with the alleged progress in certain areas (notably regarding the right to asylum) nor the tendency to extrapolate the letter of the Charter on certain issues relating to discrimination.
Furthermore, quoting countries only serves to weigh down the text and to awaken pointless nationalist reactions.
Has the Charter, as it is written, been respected during the course of the year in the territory of the EU?
That is the subject of the report that Parliament should produce, and ensure that it is given a broad political basis.
.
(IT) Only the Radical Party has, since the beginning of the 1960s, placed the fight against abuse of truth and information, at every legal and political level of large-scale non-violent campaigns and successful referendum initiatives.
Silvio Berlusconi and his enterprises are certainly responsible for choosing, since the 1990s, to turn his media empire of humble origins into an instrument not unlike RAI TV to boost his declining political career.
His attempt only succeeded in part and his greatest media representatives 'moderate' and support large demonstrations, both electoral and non-electoral, of his political enemies.
This is typical of the Italian situation, of this 'Italian case'.
Silvio Berlusconi is someone who, if anything, continues rather than opposing or reforming, as he promised to do in his electoral campaign.
As a result, the Radical Members abstained in the vote that 'deplores...a situation is continuing in which media power is concentrated in the hands of the Prime Minister' of the Italian Republic.
I am afraid that we may well now be facing savage power struggles which could go 'to the death', struggles within systems which are not only political but economic and, quite literally, criminal too.
. I welcome the Sylla Report on fundamental rights and in particular its conclusions about the treatment of asylum-seekers and their children.
The report is correct to be critical of the UK's record on this and my knowledge of the Dungavel detention centre in my constituency of Scotland illustrates the UK Government's failures.
The UK Government is failing to protect the rights of asylum-seekers' children by holding them for prolonged periods in the Dungavel centre and the devolved Scottish Government, which is responsible for the provision of education in Scotland, has failed to ensure that they are given access to mainstream education while resident in our country.
The Scottish people have been appalled to learn about the long-term detention and lack of educational facilities for families like Yurdigal Ay and her children who were deported to Germany earlier this summer having spent a year at Dungavel.
The UK Government's record on asylum-seekers and their children at Dungavel is a disgrace and I trust that the Sylla report will be heeded by UK ministers and that steps are taken to ensure that the fundamental rights of refugees at Dungavel and throughout the UK are not infringed.
.
(EL) The European PASOK group decided to vote against the entire motion, considering that the positions on the ban on women entering Mount Athos, conscientious objectors and the right of Muslims to mosques and cemeteries are unjust, unacceptable and, at the very least, demonstrate ignorance for the following reasons:
1.
Mount Athos enjoys special status, which was secured in Joint Declaration No 4 on Mount Athos in Greece's Accession Act to the EEC.
2.
The Annex to the Final Deed of the Treaty of Amsterdam contains a declaration recalling the Joint Declaration on Mount Athos attached to the Final Deed of the Accession Act of Greece to the European Communities.
3.
Greek legislation on proselytism was found to be in compliance with the European Convention on Human Rights by the European Court of Human Rights.
As far as Muslim mosques are concerned, it is a known fact that there are currently 350 mosques and 250 Muslim cemeteries, while the procedure to found an Islamic centre and mosques in Paiania in Attica is advancing.
4.
Article 18 of law 2936/2001 makes provision for a reduction in unarmed or civilian service for recognised conscientious objectors, who will complete reduced armed service.
.
(EL) 11 September provided an opportunity to speed up measures to apply the most anti-grass roots choices of the monopolies.
It was followed by a sweeping charge against human rights and personal freedoms in the ?U. Workers' rights and the right to a free state education and health service were cut back even further.
The standard of living of the working classes has fallen.
A typical example is that over fourteen thousand people died from the heatwave in the France of ? respect for human rights.
The reactionary legal arsenal is being reinforced with new provisions.
Political parties, such as the Communist Party, are being prevented from operating freely and unimpeded, especially in the countries under enlargement.
Violation of the freedom of expression is being accompanied by violation of the right of assembly with the ban on and the prevention of the participation of citizens and the bloody suppression of strikes and demonstrations.
In the name of the fight against terrorism, electronic records on citizens under the Schengen system prevail, personal data are being channelled to the USA, mass 'repatriation' of immigrants is multiplying.
Europe has appointed itself as the sheriff of the USA, especially after the signing of the agreement on cooperation in criminal matters and extraditions to the USA, where there is capital punishment and Guantanamo.
This report however, will not go unanswered.
The workers are opposed to this policy and are fighting to overturn it and for real respect for human rights.
.
(NL) It is easy to reach agreement across the political spectrum when it comes to denouncing terrorism and trafficking in human beings.
It is somewhat less easy when criticism is aimed at obsolete and over-full prisons, power concentrations in the media, the infringement of privacy and discrimination against homosexuals, immigrants or people with a disability.
Major differences of opinion, however, remain about the ambition to ban political groupings on account of 'extremism' or 'separatism'.
In the future Member State of Latvia, people who had failed to resign their membership of the then governing Communist Party eight months prior to independence were denied any political rights.
In the Basque country in Spain, a newspaper and a popular political party are banned, and the results of elections are heavily doctored because the excluded political grouping cannot in any way put forward candidates.
In Turkey, a potential future Member State, it is a matter of course that organisations and publications are banned, opponents end up in prison and regions are destroyed in order to be able to control them more efficiently.
We notice attempts are being made everywhere to adapt the electoral systems in such a way that there is only room left for the two largest political groupings, to the more or less total exclusion of all others from the work of parliaments.
It is unwise to leave to their own devices large groups of people who do not have any prospects, are outside parliamentarian democracy, and who become susceptible to violent alternatives.
. The British Labour Members have voted in favour of the Sylla report, which serves a valuable purpose.
All Member States must be strong and confident enough to accept criticism.
This does not automatically mean that every criticism should be accepted as valid.
We reject the rapporteur's assertion that the detention powers in the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 are being used improperly.
Where we are dealing with potential threats to national security exceptional measures are sometimes necessary.
Tough safeguards ensure that these detention powers are not abused.
The decision to detain individuals is made on the basis of detailed and compelling evidence.
Only 15 Foreign Nationals have so far been detained under this Act.
Detainees are free to leave the UK at any time to return to their country of origin, and have a right of appeal against the decision.
The UK Government agrees that the detention of the children of asylum seekers should be avoided and is seeking workable solutions to prevent this situation.
As regards the right to a fair trial, the vast majority of decided ECHR cases concern events occurring prior to the enactment of the Human Rights Act.
Individuals are now able to enforce their ECHR rights directly in UK courts.

. (FR) Among the numerous annual reports adopted by the Parliament, there are many that are of genuine interest.
This is not, however, the case with this infamous report on fundamental rights in the Union, which, far from serving the European cause, emphasises the worst in community federalism.
The reasoning behind such a report is in itself rather strange since, for the Parliament, it consists in denouncing alleged attacks on fundamental rights, attacks supposedly committed by the Member States of the European Union.
In fact, it would hardly be an exaggeration to say that anyone consulting this indigestible document would inevitably have the impression that the European Union, made up of what are as good as banana republics, has become an area of lawlessness.
Overcrowding in prisons, attacks on the freedom of conscience, discrimination against minorities, (economic) control of the media, an increase in the number of racist acts, restrictive migratory policies, etc.: no Member State is spared and, in fact, it is the whole of the European Union that appears to be an area where freedoms are killed off.
Clearly, all this is but fantasy.
It remains, nonetheless, that, controlled by powerful lobbies agitating for human rights; the Parliament would make a fool of itself by adopting this report.
.
(PT) The tone of my speech in yesterday's plenary did not leave much room for doubt that I would vote against this report today.
Indeed, apart from anything else, the ideological slant of the Sylla report makes it unbalanced and partial in terms of fundamental rights.
Notwithstanding, there was one important argument which I could not put forward yesterday due to the scant speaking time available to me.
It relates to the fact that the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which the rapporteur claimed was the central principle of his report, is aimed at the institutions and agencies of the Union, with due regard for the principle of subsidiarity, and also at the Member States.
The charter only applies to the latter however, when they are implementing Union law, as Article 51 makes clear.
We would therefore have liked - though this was not the approach favoured by the rapporteur - to see this report aimed directly and primarily at the institutions and agencies of the Union.
In other words, we wanted an appraisal of those actions of the Council, the Commission and Parliament itself which had an impact on fundamental rights in the EU, and which decided or implemented policies affecting those rights.
As we have seen, that was not what transpired.
.
(PT) The rapporteur steered a straight course towards this one-sided and partisan assessment of the situation as regards human rights, choosing to ignore the common interest and the institutional assessment which should guide work in this area.
He has fostered an alliance of isolated, minority claims, on the pretext, as convenient as it is vague, of combating 'discrimination'.
The multifarious libels with which he besmirches the Member States lack any kind of foundation in truth, and are at one with the over-inflated verbiage spouted by organisations of doubtful credibility, engaged in the messianic task of replacing the current social model with a different one.
We are looking at a castle which has been razed in the interests of the widespread obsession with elevating political correctness to the status of a science.
This annual report has been hijacked in order to trumpet causes which unite no social consensus, which contradict and assail eternal principles and values with deep roots in Western civilisation.
That means that its presentation and the debate on it have become an exercise in propaganda, a mere glossing and recapitulation ad nauseam of a sort of template of irresponsible ideas, devoid of the dignity and reflection demanded by the seriousness of this subject.
This is a deplorable annual ritual which the European Parliament will have to abandon some day if it wants to retain a minimum level of integrity and responsibility.
I could do nothing other than vote against this report.
. (FR) This explanation of vote relates to Article 15, referring to the question of decriminalising active euthanasia.
Given that the annual report on fundamental rights in the EU plays a part in monitoring adherence to the Charter, the Group of the Party of European Socialists will vote against this article.
It follows that there is no objective reason why the question of decriminalising active euthanasia should appear in this report.
.
(IT) On behalf of the Radical Members, I would like to justify our abstention in the vote that 'deplores...a situation is continuing in which media power is concentrated in the hands of the Prime Minister' of the Italian Republic.
During an electoral meeting on 4 April 1996 at the Mediaset headquarters in Cologno Monzese, Berlusconi's holding, Mediaset, was, amongst other things, defined as one of the country's major companies ... a major communications business ... an Italian asset ... the heritage of a country's work and skills.
These were not definitions given by Silvio Berslusconi but by Massimo D'Alema, post-communist leader of the then PDS, now the DS, who would be elected less than a year later - by agreement with Silvio Berlusconi and the whole of the centre right - as President of the two chambers - an attempt at a Convention - and immediately after as Prime Minister, in place of Romano Prodi.
It is a great mistake and an act of great populism, prejudice and dishonesty to see the concentration of media power owned by Silvio Berlusconi as giving him such a powerful, vice-like hold over the world of information and democracy itself in Italy.
Mr President, I voted against Amendment No 5 to the Lannoye report because of assurances given by the Commission that it was not factually correct and that it had not asked developing countries for binding commitments in relation to privatising their water industry.
Developing countries should be free - as we are - to choose whether or not they have privatised or public utilities to provide their water services.
I hope the Commission is making sure that remains the case and is not asking for such binding commitments.
. (FR) The issue of water services will not be raised at the WTO meeting in Cancun.
This is unfortunate.
The Lannoye report dissects the Commission proposal, which, in particular, aims to create a European Water Fund for ACP countries.
These countries, we must remember, are key commercial partners.
They are equally affected by a cruel lack of access to drinking water and purification services.
Now, access to water is a right, as is the ability of the inhabitants of the rural areas of our Member States to have access to basic public services such as post offices, education and clinics.
This is why access to water should remain a public service and not be managed on a strictly commercial basis.
The 1980s saw the failure of IMF and World Bank subsidies policies.
Only the countries that privatised their water and electricity distribution networks benefited from aid from international institutions.
The Commission is preparing to make the same management mistake with the European Water Fund.
I support the Lannoye report in its critical diagnosis of the Commission's programme.
. (FR) I voted in favour of the Lannoye report on water management in developing countries because it rightly emphasises the urgency of the problem: today, out of six billion people, 1.7 million do not have access to drinking water, and 30 000 die every day as a result.
The Johannesburg Conference fixed the objective of halving the number of people without access to drinking water by 2015, and it is imperative that Europe cooperates to realise this aim.
This is why we are particularly in favour of the establishment of a European Water Fund for the ACP countries in general and the African countries in particular.
Decisions on which projects are to be helped by this fund should be taken, not from above, but by the national authorities, jointly with the peoples concerned.
Priority should be given to a management model based on a public-private partnership, in which the public sector fixes the general framework for action of the private sector, as well as its objectives.
The Lannoye Report, however, remains suspicious of the action of private enterprises.
I believe the opposite, that privatising water management, even on the smallest scale, would allow more rational management if it is well utilised.
. (FR) In abstaining, we have finally refused to vote in favour of this report because of the adoption, at the time of the vote, of an amendment, Amendment No 15 from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, which is favourable towards the private interests of large water operators.
. (FR) The summer heatwave and the thousands of deaths it caused confirmed one thing in Europe and the developing countries, something of which the 30 000 people who die each day of illness linked to a lack of drinking water remind us: water is the most crucial problem threatening humanity.
Climate change will make this situation worse.
It is therefore urgently necessary that mass action plans are drawn up, targeted and financed.
Mr Lannoye and the Committee on Development and Cooperation have given us some minimal proposals, which we must quickly implement.
.
(PT) Access to water is essential for life, health, food, well-being and development.
Water should not therefore be considered simply as a good, but as a public asset.
It is particularly shocking that 1.7 million people have no access to drinking water, causing 30 000 deaths per day through related diseases.
While the shortage of drinking water in developing countries has worsened, however, the privatisation of water utilities continues apace, particularly as a result of the conditions for receiving loans imposed by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, and structural adjustment programmes which weaken public services and induce under-investment in this sector.
The liberalisation or privatisation of water utilities has helped deprive poor communities of access to water and has driven prices up.
A serious assessment of the socio-economic and environmental effects of liberalisation is therefore needed, as are guarantees that Articles VI and XXI of the General Agreement on Trade in Services will be revised, in order to protect the right of each developing country to decide freely on its method of water supply.
The establishment of a European Water Fund is a good initiative in principle, as long as it supports the water policy of the beneficiary countries by ensuring public ownership and management so that, as a result, everyone will have access to water, without discrimination.
. (FR) The draft resolution presented by Mr Lannoye is a very complete response to the scandal of the drinking water shortages experienced by hundreds of millions of people in developing countries.
It questions the responsibility of large international organisations that dismantled public services, leading to this situation.
It has, however, found a majority in this House by getting rid of some of the content of the resolution through amendments that refuse to point the finger and, therefore, beyond good feeling, has used its influence to push for a real improvement in the standard of living of those affected.
The adoption of Amendment No 15 which 'stresses that the key issue is not whether water provision is organised by a public or private entity but rather the specific obligations provided by the policy framework; considers that it is up to the public authorities in developing countries to define the legal framework for regulating the work of private operators', changes the essence of the report.
It is the commercialisation of this common good that is at the root of these inequalities of access, of the shortage and excessive cost in developed countries as in developing countries.
The adoption of this meant that I was obliged to abstain in the final vote.
.
(PT) More than 2.5 billion people in developing countries have no drinking water, and 3 million die every year from water-borne diseases such as typhoid fever, dysentery, cholera, hepatitis, malaria, trachoma, fluorosis, and Japanese encephalitis.
We must ensure that the water objectives of Monterrey and Johannesburg (a 50% reduction in the number of people without access to drinking water and sanitation by 2015) are implemented as soon as possible.
It is just as crucial, however, to encourage the EU water initiative launched at Johannesburg, costing EUR 700 million.
Finally, I welcome the proposal for the establishment of a European Water Fund to help the ACP states.
.
(EL) In principle we agree with the rapporteur's finding that drinking water should be a social resource, accessible to all, and not a commodity subject to speculation.
We disagree, however, with proposals that recognise a positive role in water management for the private sector, be it in the form of mixed management by the public and private sectors or with the state defining a legal and institutional framework within which private agencies operate in the water sector.
Our disagreement is based on the fact that, irrespective of intentions, legal and institutional frameworks and restrictive mechanisms, the private sector is being activated on the basis of the profit criterion, automatically converting a social resource into a commodity with all that implies, especially for poor nations.
We would stress that, as with the food problem, the problem of drinking water is primarily political and secondarily technocratic.
That is why radical social changes are needed in order to deal with it effectively.
The failings of the various programmes applied within the framework of the current system, which in certain cases have exacerbated rather than mitigated the problem, confirm our reading and anticipate the impasses and the exacerbation of the problem which will be caused by the application of the terms and conditions being set by the International Monetary Fund for funding similar activities in developing countries.
. (FR) Although access to water was recently declared a human right, the number of people in the world without drinking water today stands at 1.7 million, a figure whose increase has been uninterrupted in recent years.
We need to recognise the causes of the lack of drinking water and fight them: whether it be high productivity and intensive farming, economies directed towards growing crops for export, which often compromise the development of the local economy or the liberalisation of public services in the water sector, a condition often imposed by the World Bank or the IMF on countries in the South to benefit from loans.
The costs of water services have also become inaccessible for the poorest people.
To remedy these discrepancies, we want new patterns of production and consumption to be implemented, in the North as in the South, based on long-term water management.
We want to advance environmental farming and new irrigation systems.
In light of the tragedy that people have gone through and the totally insufficient responses given to date, the establishment of a European Water Fund for the ACP countries is a good initiative.
Access to drinking water and purification services needs to be determined by national authorities with the involvement, through associations and civil society movements, of those people affected.
.
(SV) Increased trade constitutes the developing countries' greatest opportunity bar none for improving their economic position in the long term, together with poor people's living conditions.
Aid to the developing countries ought therefore in the first place to be aimed at developing and improving such infrastructure as makes it easier for the developing countries to engage in trade.
The present report is permeated by a general scepticism about trade as a means of combating poverty and promoting economic development.
What guided us in our final vote on the report was, therefore, whether all the amendments tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, and designed to improve the report, were approved.
We are not ill disposed towards a code of conduct with ethical clauses for companies that invest in, or trade with, developing countries, but we believe that such a code of conduct should be laid down within the framework of the WTO's and the World Bank's work and not be restricted only to companies within the EU.
.
(PT) To quote the rapporteur, who is a member of my own political group, if we want fairer trade, contributing to sustainable development and to the fight against poverty, concrete measures must be introduced at the forthcoming WTO Ministerial Conference in Cancun to take account of developing countries' requirements as regards world trade.
The insufficient production capacity of developing countries and their continuing dependence on primary and low-value-added products must be combated, in order to ensure the diversification of production and technology transfers.
The problem of suffocating debts must be addressed, the aim being to cancel such debts.
Dumping in agricultural trade must be abolished, the principle of agricultural self-sufficiency promoted, development assistance increased up to the agreed 0.7% of GNP, and the right of access to medicines protected.
Just as important, however, is the need to safeguard public services, in particular by banning the liberalisation of such services.
It must be borne in mind that the liberalisation of world trade has led to a deepening of the divide between rich and poor countries, and a reduction in participation by the latter in world trade.
The injustices of world trade are the fruit of the development and global expansion of the capitalist system itself.
. (FR) The Morgantini report rejects the logic of the Commission Communication 'assisting developing countries in benefiting from international trade'.
Indeed, the Commission advocates the liberalisation of services, aid to the private sector and an increase in trade meant to help the development of less well-advanced countries.
We know now that these 'recipes' of a capitalist economic system daily increase the shocking gap between the revenue of rich countries and that of poor countries!
On the eve of the Cancun Summit, whose objective is to increase world trade, we support the proposals aiming to cancel out debt, to establish fair trade regulations, to remove from a commercial sphere a response to the needs of the people, to limit the incentives for rich countries to export farming production.
We have, therefore, voted in favour of this report, even though we believe that the WTO, the rich countries' instrument to dominate others, should not be democratised but removed.
. (PT) Given the indicators of developing countries' social and environmental unsustainability, the impartial Economist acknowledged a year ago that it would be impossible for living conditions in the southern hemisphere to improve unless the northern hemisphere relinquished a small part of its wealth.
If we want to be credible partners in the eyes of developing countries, therefore, and if we want to bridge the shocking gulf between living conditions in the two hemispheres, both the EU and the United States must, above and beyond attaining the Monterrey and Johannesburg objectives, take advantage of the next round of WTO negotiations, due to take place in Cancun, to move towards the abolition of trade barriers and the gradual removal of agricultural and energy subsidies.
