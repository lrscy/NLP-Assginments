There are many reasons why this situation has come about.
It can be explained, in part, simply by the fact that within the European institutions totally different directorates-general, committees and Councils were responsible for individual aspects, and of course they always looked at things from their own isolated point of view, which then led to quite different end results.
So up to now there has not been an integrated approach, an integrated view of the approximation of civil rights.
I think it is a very good thing that following the decisions taken at the Tampere Council, the Commission now intends, just like this House, to adopt an integrated approach in future.
This is a matter of urgent necessity, as the volume of cross-border trade is on the increase in Europe.
There are two key factors which explain this. The first is, of course, the introduction of the euro next year.
A second factor is the impact of modern technology, and I only have to mention electronic commerce.
If, in the future, you order goods or other commodities via electronic commerce, you will have no idea, or, at least, you frequently will not have, of where the company you are dealing with is based.
This is leading to an inevitable growth in cross-border trade.
That is why I believe that it is also necessary for us to develop more common definitions of offences and a broader common body of Community law.
The present electronic commerce directive, which we in this House supported, is not therefore, as we already know, an ideal solution.
As the country of origin principle applies here, whereas in the case of consumer rights law the country of destination principle applies, this can lead in practice to situations such as a district court judge in Cologne having to apply Irish law in parallel with German law.
I would not mind betting that this will lead to considerable problems when only trifling amounts are at stake and with bread-and-butter legal cases.
This demonstrates that we need to develop a broader common body of law in future.
My report now envisages, with the support of many expert groups who have been calling for this for a long time, that the Commission should continue its work by means of an action plan covering several years.
At the end of that process, and this is my belief at least, the result should be a common body of law within the European Union, for cross-border transactions at least, which is as extensive as possible.
With regard to transparency, I believe that this is necessary, not only for consumers, but also for businesspeople, and this also applies to legal certainty, legal practicality and the application of the law.
I therefore wish to ask the House to give its approval to the proposal emanating from the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs on this report regarding the approximation of the civil and commercial law of the Member States.
This is, as it were, the starting pistol for the Commission's work.
I know that the Council is currently considering this matter in parallel with ourselves, and that it is intended to deal with this subject at the Laeken Summit.
I believe that everyone in Europe has recognised that this issue is of a very high priority, and that progress needs to be made with this work.
In order to exert a little bit of pressure, I think that we should approve this action plan.
Mr President, this is a rather peculiar cooperation procedure between Parliament and the Commission, at an initial phase of the Commission' s work.
The communication presented to us by the Commission referred to a limited aspect of the harmonisation of private law, specifically contract law, and the report presented by Mr Lehne deals which a much wider scope, because it refers to the harmonisation of private law in general.
We, in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, considered that contract law was probably too narrow a scope and that it would not be sufficient to produce harmonisation of private law in general, which is necessary, as Mr Lehne pointed out, above all within the framework of the introduction of the euro and of the generalisation of European contracts.
The Commission' s communication is very broad, given the aspects it deals with and the questions it poses.
We, in Parliament, clearly cannot work intensely and on time, as we would have liked, but we can make some observations.
I will focus on one: the possibility that, in relation to harmonisation, more reference should be made to the regulation and less to the directive.
Because we are seeing that every time a Community directive is adopted, it gives rise to fifteen different national legislations, which leads us to think that we are possibly not achieving the objective of harmonisation, but quite the opposite, because the Community directive paradoxically leads to discrepancies in the development of each national legislation.
I know that this is a difficult issue, because there is still legislative zeal of a national nature, but it is one of the possibilities for development by means of Community legislation, instead of merely indirect harmonisation via a directive.
I must stop here through lack of time, but not without congratulating the Commission on its initiative and the rapporteur on his report.
Mr President, I should like to congratulate our rapporteur on taking this important issue forward and also to congratulate the Commission on a very good consultation document on contract law.
We have made a good start in what is a very politically sensitive area.
Although we might see the practical arguments for moving forward because of the advent of the euro and because of e-commerce, we have to ensure that our citizens are also comfortable with this.
Every time we talk about approximation of core civil law subjects, I see scare stories in the English press that English common law is about to be replaced by the Code NapolÃ©on, complete with a small picture of Napoleon.
Last week English contract law was supposed to be under threat.
However misguided some of this comment might be, we have to respect the concerns and deal with them.
The process outlined in this report will allow us to do so.
The Commission has made some very pragmatic suggestions about contract law, which I hope the Council will act on.
It was, after all, the Council that brought forward this idea of convergence in the Tampere agenda.
We must insist that the area of freedom and justice referred to there is as much about civil law as about criminal law.
The Tampere conclusions foresaw convergence in civil law.
Convergence is a long process, not an abrupt event.
It is not about imposing a European civil code.
It is about channelling and guiding developments in Community law to give us a more coherent and less piecemeal approach, ultimately allowing more knowledge of the law and greater access to justice across Europe's internal market.
In considering these matters, we would do much better to concentrate on what draws us together in Europe's common legal heritage.
All our legal traditions owe something to the early modern fusion of feudal, Roman and canon law called ius commune.
We now have the chance to guide and structure the modern reconvergence of our legal systems.
We should welcome that opportunity.
Mr President, there was a time when Europeans travelled all over the universities of Europe and studied what was still a common law based on the Roman law.
Indeed, in my own country, Scotland, that lasted until the 17th century, during which 6000 members of the Faculty of Advocates of Scotland at various times studied in the universities of Utrecht and Leiden.
That kind of interaction of lawyers is one of the things which contributed most to our civilisation and from which our legal civilisation has grown.
So this is a very good project and the time-tabling suggested by Mr Lehne and the Commission is feasible and worthwhile.
Nevertheless, as Mrs Wallis has said, legal traditions are valued objects.
People concern themselves greatly about the coherence and integrity of a legal order.
Therefore it must be with great sensitivity that we move forward in bringing back together again legal systems and legal traditions through the kinds of common definition that Mr Lehne is suggesting.
With that in mind, I have one doubt and it involves a difference with what Mr Medina Ortega has just said.
Clause 14 of the report suggests that a regulation is really the best way to take this forward.
The difficulty relates to subsidiarity.
If these things are to be done well, common definitions will have to be sensitively adapted and grafted into what are very deep and organic legal traditions.
You cannot do that by thrusting a regulation down the throats of the legal community.
We in the United Kingdom have two legal systems, rather distinct, and it is going to be absolutely vital for this development that both are adequately and properly represented in further discussions, as they have been on bodies like the Lando Commission in the past.
Mr President, I would first like to strike a critical note, because although the rapporteur explained the need for haste to the committee and I also understand that, I believe that there should not be fast-track procedures of this kind, because they can lead to botch-ups.
However, I would like to specifically exclude the rapporteur's report from that comment.
I am totally in agreement with the content of the report, because approximation of Community law as it applies to SMEs is also absolutely necessary if we are to increase legal certainty for cross-border contracts, especially in view of the forthcoming enlargement of the Union.
It would be irresponsible to create free trade areas without making provision for the necessary instruments to keep commercial trade on track.
However, it is my belief, and this is something that Mr MacCormick just touched upon, that the mature traditions underpinning the legal systems of the Member States impose certain limitations on the approximation of civil and commercial law, and that a failure to respect those traditions would inevitably lead to the opposite of what we are trying to achieve.
However, I believe that these problems have been adequately addressed and that it is also possible to achieve this objective, which we will therefore be supporting.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Lehne, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to know how many legal transactions have taken place in the European Union during the last 15 minutes, while we have been debating.
Would it be a million, 10 million or even 100 million?
Whatever, I believe that it must be a large figure.
We are in a world of what in German we call "MassengeschÃ€fte" a term that is not perhaps particularly easy to translate into other languages - bread-and-butter transactions, perhaps.
I am sure that only a fraction of these legal transactions will have been cross-border, and I am equally sure that these transactions, ranging from Lapland to Sicily, from Scotland to Bavaria, will have been conducted according to totally different traditions and customs.
That is why we need to be clear that this is a very sensitive area and however ambitious we may be, we still need to proceed very carefully and prudently.
Mrs Wallis has already referred to the reaction in the United Kingdom, for example.
So I think it is reasonable for the Commission to propose in its Option II that we should initially work out some general legal principles.
One expert very appositely said that the problem with legal convergence is not so much the rules as the exceptions.
We have discovered precisely that through our own work, in the case of warranty periods on purchases, interest on arrears, money laundering and also the takeover directive.
General principles can be agreed quickly, but in contrast it is very difficult to harmonise which groups should be given special treatment and who qualifies for special protection.
That is why we also need to set reasonable priorities for our work.
The cross-border aspects should be prioritised in the first place.
We need to achieve compatibility between European legislation and national legislation, but national legislative provisions also need to be made compatible with each other.
Courts need to cooperate more effectively and mutual legal assistance needs to be guaranteed.
I believe that these are concrete, practical steps that we can implement from one day to the next, which would assist legal transactions between our citizens within the single market.
I think that in considering these matters, we should also deal with the concept of working towards a European law as an option for parties entering into contracts.
They could therefore choose either to opt for a legal system created in Europe or else continue to use national law.
As I see it, this would be a kind of soft harmonisation, setting in train a process of convergence which, Mr MacCormick, would be better than regulations adopted as an abrupt event, as Mrs Wallis put it.
Against this background I would also like to say that Mr Lehne's draft does not, of course, reiterate the demands that we made in 1989 and 1994.
At that time we demanded that a European Civil Code should be drawn up, but as far as I can see, that proposal has not been incorporated in the texts adopted in committee nor in the amendments.
We have adopted a good, reasonable and cautious approach here.
I would like to thank both the rapporteur and all those who helped with the hearing for their assistance.
Mr President, by and large I agree with the rapporteur, and in the limited time I have available I can only mention one or two rather unrelated points.
What we need to start with at EU level is coherent and homogeneous legislation.
That is very often not the case, because terms are used which have a different meaning in other legal texts.
Scarcely any academic research has been done into this aspect of Community law.
So the first thing we should do is to ensure coherence and homogeneity in our own legal texts, and I would urge you to set up an expert committee to do this.
That is one point.
The other point that I would like to address is how this relates to international civil law.
It seems to me that Mr Lehne has rather neglected this aspect in his report.
International civil law can make an important contribution to overcoming the difficulties involved in cross-border legal disputes, and as a rule, and I am choosing my words very carefully now, international civil law is certainly not inferior to Community law, certainly as far as legal culture and the quality of legal texts are concerned.
So if, as in the case of the directive on electronic commerce, you take issue with international civil law, the situation becomes very difficult indeed.
We therefore need to examine once more to what extent we can retain international civil law.
My final point concerns national regulations.
I think this is an area where we should not overreach ourselves.
That will be very difficult.
I believe that it would be best for us to have convincing law making in the European Union.
Mr President, I welcome this opportunity to congratulate Parliament and especially the Committee on Legal Affairs and its rapporteur, Mr Lehne, on its timely report on the approximation of the civil and commercial laws of the Member States.
Given the forthcoming European Council in December in Laeken, for which this report will be of relevance, I am particularly pleased that the European Parliament is discussing this report here today.
The European Council will therefore have at its disposal not only the Commission's communication and the Council's report, but also the report by the European Parliament, which handles this important issue in the necessary depth.
The Commission also very much welcomes the report as Parliament's response to the Commission's consultation process, launched by the communication on European contract law.
It is absolutely essential that the Commission should get as much feedback and input as possible from the other EC institutions so that it can establish its future approach in the area of contract law.
One fundamental question confronts the Commission, as well as Parliament and the Council as the two branches of the European legislature.
Should we continue with the existing piecemeal approach of harmonising European contract law in a very sector-specific way, as has been done for the past 20 years, or should we adopt a new approach?
It is obvious that if the existing approach corresponds to the needs of the European Union then we should continue it.
If, however, there are problems despite, or possibly even because of, the existing approach, then we should be brave enough to change it.
It was in order to get a reply to this fundamental question that the Commission adopted its communication on European contract law.
The choice of our future approach is highly important for the smooth functioning of the internal market and the participation of consumers, small- and medium-sized enterprises and all other economic operators, as well as for the uniform application of Community law.
We have already received a large number of constructive comments and reactions which confirm that the Commission's initiative is of great interest to all stakeholders.
Of course not all the reactions point in the same direction, but this is inevitable with such a complex subject where so many issues are raised and different options need to be considered.
The reactions will be examined in depth by the Commission.
Obviously the Commission will attach great importance to Parliament's response to our communication which, once you have adopted it, will be very carefully analysed.
The Commission will decide what suggestions it will make in the light of the reports from Parliament and the Council, the possible reaction from the European Council and the responses to our consultation process.
I understand that the Council may ask the Commission to report to the Community institutions and the public on the consultation process, together with any observations and recommendations if necessary in the form of a Green or White Paper, not later than 31 December 2002.
The European Parliament's proposal for an action plan is particularly relevant in this context.
The Commission has taken due note of the ambitious deadlines for specific steps to be taken.
In conclusion, I would like to express the Commission's thanks for the careful analysis that has gone into this report.
If there are problems for the internal market and the uniform application of Community law which need to be tackled, it is obvious that whatever line we take this will be a longer term project of considerable importance.
So, this is certainly not the last time that we will debate questions of European contract law in this House.
I submitted the Commission communication to the college, together with my colleagues Mr Vitorino, Mr Bolkestein and Mr Liikanen.
At the last Council meeting on the internal market and consumer affairs, I emphasised my strong personal interest in this matter, not only because I am convinced of its value but also because of my own professional background as a practising barrister and as international commercial arbitrator.
For those who have expressed concern about the survival of the common law system: that is the system that I have worked in myself for 27 years and I have some attachment to it.
Perhaps with that background it will be able to make sure that these issues and sensitivities are taken fully into account.
This is an ambitious project but it is a feasible project.
When I worked on contracts where arbitration was needed or on dispute had to be resolved, the "applicable law" was - lex mercatoria.
What is that?
Those who have to enter into contracts with a term like that will feel perfectly comfortable with something a bit more rigid and rigorous, which is what all of us in this House are aiming at.
My colleagues and I are therefore looking forward to constructive dialogue with Parliament and the other EC institutions in the future.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Byrne.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Arbitrary arrests and the political situation in Laos
The next item is the Commission statement on arbitrary arrests and the political situation in Laos.
Mr President, I am honoured to make this declaration on behalf of the Commission on the arrests in Laos PDR.
The Commission welcomes the release of the five members of the Transnational Radical Party who had been arrested on 26 October in Vientiane, Laos PDR, after staging a peaceful demonstration.
We are particularly happy to see Mr Dupuis back.
Their release followed 14 days of detention, during which the Commission and EU Member States made frequent contacts with the Laotian authorities to ensure a rapid resolution of the situation.
At a public trial on 9 November, the detainees were found guilty of violating Laotian law.
They were given suspended sentences before being released and expelled from the country.
In relation to this incident, the Commission notes that the human rights situation in Laos PDR, including the case of the Laotian students who organised a demonstration for freedom and democracy in Laos PDR in October 1999, continues to give cause for concern.
The Commission, together with the diplomatic missions of the EU Member States, is following the human rights situation in the country closely and participating in all EU dÃ©marches to the government of Laos PDR on these issues.
Included in these issues are deficiencies in the rule of law.
There are still a number of flaws in the administration of justice, notably cases of arbitrary arrest, lengthy pre-trial detention and lack of guarantees of due process.
Many of these problems are exacerbated by the poor training of people working in the judicial system and the Commission has therefore offered assistance to the government of Laos PDR, both in reforming the system and in developing its human resources.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the arbitrary arrest of a Member of the European Parliament and a number of his fellow campaigners in Vientiane has put a severe strain on relations between the European Union and Laos.
In the intervening period both the institutions of the European Union and also the Member States concerned have done everything in their power to secure the release of those arrested.
In this context I would like to thank both the Commission and also the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, under the leadership of Elmar Brok, and also all those colleagues who have become involved in this issue.
Those arrested have now been released again.
The Italian government was particularly helpful in that it sent a government representative to Vientiane.
This action was ultimately successful.
I would also specifically like to thank the Ambassador of the Lao People's Democratic Republic, who made himself available for discussions with us both here and in Brussels and who obviously also had a very positive influence on events.
Laos has been a single-party state since 1975, that is to say that it is not a democracy as we understand it.
Places where there is no democracy and no freedom of choice usually do not have any constitutional checks either, and Laos is no exception to this.
Despite this, the European Union has a cooperation agreement with Laos, and in this framework the European Union is assisting not only the development of that country but is also helping to encourage democracy and constitutionality.
The ASEAN delegation accepted only this year that this assistance was indeed useful.
There are some very good projects in which the European Union is involved.
I would like to make it clear at this point that regardless of the unacceptable behaviour of the powers that be in Laos, we stand by our cooperation agreement and our willingness to provide assistance.
I also concede that our concept of democracy and constitutionality does not necessarily have to be accepted by every country on this planet.
In fact we need to ask ourselves every now and again if the European Parliament is really in a position to wave its finger at every country in the world and lecture them about democracy and constitutionality.
Nevertheless, we do have our principles and they have been infringed in this case.
We also intend to make sure that they are respected in future.
But we are willing to carry on helping Laos, whose people are amongst the poorest in the world, and to contribute to ensuring that this country has a chance of achieving a degree of prosperity.
However, we also want democracy and constitutionality to occupy their rightful place in Laos.
Mr President, we are now feeling relieved as our fellow Member, Olivier Dupuis, is fortunately back with us.
We should, however, revisit the problems that we were discussing last week so that we are somewhat less hesitant, should we have the misfortune to be in this situation again in the future.
First of all, we were facing some serious human rights issues.
Can a country detain individuals, without any form of trial, particularly foreign nationals who publicly campaign for democracy and human rights and condemn the breaches committed by the host country?
Even if Laotian law permitted this type of ban on demonstrations, it goes without saying that the immediate arrest of peaceful demonstrators was completely disproportionate.
Furthermore, it is natural for the European Union to be vigilant about whether or not a country like Laos observes the clause on human rights enshrined in the cooperation agreement that it signed.
Secondly, we were facing an institutional challenge that directly concerned the European Parliament, since one of the detainees was an MEP.
Of course, Mr Dupuis never asked for preferential treatment.
The European Parliament cannot, however, remain indifferent to how one of its members is treated.
The credibility and the honour of our institution, and even that of the European Union as a whole, depend on this.
This must be clear to everyone so that if we ever have the misfortune to be in this situation again, everyone has a role: the Commission, the Council, the High Representative, the Member States, Parliament, particularly the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy will react quickly and know exactly what to do and how to do it.
In fact, everyone did take the appropriate action, and we should welcome this.
We now need to do everything we can in order to encourage Laos to move forward, which is the purpose of the resolution that we shall be voting on this week.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to welcome the Prince Regent and the members of the Laotian royal family, the leaders and those in charge of the Laotian human rights organisations, my friends, Massimo Lensi and Bruno Mellano, who were my companions-in-arms during the demonstration and over the following days in Laos.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would once again like to thank you and President Fontaine, and all of you who supported the purpose of our action, which was and still is to free the five student leaders who were arrested in 1999 and about whom we still have no news today.
I think that the issue that we raised is, of course, much wider, it concerns democracy, and the globalisation of democracy.
At the beginning of the 1990s, Laos launched a process to bring about democratic change that, during the first five years, took the form of a number of openings in the economic sector.
Since 1995, however, we have witnessed an extremely serious drift, a transformation of the Communist regime into an utterly 'clepto-Communist' regime, or rather into a hybrid of clepto-Communism and narco-Communism.
This is extremely serious.
The people of Laos face this every day, and they are dying in their thousands at the hands of this regime.
Tens of thousands of Laotians, starting with the royal family of Laos, have quite simply been murdered in dribs and drabs.
The European Union, and also the Member States, must therefore understand the tragic nature of the situation in Laos.
We should first of all understand that the Stalinists and the drug traffickers who are running this country are preventing the democrats, both inside and outside Laos, and also those in favour of reform within the regime, from promoting reforms.
Instead of continuing to support politically correct projects, such as the promotion of women, the promotion of rural development, the protection of the environment, which, albeit worthwhile, do not tackle the root of the problem, the European Union should specifically attack the root of the problem which is democratic change, penal code reform, constitutional reform and guarantees of fundamental rights.
And I do not believe that the Commission and the Member States are doing what they should be doing in this area.
We must therefore change our policy, re-focus on law and on the promotion of law, and this is what we are attempting to do with the text of this resolution.
Mr President, I welcome the release of Mr Dupuis and our other four Radical friends from prison, but, at the same time, I am extremely concerned for the other five political detainees who are still being detained under arbitrary arrest.
We are concerned for their fate but what concerns us most is the fact that there has been no news of them at all for two years.
I am appalled by the unnecessary delay with which this institution reacted to the violence suffered by Mr Dupuis and the other Radical activists.
Lastly, Mr President, I would like to express my concern at a complex case of hypocrisy which Parliament and the European institutions have failed to address: on the one hand, they regularly, emotionally, bring up the issue of human rights, for the protection of human rights is a symbol of our political prowess and pride, yet, on the other, they are reluctant to apply the clause providing for the suspension of economic and commercial relations with those countries which systematically violate these rights, and not just in the case of Laos.
We should not be asking Parliament to teach the world democracy: rather, we should be demanding the greatest possible consistency from our institutions.
Thank you very much, Mr Fava.
I have received a motion for resolution pursuant to Rule 37 (2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon.
Services of general interest in Europe
The next item is the report (A5-0361/2001) by Mr Langen, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission communication 'Services of General Interest in Europe' [COM(2000) 580 - C5-0399/2001 - 2001/2157(COS)].
Mr President, general interest services are services of both an economic and non-economic nature which are geared towards the public interest and in whose provision both the public at large and the state have a special interest.
In the various Member States of the European Union, this includes supplying the public with services in the fields of energy, water, waste disposal, transport, telecommunications, post, media, finance and insurance, a basic social, educational and training system, social services, external and internal security, a judiciary and a system of registration.
You will see from this broad span of services how wide-ranging this subject is.
Why are we concerned with this area?
Because some Member States, and, in particular, Germany, have questioned the power of the Commission to take decisions under Article 86 of the EC Treaty, and have also challenged the enactment of secondary Community law such as the transparency directive.
I believe that there is no justification for the fears of the LÃ€nder and municipalities that competition law will greatly undermine their powers and destroy the existing network of mature, tried and tested general interest structures.
Today we wish Parliament to adopt an opinion on the decisions to be taken by the Heads of State and Government in Laeken, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues very sincerely for their cooperation on this issue.
We have been trying for over a year, by means of hearings and a great many debates, to identify a common line.
The Commission's behaviour on this issue has been objective and I think I can say successful.
I would therefore like to thank the Commission, which I see is still represented here.
The Commission has comprehensively described the Community law framework.
It has presented the principles of neutrality, freedom of definition and proportionality, which we support, and in response to the question of how more legal certainty is to be achieved, it has proposed the use of exempting regulations and case-by-case decisions.
This is one of the questions that have to be resolved.
Whereas a good many Members favour an amendment to Article 16, we have agreed to propose a framework directive on the basis of Article 95, the internal market article, which will allow all unresolved issues to be settled, and using the codecision procedure, this is not to be a Council regulation or a Commission instrument, but a directive under the codecision procedure, so that we will be able to fully participate in decision making on these marginal issues under competition law.
There were two pivotal points in the debate: to what extent can we maintain structures that have developed along traditional lines or need to be opened up with regard to free markets and competition?
Secondly, to what extent is it permissible for the state to subsidise general interest services?
And if so, is there a difference between public and private companies?
What general interest services come under EU law?
Activities not included are all those of a non-economic nature and those that are purely national.
What does this cover?
EU competition law assumes that companies are involved and in this case we have the controls on state aid under Articles 87 to 89.
The internal market rules refer to economic activities, and in particular the freedom of establishment and the freedom to provide services.
In addition, there are activities relating to sovereignty which the state has effectively reserved to itself, and there are institutions which do not fall into this category, which are neither companies nor state institutions, the "independent charitable associations" or not-for-profit organisations which the Commission refers to in its observations on Article 30, as do we.
The EU's competition rules and the internal market rules are not applicable to purely internal national matters.
This is particularly relevant to general interest services at regional and local level.
If they are applicable, then there are exemption arrangements, such as the de minimis rule, such as aids for culture and such as the exempting regulations for small and medium-sized enterprises and other bodies.
For this reason, the Commission has given us a head start by means of this framework, and one with which we basically agree, in cases where we want to establish legal certainty on issues that we have openly debated and in cases where we want to declare the free market, competition in the market, to be a fundamental principle.
I would like to ask honourable Members to actively support the compromise that we worked out in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to heartily congratulate Mr Langen and will limit myself to just one aspect of a special public provision situation, that is, the cultural dimension in the audio-visual field, in other words public television and radio.
I was in favour of the introduction of private-sector television from the very outset, as I still am, whilst being convinced, in the final analysis, that we must work on the assumption that a public-service broadcasting remit is necessary.
Two particular aspects must be highlighted here: on the one hand the obligation to provide a service to all, that is, overall popular provision under appropriate conditions, and on the other the obligation to reflect the pluralistic nature of our society.
The dual broadcasting system has proved itself.
There would be no sense in constantly requiring the public broadcasters to justify every single programme.
A balanced programme needs leeway.
What is also certain is that we cannot allow taxes and licence fees to finance the creation of a public-service copy of the private-sector service providers.
The public media need leeway, but also clarification of their role and standards for fulfilling it.
It is in this respect that the communication from the Commission is particularly to be welcomed.
It also needs to be made clear, however, that, in the case of services with social welfare in mind, the type of transmission - be it terrestrial or videostreaming - cannot be crucial.
What matters are the objectives to be safeguarded, our democratic foundational principles, pluralism and free access to culture and to technological progress.
We must of course guarantee the protection of the users, especially of the young.
In terms of competition law, the Commission, as guardian of the Treaties, must restrict itself to watching out for misuse.
It must continue to respect and defend the competence of Member States as regards the content of programmes.
Regulatory authority must then remain with the Member States, and it is therefore incumbent on them too to determine financial and organisational structures.
I welcome the fact the Commission and the Council are endeavouring to come to an arrangement with the Member States about this.
Mr President, Mr Philippe Herzog, who is the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee, is currently in Qatar as a member of the Parliamentary WTO Delegation and has, therefore, asked me to present the opinion of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy on his behalf.
This was adopted by the Committee almost unanimously, with only one member casting a blank vote.
The draftsman does not share the Commission' s view that compliance with the rules governing competition and the internal market is fully compatible with safeguarding the supply of services of general interest.
The problem arising is how to safeguard the supply of such services.
The draftsman proposes the creation of a European joint responsibility framework to cover services of general interest.
He considers that more open and more democratic regulation is a necessity, also in the conditions that will prevail following the potential enlargement of the EU.
The draftsman wishes to make the tasks clearer and at the same time to strengthen the communities' and states' freedom of choice regarding the selection of a model for safeguarding these services and the type of administration to be set up for this purpose.
While the current market philosophy and rules of competition encourage privatisation, the EU should retain the principle of diversity, or in other words, there should be a number of options to choose from.
On the basis of these arguments the committee has adopted an opinion according to which the gradual process of freeing service industries must be implemented in parallel with retaining general services.
The principle according to which it is up to the Member States, within their own territories, to retain their cultural habits and political views has also been adopted.
The Member States should have the right to ensure that services of general interest are also provided to the less advantaged of their citizens.
In paying particular attention to the problems presented by the financing and its safeguarding, the committee in its opinion shares the draftsman' s concern about the necessity to safeguard general services.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Langen, ladies and gentlemen, in a changing world in which global competition is growing and, indeed, becoming ever tougher, public services are among the essential cornerstones of the European social model.
Citizens, and indeed enterprises, of today, work on the assumption that a broad spectrum of such services will be generally available, with high quality and at affordable prices.
By 'services of general interest' is understood activities engaged in for the general good and therefore linked by the authorities with specific social welfare obligations and benefits.
Such services make a significant contribution to improving citizens' quality of life and thus play a significant part in maintaining the social, human and geographical cohesion of the European Union.
The subsidiarity principle clarifies responsibilities at regional and national level.
The meaning of 'social welfare interest' is laid down in the Treaty of Amsterdam and in the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
It has therefore been important for me as President of the Austrian Welfare Service to clarify my position with respect to the major social institutions and health organisations, with the Red Cross, Caritas, the Welfare Service, the sports clubs, the fire brigades, the parishes and towns.
It was also important for me to observe that the specifically rural areas are involved, that the candidate countries through which the EU is to be enlarged are involved and that the significance of 'non profit organisations' in the service of the public is clearly expressed.
Today's report contributes to greater humanity in everyday life.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I think it is useful for Parliament to issue an opinion today on the report by Mr Langen, since the report is rather topical.
I think it is useful for us to issue an opinion prior to the Laeken European Council, as we are expecting this Council to give a great impetus to the redrafting of the notorious framework directive, the principle of which the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is proposing that you adopt.
Furthermore, as regards the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Communities, day after day I see judgments being passed, which show just how far ahead case law is on this issue, in comparison to our legislation.
In a judgment dated 25 October 2001, this case law again justified certain restrictions on competition where these are necessary for carrying out the task in question in order to achieve economic and social balance.
So, when you consider the timeliness of this framework directive, you must also consider the organisation of services of general interest.
And, from that point of view, this would mean knowing which authority is responsible for services of general interest.
In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, we are calling for all levels of the European Union to be involved, whether at European or local level, both in defining the scope of services of general interest as well as in the ways that they are organised.
Our concern relates to consistency between the general approach towards services of general interest and the sectoral approach.
This is because there is no point defining the framework if there is a lack of cohesion between one sector and another.
Our group will therefore oppose a number of paragraphs which fall within a sectoral approach that we will not support.
I would lastly like to touch on the issue of funding.
The Commission recently proposed a new text which deals with an exemption regime in the sector of services of general interest.
We shall support this proposal which we believe must be supplemented by an approach that enables cross-funding, without which adjustments are not possible, and that threatens, over the long term, the functioning of general interest services.
Mr President, it is, of course, vital to assess the phenomenon of services of general interest and the implications thereof for the European citizen.
In our view, the basic objective in this connection should be to step up competition in favour of the citizen and to determine the pre-conditions on that basis.
The concept of services of general interest should be a matter to be decided upon by the Member States, and subsidiarity should be a keyword in this connection.
It is essential to accomplish the internal market in the way it was agreed in Lisbon.
That is why, in the interest of the citizen, swift progress should be made with the ongoing liberalisation of postal services, transport, electricity and gas - and water as well, as far as I am concerned.
Current liberalisation has contributed greatly to the competitiveness of European businesses and has also benefited the European citizen.
Citizens should have a choice, particularly in the case of products which are so important in everyday life.
Citizens must be regarded as consumers rather than objects.
That is why services of general interest must be provided in a competitive manner everywhere.
It is important for a sufficient number of market operators to enter the market, and that is why the same conditions of access must apply to public and private businesses alike.
The citizen also benefits from clarity in the field of prices, bills and supplies.
In addition, high quality must be delivered.
This should, of course, go hand in hand with the correct and prompt handling of complaints.
Efficiency, for example with a view to an improved guarantee of supply, should also be on the agenda.
Furthermore, the market for other products, such as water, must be opened up so that the citizen can reap the benefits there too.
With regard to the drafting of a framework directive, I would prefer to await the Commission position in Laeken.
At the moment, we are actually opposed to a framework directive.
We must carefully consider whether such a directive is in fact necessary, and we should only draft legislation if it is required.
We should not make it more opaque than it already is.
On a final note, I should like to thank the rapporteur, including for the consultation he has entered into with all of us.
In all honesty, I thought his original proposal was the best and the Commission has since then made every effort to tone things down.
Our voting behaviour will therefore be able to hit quite a critical note in that respect.
Mr President, Commissioner, with regard to the decisions taken in recent years by the Council and the European Parliament on the opening up to competition of hitherto protected sectors, in other words, monopolies, it has become clear that we must have solid legal bases in order to guarantee and develop services of general interest that are economically accessible to everyone and which therefore give substance to the status of citizens of the European Union.
In our view, the current economic situation and the numerous job losses that have been announced in recent weeks, coupled with the fact that, even during a period of strong growth, we have had an average unemployment rate of 8% in recent years, highlight the absolute need to develop services of general interest.
This is why our group fully supports the voluntarist guidelines drawn up, in the main, by the European Confederation of Trade Unions and by the European Liaison Committee on services of general interest.
Article 16 of the Treaty of Amsterdam was a major step forward for Europe.
It is now deemed to be insufficient, and that is why we are supporting the draft framework directive and the amendments tabled by the Group of the Party of European Socialists, the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance.
We expect the Laeken European Council, part of which will be dedicated to the European Union' s objectives, to clearly set forth this objective on services of general interest and the framework directive as well as a timetable.
What is at stake is of crucial importance.
As in the case of procedures for public procurement contracts, which the Zappala report tackled, and as in the case of a particular sector such as public transport, which the Meijer report dealt with, we are required to adopt a framework for the policy on European competition, to develop a policy on regulated competition, to enable national, regional or local public authorities, in line with the principle of subsidiarity, to determine the missions of general interest services, the management contract that is to be fulfilled by the operators and the funding of these missions.
This is the purpose of Amendment Nos 52 and 55 that we have tabled.
We also think that we must insist on carrying out a much more in-depth evaluation on the liberalisation of sectors, taking into consideration the interests of consumers and workers and the compatibility of market guidelines with the objectives of sustainable development - I am thinking of the water sector, for example - and not only from a technical point of view, but equally through dialogue with all the actors involved.
This is the purpose of Amendment Nos 44 and 46.
The fact that it was necessary to present the various amendments to the House once again obviously indicates that what I have just said about objectives, and above all, about the resources to be implemented, has not received unanimous support.
Once again, in this field as in others, it is greater European integration that we need, whilst respecting the Community method and guaranteeing that public figures at all levels take the proper action to ensure the provision of general interest services.
Mr President, faced with the process of liberalisation and deregulation currently underway in the European Union, moves for proposals to be put forward and action to be taken in the field of public services have built up.
The contribution of these has led to the fact that Article 16 of the Treaty of Amsterdam recognises the essential role of services of general interest in ensuring social and territorial cohesion.
The Commission' s proposals, however, contain the usual double language. On the one hand, there is reference to the interests of citizens, and therefore to the need for services of general interest, whilst on the other, several of the Commission' s directives accentuate liberalisation and deregulation of public services.
The Langen report supports the spirit of the Commission' s communication of September 2000 on services of general interest in Europe.
The Commission acknowledges that competition cannot meet all the requirements of citizens and that Member States have good reason to set up and implement services of general interest.
At the same time, however, the Commission states that the progress of liberalisation is positive and relies on the content of the Lisbon meeting of the Council of Ministers to step up this process.
The report has been improved by the debate and the amendments.
It has made a real effort to adopt a balanced position between liberalisation and public services, it also stresses that services of general interest must ensure equal access, security of supply and continuity.
It also proposes to assess the actual impact of liberalisation before embarking on any new phases, as my group suggested on many occasions.
However, we still have a long way to go before we meet the required demands for services of general interest that are worthy of the name.
The Langen report claims to relentlessly pursue liberalisation in sectors such as transport, electricity and gas and the postal services.
Furthermore, it believes that it is necessary to privatise the water industry.
I think that services of general interest, as their name suggests, must be subject to the rights and obligations that the general interest demands.
In other words, this means providing transparency, continuity and equality.
We need a new European model of services of general interest that meets citizens' aspirations, and we must stop approaching this issue solely from the point of view of competition, as advocated in the report.
That is why I do not think it is wise, and I think it could even be dangerous, to envisage a framework directive where we stick to this approach.
Yes, I believe that we need safeguards.
I am in favour of a framework directive on services of general interest on the condition that it maintains the social benefits that these provide in terms of employment, security and sustainable regional development.
This directive should also ensure the respect of service obligations in terms of quality, equality, access for all users, and also by maintaining reserved areas allowing price offsetting on a geographical basis and on social grounds.
I also think that all levels of the European Union must be involved.
Our position will be related to whether or not a number of amendments are accepted.
Mr President, this report on services of general interest in Europe deals with a field of tension between two significant blocs. It is about the issue of a unitary competitive order in Europe, and about the self-government of communities or, in other words, about subsidiarity.
The focus of all this must always be the citizen, the consumer, and what services he receives, under what conditions and, above all, of what quality.
There are two points I find important in the communication from the Commission. It always speaks of an economic activity, with 'an economic activity' being very hard to define exactly.
If we in this House discuss what an economic activity is, the thinking of a very large number of Members is shaped by their national origin.
Is an economic activity to be affirmed when an enterprise works in a particular line of business for profit?
Let me mention only ambulance services.
The second is the issue of checking for misuse.
The question here is not whether the Commission can check on this, but in what detail it should, so that over-restrictive requirements do not result in a definition of general interest by the back door.
What is important is that we should be given communal responsibility and that we use it to choose one or other type of competition by means of public tender.
I would like, finally, to re-emphasise one thing that is mentioned in the report, but not in the communication from the Commission, namely the market in water.
For us in Germany and Austria, water is an extraordinarily important area.
I believe that as a matter of urgency we should reject the opening of the market in water, brought about by means of a decision on an individual case in the European Union - and the Commission has already requested an assessment on the subject.
We reject this decisively.
Examination of the sector-specific situation is in any case needed first.
I can therefore only warn the Commission not to take these steps.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, one of the consequences of the internal market is that many things that were regulated in a quite specific way in the Member States are now subject to new and different rules.
Services of general interest are now an outstanding example of this, an example made more problematic by the additional factor that the objectives of services of general interest are similar in the Member States.
The instruments, however, sometimes differ significantly as a consequence not only of different cultural developments, but also of the Member States' differing administrative structures.
The drawing-up of shared rules is not exactly made easier by this.
The Member States must, however, continue in future to be able to decide what services they will categorise as being of general interest.
On the other hand, the rules must be as similar as possible in a common internal market.
Competition law, as laid down in the Treaty, provides on its own insufficient legal certainty when it comes to framing them.
On the other hand, the objective should not be to empty European competition law of its meaning.
It must therefore be interpreted in a binding way for the purposes of services of public interest.
We accordingly call for a framework directive to determine the Community principles on which services of general interest are to be founded.
This directive should lay down rules for the Member States.
Above all, though, it should provide legal security for those who provide services of general interest.
Thirdly, it should limit the space available for the Commission to exercise its discretion.
Its executive monopoly should not be infringed, but as far as its decisions in individual cases and its block exemption regulations are concerned, I would like to see it laid down what, for example, are 'economic activities' and what are not.
What falls at this arbitrary threshold?
When is intra-Community trade affected?
Above all, the many sectoral directives and regulations on which we are working at present must give direction to the legislative work in various sectors done by those of us in the European Parliament...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, the report is called 'Services of General Interest' in order to improve ways of handing over public services to private interests, and it calls for us to pursue liberalisation with unflinching determination.
Contrary to the misleading assertions made in the report, privatisation brings about poorer services and social discrimination that affects those on the lowest incomes. Activities are reduced or withdrawn in order to avoid making private profit, and these are still just as essential to the population.
And there can be no other approach.
The private companies that benefit from the erosion of public services are motivated by making maximum profits for their shareholders and not by the need to satisfy the general interest as best they can.
The policy to hand over public services to private interests is a policy pursued by the European institutions and the national governments, and represents a major social step backwards.
Education, health, public transport, postal services, telecommunications, water and energy supply, and refuse collection must remain public services which must not generate profits...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, the EU is trusting in liberalisation to ensure that services of general interest are sufficiently available.
If that means increased and fairer competition in postal services, transport, water supply, social services and so on, this can only be agreed to.
If, though, simple considerations of cost mean that the quality of service drops, with ever fewer service providers being available and ever fewer people being employed, this proposal merits political resistance.
State monopolies must not be replaced by private monopolies.
Mr Langen, the rapporteur, has taken on board my suggestion that tasks of general interest should be acknowledged to be common European values.
They contribute to the European social model and to the sustainable development of the EU's regions.
The aim is to guarantee high standards of quality and safety, range of provision and continuity in a healthy price/service ratio.
As before, the Member States' offers for tender will independently determine which yardstick to apply as regards environmental friendliness, availability and social standards.
It is for the good of all citizens if these services are unambiguously defined in the context of a European law on the placing of contracts.
Exceptions from the internal market's competition and market regulations should include local, social and charitable services which do not work with their eye on profit and are committed to meeting the needs of the weak and those on the margins of society.
Citizens and service users are to be comprehensively involved in the Member States' and the Commission's efforts to make this agreement reality.
New regulations on services of general interest in the EU will only be accepted if transparency and involvement are ensured.
As a member not only of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs but also of that on Employment and Social Affairs, I recommend that this House approve this report, which is excellent because it is balanced.
Mr President, I am concerned about a number of aspects in the Langen report.
Initially we have to address this question of services of general interest from the point of view of the rights of citizens, for the rights of consumers are a subset of those rights.
Citizenship confers rights which entitle one to various essential needs such as water, which is essential to human life.
Water cannot be treated within the European Union simply as a commodity to be bought and sold.
Europe is committed to the idea of a distinct social model based on solidarity.
It is therefore essential that we have a legal framework, a regulatory framework, within which the Commission and Member States can address the question of competition as it affects social services, public services, and services of general interest.
It is part of a democratic agenda for the European Union to ensure that we are accountable, that the services we provide are accountable, and that we have a Europe which is developed as a socially inclusive Europe.
The economy has to be an instrument to serve the people, not simply to serve the market.
Rights of the consumer being defined on the basis of purchasing power is not an adequate way to develop a cohesive social Europe.
It is a Europe where politics is denigrated because it is simply based on people's capacity to buy or not to buy.
Mr President, it is a particular pleasure to welcome the Langen report and the excellent work of the rapporteur in presenting a measured and forward-looking approach to the future provision of a category of services essential to our economy and to the wellbeing of all European citizens.
The Commission has played its part by presenting two communications on this subject and most recently a report to the Laeken European Council.
Essentially we are all inspired by the same will to ensure that every citizen in Europe has access to high-quality services of general interest.
The European Union has direct responsibilities with regard to those sectors for which internal market legislation has been introduced, essentially for network industries.
In each case, specific provisions have been devoted to public service obligations.
All this legislation has been adopted under codecision and is continuing to evolve.
The package of proposals on energy adopted by the Commission this spring comprises greatly strengthened elements relating to public service obligations.
Member States have a duty to specify and implement those obligations.
Elsewhere, in sectors not covered by specific Community legislation, Member States and their constituted authorities have the main role to play, for instance in the organisation and provision of local and social services.
Here the Commission limits itself to ensuring compatibility with competition and internal market rules in general.
Those rules, as emphasised by the Langen report, are quite flexible.
In particular they provide for adequate financing of services of general interests.
The Commission has repeatedly been requested to provide greater legal security with regard to the general competition and internal market rules applicable to services of general interest.
By explaining and developing its approach, it has attempted to put the fears expressed by operators and others involved to rest.
The Commission proposes to continue to use examples, guidelines and communications, together with proposals for regulations on exemptions, to provide further clarification, as called for in the Langen report.
In its report to Laeken, the Commission has undertaken to establish a Community framework for state aid granted for services of general economic interest.
That framework could, in particular, specify the conditions for the authorisation of state aid schemes by the Commission, thus alleviating the notification obligation for individual aid.
This may lead to the adoption of a regulation exempting certain categories of aid from the obligation of prior notification.
On the issue of a proposed framework directive, the Commission is not opposed in principle and has already agreed to assess the value and feasibility of such an instrument.
Our doubts concern mainly the articulation between such a directive and legislation at sectoral level.
In the light of the European Parliament's resolution, the Commission will look at the subject again.
Another major issue concerns evaluation.
I repeat that the Commission has every interest in rigorous, complete and honest evaluation of the results of Community legislation.
That is good practice; it is also good governance and it should not be neglected, either at Member State or at European level.
We propose to improve on existing sectoral evaluations and we have agreed to present an annual horizontal report in the context of the Cardiff process.
The Commission welcomes the European Parliament's proposal to organise a debate in the existing forums in order to ensure a pluralist assessment and the debate ought to take place before the preparation of the Cardiff report in order to take full account of its results and recommendations.
In conclusion, I stress that services of general interest are an area of ongoing concern which will require new initiatives in future and further development of Community legislation.
The Commission looks forward to involving the European Parliament as a partner in this process.
Thank you Commissioner Bolkestein.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Vote
Thank you Mr Caveri.
We will, of course, take your comment, which would appear well-founded, into consideration.
Mr President, I too have had a mistake in the Spanish version brought to my attention by my Spanish colleagues, and I would like it to be corrected.
The word in question is determinar in the second part of Article 6(3), which should by rights be replaced by the word evaluar, that apparently being the correct translation.
I ask that this should be checked and, if necessary, corrected.

I have to table a minor oral amendment at this stage, because I have noticed that there has been some misunderstanding as to the true intent of this text.
Certain Members of this House suspected me of wanting to weigh down Europe' s bureaucracy, while, in fact, I wish to achieve the opposite.
To clarify this, I will read out the text of the second part in English: "and for the same purpose, to foresee the creation of a specific European executive agency (agency with lower case) for cinema and audiovisual matters" .
The rest is therefore omitted.
I simply mean by this that the efficiency of the existing organisation in Europe is enhanced, and certainly not encumbered.

Report (A5-0347/2001) by Mrs Maat, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the Commission report on the experience acquired by Member States since the implementation of Council Directive 95/29/EC amending Directive 91/628/EEC concerning the protection of animals during transport [COM(2000) 809 - C5-0189/2001 - 2001/2085(COS)]
Mr President, I would like to point out two mistakes that need to be corrected in the French language version.
In Paragraph 10 of the French version, it says 'Treaty infringement procedures against Member States' , which is a misinterpretation.
What is meant is 'Treaty infringement proceedings against Member States' .
In Paragraph 16 of the French version, it says 'calls on the Commission to examine ways of promoting small-scale, local culling' .
Mr President, in order to avoid more serious culling, I propose - this sounds like a film called 'Petits meurtres entre amis' - I propose therefore that we put 'small, local abattoirs' .
Mr President, I would like to refer again to the vote, in which, alas, we lost the chance to vote on item 62.
I have again consulted the documents: item 62 is an addition to item 58, and we should in fact have voted on it by roll call.
Both my points of order were, unfortunately, ignored by your two assistants.
What is at issue here is that we make it simply and convincingly clear that the opening-up of competition in the water market cannot be achieved by means of general competition law.
I therefore want to reiterate this.
I stated in my opening statements that we reject this, and I ask that this be noted in the Minutes and that, if possible, Members' requests to speak should not be ignored in future.
I was not told about your request, Mr Radwan.
Mr President, you can ask your two comrades-in-arms.
The official sitting your left looked in my direction but did not inform you.
I cannot do anything about it either.
Mr Radwan, in my opinion, our colleagues do an extremely important job and do it with great care, but I can see that you are not interested in anything I might have to say.
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE - Schmid, Gerhard report (A5-0362/2001)
The risk of manufacturing and circulating false euro notes and coins is a serious threat overshadowing the launch of the single currency, which will be present for several years following the physical changeover to notes and coins taking place on 1 January 2002.
During this critical period, the confidence of our citizens is a vital factor.
It appears, however, that the danger was under-estimated, and then it was too late to deal with it.
The Commission only published its main communication on the subject on 22 July 1998, and it was in 1999 and 2000 that the first, but still incomplete, provisions were adopted on extending Europol' s mandate and the criminal penalties against counterfeiting of the euro.
The draft decision that we are examining today adds to these measures by establishing a Community training and assistance programme by the key players involved in combating counterfeiting.
Although there have been no major objections to the text itself, we can only stress, however, that it has arrived too late and that it contains some ambiguities, which arise from the design faults in the single currency.
First of all, the text before us constantly wavers between providing 'training' , and 'assistance' , and does not dare to state too clearly that, 48 days before the physical changeover to using coins and notes, cooperation in this vital area has still not been finalised.
Secondly, one of the objectives of the training and assistance programme is to protect the euro outside the euro zone, which is not actually an area of the Community competence.
From this particular perspective, we can see how shaky the single currency system is, one that is shared between Community competences and other competences that remain national, and both sides are poor at organising coordination.
But how could things be any different, as at Maastricht, the aim was to seduce the electorate into believing that the single currency was possible without having an absolute super State?
Lehne report (A5-0380/2001)
Mr President, I speak on behalf of the my group on the Lehne report.
Since the Tampere summit EU governments have been working more closely with each other on justice and home affairs and since 11 September this has become even more apparent.
Since we live in an internal market it is only right and proper that there should be some cooperation and coordination between the Member States.
International crime involves very sophisticated structures, but such operations centre on funding of criminal activities.
That is why it is important that we enact this legislation, to ensure money laundering does not take place within the EU financial systems.
We must ensure that international criminals cannot use existing financial structures in Europe, or indeed elsewhere, to launder their unlawful gains.
The implementation of this directive on prevention of the use of financial systems for the purpose of money laundering is an important element in the battle against international crime.
I have always believed that EU legislation in this area should be broadened to include offences other than drug offences.
This is exactly what has been achieved here through the agreement between the EU governments and the European Parliament.
The directive extends the prohibition of money laundering to organised crime as well as drug offences.
Member States will remain free to extend their national anti-money laundering legislation to other forms of criminal activity.
As a result of the conciliation agreement, lawyers' professional secrecy will be safeguarded unless the lawyer knows that the legal advice sought is for money laundering purposes.
In a wider context there is agreement at European level to implement the framework directive on permitting the freezing of criminal assets within the EU.
The protocol relating to the convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters will also help EU governments when criminal proceedings take place in different Member States.
I support closer cooperation and coordination on justice within the EU, although I would caution governments to look very carefully at any conditions attached to future initiatives.
There must be proper procedures to safeguard civil liberties and rights and to maintain the presumption of innocence until proven guilty.
Mr President, I voted for the Lehne report on combating money laundering.
The French term used for money laundering is 'blanchiment des capitaux' , which literally means 'bleaching or washing capital' , that is, making something white which was not white before, cleaning something which is dirty, making an ugly thing beautiful.
Well then, I thought: why can we too not manage to be as clever as criminals, who do succeed in making ugly things beautiful?
Why can we not manage to make ugly things beautiful too?
I refer, Mr President, not to myself, who some people might consider ugly, but to the pension laws throughout Europe.
Will we manage to make those ugly laws - and there are a great many of them - beautiful?
The European Parliament and the Council have therefore reached agreement on a conciliation package that has the value of appearing to do something against money laundering related to drugs offences, whilst doing nothing at all.
Who can tell the difference between the proceeds from organised crime and those from normal economic transactions?
Especially because the banking system itself does not want to make this distinction, as it believes that it is not the job of the banks to determine where the proceeds come from, only what the proceeds make.
And it is public knowledge that laundering of the proceeds from crime is not only carried out in tax havens; laundering also, and more importantly, goes on in the largest banks in the financial world.
If adopted, this resolution will certainly not prevent the proceeds from organised crime from passing through the financial system and from being invested in so-called normal activities, which are, in many cases, just as criminal as mafia money, if considered from a humane point of view.
It is absolutely scandalous to create one' s wealth out of drug money.
It is equally scandalous to make a fortune from manufacturing and trafficking weapons.
And it is even more scandalous to allow pharmaceutical corporations and their shareholders to become rich from having a monopoly on trademarks of some medicines, when this monopoly increases the price of some essential medicines by ten times or more, condemning to death all those who do not have the means to pay these prices.
This is all legal however.
The European institutions may have the power to decide what constitutes a legal or illegal way to use the proceeds.
They do not have the power to 'exonerate' the proceeds.
The directive on the fight against money laundering is a step in the right direction and is a response, at least in part, to the aspirations of the citizens' movements and to the proposals made by the judges who are the most involved in this issue.
The events of 11 September should, in fact, give us more reason to intensify the fight against money laundering.
The Lehne report does the opposite, however.
It welcomes a new paragraph, which is drafted in an absurd manner, since it states that 'Member States are not forced to impose the obligations, stipulated in the directive, on the professions concerned (members of the legal professions, independent or otherwise)' .
The sacrosanct professional secrecy is preserved, unless the legal advisor is himself involved in financial misdealing.
It is not enough for him to have 'specific reasons for believing' that 'his client wishes to obtain legal advice for the purpose of money laundering' . It is only if the lawyer 'knows' that this is the situation that professional secrecy can be lifted.
These delicate points clash horribly with recent, brutal decisions made by this very Parliament, which follows the example of the CIA and does not hesitate in wanting to make any individual demonstrating against financial crimes into a criminal.
In spite of these shortcomings, we did not vote against the Lehne report.
Maij-Weggen report (A5-0349/2001)
Mr President, I voted for this regulation on public access to European Parliament documents as well.
I have to say that, last Sunday, a pensioner from Bergamo, Mrs Erminia Santinelli, a young, active lady of 60, said to me: 'What good regulations you adopt at the European Parliament!
That might mean, then, that I will at last be able to see the documents as well!'
'What documents?' I asked her.
'The documents showing the way my pension is calculated,' she replied, 'for I still cannot understand how that figure was reached.
At last I will find out how my pension has been calculated, from the documents given to me to read.'
'Next time round' I told her.
'For the moment, we must be satisfied with reading the documents of the European Parliament.'
Mrs Maij-Weggen' s report on public access to Parliament documents is an advance we cannot but support.
We have, then, all voted in favour of 'the lesser evil' whereby a small advance towards more openness is better than nothing.
The problem is everything that is not included.
The main problem is that the Commission and the Council do not supply Parliament with documents from the phase during which legislation is prepared.
That is unfortunate in as much as it is this phase in which people have an interest in participating so as to be able to influence the content of the legislation.
A second problem is the division of MEPs into first and second class Members according to whether or not they have access to confidential information.
Moreover, it is completely insane and contrary to every parliamentary tradition that Parliament' s Committee on Budgetary Control, the ombudsman and the EU' s own Court of Auditors are never in a position to check all the documents concerning the Commission' s discharge of its office.
We voted against the report on 'Public access to Parliament' s documents' because this is a misleading title and the report aims not so much to widen the possibilities of access as to regulate them and, in doing so, grants the European Parliament the right to restrict public access.
On the one hand, we hypocritically acknowledge the right of the public to have access to documents, and, on the other, we admit that some of these documents are 'confidential' .
In actual fact, there is no reason why any document of the European Parliament or any other European institution, should be kept from the public.
We are in favour of the complete publication of all documents, all agreements, all treaties, as well as the details of all the speeches that are currently hidden, all the dealings that are kept secret, all the lobbying activities that have led Parliament, the Council or the European Commission to take a decision or to issue a directive.
. (NL) In days gone by, the interest of the state was protected from the citizen by secrecy.
These days, the impression is created that all government information is public in a democracy.
Despite this, there are quite a few exceptions on the basis of military or economic interests, and the extent of public access differs from Member State to Member State in the EU.
There are now two completely opposing views with regard to future public access to information in preparations for Community decision-making.
The first opinion, expressed by the rapporteurs Mrs Maij-Weggen and Mr Cashman, is that we have made great progress this year which will lead to optimal public access by 2002, with which everyone should be happy.
The second opinion, formulated by Messrs Martin and Bonde, and included in the amendments tabled by the Greens, is that the EP has, in fact, created unnecessary, self-imposed restrictions by striking deals with the Commission and the Council and that we have sadly not yet seen a majority in favour of total public access in this Parliament.
People may view the proposal as a step forward, but the most striking thing about it is what it is not saying.
Some of the documents of the Council and the Commission are still hidden from the public and Parliament.
I support the amendments which aim to further enhance public access.
Carnero GonzÃ¡lez report (A5-0346/2001)
Mr President, I voted for the Carnero GonzÃ¡lez report as well.
It would appear right that the same procedure applied when electing the members of permanent committees should be followed when electing the members of joint interparliamentary committees.
In any case, seeing as we are discussing how joint interparliamentary committees are elected, Mr President, I would stress the importance to the European Parliament of the joint committees including members of the parliaments of the candidate countries or including members of the countries with which we have close relations.
I call upon the European Parliament to confer increasing power upon these committees, for in that way we will see the fruit of the existence of the European Union and the European Parliament.
Cappato report (A-0374/2001)
Mr President, when, on 4 November, at the end of an important meeting I had held, in which I talked at length about Mr Cappato' s report - as you can see, Mr Cappato, like all the Members, is here in the Chamber to hear why I voted for his document, but I know that he usually watches me on the monitor in his office - I displayed his photograph, many young pensioners, instead of coming to ask for my autograph, which is what usually happens in large, important meetings held by important politicians, asked me to introduce them to Mr Cappato.
'We want to meet him!
He is a very good looking, extremely clever young man, and we congratulate him on this report!
Does this mean, then, that, at last, no one will know how old we are?
This is the sort of privacy we want!'
'Of course,' I told them.
This document will mean that no one will know how old a lady is.
.
The British Labour Members of the Socialist Group have voted in favour of national choice as to whether Member States will "opt-in" or "opt-out" on the reception of unsolicited commercial e-mails (UCEs).
This was the compromise reached in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs.
The revision of the e-commerce directive in 2003 will offer an opportunity to bring forward measures based on the experience of Member States which have opted in or opted out.
It is essential that any new measures in the area of e-commerce are based on direct experience of all those involved within the industry including consumers.
In the area of retention of traffic data, we believe that at second reading further amendments need to be considered.
We are all agreed that a certain level of protection of private life and of personal data is one of the foundations of a functioning democracy.
Modern means of communication and a recklessly expanding information society make this more important today than ever.
A wrongly-conceived protection of personal data can, however, have unwanted side-effects.
The Commission's text thus envisages a ban on advertising e-mails previously not expressly allowed by the consumer.
This so-called 'opt-in' principle flatly contradicts the principle, found elsewhere in the directive on e-commerce, that advertising is permitted unless the consumer has explicitly expressed a desire not to receive it.
This 'opt-out' of course costs nothing and requires no effort other than a simple click of the mouse, which is often sufficient for you to delete yourself from a database you do not want to be in.
Moreover, the e-commerce directive provides for several transparency conditions, so that, for example, advertising e-mails are recognisable as such by their titles and the recipient knows the sender before he even opens them.
An uninteresting e-mail can thus be deleted in seconds by the click of a mouse without the consumer having to waste further time, money or energy.
The unrestricted sending of advertising e-mails is, moreover, a boon particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises, which cannot afford to make use of expensive advertising campaigns on television or in other media.
Cutting them off from this opportunity to introduce themselves to a wide public at reasonable cost would quite clearly mean giving an even greater competitive advantage to the big national and multinational enterprises.
These considerations mean that I will be voting in favour of the text adopted in Committee on 'unwanted information'.
As in the vote on this report on 6 September 2001, I now choose to oppose the position adopted by my political group when it comes to the rules for sending unsolicited advertising material out to consumers via e-mail.
Generally speaking, e-mail advertisements involve inconvenience for the consumer, partly because it takes time to open and delete advertising communications.
Moreover, it is the consumer who has to bear the costs of receiving and reading the advertisements The division proposed in the report between, on the one hand, e-mail advertisements and, on the other hand, advertisements via text messaging, fax and automatic calling I also consider to be artificial.
Whichever of these methods is used, it causes just as much inconvenience for the consumer, and an opt-in solution is consequently to be preferred to all other methods since it constitutes the most effective protection against unsolicited advertisements.
In view of how important it is for this report to be adopted by Parliament as soon as possible, the compromise that is on the table must, however, be viewed as an acceptable, if ultimately less desirable, alternative.
In the final vote, I therefore choose to support the report, irrespective of what transpires with regard to the aforesaid issue.
Turco report (A5-0370/2001)
Mr President, I voted for Mr Turco' s document because I am in favour of all situations in which there is cooperation and agreement between all the States of the European Union.
I talked about Mr Turco' s document during my meeting on Sunday 4 November as well.
At the end, a lot of pensioners came up to me and asked: 'Does this mean, then, that we might have a European bobby on the beat at last?
We welcome any improvement in police activities coming from the European Parliament because here, in our State, we only have policemen who impose fines or come and arrest us.
It would be so nice to have friendly policemen!'
'This has not happened yet,' I replied, 'but I am sure that Mr Turco will take us another step closer in his next report and we might manage to achieve this too' .
- (DA) The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have, today, voted in favour of this report.
We agree that the EU and Europol should combat international crime and are therefore satisfied with the report as a whole.
We are nonetheless alert to the fact that certain amendments call upon legal cooperation and police cooperation to fall within the Community' s competence and that this is incompatible with Denmark' s reservation, cf. the protocol concerning Denmark' s position.
We do not support these amendments.
. (PT) On the pretext of fighting terrorism and the dangers inherent in deteriorating security, what we are seeing is the development and establishment of a huge, complex mechanism designed to limit freedoms, which could lead to the creation of a 'fortress Europe' in which this and other initiatives will be used as the reference point for the processing of personal data.
In the case of Portugal, for example, the fact that Europol considers the territory of Portugal to be the main point of entry into Europe, combined with the extension of its mandate to fight terrorism and organised crime, would turn our country into an area in which this body would feel particularly free to persecute and monitor people, unconstrained by the national police, the Minister for Home Affairs or by any real democratic control over its actions by the Portuguese Parliament.
These projects are intended to ensure cooperation between police forces, the information services and data filing systems, without any democratic control, under a restrictive and xenophobic immigration policy that infringes individual freedoms.
As a matter of fact, if there is no democratic control over the Schengen Information System now, what would be the case with regard to the transmission of information to third countries and bodies, largely sponsored by Europol and the American agencies, on the pretext of fighting terrorism?
Europol' s mandate must not take precedence over national policies or the control of Ministers for Home Affairs.
Its activities with regard to each country must be listed in internal security reports.
Europol must be subject, in all cases, to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice and account for itself, in detailed reports, to the European Parliament.
Any extension of Europol' s powers must, of course, be subject to prior debate by the European Parliament and by the national parliaments of the Member States.
.
I strongly support this excellent report by Maurizio Turco which calls for the extension of Europol's mandate and the addition of other non-binding arrangements.
If Europol's mandate is extended to cover serious forms of international crime, such as kidnapping, illegal immigrant smuggling and racism, this body will become an institution with real biting power and one which can be seen as working in the interests and for the safety of European citizens.
Moreover, the Swedish proposal to allow the onward transmission by third countries of personal data received from Europol is particularly important.
It is well known that crime in the twenty-first century is borderless, and as such the EU should not and cannot operate Europol in a vacuum.
This is why it is essential that Europol works in conjunction with third party states since only then will its full effectiveness be realised.
Kirkhope report (A-0369/2001)
Mr President, I voted for the Council' s framework decision on joint investigation teams.
Forgive me, Mr President, for giving rein to my imagination, but while we were discussing European joint investigation teams, I imagined investigation teams which included women, dressed in the same uniform, a common uniform for policewomen.
I then wondered when we will vote on the type of uniform these women from the joint investigation teams are going to wear and who will model them so that we can give our opinions?
And who will chair the panel which will have to watch the fashion show of policewomen' s uniforms?
Might it be you, Mr President?
Or Mrs Theorin, who is chairperson of the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities.
Anyway, joking aside, what I am trying to say is that I am in favour of joint investigation teams, of European policemen and women.
.
I strongly support this excellent report by Timothy Kirkhope which calls for a framework decision on setting up joint investigation teams.
This decision opens the way for the full implementation of the EU convention which calls for mutual assistance in criminal matters.
Police cooperation at EU level is a relatively new and innovative idea.
Without cooperation in these kinds of matters, individual Member States cannot hope to solve and combat the new kinds of crime that presently face all Member State police forces.
In addition, the report calls for joint investigation teams which should be available not only to combat drugs trafficking and human beings, but also to ward off organised crime.
Once joint investigations really take off and Member States come to fully realise their effectiveness, their remit could and should widen to include these kinds of issues.
Finally, as the report indicates, there is a real and valid role for the European Parliament in matters pertaining to joint police initiatives.
The call for some kind of review mechanism, whereby the Council accounts for and reports to the European Parliament on the effectiveness of joint initiatives, will make this process more open and transparent and therefore more legitimate.
Marinho report (A-0371/2001)
Fatuzzo (PPE-DE).
(IT) Mr President, I voted for the Marinho report because it provides for the mutual recognition of court sentences and decisions on the implementation of the Schengen acquis.
However, as a representative of the Pensioners' Party, I am not in favour of the mutual recognition of decisions.
This is not something which furthers European integration: we need common rules in both civil and criminal law.
If we do not achieve this but are content just to implement mutual recognition of decisions, we will be taking a step backwards in the practical integration of Europe.
We will only have a Europe which is genuinely fully functional when we move on from the mutual recognition of decisions to common rules which are the same throughout the European Union.
Then there will be no need to recognise the decisions of other States because the decisions of each Member State will be the decisions of all the States.
Vander Taelen report (A5-0351/2001)
Mr President, as representative of the Pensioners' Party, whose members include a large number of pensioners and elderly people who, having a lot of free time, watch the films and other products of world film-making either directly in cinemas or sitting comfortably at home in front of the television - a huge number of films are broadcast on television - I support Mr Vander Taelen' s document, which, like the Commission, calls for more support for European film-making.
I would stress, Mr President, the importance, as this document points out, of deciding to promote the circulation of European films, not just in Europe as it is today but also in the Europe of the future, in the enlarged Europe which includes the candidate countries.
If we really want to create a greater European culture than the one we have today, which, I regret to say, leaves something to be desired, it is vital that we dedicate even more funds to the circulation of European films within Europe.
The author of this report condemns the fact that the European film industry has been gradually stifled by the major Hollywood productions.
We did not vote against this report as we support some of its proposals.
However, we did not approve of the report either, because the root of the problem is that, as in many other industries, in art and literature for example, the film industry is, in the current economic hierarchy, simply a marketable product and that the film industry, as all other industries, has to obey the law of profitability.
Contrary to what the text claims to be nationalist feelings, the problem is not that of the domination of American cinema, but that of the domination of the major corporations, over the cinema market in the United States - where independent film-makers have just as much difficulty in holding out against the production of large companies as European film-makers - and over the global market.
The author of the report, a supporter, surely, of the market economy, is sensitive, however, to the irrational and harmful effect of the law of profitability in the film industry.
But the law of profitability is not more rational where consumer products, such as food, clothing, medicines or even jobs are concerned - it is, undoubtedly, more harmful still.
The Vander Taelen report announces the European Parliament's intention to promote the European film industry and reinforce it against the strength in the market of its American competition.
This concern also meets with the approval of the Group of Socialist MEPs, who have therefore voted in favour of the report, although they have substantial reservations about the statements made under item 8.
This is an attempt, detached from the debate just beginning on revision of the 'television without frontiers' directive, to force the amendment of one point in a particular direction, one highly dubious from the point of view of content and law.
Cultural, and therefore broadcasting, sovereignty belongs to the Member States alone.
Item 8 would in practice mean massive interference in the programming autonomy of both public-service and private-sector broadcasters.
It would, over and above that, offend against the authority of national public-service broadcasting organisations enshrined in the Protocol to the Treaty of Amsterdam.
The success, or lack of it, of European audio-visual productions is not determined by extending protectionist measures, but by the marketability and competitiveness of such productions.
There is no doubt that a structural weakness is revealed by the fact that it is exceptional for European audio-visual works to cross the borders of their country of origin.
Consideration should therefore be given to systems of incentives for the distribution of non-national European films.
The restrictions described in Item 8 are, however, the wrong way to go about it.
The European film industry has problems distributing its films on the scale that we should perhaps wish.
The proposals put forward by the report do not however solve these problems.
They are based on the erroneous belief that increased State and EU aid can make an industry competitive.
They also show a lack of respect for free choice on the part of the consumer.
There is also a desire to impose a further item of expenditure on the European Investment Bank, parallel to the Bank' s main responsibilities.
If TV companies were to be forced to adjust their programming in the interests of European cinema, this would constitute an infringement of their freedom.
It might also be asked whether it is reasonable for European schools to be required to support the film industry through their teaching.
For these reasons, I have chosen to vote against the report.
Maat report (A5-0347/2001)
Mr President, I would like to say that it was with conviction that I voted for this report, for I hope that it will enable us to respond adequately to the demands of the people, the producers and all the consumers too.
I feel that we have erred in the past in that we have failed to implement and monitor the existing directive adequately.
In my opinion, the transportation of animals is a major issue and that it is something which almost all of us feel to be important.
It is no longer just an economic issue; it has taken on an ethical dimension.
Therefore, I welcome the increase both in regionalisation and controls, and I hope that, in the future, the contributions for the export of live animals will be abolished.
Mr President, how could I not vote for this document protecting animals, which, although certainly destined for a cruel fate, should at least be treated as beings that deserve our respect and our protection in matters of transportation, as Mr Ebner has just said.
However, I would ask you, Mr President, when we are going to do something for the dogs in Bucharest.
While we are on the subject of animals, Mr President, I cannot fail to take this opportunity to tell you about the stray dogs in the city of Bucharest. They have no owners and should be caught and sterilised, but, instead, they are the victims of indiscriminate hunting by the people of the city, who receive a reward for every dog they kill and whose body they take to the mayor as proof.
As I see it, the real villain is the mayor of Bucharest, not the poor dogs killed in the city.
I hope that we will soon do something to improve this situation as well.
Mr Fatuzzo, don' t forget to tell us what the mayor of Bucharest says when he reads your explanation of vote.
. (NL) Animals are not products.
They are living creatures whose well-being we must aim to protect.
Given the many cases of abuse during the long-haul transport of animals for slaughter, this transport should be abolished.
We have not got there yet, although the Commission measures are heading in the right direction, with the restriction on distance of 500 km and a maximum duration of 8 hours.
This will also help reduce the risk of spreading animal diseases.
That is why we have approved the report.
To date, the Commission has actually promoted this long-haul transport with its subsidy policy.
Similarly, the policy that has led to the disappearance of small slaughterhouses, including in remote areas, has had pernicious effects.
This policy should therefore be reviewed as a matter of urgency.
A great deal will depend on the policy of the Member States that have so far been very negligent, among other things by inadequately monitoring compliance with the animal welfare directives.
. (NL) Over the years, transport by road has become increasingly cheap, relatively speaking.
That is why all kinds of goods are continuously being hauled back and forth to places where the raw materials or labour are cheap, or where the expected profits are the highest.
It is even worse if living creatures are involved.
For example, discarded work horses from Eastern Europe are transported en masse to Western Europe to be slaughtered there.
During this transport, they incur fractures, they do not get any water or feed, and animal diseases are quickly spread across Europe.
Since a political majority wishes to protect the interests of the traders and carriers involved, various petitions organised over the years have failed to improve the situation.
Nearly a year ago, the European Commission responded to me that the solution is to improve the ventilation of animal trucks.
I fear that this non-legislative advice based on experience gathered from applying existing directives will not really solve the problem either.
However, the proposals by Mr Maat to limit transport for slaughter or fattening to eight hours or 500 km, to increase the penalties for infringements, to re-open the smaller, regional slaughterhouses that were closed down by EU legislation, and to abolish export subsidies for live animals for slaughter constitute a necessary step forward.
The deficiencies of current agricultural policy are evident.
The existing system only serves to promote the transport of animals.
This trade is, at least in part, truly absurd.
For example, Spain imports sheep for slaughter from the United Kingdom, while at the same time exporting sheep to be slaughtered in Greece.
We must aim to abolish the promotion of the transport of live animals.
It is indefensible in the long term that EU funds are used for this purpose.
The only possibility of putting an end to the long-distance transport of livestock lies in the regionalisation of agriculture policy.
The watchword must be: production in the market, for the market.
This would also make it possible to effectively counteract the spread of diseases.
.
I strongly support this excellent report by Mr Maat which reviews the 1995 directive designed to ensure protection for animals enduring long journeys.
The report is balanced and fair in that it recognises the possible negative role initially played by EU legislation: this called for the closure of many small slaughterhouses in the first place and made animal transportation more necessary and prevalent.
It also exposes the present lamentable situation whereby the provisions of the 1995 directive are often flouted and where some Member States fail to implement existing legislation.
The call for increased protection of animals during transit is both necessary and worthwhile; as the report indicates, this should be legally enforceable whereby those countries who fail to comply with the rules will be charged a fine.
This would act as a real and concrete disincentive for flouting the law.
In addition to the call for increased and harder legislation in this domain, practical measures are suggested, such as promoting the opening of small-scale abattoirs.
Lastly, this report calls for these tougher measures to be also applicable to third party countries.
This is both a positive and substantive move since EU Member States import livestock from outside the EU's borders and it would be counter-productive to have these enhanced rules operating exclusively in the EU without any regard for the unfair practices that operate outside its borders.
Langen report (A5-0361/2001)
The Commission' s communication of 20 September 2000 on services of general interest in Europe reviews its position in order to take into account recent developments in the case law of the Court of Justice, and also the will of Heads of State, expressed at various European Councils (at Amsterdam and Nice in particular) to show greater respect for the specific nature of the missions of public service.
This new communication, however, pushes us into a difficult position.
Apparently brimming with good intentions, the Commission is proposing to define the limits of public services and competition rules, to grant derogations for State aid to activities of general economic benefit, to put in place systems to evaluate the performance of public services and so on.
In fact, the Commission is behaving as if the articles of the treaty on competition were universally applicable, and as if it was up to the Commission to say, out of kindness, the extent to which they will be applied.
The Commission is giving itself the role of arbitrator.
The treaty, however, does not give it any right to do this.
Although the Treaty of Rome only mentioned public services in passing, this is because those who drafted the treaty thought it went without saying that public services did not fall under European competences.
Even Article 16 of the TEC, introduced under the Treaty of Amsterdam, does not amend this position.
We must, however, be very attentive to the Commission' s attempts to wield imperialist powers.
We believe, in particular, that the memorandum issued by France on 27 July 2001, despite being full of good intentions, falls into this trap, by proposing to draft a framework directive to set objectives for services of general economic interest and also the freedoms and obligations of Member States with regard to these.
This is another example of a European text that can be interpreted in many different ways and is subject to European arbitration.
In reality, all we need is a new article in the treaty to confirm the evidence, in other words, the sovereign right of Member States to define and organise their public services independently, whether these are general services or services of economic interest.
We were unable to support a report that places us in the position of observer.
Too many amendments, which could give a sign that a change is underway in tendency and approach, as we expressed in Amendment No 59, were not adopted today.
To leave public services to the mercy of the rules of competition is to seriously threaten the regional development and the social cohesion of our States.
This represents a step backwards for users and is being taken with disregard for the principle of subsidiarity, which is, in fact, emphasised in all our texts.
This new move is a lost opportunity for the European Parliament to show that it is listening to its citizens.
As far as we are concerned, we will continue to fight so that the Laeken European Council becomes the opportunity to take a step forward for the good of citizens.
At the Lisbon European Council in March 2000, European governments decided to 'increase the pace of liberalisation in sectors such as gas, electricity, postal services and transport' .
The Commission and the European Parliament, by means of the Langen report, are supporting this process of 'selling off' the methods we use to meet our citizens' basic social needs, and are thus strengthening the domination of markets over our societies.
We all know, however, that in sectors that have already been liberalised, the expected gains in productivity have not been met; that the erosion of public services has caused standards of quality of service and of safety to fall; that, for employees, the 'gradual and controlled' opening up to market forces has led to staff cuts and greater job insecurity, and has caused inequalities in regional development.
Is this the European model of society that the European Union desires?
We believe that we must urgently block the liberalisation process and re-appropriate public services by freeing them from the markets.
Regarding the liberalisation of services of general interest, we are opposed to coordinating public services at European level, and even creating public Euro-services within the framework of common policies of general interest, through state-owned businesses, involving users and employees, over the long term, and making use of the most advanced techniques.
We reject the Langen report for this specific reason.
.
The ELDR Group voted against in the final vote on the Langen report, because its members are not convinced that a framework directive on services of general interest (SGI) is a good idea.
At least we want to wait for the Commission's reflections on the desirability and feasibility of a framework directive on SGIs before we insist on such a proposal.
Another reason for our vote against is the ambiguous wordings on the need to stick to the Lisbon agenda.
We found that the text was too watered down (for example in the votes pertaining to par. 33).
Liberals also find that the report, through amendments both in committee and in plenary, had become too long, inconsistent and incoherent and that it therefore, unfortunately, no longer presented any added value to the debate on SGIs.
. (EL) Services of general interest, the purpose of which should be to provide the best possible services to the entire public, are being handed over to private, profit-making companies which trade in social commodities purely on a maximum profit basis within the so-called free market economy.
This is the objective of the ÃU, to step up the liberalisation which it started in the transport, electricity, natural gas, postal and water sectors.
The only justification for this anti-grass roots approach is the contention that it will improve the competitiveness of the economy.
It completely overlooks the quality of these services and the fact that, once they have been liberalised, one section of the population will be denied access to these services because it will be unable to afford the prices charged by the companies which agree to manage them.
The basic aim of liberalisation is to hand these services over to the private sector for speculative purposes.
This will have adverse repercussions on the workers, in the form of the increased prices for the services provided and, more importantly, the waves of redundancies and flexible types of employment which always replace traditional forms of employment in the wake of privatisation.
Our experience of market liberalisation and privatisation in Europe and other countries has shown us that the quality of services falls, prices rise and jobs are cut back drastically, as the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs admits in its opinion.
In Greece, for example, the price per unit for local and long distance calls has risen over tenfold and profits have risen a hundredfold since Greek Telecom and mobile telephony were privatised.
And instead of the flourishing of the arts anticipated from the privatisation of radio and television, broadcasting companies are dumbing down and distorting culture, disorientating and misleading the public.
Public utilities are not only economically important to each country; they are also strategically important from the point of view of the security and independence of each country, especially in times of economic or other crisis.
We oppose all forms of privatisation and contend that privatised companies should be returned to the public sector and improved and modernised so that they can provide cheap, high quality services, serve the working classes and act as a driving force behind the grass-roots economy.
That is why we shall be voting against the report.
Passenger transport by rail, road and inland waterway
The next item on the agenda is the Report (A5-0364/2001) by Mr Meijer on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council [COM(2000) 7 - C5-0326/2000 - 2000/0212(COD)] on action by Member States concerning public service requirements and the award of public service contracts in passenger transport by rail, road and inland waterway.
Mr President, many private companies have withdrawn from public transport since it became permanently loss-making as a result of the large-scale distribution of the car.
Public transport is necessary for access, the environment and for reducing the pressure on public space and cannot survive without extensive government funding.
Like education and welfare provisions, public transport is more a core task of the government than it is part of the market.
Unfortunately, this Regulation has been preceded for some years now by a rumour in a number of Member States that the EU is committed to privatisation and competition.
When I was appointed rapporteur a year ago, I was put under pressure to have the report ready for first reading in the first half of 2001 during the Swedish Presidency of the Council.
Had I succumbed to that pressure, it would have been impossible to have more than one hundred investigative interviews with organisations, including national associations of municipalities, trade unions and different types of transport companies.
I gleaned very opposing interests and views from these conversations.
Public transport is regulated very differently in each Member State and in each of its regions.
Much community funding has gone into buying up old private companies that failed to offer adequate public transport, particularly in densely populated urban areas and for rail connections.
This is in contrast to many small bus companies operating a few bus services in thinly populated areas that have now been bought by large, fast-growing bus companies operating in different States.
If the European Commission is of the opinion that the award of contracts for transport areas to such companies should not be based on nepotism or judicial verdicts but rather, on objective standards and openness, then this Parliament shares this point of view, and so does the rapporteur.
In this way, the Commission helps those areas where the municipal or regional governments would like to contract out their public transport apply useful rules so as to be able to choose between a few large companies, such Arriva, Vivendi or Deutsche Bahn.
Unfortunately, the Commission proposal applies the same obligation to contract out to areas which, based on practical experience, prefer the sustainable existence of one of the country' s own public companies or the continuation of a long-term contract with a small, private company.
Precisely this restriction of freedom of choice makes the Commission proposal extremely controversial.
It particularly affects countries such as Belgium, Luxembourg, France, Germany and Austria.
But also in the Netherlands, which led the way in privatisation and liberalisation, the disadvantages of a disorganised rail company and of delayed growth in public transport in densely populated areas are now emerging.
The rule that applies to every government is that it is appreciated by the people if it helps solve problems and maligned if it creates unnecessary problems.
European legislation can be useful if it makes a vital contribution to solving our joint and cross-border problems.
Far-reaching, centralistic intervention in municipal and regional policy certainly forms no part of this.
No one will be satisfied if such intervention soon appears to result in fewer public services, higher consumer prices, worse working conditions, fewer new tram lines, the termination of free urban transport, the supremacy of a monopoly and the erosion of democratic participation.
The compulsory introduction of competition in this case does not mean the emergence of an ordinary market; instead it means promoting a battle for securing government subsidies for permanently loss-making businesses that want to take over government tasks.
According to many experts, the introduction of an obligation to tender for passenger transport by rail, road and inland waterways goes beyond the powers of the European Union.
On account of this obligation, the importance of providing public services and the well being of the user are being subordinated to attempts to cut down on labour costs.
If this proposal for a regulation were to be accepted unamended, it would spell doom for small companies, including virtually all public companies.
Although the municipal tram company or the local bus company can also take part in the tender, these companies will go under as soon as they lose the tender at some point in the future.
Only large, cash-rich companies with many diverse transport areas can survive such a system in a sustainable manner.
It is exactly this crucial aspect of the tender obligation pertaining to all public transport that attracts criticism.
On 10 October, it appeared that the majority of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism had accepted the gist of what I had proposed or what Mr Piecyk and others had developed by way of alternatives on the back of my proposal.
Tram, underground and short bus services remain outside the obligation, while employment and the environment are better protected.
If the plenary follows the same line of thinking, we could save ourselves a great deal of upheaval and bother.
Mr President, it is with particular pleasure that I contribute to the debate on a very important report dealing with the opening of the market to competition in key parts of our public sector.
The Committee on Legal Affairs considered that the key elements of the proposals were sound, but differed in its opinion on a number of key issues.
Firstly, some of the amendments proposed gave exemptions to what are known as integrated transport systems, yet we all know that transport, and particularly integrated transport, is a matter of organisation and not ownership.
This would merely be protectionism by the back door.
Secondly, there was concern that some of the proposals would allow for predatory bidding by exempted sectors for those parts of the transport industry which, in the case of my own country for example, are already liberalised.
Thirdly, the de minimis provisions failed to meet realistic levels to allow competition to take place in the open market.
Finally, there was concern that the level of public subsidy taken into account in drawing up contracts would not allow the continuation of socially needed routes nor provide adequate recognition of contribution towards fares, for example for the less fortunate, such as the elderly or disabled.
The report which finally emerged goes some way to addressing these issues.
However, I fear that some of the amendments included in the final report would also introduce extraneous non-commercial considerations into what should be a completely open and transparent competitive system within the EU.
For example, the issues already mentioned relating to environment and social policy are not in themselves relevant to the contract tendering process but should be dealt with under separate legislation.
That is why I draw your attention to these matters and why this report should be seen as merely the first step towards the liberalisation of the market in this sector and not as an end in itself.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
(FR) Mr President, I can say that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which has been asked for its opinion, widely supported the proposals put forward by the European Commission.
In a series of amendments which were passed on to the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, the Commission was careful to extend the length of contracts, for which operators apply in response to calls for tender.
The Commission also tabled a number of amendments to increase the content of management contracts set out in the Commission regulation, particularly under the social chapter.
Lastly, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs supports the idea that we must ensure that the objectives of sustainable transport are taken into consideration in the management contracts and this is duly taken into account by the competent authorities, particularly with regard to the integration and interoperability between bus transport, which is precisely the subject of our debate, and other types of transport.
Nonetheless, the Committee regrets that this proposal for a regulation was presented before a discussion could be held. With regard to rail issues, the second railway package and also services of general interest, which we discussed this morning, it would clearly have been more logical to first adopt a framework directive on services of general interest before having to discuss the same services of general interest on a sector-by-sector, directive-by-directive basis.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Meijer, I would like to say in advance that I actually want to say a word of thanks to you, as I know with what commitment you have sought to introduce this subject and how many discussions you have had in order to produce some sort of proposal.
I must, though, say on this point that I cannot go along with broad areas of your proposal.
There is, in principle, nothing new about what we are discussing today.
When, in the summer of 2000, the regulation at last emerged from the Commission, reached Parliament, and then the first discussions were held with trade unions and the representatives of local transport bodies and voluntary organisations, everything was clear: There was to be controlled competition.
This had been the aim for years, and now we only had to deal with the questions of how long future contracts should run for and when the regulation was to enter into force, in other words, when would the first tenders actually be invited and the first contracts awarded?
There was the additional question of what exceptions there should be to the obligation to put contracts out to tender.
All that had its part to play, as did the recurrently raised issue of social dumping, that is, the danger that tenders would lead to the employment of especially cheap labour.
We came to a consensus.
We wanted controlled competition without privatisation. The two are always confused with one another.
Privatisation is not automatically connected with it.
All that is involved is that local transport bodies no longer automatically come into the enjoyment of substantial subsidies from regional, national or local funds without having to compete for them, but contracts will now have to be put out to tender.
We all know that local transport bodies, who know this themselves, basically offer their product at too high a price.
The cause of this is to be found in the fact that it is in the public sector that trade unions have always been very successful in pay negotiations in recent decades.
It is a truism, to give just one example, that the personnel costs of private bus companies are some 35-40% lower than in the public sector.
Competition also opens up the possibility of us being in a position, in the future, to buy in transport services more cheaply, without a local authority being able to evade its responsibilities in the process.
It is not the case that they are being privatised.
There will continue to be a State office with responsibility for ensuring that public transport carries on.
I can see the opportunity of using the resources saved by buying-in transport at more favourable rates to buy in more transport in the future, thereby making short-distance transport more attractive and achieving all that was said at the outset, namely making transport so attractive, that more people will use it in the future.
Let me say that, following these lengthy preliminaries, I think there has almost been a catastrophe, because Mr Meijer was evidently unsure which way he should go, and proposed that, in future, the responsible bodies, whether the regional or local government, should be entitled to decide whether or not to invite tenders.
I forecast that if this right to choose, which is to be introduced into the bill by means of Amendment No 61 and Article 7a, becomes reality, there will be no competition, because pressure from the transport companies, trade unions, and associations will be so great as to be irresistible, and contracts will continue to be awarded automatically.
Though we can disagree about many details, I therefore beg you, ladies and gentlemen, to seriously reconsider your decision tomorrow and not to vote in favour of Amendment No 61, so that contracts will continue to have to be put out to tender, exceptions being made for rural areas where only small sums are involved, but let us march in the same direction.
Mr President, you will not be surprised to learn that I see things in quite the opposite way to Mr Schmitt.
What is true is that we need a European legal framework for public local transport, as there is legal uncertainty and the market has already been opened up.
The question is, though, how closely to the citizens Europe's decisions must be taken on a given subject.
Local public transport is, in my view, primarily the responsibility of local authorities and that is how it should stay.
Towns and parishes should themselves decide whether they want to run their local public transport by their own enterprise, and then whether they are able to do so.
It is also clear that those who say they are going to do it themselves must not be allowed to compete elsewhere.
I wish to thank Mr Meijer, the rapporteur, for pursuing this basic idea with, if I may say so, a certain stubbornness, as this issue of community decision-making is an important point.
My second point is that where there is competition in local public transport provision, it can lead to minimal wages and social dumping.
My dear Mr Schmitt, a bus driver working on regular services does not earn a fortune - barely DM 200 above the social security rate in Germany.
It is for that reason that social minima must be maintained when there is a change of operator.
My third point is that local public transport is run in many Member States' rural areas by small and medium-sized enterprises.
These must not be unnecessarily squeezed out of the market, quite the contrary.
I believe they must also have a chance in the market when routes or networks are awarded directly.
The situation prevails in any case, in many areas of Germany, that up to 90% of local public transport is to and from schools, and here too, the direct awarding of contracts must be given more of a chance.
I think we can agree that the Commission's time limits for contracts and handing-over are both too short, and we strove together for their extension.
As regards the other things, our opinions simply differ and, unlike Mr Schmitt, I believe that tomorrow will not see a catastrophe, but that we will be very close to the communities in deciding in their favour on public local transport.
Mr President, I wish, first of all, to thank the rapporteur, Mr Meijer, for preparing the report; he has done a great deal of work on this complicated issue.
The interests of passengers must be borne in mind in the development of public transport.
It must be made into such an attractive alternative that more and more people will be happy to opt for public transportation.
This is highlighted particularly in towns where it is necessary to find ways of solving environmental problems and the difficulties caused by traffic jams.
Signing agreements when organising public transport services is the correct procedure in cases where such agreements enjoy public subsidy.
With a combination of open and controlled competition it is possible to achieve a higher degree of efficacy and a better level of service.
Competition is also really needed in this industry.
There should be some room for flexibility in the application to enable Member States to retain any proven procedures that they have applied previously.
In my own home country such successful solutions include the fixed route transport licensing system and the town and district ticket systems.
This is corroborated by an amendment relating to Article 3, item c. The aim of this is to prevent the formation of local and regional monopolies and to enable competition as far as possible.
Another objective is to safeguard public transport systems that function well in countries with sparse populations where distances are great.
Arguments relating to transport safety and to minimising the number of accidents are also in favour of the public transport option.
For these objectives to be achieved, legislative flexibility is called for.
It should be possible to opt for solutions that are best suited to various conditions and to each operating environment.
Such solutions should be practically oriented and they should be implemented in cooperation with local and regional operators.
Mr President, the main problem with the Commission's proposal is that local public transport is subordinated to the objective of 'free competition' alone.
Some in this House may well welcome this, but I consider it a fundamental error.
It is the objectives of transport policy that local public transport must primarily serve.
It is also a European issue, how can the local public transport service improve the mobility of all citizens, including those who, not being car-owners, have no alternative to it, schoolchildren, large families, pensioners, disabled people, people on limited incomes?
Ensuring sustainable basic mobility in accordance with town and country planning is therefore the prime objective for local public transport.
Specific local situations mean that this can be achieved in a wide variety of ways.
So, to this day, I cannot understand why the Commission chose to do this by means of a regulation without considering the possibilities afforded by a directive, as this is a typical case where the subsidiarity principle applies.
I also wonder how it is that the Commission is also choosing the form of the regulation, at the same time as bringing out the White Paper on European governance.
According to this White Paper, it wants to reinforce local autonomy, and here it is interfering.
Hence the question as to how such a regulation can make real the principle of reinforced local autonomy in European governance?
Let me finally return to the offering of contracts for tender.
Of course contracts must be put out to tender.
But the process must highlight firstly transport policy, secondly environmental policy and thirdly social policy, which should lead to optimised mobility for our electorate.
Mr President, my colleague Erik Meijer's report is of the greatest interest, as it touches on a core issue in services of general interest, that is, the guaranteeing of citizens' mobility within their immediate surroundings.
This fundamental citizens' right was formerly predominantly guaranteed by local public services and their agents.
As local public transport is mainly unprofitable, services are subsidised by the local authorities, which of course makes the local transport market interesting for private-sector service providers.
The public local transport market in Germany alone is valued at some DM 30 billion.
The creation of the internal market and the rise of international companies offering public transport services has led to a conflict between the previous practice of awarding transport concessions directly to local service providers on the one hand, and the international firms on the other.
The Commission has therefore proposed to give competitive rules the edge over public interest and to create a new and binding obligation to put contracts out to tender.
The rapporteur is, in my view quite right to question this procedure.
He would give local authorities the right to decide for themselves how contracts are to be awarded. That is democracy; that is the subsidiarity principle.
There must be no interference by the European Union in the conditions applied at local and regional level.
I see this as a fundamental issue, as it is evidence of real subsidiarity.
I appeal to my fellow Members of this House, although I know that there is little point in doing so, to support this position.
We had many meetings and discussions with local, regional, national and international operating companies and interest groups, so of course highly detailed proposals were the result.
Now, you do not have to agree with all these suggestions, but the basic line taken by the Meijer report corresponds to the demands of local public transport as seen by local authorities and operators, does not, contrary to what you said, Mr Schmitt, exclude the possibility of introducing competition, and safeguards local and regional transport services accessible to all and which citizens can afford.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my serious concern regarding the first reading of this report that we are to debate today, even in spite of the remarkable work that Mr Meijer has done. We also support most of the amendments that he has tabled.
However, on the deceptive pretext of seeking to make financial compensation from Member States to service providers compatible with Community legislation and to award public service transport contracts that are already open to private service providers, the Commission is once again attempting to work well outside its area of competence.
By encroaching on the Member States' methods of public management, the Commission is making a direct attack on local authorities' freedom of management, and it must be said that, in doing so, it is denouncing the direct rule method of management used in France, which has proved its worth for many years.
This shows that the aim is not to achieve better service for the benefit of the user, but to actually create, using liberal dogma, the internal market.
In other sectors, such as telecommunications, energy and the postal services, it is freedom of choice that is at stake and, therefore, the very concept of public service.
In addition to the attack on the constitutional principle of freedom of administrative choice for local authorities, this is, more broadly speaking, an attack on the public sovereignty of Member States.
Freedom of choice in public services and in its method of management, freedom of choice in terms of provider, partial freedom in sub-contracting, freedom to set prices and freedom of compensation are freedoms of Member States and their local authorities that have been withdrawn.
Beyond the State, it is the citizen/user who will be slain on the altar of Community liberalism, because this proposal is a direct attack on local authority, which is the closest to the citizen and therefore is in the best position to manage the difficulties experienced by citizens on the ground.
They already have the least power, in the less affluent areas which are even at risk of having no services at all.
The social partners made no mistake, when they warned their MEPs at the vote in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.
This illustrates perfectly the danger that everyone has spotted, and we are not dealing with subsidiarity that has been reintroduced here and there, or the odd possibility of derogating from the procedure that has been put in place, which should be enough to stop us seeing the truth. The citizen will see through this.
To sum up, I have reason to doubt this European project that, faced with ignorance and, at times, the distrust of our citizens, responds in a technocratic and dogmatic fashion by trying to wrestle power from the States and from local authorities, which efficiently manage the daily lives of citizens.
We cannot accept these proposals and that is why we demand this report is rejected.
Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, we should begin by saying to those watching us, who have found their way here in greater numbers than we MEPs, that we do not differ as regards our objective.
We all want the best possible local public transport at the lowest cost to taxpayers and passengers.
That is our common objective.
We now have to deal with the question of how best to go in that direction.
If your proposal is propaganda from the left of this House for the right of communities and regions to exercise free choice, then I can only say that the past fourteen years have demonstrated that free choice is to the citizens' disadvantage.
What, then, is the position?
In most towns and communities, services by the communities are being reduced and the subsidies are on the up and up.
So the reality is that we cannot carry on with the present system if we want a good, efficient, public transport service at local and regional level.
So we say we must put them out to tender, so that citizens get the best modern buses at the best price, with the best quality, and arriving as often as possible.
That is the objective we have set.
I can tell the gentleman from the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities that, secondly, there is the Community Treaty, the Treaty on the European Community, in which it is stated that everyone shall have the right to provide services.
Freedom of services can be restricted only on the basis of a greater good.
The free will of a village community is not sufficient to say that one should limit the freedom of services under Community law in village A or village B. You need carefully-controlled legislation to be able to limit the freedom of services by reason of a higher good.
That is what we are doing.
If, though, you give communities back their free choice, you are suspending the justification for limiting the freedom of services, so, no matter what we agree on, be it journey times or whatever else, we need a proper framework for a controlled competitive order, and the free choice you propose undermines that, as we need sensible Community regulations to limit the freedom of services.
Mr President, I feel that it is perfectly legitimate for the European Union to equip itself with common rules whenever we introduce competition into local public services.
I feel that it is infinitely less legitimate to seek to withdraw a method of management and to introduce competition within the field of transport and to use case law to extend this to all the other fields in the future, through a regulation which is not transposed by the national parliaments.
I have several reasons for this view.
The first is that the private sector has not always performed better and I urge my fellow Members to come and see what is happening in France, in the water industry, which has been largely opened up to the private sector.
Cartels have sprung up, which are no longer controlled by the local authorities and which currently supply water at higher prices than the local authorities, which remain under direct management.
On the other hand, we must not consider direct management to be a better method, but simply that the two methods of management must co-exist.
Secondly, this goes against the principle of subsidiarity.
If subsidiarity means anything at all, then it most certainly means the freedom of administrative choice of local authoridies and the constitutional provisions of most Member States, under which decentralisation now gives freedom of choice to the mayors, regional leaders and heads of local authorities.
There is therefore a genuine political problem posed by this regulation.
I do not think anyone can deny this.
Lastly, we must also be very clear on this question. Whenever a mayor chooses direct management, he cannot turn to external markets.
Who knows of a school bus service, in a rural area, managed by the local authority, that has to rely upon external markets?
This is not a problem that exists in reality.
On the other hand, whenever public services are delegated or an exclusive choice is made by a business, which is, itself, competitive, this company can turn to the external markets.
That is why I believe that we must impose the principle of reciprocity.
In any case, however, we cannot give up direct rule as a method of management.
Mr President, to get legal clarity on tendering rules in the EU, unfortunately the committee voted to delete most of the specific exemptions in favour of one very wide one, Amendment No 61.
But it is open to legal and political challenge to simply cite democratic decision-making as a justification for exemption from EU legal rules for the internal market.
I therefore commend the specific amendments from the ELDR Group - Amendments Nos 110 to 112.
These would mean that authorities would be justified in not tendering metro and tram services if there were good reasons of cost, safety or risk of creating a permanent private monopoly rather than competition.
Any claim for exemption would have to be justified to the European Commission.
In addition, there are provisions for direct award of contracts in the absence of tenders or in emergencies.
I appeal in particular to the left of this House.
You take a big risk if you rely only on Amendments Nos 61 and 62.
They may not survive the course and as an insurance policy we need specific provisions to protect large complex metro systems like London's from being split up for tendering or risking becoming a private monopoly.
Mr President, European transport policy is not really a page of glory in the annals of the European Union.
Too little, too late, not really consistent, those are only some of the features criticised as being characteristic of European Union policy to date and justifications for criticising it.
The present Commission is investing a lot of commitment in attempting to counteract this.
The proposal for a regulation on local public transport belongs to the legislative package with which some past errors are, admittedly belatedly, to be repaired.
Some of the internal market philosophy is also to acquire significance in the transport sector.
Controlled competition, not total liberalisation and certainly not privatisation at any cost, was said to be on the way.
One unfortunately has to say 'was' as what the competent Parliamentary Committee has produced as a compromise signals a return to the old and unsatisfactory situation.
In order that there may be no misunderstanding between us, let me say that there is consensus on all the points concerned with the quality of the transport offered to the consumer, consensus also on demands for high standards of safety, social provision and environmental protection.
All that, though, can be, and is to be, required and put into effect by the conditions on the offering of contracts for tender.
So we do not need the continuation of monopolies and quasi-monopolies.
Finally, I will say something about subsidiarity. It is no help to local autonomy to declare local public transport to be a res extra commertium, whose watchword is that everyone is to do what they like in the way they like.
It is, unfortunately, no help to the citizens either, for it is they who, at the end of the day, have to pay for all that twice over, as consumers and as taxpayers.
So, then, controlled competition and high standards for local public transport as well.
Mr President, I believe that public transport is incredibly important for Europeans in both towns and sparsely populated areas.
In this vote, I am therefore going to support the basic ideas behind the committee' s proposal, which I believe points in the direction of better public transport.
However, I oppose many of the simplistic statements made about tendering.
Our experience from Sweden shows that tendering can be very good.
Account can be taken of the environment and of social considerations, safety regulations can be established and a good relationship can be enjoyed with the social partners.
As a prerequisite, politicians must have responsibility for the tendering and establish these criteria openly.
That is possible, as is shown by experience from Sweden.
We should be able to get rid of many of the simplistic statements about tendering.
As I say, I am prepared to support the basic idea that regions and administrative districts should have freedom of choice.
I also believe that it will, in practice, emerge that tendering can be used because it saves money that can be used for other purposes within the framework of public expenditure.
Finally, I want to say that I do not believe that the rule of reciprocity referred to in the committee' s report should operate at European level.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have as yet been unable to find a simple solution to the problem of liberalising public transport.
That does not mean to say that we should not continue with the liberalisation process.
Quite the reverse, in fact.
Nevertheless, this liberalisation process should not be forced.
It must be carried out in stages.
In principle, I am against exceptions to freedom of services, but it is clear, of course, that a very limited list of exceptions should be possible, particularly for less sizeable contracts.
Finally, I should like to say that it should also be made clear that it certainly cannot be the intention to replace the government monopoly by a private monopoly.
I therefore think that a compromise solution must be found, particularly in the interest of the user.
Many thanks, Mr President.
Mr President, Madam Vice-President, the likely reason for the Commission's proposal being such a centre of attention is that we are dealing here with employment, especially with mobility, and with issues of safety, environmental protection and economic development as well, and the opinions which are still being vigorously discussed today were also the basis for almost 500 proposed amendments.
I would like at this point to again make clear that, for us, it really is not about opening up local transport in such a way that it inevitably ends up in private hands.
Nor is it about local transport remaining in public hands unconditionally, and that is the subtle distinction that we want to make clear now.
National, regional and also local government are to be obliged to put local transport out to tender, a process to which conditions must be attached, conditions which we have clearly described in numerous proposed amendments.
For us, it is about safety.
It is also about certain exceptions, small markets in rural areas, for example.
We, of course, view these exceptions with sympathy, as we do the special aspects associated with rail transport.
As has just been said, though, our misgiving cannot be dispelled that many are more interested in the service provider than in the service itself, for the word 'voter' was just used rather than 'citizen', something that we find symptomatic of the whole discussion we have been having.
We have brought in numerous amendments and can, I believe, say quite unambiguously that these amendments prevent social dumping and also guarantee social security, safety in general, and, I believe, can give local transport a better future.
One final observation, with which I know the Commission has difficulty. Protected markets make it impossible, in our view, for businesses profiting from them to take part in tendering processes in other markets without, at least, some problematic aspects being created.
As we see it, that is, and cannot be other than, unfair competition, which must be combated by all means available.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by expressing my thanks to the Commission for showing that they have the courage to present, in the past year, a proposal for a regulation on the thorny topic of local public transport.
For we are not going to get away from the fact, as we see at this very moment in the case of an airline, that even in local public transport, profitability is making an entrance.
We cannot therefore have the situation in which - I am involved in local politics myself - year after year, questions about the losses sustained by local public transport are simply shrugged off without further ado and with the taxpayer being left to foot the bill, without the money actually being able to be invested in making local public transport more attractive.
We have to ask ourselves: why was local public transport created?
It was not created in order to employ as many bus drivers as possible; on the contrary, it was created so that attractive facilities can be offered in rural and more densely populated areas to ensure the mobility of all.
