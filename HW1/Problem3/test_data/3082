The Commission faced up to its responsibility to make proposals as early as November/December, when the second BSE crisis broke out.
We are now securing the funding for the decisions which were adopted back in December.
EUR 971 million is a very substantial supplementary budget, and I am most grateful to Parliament for approving it.
The additional EUR 971 million means that in total, more than EUR 7 billion will be made available to the beef industry this year.
This represents an increase of more than 50% on last year's figure.
I emphasise this point to make it clear that the European Union is not abandoning its farmers in the current crisis; on the contrary, we are spending a significant proportion of our budget in this area and I think it is important to underline that fact again here.
But I also agree with all those who say that spending EUR 6 billion on subsidising production and allocating a further one billion to deal with production - in the sense that we are destroying part of it - also proves that there is an urgent need for action and a new direction in this area.
Let me explain once again what the supplementary budget will be used for: a proportion, i.e. 33 million, will go towards funding additional BSE tests, a significant share will be used for the buying-in of beef in public stocks, and the majority will be allocated to cover the 'purchase for destruction' scheme for cattle.
It is important to make this clear.
But the money will go to the farmers, as partial compensation for their revenue shortfall.
Let me also remind you that we still have very different systems in the beef industry.
If the price falls below a specific margin, the meat from male cattle at least, must be compulsorily purchased by the European Union.
And what about the ethical issues involved? Of course it is sad that we are currently allocating EUR 700 million to the destruction of cattle.
It is a sad day for agricultural policy, and a sad day for the taxpayer.
But I must also point out that there really is no alternative.
We are not simply promoting a slaughter programme: what we have is a necessary measure because far less slaughtering is taking place than usual.
Let me say a few words about food aid as a possible alternative.
For food aid to be provided in the form of beef, the recipient country must have closed refrigeration circuits.
You cannot simply load beef on to a ship and send it to a region in crisis somewhere in the world. You will just end up with a shipload of rotten meat which is completely unusable.
These are factors which have to be considered.
The European Union's experience has shown that the regional market was then partly destroyed, which must be a warning to us not to make the same mistakes twice.
Let me say once more: it is clear, of course, that what is on the table is a package of emergency measures for which funding is now being secured.
Nonetheless, we are already discussing the further steps to be taken, and are doing so in the Agriculture Council as well.
We will be discussing the second package this week. It includes measures which go beyond the current policy of eradicating the problem.
Of course, we can, and must, discuss whether further measures are necessary.
But we have to agree something at this stage.
And I would like to say that I am rather bemused by some of the newspaper reports about the package of measures proposed by Mr Fischler. These reports seem to bear very little relation to the measures put forward.
For example, I read about a mass slaughter programme which has allegedly been ordered by Mr Fischler. But I should point out yet again that this is an offer from the European Union to buy up meat for which there is currently no market.
We are saying that we are only prepared to do so with cofinancing. A proportion must also be funded by the Member States.
Given the indignant reactions, even though there is a safety net wherever it is clear that there will be compulsory purchase by the European Union, I cannot help but feel on occasion that there is some deliberate mischief-making going on.
Now to the question of the further measures which can be adopted as a result of the crisis. I think it is a good thing that so many proposals have been tabled.
I also think it is right to give more thought to other options, such as an early marketing premium.
After all, the problem is partly resolved if an animal goes to market at an earlier stage in the rearing process and therefore has less weight.
And it is also important, in my view, to consider uncoupling the premiums from output, to ensure that the premium schemes take greater account of the other agricultural policy objectives.
But let us be clear on one thing: what we are doing today is securing the funding for a package of measures which were necessary as an initial response to an emergency.
When we come to debate the second package of measures, we can examine the issue of crisis management.
But at that stage, of course, the necessary steps should have been taken, and we must then open the third phase with the mid-term review, in order to ensure that the premium schemes take greater account of the other agricultural policy objectives.
Let me conclude with a few words about foot-and-mouth disease, which has rightly been mentioned by several Members of this House.
The crisis in the United Kingdom has already reached major proportions.
Due to the incubation period, it will become apparent in the next few days whether the disease has spread to the continent.
We must be prepared for this possibility.
As budget specialists, we must also be prepared for the fact that we may face major problems in the future.
And finally, we must also recognise that we may not have reached the lowest point in the agricultural crisis yet.
Of course, I hope that this is not the case, but we must be prepared for this eventuality.
So it is even more important to manage the crisis in a rational way, but also to adopt a course which leads to our desired goals: namely to combine agricultural policy goals with consumer protection, animal welfare, and environmental protection objectives.
Mr President, allow me to make a brief remark.
Various speakers have observed that it would be statutorily impossible to change the 70/30 proportion to 50/50.
That is not the view of the legal affairs service of Parliament, which has told me that it quite definitely is possible.
Thank you very much, Mr Mulder.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
Foot-and-mouth disease
The next item is the Commission communication on developments in the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease.
I am glad of this opportunity to update you on the most recent developments in relation to the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in the United Kingdom.
You will be aware that the first outbreak was confirmed on 20 February in the evening.
The Commission adopted a safeguard decision the following day, that is on 21 February, at a Commission meeting.
This measure imposed a ban on the export from the UK of certain live animals, that is cattle, sheep and goats, and restrictions on the export of meat, meat products, milk, milk products and certain animal products.
It also provided for a review of the decision of the Standing Veterinary Committee on 27 February.
This very prompt action has been criticised in some quarters as a panic reaction.
Nothing could be further from the truth.
It is an essential and very necessary reaction to a highly infectious disease with potentially huge economic and trade consequences for the entire European Union, some of which you have heard about from Mrs Schreyer just a moment ago.
I am encouraged that the decision was strongly supported by the Agriculture Council last Monday.
It is also supported by the farming community throughout the European Union including in the UK, as farmers are conscious of the grave threat to their livelihood from this particular disease.
Unfortunately, the number of outbreaks has continued to increase and currently amounts to 22.
There are a number of worrying aspects to this outbreak which I should enumerate for you.
First of all, it has been detected in several different counties in Britain with a widespread geographical distribution.
Secondly, it has been found not only in farms but in abattoirs, dealers' premises and collection points.
Furthermore, there were exports of potentially infected susceptible animals, in particular sheep, to other Member States before confirmation of the outbreak took place.
I would like to take the opportunity to congratulate the UK for its very firm action to bring the outbreak under control.
The UK imposed a complete restriction on the movement of livestock in Britain on 23 February in order to reduce the further spread of the disease.
This ban has been prolonged for another fortnight.
Given the incubation period of this disease the impact of this measure is not yet fully apparent.
The Commission is obviously keeping the situation under constant review and we are in continual contact with the veterinary authorities in the UK and in other Member States.
The situation was reviewed at a meeting of the Standing Veterinary Committee yesterday.
In the light of the update on the current situation from the UK representative and the views of the Member States' veterinary experts, the Commission services proposed the following.
Firstly, the extension of the current ban until 9 March. That decision was taken at a Commission meeting this morning.
Secondly, Member States shall take any precautionary measures including the isolation of susceptible animals and preventive killing of such animals exported from the UK between 1 and 21 February.
The Standing Veterinary Committee gave a favourable opinion to this proposal and it will now be approved by the Commission with a view to entry into force before the expiry of the current decision at midnight on 1 March.
The new decision will expire at midnight on 9 March 2001 and will be reviewed at the Standing Veterinary Committee scheduled to take place on 6 and 7 March.
Our current approach is focused on stamping out the disease.
We would only turn to vaccination as a last resort, since it would call into question the disease status of the European Union and involve very significant future costs for the farming community and for exporters.
Clearly we have to be very concerned with the present situation.
The stakes are very high and the costs of failing to bring the outbreak under control are very high.
In addition, the timing of the outbreak, as the BSE crisis continues to do its damage, could not be worse.
I will caution, however, against drawing any immediate conclusions.
For example, the outbreak is already being attributed to poor controls on imports and the intensive nature of agricultural production in the European Union.
Obviously, we will be considering all these issues in the coming weeks and months in our investigations into the origins of this disease.
However, we should not overlook the fact that the Community has been hugely successful in achieving its current status on foot-and-mouth disease, at least up to a couple of weeks ago.
Vaccination ended in 1991, which has since saved European farmers over EUR 1 billion.
It has also allowed Member States to export to countries which insist on imports only from countries which are recognised to be foot-and-mouth disease free and which do not follow the vaccination policy.
Since then, there have been no cases other than in Italy in 1993 and a number of incursions of the disease in Greece next to the Turkish border.
Prior to the implementation of the non-vaccination policy in 1991 hundreds of outbreaks were recorded each year.
My firm intention is to maintain that success.
I hope that I can count on your support for the present zero- tolerance approach towards this disease.
I would now like to hear your views on the current situation.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Byrne.
The next item is Question Time.
As many Members are already scheduled to speak, we shall put the questions in groups of three so that more questions can be answered.
I would like to thank the Commissioner for his measured statement this afternoon.
Members may not know but the farm at Heddon-on-the-Wall in the north-east of England which appears to be the centre of this outbreak is in my constituency and therefore I know at first hand the great devastation it is causing to the farming community and the disruption that it is causing to the meat processing industry, to say nothing of the curtailment of access to countryside pursuits.
I would like to express to the farming community in the United Kingdom our great sympathy and concern with this situation.
I would also like to say to colleagues from the mainland continent of Europe that we sincerely hope that we have not exported the disease to mainland Europe.
I very much welcome what the Commissioner had to say about the actions that had been taken by the British Government.
We all understand that slaughter and stoppage of animal movement is one of the best means of bringing the outbreak under control.
He also mentioned vaccination as a further possibility.
Can he say anything about the time scale for vaccination?
Mr President, Commissioner, I have two questions.
The current precautions in connection with BSE have been eclipsed by the dangerous foot-and-mouth epidemic.
I remember back in the 1950s, when whole villages were quarantined in order to prevent the epidemic from spreading.
How are the severe restrictions on movements of animals being enforced, Commissioner?
What I mean is, anyone who still fails post-BSE to comply with regulations should be taught a serious lesson using other means.
How secure is the situation in the European Community regarding labelling obligations?
You said that culling and the travelling ban are currently the main objectives.
How prepared are you to vaccinate animals which must surely be scattered throughout Europe on a strategic basis in order to help prevent the disease from spreading?
Are you well prepared?
Thank you, Commissioner, for coming today.
It was my request in the Agriculture Committee that we had a debate on this and I much appreciate your coming.
I also echo Mr Adam' s feelings.
I would like to express my heartfelt sympathies to those in Britain affected by it and my sorrow that we may have exported this disease.
On that note, I would like to say how worried we are.
However, it is vitally important that we use everything within our power to stop a future occurrence of this.
I want to know whether or not you will be looking - and you did indicate this in your speech - at strengthening phytosanitary measures so that we can have healthy, safe food within the United Kingdom and within Europe.
Could the Commissioner answer two quick questions. Has the British Government applied for full funding from the EU, using agrimonetary systems and other systems, and what is the position of sheep in Germany?
Have we finally sorted the problem of infected sheep?
In response to Mr Adam on the question of the time scale for vaccination, let me repeat what I said earlier and emphasise the fact that vaccination as a policy would be used as a last resort.
We are not considering it as an option except as a last resort.
Even in those circumstances it would be necessary to seek the views of the Standing Veterinary Committee and, indeed, to bring the proposal before the Agriculture Council for its consideration.
It would entail huge costs and potential loss of trade.
It would be an enormous decision with many implications.
Therefore the time scale would reflect the difficult nature of such a decision and the need for widespread consultation with the bodies that I have indicated.
The next question relates to how the Commission and the European Union is prepared for the travelling ban.
It is the function of the Commission and the legislative authorities in the European Union to put in place legislation at EU level and it is for the Member States on the ground to implement that legislation.
Therefore to ban movements from the UK, legislation was first of all implemented at UK level.
There is also EU legislation.
This was considered at the meetings of the Standard Veterinary Committee and there are continuing contacts between the veterinary services of the UK, our own veterinary services at the Commission and, indeed, other veterinary services as necessary.
Susceptible animals have been identified and are under active surveillance.
Indeed, as you are probably aware, many animals have already been destroyed.
Mr Sturdy then asked me two questions.
Firstly, has the UK Government applied for any funding?
The answer to that question is no.
No such application has been made and I understand that the costs are not yet known.
On the question of sheep in Germany, the up-to-date information that I have in relation to that matter is that those suspect cases are either still regarded as suspect or have been cleared as negative.
Moreover, there is certainly no confirmation of any foot-and-mouth in Germany, as was reported either earlier today or yesterday.
Is the Commission in a position to give us reassurances in relation to the Armagh case straddling the border between the north of Ireland and the Republic, where we have word today of a suspect case again; sheep imported from Carlisle Mart, some of which have apparently travelled onward down south to the Republic.
In fact, as I am talking to you, I have just heard of gossip - and let' s hope that is all it is - of sheep in Wexford, my own constituency, having been identified and being incinerated as we talk.
Again, that remains to be confirmed but apparently there is a spread of sheep from Carlisle to a mart in Armagh, which straddles the border of the Leinster Euro constituency I represent and the exclusion zone.
Could the Commissioner give us any update on that?
Hopefully, again it is only a suspect case and will remain so.
Is the Commissioner satisfied that the vigilance and disinfection facilities at all ports and airports in the EU, but particularly in Ireland and Great Britain, are as they should be, and has he a role in that area?
Mr President, Commissioner, it again looks like a case of waste disposal here.
In this case from an airport, which then triggered the epidemic.
Firstly, surely it makes sense to back up State controls by imposing a duty of proof on firms in the waste industry?
Secondly, will you ensure that the holdings affected receive compensation if epidemic funds in the Member States run dry?
Thirdly, should we not be a bit more cautious with the culling programme now, because this epidemic may force a culling programme which goes beyond what we had intended?
We should at least exercise some caution here.
Not that I am tempting providence, Commissioner, but the risk does exist.
Obviously the farmers in the UK and in my constituency where we have a suspected case are absolutely devastated by this in addition to BSE.
The Commissioner said that no funding from the EU had been requested for this at the moment.
Would there be EU funding specifically available to help with foot-and-mouth?
Will he also help the British Government to determine where the foot-and-mouth originally came from, because he said that we do not import from countries that do not have a clean record.
I thought it was perhaps just regions of particular countries.
Could he be a little more specific on that?
Would he agree with me that the closure of the smaller abattoirs in the UK has perhaps led to the spread of the disease?
First of all, in response to Mrs Doyle, the situation, as you will appreciate, is evolving hour by hour but I can confirm that, as we speak, there is no confirmation of the situation in Armagh about which you asked me.
Obviously, there is active surveillance of the situation.
Authorities are keeping the farm under close surveillance and it has been closed.
I will have clarification of that situation later in the day.
With regard to your own constituency of Wexford, Mrs Doyle, I do not have any reports of the rumours that you reported.
Nothing has been brought to my attention in relation to that.
With regard to surveillance at borders, this is a matter for Member States themselves.
I can assure you that, from my contacts with Member States and, indeed, from their own observation of the situation, they are perfectly well aware of the seriousness of the situation.
Focus must be on the restriction of live animals and then also on animal products.
I am aware, from reports that have been made available to me, that Member States are taking the kind of precautions that we would regard as being suitable to eliminate movement and to try to ensure the lowest level of risk.
Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf asked me about compensation.
As you may have heard from Mrs Schreyer when she spoke earlier this afternoon, compensation is available.
There is a budget line for this kind of situation but, as she indicated to you, there are budgetary limits.
I understand that approximately EUR 50 million a year are available for this.
I am not aware of the exact amount of money available for an issue such as this, but I believe it is somewhat less than EUR 50 million.
Mrs Lynne asked me about the differentiation in designation between regions and countries.
The situation is that any third country that has an outbreak of foot-and-mouth in any particular region is precluded from exporting products to the European Union.
This is done as a result of legislation which requires that any product exported must be accompanied by a certificate stating that it is free of foot-and-mouth.
If a region is incapable of providing that certification, then the product cannot be exported.
That has been the situation in the past and continues to be the situation and it has applied in a situation quite recently.
With regard to the question relating to the small abattoirs, I did touch on this earlier in my own statement.
I would refer again to what I said in my statement and repeat that foot-and-mouth disease was a bigger problem in the past than it is now.
I gave you instances of what outbreaks there have been in the more recent past, one in Italy and a small one in Greece on the Turkish border.
We have been remarkably free in the European Union from foot-and-mouth disease over that period of time.
With regard to any application for or any authorisation of compensation to the UK, we are awaiting any application for compensation and it will obviously be given the appropriate consideration in the usual way.
Mr President, Commissioner, once again we face a tragic crisis, and I shall add two points to my fellow Members' questions.
Firstly, in answer to Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, you stated that everything connected to fraud was actually within the jurisdiction of the Member States.
While that may be true, the Commission must still ensure that there are sufficient staff resources to monitor this work.
In that respect, what progress has been made by your directorate and the Health and Consumer Protection Directorate?
However dedicated they are, do you have enough staff resources at the current time to adequately monitor all the urgent assignments they receive, this being the last problem in line following BSE and so many others?
That is my first question.
My second question is this: I feel you were rather quick to dismiss the fact that local abattoirs are not a solution to this type of problem, for small local abattoirs today are not what they were fifty years ago.
Therefore, is the fact that they are local not a solution to the unfolding crises?
This has been seen clearly in Great Britain, particularly with the problem of the long-distance transportation of animals, which apparently engenders and spreads the epidemic.
Mr President, the British authorities have been rather evasive in providing information on the export destination of live animals.
I should like to know, Commissioner, whether it would be possible to obtain a list of the countries to which the United Kingdom may have exported live animals that could possibly have been infected with foot-and-mouth disease.
Mr President, Commissioner, have you enough vaccine for this special strain, should the worst case scenario in fact occur?
And secondly, according to today's front page headline in a widely-read German newspaper which carries several large colour photographs, foot-and-mouth disease can infect humans.
Your views on this please.
Mr President, with regard to Mrs Auroi' s question on fraud in the Member States.
In the event that there is any evidence of fraud in Member States then there is an obligation to investigate this fully.
The Member State in question will be required to do so, and the Commission will have a direct interest in ensuring that was done.
On the question of small abattoirs: I can only repeat what I said earlier that the last case of foot-and-mouth disease in the UK was in the 1960s.
The fact that we have had bigger abattoirs in the meantime over the last 20-year period tends to indicate that there is not necessarily a correlation between big or small abattoirs and the outbreak of foot-and-mouth.
However, all issues are kept under review and this situation this will obviously be one of the issues that will be taken into account.
We must be careful not to look for magic solutions and make knee-jerk reactions as to causes.
That is one aspect that will be weighed in the balance in coming to a conclusion on this issue.
There are 30 million doses of vaccine in the European Union.
On the question of whether foot-and-mouth disease can infect humans, the position here appears to be that if there is any infection, it is an extremely mild form causing very mild symptoms and very few cases.
In other words, it is not understood to be a public health problem.
Mr Cunha then asked me about countries where exports had taken place.
I am sure that information is available in my DG.
I do not have the information at my finger tips, but I understand that in all probability the list will include Germany, France, the Netherlands and Belgium.
The UK has kept my DG fully up-to-date on all developments.
I personally receive faxes and I have had a number of conversations with the relevant minister, Mr Nick Brown, on these issues.
I am absolutely satisfied that the UK authorities are keeping the Commission fully informed as events evolve.
Commissioner, will you take it from all of us that we believe you have acted proportionately and not out of panic.
The only panic here would be if this were being represented as a major threat to human health, rather than animal health which it is.
In recognising the prompt action of the UK on 20 and 21 February, could you confirm that the UK has in fact now asked to draw down the remaining tranche of agrimonetary compensation, as the British Minister announced last night.
Could you be specific about the additional support which will be needed if an entire farming community is to be able to survive the loss of its livelihood which, for many of those we represent, is now the case.
Finally, have you had any reports from the FVO in Dublin yet concerning the causes of the outbreak at Heddon-on-the-Wall.
Given that the risk by land and air of infection is now so great, will you at least assure us that you will not rule out preventive vaccination, at least to give additional assistance in the attempt to stop the disease spreading, even if the animals have to be destroyed later?
Mr President, I have three questions.
It is apparent that with regard to execution and preventive measures there is a difference in tempo between the various Member States, particularly in relation to the disposal or slaughter of livestock from Great Britain.
Can you say anything about this?
Will that continue to occur in future with the new regulations?
Secondly, it appears that there are problems in tracing animal movements from the United Kingdom to Europe.
Is that true?
What is the percentage that cannot be traced?
Thirdly, it has become clear that the transport of livestock over long distances for slaughter has certain attendant difficulties.
Will that prompt the Commission to reflect on the possibility of introducing distance tables relating to the transport of animals for slaughter?
I should like to make one further observation. Farmers in Great Britain have suffered an enormous blow from BSE.
Now they are again the victims of a serious epidemic, and words are not much help, but a trouble shared is a trouble halved, and I should like to say that we in my country have great sympathy for the plight of farming families in Great Britain.
As the Commissioner knows, this latest problem coming in the wake of the BSE crisis threatens to destroy agriculture and indeed unravel the entire CAP.
There have been lots of rumours about people knowingly withholding information about outbreaks, or indeed movements of livestock.
Is it possible for the Commissioner to talk to Member State governments to see whether it is possible under their own legal systems to take criminal prosecutions against those who act in such an irresponsible way?
Secondly, does the Commissioner welcome the voluntary action by many responsible people in sporting and other fields to curtail the movement of people.
In that regard, in my own country, would he particularly acknowledge the responsible and unselfish act of the new leader of Fine Gael in scaling down its Ãrd Fheis to a Dublin conference to contribute to ensuring that there is no major problem in Ireland?
That sounds like a hot potato for you, Commissioner.
Mr Whitehead, I greatly welcome what you said as a preliminary to your question, that you believe that the Commission has acted in a proportionate manner.
I fully agree with your assessment that the only panic that can come from this situation is by people irresponsibly drawing attention to what does not exist, which is a threat to human health.
I am very happy that you raised that question and gave me an opportunity to emphasise that point yet again.
As regards the application for compensation, as you are probably aware this is an issue that falls within the competence of my colleague, Mr Fischler, but I understand that the UK authorities intend to make an application and it may very well be in the pipeline.
I am aware that this constitutes an enormous impact on farming incomes, and this is something that has been fully taken into account in all deliberations.
With regard to the Food and Veterinary Office, no FVO report is available yet, but I should say that no options will be ruled out with regard to vaccinations.
As I said earlier, however, this would only be regarded as a last resort.
The question from Mr Maat concerns different levels of performance in different Member States.
I strongly believe that Member States fully understand the seriousness of the situation.
Member States are taking the appropriate action, given the level of exposure that they believe exists in their own Member State.
I am satisfied, for instance, that one Member State alone has destroyed 47 000 sheep without any positive finding in any one of them.
Other Member States have also destroyed large numbers of sheep, and markets and so on in a number of Member States have also been closed.
Movements have been restricted.
The Member States, particularly those at risk of having imported sheep from the UK, are taking the appropriate action.
With regard to that, traceability has worked very well but there are limitations.
We cannot ensure individual identification of sheep and pigs in all instances.
Mr Cushnahan then asked me about whether there should be criminal prosecution in the event of fraud.
That is an issue that Member States are responsible for themselves.
It is not the duty of the Commission to require Member States to initiate such criminal prosecutions.
But in the event of any persistent failure of a Member State to implement the laws of the European Union, there is scope for the Commission to initiate infringement proceedings.
That does not arise in this instance, but I am satisfied that in the event that there is evidence of criminal activity - and I am sure you are referring to the UK when you asked me this question Mr Cushnahan - that the UK authorities will be well aware of the fact that prosecutions of this type are appropriate in the circumstances.
With regard to the last part of your question as to whether I believe it is appropriate for the political party you identify to have restricted its Ãrd Fheis, firstly let me say that I do not follow the affairs of all small parties in the European Union.
Another concern that might well have motivated him is: would anybody have turned up out of lack of interest?
Commissioner Byrne, I should like to go back to the question of imported meat from outside the European Union.
You say that it has to be licensed.
I think there are problems with this licensing.
When cases break out in these countries there is a time lag.
All this needs to be tightened up.
You need to be absolutely certain that meat from countries that have foot-and-mouth disease infection cannot enter the European Union.
I should like to join with other colleagues and say how terrible it has been for the farming community in Britain.
The farmers feel that the gods have deserted them entirely after BSE, and now foot-and-mouth.
Can I also ask as regards compensation whether it is possible for the Commission to consider compensation, not only for those farmers that are directly hit by foot-and-mouth disease, but those that are also closed down by not being able to move their livestock?
We can all agree on one thing: farmers everywhere in the European Union certainly did not need this disease to come upon them at this moment in time, and certainly the farmers in the United Kingdom did not need it at all.
But it is at a time like this that you realise how mobile animals are.
You need only look at the map and see the distances they travel.
Mrs Doyle referred to the scare in my home county in my constituency in Northern Ireland.
We had hoped that we would get away with it unscathed but it shows just how dangerous and highly contagious this disease is, through the way animals move.
At this time those animals have all been tested.
I have been in touch with my local veterinary department.
There is cooperation with the government of the Republic of Ireland and indeed a perimeter has been set which happens to straddle the border between the two areas.
I should like to ask the Commissioner one question. He referred to intensive farming.
Would he not agree with me that the hype being put forward in the media about intensive farming/factory farming has nothing to do with all this?
In fact in 1967 when the last outbreak occurred, the type of farming we have now did not exist.
Would he not agree with me that this is the case?
Firstly in response to Mr Parish and his concerns in relation to imports from third countries.
I should like to emphasise again the very strict controls that exist on imports and the fact that the evidence of no incidence of foot-and-mouth - or very low incidence in one or two countries - is testimony to that fact.
With regard to compensation, the position here is that we can only compensate within the regulations, which does not include loss of production.
On travel, I confirm that this particular disease can be wind-borne.
In response to Mr Nicholson I would repeat what I said earlier in relation to this issue about intensive and extensive farming.
I do not believe that particular issue is a significantly relevant issue to this particular outbreak of the disease.
I know that there is some speculation in the media in relation to this and obviously in all our deliberations about how this disease came about and how it has spread, this will be one of the issues that will be taken into account.
I am sure that the whole House will wish you and Commissioner Fischler well in the way you have to face up to all these responsibilities with this dreadful disease at the moment.
That concludes this item.
Electronic communications
The next item is the joint debate on the following three reports:
A5-0061/2001 by Mr Brunetta, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on access to, and interconnection of, electronic communications networks and associated facilities [COM(2000) 384 - C5-0433/2000 - 2000/0186(COD)];
A5-0053/2001 by Mr Paasilinna, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on a common regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services [COM(2000) 393 - C5-0428/2000 - 2000/0184(COD)];
A5-0062/2001 by Mrs Niebler, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on the authorisation of electronic communications networks and services [COM(2000) 386 - C5-0440/2000 - 2000/0188(COD)].
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in a short space of time, the European telecommunications industry has, thanks to the impetus given to it by the Community institutions and the innovative action of the market, moved over from a system based on national monopolies to one based on general liberalisation.
Market forces and new technologies have pushed this regulatory process forward, generating results in terms of competition and new operators coming into the market, which have in some cases exceeded expectations.
The proposed revision of the current regulatory framework governing the telecommunications sector, currently before the European Parliament, consists, therefore, in laying down general objectives from which are derived the regulatory principles governing the new reference framework, basically with the aim of gradually moving the telecommunications market from a phase of market liberalisation to a phase of genuine competition.
The approach to regulating the market should be geared to the future state of markets in which the conditions will be much more competitive and diversified, with the rapid spread of innovative services, and focused on the implementation of competition law, to replace the ex ante rules applied on a case-by-case basis.
This objective can be pursued by means of a body of ex ante rules harmonised at European level, which are of a transitional and exceptional nature.
In other words, ex ante regulation must provide for its own disappearance once a sufficient degree of competition has been achieved, for excessive regulation is against the interests of the market.
With regard to the content of the directive which is the subject of my report, Parliament has identified priorities through its Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy.
The definition of the term 'access': the definitions given in the Commission's proposal were extremely broad and the failure to define terms clearly could have led to disputes with the regulatory authorities.
There is a particular risk of the rules and instruments set out in the directive being applied indiscriminately to extremely different situations, such as access for operators and users to end-user services, network facilities, system facilities, networks and roaming.
Roaming warranted more detailed consideration. I do not feel that it should be seen as a form of access, given that it has different connotations according to whether what is involved is enabling a user with a subscription to a foreign operator's network to use a mobile service in a given country and vice-versa - what is known as international roaming - or enabling operators entering the market to use the facilities of existing operators in a given country until such time as they have installed their own networks, which is known as asymmetric roaming.

The principle of light regulation: the report stresses the fact that light regulation and flexibility, central parts of the European legislation, must not mean 'anything goes', but must be a means of overcoming the problems of the current approach involving ex ante regulations which have failed to keep pace with the times and with technological progress.
The management of access and interconnection rights in fact requires a balance to be found between the rights of operators which are infrastructure owners to manage their networks and infrastructures for their own benefit and the rights of other operators, which are service providers, to access to essential facilities.
Degree of competitiveness of the market: another point which required clearer definition was the assessment of the degree of competitiveness of the market.
The achievement of a high degree of competitiveness is the precondition for reducing the role played by the regulation so as to enable its place to be taken by competition law alone, or, conversely, for subjecting operators that have been notified as having significant market power to regulatory obligations and subsequent cost orientation negotiations.
The definition of the 'new significant market power' is based on Court of Justice judgment and refers to a form of 'reduced' domination, since one of the features of dominance is to 'hamper competition', which is an ex post concept.
The proposal for a directive applies the 'new' significant market power' or 'reduced domination' concept, which, its 'negative' feature of hampering competition having been corrected, leaves the field open to ex ante measures.
Obligations imposed on operators: national regulatory authorities may impose obligations of transparency, non-discrimination, accounting separation, access to and use of specific network facilities, and price control and cost accounting obligations on operators notified as having significant market power.
The proposal also lays down arrangements for applying or revising the obligations deriving from the implementation of the current system and those deriving from the new regulatory framework.
The first remark to be made regards the arrangements for imposing obligations on operators notified as having significant market power.
In fact, notification does not automatically entail any obligations but the national regulatory authorities have to specify the obligations to be imposed on each operator that has been notified.
However, the fact that an operator has significant market power does not always mean that it is misusing that power.
When considering whether an operator does or does not have significant market power, national regulatory authorities should at the same time consider whether it is actually using that power before imposing obligations provided for in the directive.
Lastly, environmental impact.
An issue which is particularly close to my heart, as a local administrator apart from anything else, is reducing the number of masts in residential areas.
Operators are increasingly being forced by technical requirements to install infrastructures which do not fit in with the landscape.
It is the duty of the Community institutions, as well as national local authorities, to reduce this impact on the landscape and the environment as much as possible.
It is the duty of all policy-makers, at all levels, while safeguarding the importance of competition in the telecommunications market, to find regulatory solutions which allow maximum use of the installations currently available, taking into consideration the impact on the landscape and the environment and the socio-cultural implications for the citizens.
Then there are other points relating to the different taxation systems, in which area there is a call for harmonisation, and to the need for coordination by the European Commission.
Taking all these considerations into account, we can only recommend the proposal for a directive, in that it seeks to stimulate growth in the sector, it will stimulate future investment and enhance the competitiveness of businesses, and, by increasing efficiency, will help to bring about a fall in prices and contribute to economic growth across the board.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the biggest change going on in Europe is obviously the opportunity to network, and this is of particular political importance because the participation of ordinary citizens in it is becoming ever more dependent on their level of income, and sometimes where they live.
In addition, it is those very people that are on the wrong side of the digital divide who are already today' s excluded citizens.
The aims of an electronic Europe and civil society will thus not be achieved without network services helping people to establish connections with one another and get organised accordingly.
We need to create a basic amount of telecommunications time for everyone, so that everyone can use the telecommunications and information society services without charge.
It would be an important addition to citizens' rights.
In this way a person could function in the networked society and we would not be creating an elite network.
As much as EUR 170 billion are estimated to have gone into radio spectrum auctions.
This huge amount of money was obviously noticed in political circles and part of the profits was taken for the benefit of society.
Apart from anything else, the timing was unfortunate.
The US economy started to wane and the Union decided to build a Europe that would embrace all its citizens, which is our main strategy.
This auction policy works against this, as now the charges for telecommunications services are rising.
Investors have begun to shun the industry and the production of the next generation of networks, equipment and services is slowing down.
The result is more problems, the stock market value of many operators having collapsed.
The Commission' s framework directive, as with other provisions relating to this package, is a relevant and balanced solution, and I thank them accordingly.
The framework directive is a move towards the regulation of all telecommunications networks and services.
With it the number of provisions will fall to less than a third of what there are at present.
What is most surprising about all this is that the telecommunications industry, in which goods move across borders at the speed of electrical current, has no coherent European market.
On the contrary, the same EU provisions have been interpreted in very many different ways and in many areas exorbitantly high charges have been maintained.
Genuine competition has been prevented through many forms of trickery.
As the telecommunications services sector has grown, costs have become an ever more important factor for both households and countries' economies in general.
Certain big players in the industry are all for competition in other sectors, but are in truth against it in their own.
The bigger the market and the more powerful a company is, the more effectively it can compete with smaller companies in the market and the new players trying to enter the market, and that is true of those other markets.
In my own proposal I have increased the scope of the national regulatory authorities and supported an improvement in resources.
At the same time, I propose an increase in transparency.
The national regulatory authorities are by far the best agencies to assess the situation in their own market, but I believe that it is the Commission that is best placed to assess the situation regarding the telecommunications markets throughout the Union as a whole.
I also believe that if the Commission had had the proper powers the auction principle would hardly have been established of the type and on the scale we know at present.
The Commission must act when a Member State is not complying with common telecommunications legislation.
It is essential for companies that they are able to function on the same terms and conditions throughout the Union.
As a result of Commission action we will also be able to avoid having to establish a separate pan-European regulator.
As the auction principle could also extend to other resources caught in a bottleneck and new generations of mobile phone networks, I would ask the Commission now to investigate the situation comprehensively for Parliament regarding the effect of auctions on companies and consumers.
Another essential sector is the definition of significant market player.
We in the committee have broadened the notion in the light of recent developments.
A significant market player is now also one that has the continued ability to limit other operators' contacts with users.
The same goes for a situation where a company operates in several parts of the production chain and has a significant position in one of them.
We consider that many companies are in a dominant position in markets in which they can, as it were, tacitly agree on the swings in the market that will touch others.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by thanking all my colleagues for supporting my report on the authorisation directive and for proposing a great many extremely useful amendments which I have willingly included in my report.
I should also like to thank the Commission and the Council Presidencies for working with us in a highly constructive manner over recent weeks and months.
Turning now to the authorisation directive and my report.
How do things currently stand as regards the authorisation procedure for communication services and networks in the European Union?
According to the Commission's fifth and sixth reports on the implementation of the reform package for the telecommunications sector and according to the reports of the European Telecommunication Office, the Member States all have completely different licensing regimes.
This causes problems, especially for operators offering cross-border telecommunications services, and means that, at present, a business in the telecommunications sector can only start trading once an authority has so decided, i.e. once an individual licence has been issued.
These individual licences vary enormously from one Member State to another; some licences have extensive information requirements attached, others have none at all.
As a result, the licensing procedures in the individual Member States take varying lengths of time, the terms and conditions differ and the fees charged vary widely.
The purpose of the authorisation directive submitted by the Commission is to remedy this.
The directive calls for simpler, more harmonised rules for market access for electronic communications services and networks in the Community.
Future licensing regimes must be fair, predictable and the least cumbersome possible for applicants.
Some Member States have already put this into practice and it is therefore good and the Commission is right to propose that such regimes be introduced throughout Europe.
A couple of comments on the content of the proposed directive.
In future, network operators or communication service providers will no longer need to obtain an individual licence, i.e. to get permission from the authorities before providing their services.
They will merely be required to meet the conditions set out in general licences.
At the same time, the number of conditions that can be imposed on service providers has been sharply reduced and harmonised at European level.
The proposal also provides that, in future, service providers will no longer have to furnish comprehensive information.
In future, the national licensing authorities will only be able to demand the information which is strictly necessary for the authorities to verify compliance with the conditions for authorisation.
The change in licensing regimes will ensure that service providers are able to provide their telecommunications services and networks quickly, and without a great deal of red tape, throughout Europe.
This is in my opinion, without doubt, a milestone on the path towards a dynamic and competition-orientated market for electronic communications in the Community.
I should like to address a problem which currently hits operators hard in practice.
Time and again they come up against serious difficulties as regards the granting of rights of way.
Here again, the Member States have very different rules on procedures, fees and conditions.
This makes it even more difficult to develop an infrastructure - unnecessarily so.
Laying long telecommunications cables is an expensive business.
Operators have to apply for a whole series of rights of way in towns, communes and districts.
They have to obtain planning permission.
They often need consent from hundreds of property owners before they can start trading as operators.
The directive should therefore at least place Member States under an obligation to publish a list of charges, procedures and conditions in connection with the granting of rights of way.
This would at least give operators an overview of the legal situation, thereby saving a great deal of time when applying for rights of way.
Finally, the subject of administrative charges is another crucial point.
Administrative charges as a whole should mirror the costs incurred in administering and controlling general authorisations more closely.
The directive provides here for the Member States to publish reports in order to make the costs transparent.
The proposal for a directive apportions the administrative charges between the individual undertakings providing services under a general authorisation.
I disagree with the Commission proposal and consider that they should be apportioned equally between applicants, rather than on the basis of the turnover of the undertaking in question.
Smaller undertakings, with annual turnover of up to EUR 10 million, should be exempt from any charges, thereby making it easier for small and medium-sized undertakings to access the market.
That concludes the introduction to my report.
I should now like to take the liberty of highlighting an important aspect of Mr Paasilinna's report.
As Mr Paasilinna has already explained, the Commission proposal stipulates that the national regulatory authorities will, as a rule, no longer be allowed to take important decisions on telecommunications regulations independently.
Instead, they will simply prepare drafts, which the Commission will examine within one month and either approve or reject, as appropriate.
If the draft is rejected, the Commission has a further two months in which to give the regulatory authority in question a decision.
The Commission would also decide in future if and on what frequencies radio communications can be broadcast.
Parliament has always taken the view that this is a matter solely for the individual Member States.
I should therefore like expressly to object to this proposal, which is also contained in Amendment No 33 by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy and was adopted in committee by a broad majority.
I personally am positive that the national authorities are closer to the market than the Commission and are therefore better placed to decide how and to what extent the telecommunications markets can be further liberalised on a case-by-case basis.
The liberalisation of the telecommunications markets has been a real success story.
Consumers today have a choice of service providers and telephone charges have fallen rapidly.
There is no cause, especially at this stage of the proceedings, to take the reins away from the successful national regulators and hand them to the Commission.
This would only complicate and slow down the decision-making process.
I have re-tabled the proposed amendment which Parliament will be voting on tomorrow.
I refer to Amendment No 78.
I ask you to support this amendment and thank you for listening.
Mr President, our thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Brunetta, for his thorough report on access to electronic communications networks as part of the open network provisions package. It refined and specified certain aspects of the Commission' s proposal.
That is to be welcomed, also in the interest of culture and education, because I viewed the report from the perspective of the draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport.
Telecommunications are changing our lives at a fast pace.
Particularly with the rapid development in telecommunications it is important that directives are put in place in good time in order to regulate access and interconnections within the European Union and beyond its borders as effectively as possible.
The Commission' s proposal focuses mainly on competition and a level playing field.
It is of great importance to national regulatory agencies, certainly in relation to a position of considerable power.
It is therefore a purely commercial approach and focuses on the infrastructure.
What I feel is missing is the proviso that cultural diversity and plurality should be guaranteed.
This is the reason why we in the Committee on Culture have tabled a number of amendments strengthening this aspect.
I am consequently very happy that these amendments have also been accepted by the Committee on Industry.
In this context we are very concerned that the 'must carry' obligation should be extended to broad-band format, as indicated in Amendment No 14.
Finally, I would like to turn my attention to the regulation of the APIs and the EPGs and other accompanying facilities in accordance with the procedure of a regulatory committee.
In the view of the Commission that only needs to be implemented when there is a revision, but it is now clear that developments are so far advanced that they should fall within the scope of the regulations.
Well, Mr President, that will in fact be much too late.
It is to be welcomed that the rapporteur has taken this line of reasoning into account.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the 'telecom package' , the main parts of which are now being put to the vote in Parliament, is an ambitious venture which, in principle, deserves our support.
It makes perfect sense to want to simplify and organise the current legal framework of no less than 28 different legal texts more clearly.
That a horizontal approach has been chosen is logical and to be welcomed.
The Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport has called unanimously in its opinions on the various reports for care to be taken in all regulations on electronic communications networks and services so as to ensure that no conditions are attached to access which might, in the final analysis, have an adverse effect on the broad range of content.
In other words, we must ensure that networks and services of general interest are adequately disseminated.
The Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport also sees a need for harmonisation measures within the internal market, but in a wider sense than the Commission, which wants to consolidate its powers here.
The institutions have agreed, after years of arduous discussion, that different legal rules are needed for infrastructure and content.
They have likewise agreed that there are links between the routes and the content disseminated via them and that these links must be duly acknowledged and taken into account in the interests of cultural variety and democratic opinion-forming within society.
The market can do a great deal, but it cannot do everything.
In plain text this means, for example, that in order to safeguard pluralism and a variety of opinions, the widespread dissemination of a range of content to a wide public must be guaranteed under a 'must carry' obligation, with the Member States alone responsible for putting the flesh on the bones of such a regulation.
We must make it clear that Europe has no business interfering in national and regional radio sovereignty.
From this point of view, the principle of coordination before harmonisation applies.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to thank the three rapporteurs most warmly for their excellent work and for their first-class manner of cooperation.
I believe that this is exemplary in this House.
We are discussing three important reports and at the same time we are talking about a sector characterised by a great degree of uncertainty.
In every conceivable kind of article in magazines and newspapers we even see prophets of doom sowing the seeds of doubt on the question of whether the 3G sector is at all viable.
I believe that the Commission and the Swedish Presidency have an important role to play in the run-up to the informal summit that will take place in Stockholm on 23 and 24 March 2001.
It would be very good if a plan of action could be agreed there.
I should like to mention here a number of elements, which strike me as important in this context.
In the first place, the Heads of Government should state expressly at the summit that they consider the 3G sector to be of prime importance for high-quality employment in the European Union, and that they are also prepared to work towards a single Europe-wide market.
Secondly, it would be very wise if the two countries that bear the greatest responsibility for the high auction results, the United Kingdom and Germany, were prepared to consider other sources of finance.
Perhaps they will also be willing to postpone this financing for a little while, so that the financing burden on telecom companies would ease, with all the accompanying stabilising effects that that can bring about on the financial markets.
Thirdly, it would be a very good thing if Commissioner Liikanen were to sit round the table with all these companies to discuss the question of how the public at large can be better informed about the achievements and potential of the 3G sector, and particularly to examine collectively how, for example through collocation, more effective use can be made of transmission masts, etc., resulting in a reduction in infrastructure costs.
Fourthly, it would be a very significant step if the Member States that have benefited greatly from those auctions were prepared to boost demand by stimulating the need for 3G, for example in the field of e-governance projects, and to do more in areas such as education, in-service training of teachers, etc.
Finally, as part of the sixth Framework Programme we should use a significant part of our financial resources to solve questions such as the new internet protocol 6 (IP 6), e-banking standards, etc. I hope that the Commissioner will respond to the recommendations I have just made.
To return to the reports. In the first instance to the report of Mr Brunetta: I think it is an excellent report.
It is very important that we should establish now that Parliament, in cases where open competition does not yet work and there is emphatic evidence of problem areas in the market, has the courage to take a position and to opt for the consumer.
A well-known example is that of the international roaming tariffs.
We have seen a Commission report of last December, from which it is apparent that there is actually a closed system, that there is too little price competition, that there is too much disguising of costs and that it is vital that there should be transparency.
With regard to the report of Mr Paasilinna I want to make the comment that the suggestion that we should strive for greater competition is supported by our group.
We must indeed work towards a Europe-wide electronic communications market.
Fifteen separate national electronic communications markets cannot work.
A Europe-wide market must be created and that is why it is so important that the role of the Commission is maintained.
I appeal passionately to the House not to support the amendment of Mrs Niebler, because that amendment misrepresents matters.
We must ensure that the Commission is able to fulfil its task in that area and to guarantee that true competition is created and that a Europe-wide market becomes a reality.
That is the priority.
To that end we need a clear division of tasks and responsibilities between the Commission and NRAs, as is rightly advocated in Mr Paasilinna' s report.
Finally, Mrs Niebler' s report. She has produced an excellent report, and I should like to draw attention expressly to the amendment in which we are now trying to formulate criteria designed to ensure that in the distribution of frequencies Member States take account of the fact that we live in a Europe-wide market.
I would also like to congratulate all three rapporteurs for simplifying reports on a very complicated area.
For me, the emergence of a fully integrated and liberalised telecommunications market by the end of 2001 is the vital precondition for the transition to a digital knowledge-based economy, which I hope will bring considerable growth to the EU.
It is essential to note that the consequences of this package will certainly not be restricted to one recipient in particular.
On the contrary, the new legal framework will serve to enhance competition in this sector.
This House' s objective is to encourage incumbents to continue to be major players, yet there is a danger that their over-dominance will discriminate against new entrants, when one of our key priorities is to create a climate in which new entrants are allowed to flourish.
We are getting the balance right on this issue, and this I hope will actually counter concerns over the mounting debt in this sector at present.
For my group the intention of this raft of legislation is to encourage market development and to reduce the burden of legislation.
However, rules with a significant effect should not be based on a short-term vision.
I am therefore pleased that in the access directive the committee approved the inclusion of mobile networks in the definition, and I am equally pleased that the retail prices of international roaming, which are exorbitant at present, will be transparent and cost-based in future.
In a sector which is subject to such swift technological change, it is important to ensure that the regime is able to deal with unforeseen issues that might arise in the future.
The access directive will have the greatest impact on the European consumer as it will lead to lower prices, greater choice and better services.
At the same time, the new situation will create opportunities for businesses across Europe and especially small businesses.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank all the rapporteurs warmly for their commendable reports, but also my fellow MEPs for the excellent collaboration in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy.
Mr President, the liberalisation of telecommunications has created a new market environment with more competition and lower prices for companies and consumers.
Nevertheless there is still no single internal telecom market.
The fifteen fragmented, liberalised markets must be merged into a single transparent market, and the legislation now before us must create the framework for this.
The NRAs have an important part to play in this, but in the view of my group the final responsibility should remain with the Commission.
My second point, Mr President, concerns licences for radio frequencies.
At this moment there is no question in the Member States of the European Union of a consistent policy on the granting of licences.
Think, for example of the UMTS auctions.
As a result, the Union is threatening to lose its leading position in the field of mobile telephone communications.
In the dividing up of the radio spectrum the licence procedures should be subject to the same conditions in all Member States, because for optimum development of the radio and television market we should aim for a better balance in occupation of frequencies between public service providers on the one hand and commercial providers on the other.
I would ask the Commissioner to take a more active role in future in formulating the conditions and in relation to the way in which frequencies are distributed.
I believe there is also a job here for Commissioner Monti.
Finally, Mr President, the revenue that comes from the allocation of wavebands, such as the UMTS auction, should be channelled back to the ICT sector.
Mr van Velzen has already pointed this out.
It also concurs with the agreements at the Lisbon Summit.
Auctions should be avoided wherever possible.
Consequently, it is to be welcomed that the Dutch Government decided last week not to hold an auction.
In addition, the proceeds of the wavebands should never be seen as a stealth tax.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Greens agree with these three reports in principle.
One may well ask why this should be, given that these directives basically deal with the privatisation of the telecommunications market.
The public-sector undertakings have already been partly or completely privatised throughout the EU.
So the point is not if they should be privatised, it is merely how.
The European Greens have a clear attitude towards liberalisation.
We believe that the state has not always acted in the citizens' best interests, but we fear that privatisation will dismantle public services and we intend to fight a digital divide in society.
A great deal has been said about technological neutrality.
Technological neutrality may well exist at a purely legislative level.
But at a social level, technology is never neutral.
We want developments for the people, which are good for the people, which benefit everyone and hurt few, which is why we are in favour of maximum controls on monopolies in the telecommunications sector.
Maybe this cannot prevent our still having three telecommunications giants in the whole of the EU in ten years' time.
But it can prevent it if the national regulatory authorities are strengthened and the Commission also takes on an arbitration function, because then - and only then - is monopoly control even thinkable.
We are also in favour of new companies' being able to offer services which compete with former public undertakings on fair terms.
This at least will give more people a chance of being able to afford Internet access even though - let me stress once again - we believe in neither the hand of fate nor market logic.
So where does this take us?
The aim is to regulate a sector of the economy which should bring people greater independence and more self-determination.
We want to help ensure that everyone who wants access to these technologies can take advantage of this opportunity.
And we want people to be able to use digital communications to communicate and organise themselves, in brief to develop this, throughout the world.
And that means fair access.
Not just in private households, but also in public places, in libraries, schools and all public places.
This communication must be free.
It must be available to everyone indiscriminately and, if at all possible, it must be available to everyone on the same terms, which is why we say no to the numerous attempts to restrict, censor or criminalise the Internet.
Even if this is not specified in the directives before us, censorship and the supervisory authorities' quest for more and more control over people appears increasingly to be the essence of any attempt to shape the digital sector, which is why it must be said here that we Greens are in favour of open access for everyone.
We want open digital communications. We do not want more supervision, we want no supervision.
That is the only reason we went along with the arrangements for privatisation, given that we do not in fact want privatisation.
Mr President, the telecommunications companies proclaim that competition should regulate the market.
But can we trust in competition as a regulator of the market?
No, we cannot.
Although telephone charges have gone down in many countries, not all charges have.
For example, in Finland charges for local wired telephone calls have risen by a quarter in the last few years.
In addition, it is impossible for consumers to discover what mobile phone calls cost to different companies' networks or wired telephones.
We live in a jungle, where the laws of the jungle determine prices.
The lion' s share of profits are being grabbed by supranational operators whose objective it is to dominate the market.
Unfortunately, the governments of certain Member States of the Union are like Tarzan, King of the Jungle, who has in his hands a limited natural resource - new frequencies.
The central left governments of Germany and Britain have auctioned off mobile phone UMTS frequencies to telecommunications companies in such a way that a crisis is looming for the companies involved and many banks.
The stock market bubble has now burst as far as that sort of thinking is concerned, based as it was on a belief in the power of information technology to work miracles.
The auctions have sabotaged the e-Europe project. They have weakened democracy.
They have caused telephone charges to go sky-high. They are an imposition on the free flow of information and data.
Would all of this have been avoidable if there had been a framework directive on telecommunications at the disposal of the EU?
I would like to think so, although it is not certain it would have.
But now we have to try out a framework directive, and Mr Paasilinna has been engaged on an immense task in its preparation.
He is calling for a thorough investigation into the financial effects of auctions.
Our group supports this.
However, it is difficult to agree with Mrs Niebler' s amendment to the framework directive. It is based on the values and interests of certain European monopolies and is at odds with a democratic information society.
I would like to join my colleagues in congratulating the rapporteurs on their work, and also commending their work to the House, because of the cooperation that there was between the different rapporteurs.
However, one of my key areas of concern with regard to the e-commerce and e-Europe revolution is equality of access for consumers.
Members have already mentioned the costs and the tariffs that are associated with the different structures.
However, we are seeing a new divide being created between the haves and have-nots as regards digital technology and access to it.
One of the key components which must be enshrined within all liberalisation or competition law in this area is the question of universal access for all, so that no matter where anybody is living they have the same access as somebody living in a large urbanised area.
We also need to ensure that people of a different generation from the present younger generation are not disadvantaged because of lack of access to training for this new means of communication and this new information network.
The final point that I would make is that we must move to a system where there is a flat rate for access to information technology and not allow internal competition to arise which will block the further expansion of this new global system.
Mr President, we support the Commission's initiative and see it as a substantial step forwards towards the simplification, at the very least, of European legislation.
We would, however, like to emphasise the existence, in any case, of a serious contradictory situation affecting the electronic telecommunications sector which, if, something is not done, is likely, in time, to sabotage any endeavours to create a situation of competition benefiting the consumer.
The contradiction lies in the genuine conflict of interests present in many European States, who find themselves in a situation in which they are both regulators and holders of economic and political interests, both referees and players in the game.
This is true in the field of telephony, but also in the field of digital television, where the huge investments financed by public funding give public broadcasters enormous power.
We must therefore be aware of this fundamental anomaly but, overall, I repeat, we support the package.
Following the result recently achieved with the adoption of the regulation on local loop unbundling, it is now time to find an initial solution to a situation in which any company operating on the European electronic communications market finds that it has to weave its way not only through the layers upon layers of directives and regulations issued over the years but also through a plethora of national regulatory authorities acting under extremely varied legislation according to a very wide range of criteria which the operator cannot even hope to predict, and it therefore finds itself in a situation of fragmentation and, at times, great legal uncertainty.
The Commission's proposals have the merit of streamlining the existing legislation to form a small number of directives, in addition to creating an increasingly pan-European telecommunications market.
It must also be stressed - and I think Mr Brunetta made this point - that the goal to be striven after is the achievement in as short a time as possible of a situation of genuine competition where there is no longer a need for the heavy regulatory hand of the authorities.
We must endeavour to reach a stage where there is no longer a role for the national regulatory authorities, we must bring the electric communications sector to the point where the general competition rules valid for the entire market are applied.
We will only be able to achieve this when we have succeeded in prising out the root of this fundamental problem of multiple roles and the conflict of interests, which are still there at State level, with the weight of the State in the electronic communications economy: only then will we be able to bring this sector into line with the common competition law which prevails in the other sectors.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I recently read an excellent and extremely interesting dissertation by Dr Leitl on the control of abusive practices, which convinced me that what we need most is a functioning and supervised market and fair payment for services.
It is clear from roaming fees, for example, that the market is far from transparent.
It would be good if consumers really could find out exactly what their conversations cost or if they at least received a follow-up SMS straight away, telling them what the call had cost.
This sort of transparency results in benchmark comparisons, i.e. you can compare who is best in Europe and how we compare with the rest of the world.
We want to work out a best practice method together with the Commission.
Who in Europe or anywhere else in the world has the models which work best and which we can use ourselves?
Above all - and this is very important - we also want to use SLIM.
Various regulations being introduced today will, in fact, need to be repealed as quickly as possible once the market starts functioning.
One very important point in the Paasilinna report is Amendment No 47, because we have seen that, although the auctions were fair, a great deal of money has pulled out of this important sector.
That is why we consciously do not want to treat the proceeds from auctions as straight taxation and why we politicians take the view that this was an investment, an asset which was once a public-sector asset and which is now a virtual asset for the companies.
I also believe that, once the licences have expired, these rights should be retained by the companies, which can then sell, rent or otherwise trade them.
That will improve the companies' rating and it will improve the capital market and, by extension, the share prices, giving us an investment in this sector and strength for the future.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when one is so far down the list of speakers, one always runs the risk of repeating certain points.
I want to try and avoid that.
But I too should like to highlight two or three points.
I too should like to express my gratitude for the interesting and exciting cooperation in Parliament right across the group divide.
There are certainly material arguments here which go beyond political bounds.
I too found the discussions with various representatives from companies large and small right across Europe very interesting and, although not everyone will be satisfied, I think we are on the right track towards a more viable future.
It has been my conviction over recent years that we need to create tight, bundled rules which allow us to react quickly in the future to technological progress.
In this respect, my maxim still holds: less regulation may be much better regulation.
I think that, in concentrating on the directives being debated today, we have succeeded in doing this.
I also think that sooner or later - I think relatively soon - we shall be able to start applying general competition law.
I must, of course, pour just a little cold water on one point.
I personally and many of my fellow Members fully support Amendment No 78, as tabled by Mrs Niebler, and shall vote in favour of it.
As I said, this support cuts more or less across the group divide, because I am positive that this proposed amendment does not stand in the way of European harmonisation.
On the contrary, in my view, the type of licensing procedure and powers set out in this article are more time-consuming and bureaucratic and, in my book, constitute interference in regional affairs in the public-service radio sector, as my fellow Member, Karin Junker, has already said.
In this respect I feel strongly that, whatever the approach, we must prevent the 'must carry' obligation from being abolished through the back door.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the first phase of the internal market is drawing to a close, marking the end of monopolies and the opening up of national markets to competition.
Today we are debating the options for the second phase.
The question has been raised, and it is more than a question, it is a choice.
Mr van Velzen was one of many who said that our aim is a great pan-European market.
I concur.
Today, however, we are discussing the options of 'how' to achieve this, and there is a difference between choosing to achieve genuine and sustainable competition, as in a traditional sector - which is what Mr Brunetta advocates - and what we would like, which is different; i.e. public regulation of networks in Europe, with competing services but alongside the development of a universal service, and, where necessary, possible sharing of infrastructure.
What is at stake, therefore, is the debate on how the market will be regulated rather than the objective of creating a pan-European market.
We believe that the option being considered is of dubious value; i.e. to have national regulation of the telecommunications market and common rules on genuine competition on a Community level.
It is unsound, because, currently, national regulation means every man for himself.
All the Members of this House have criticised the problems of allocating radio frequencies, the extreme variations in licence costs, the excessive debts of some of the operators, and so there may be risks of the telephone market crashing just as the property market crashed a while back.
Therefore, we are not favouring indiscriminate national regulation but we are in favour of the rules of competition, even if, for example, the Commission has tried to move towards the concept of a relevant market, which is not supported by the Council and we have to deal with - and the Commission, perhaps, is not moving in this direction - issues on development of a universal service, problems with investment savings and on sharing of the networks so as to be able to reduce costs.
We would therefore advocate - and I personally would advocate - a system of European regulators, basically to create a pan-European market, but we come up against the European framework of references and rules, and I believe that we are going to have to look more closely into this, because the solution that we currently have is an absolute hybrid, I must stress this.
The proposed package, which will result from all these negotiations, cannot be seen as set in stone.
Despite the efforts some have made, it is another regulatory nightmare.
That is why I believe that we need to widen the public debate on the action plan that you are outlining, by involving civil societies to a much greater extent in order to reach agreement.
This has been a difficult and complex task and the three rapporteurs have certainly done a very good job in the circumstances.
We have had difficulty in reconciling the texts.
We have not made the Commission' s task easier.
Between us, we have overcomplicated these texts and it is going to have a job to sort these out before the second reading.
It is a lesson for us in the future that, as politicians and parliamentarians, we should focus on simplification and minimum regulation.
I was interested that my colleague, Mrs Gill - unfortunately she is no longer here - made the point of support for market development to minimise regulation.
We have not done that with the amendments that we have made.
The problem with the work that we have done so far is that we have got bogged down in today' s thinking.
We are actually finding excuses for regulating.
We have spent an enormous amount of time on significant market power and deciding how to regulate it, instead of actually thinking about the way forward.
I am pleased a number of colleagues, including Mr Glante, made that point as well.
That is something that we need to reflect on between now and the second reading.
I am particularly concerned about the fact that we are not thinking about the way the market is going to reconstruct.
We should look at the change in sentiment in the market that has taken place over the time that we have been reviewing these texts and think about the mobile market which is still enormously dynamic, has shown terrific rates of growth, is introducing new products all the time, and is within sight of getting mobile communications to two-thirds of the European population.
We are spending far too much time here thinking about transitory issues of roaming.
I know colleagues feel very strongly about it but the market will actually cure those issues.
I remain entirely unconvinced that the sort of interventionist approach we have taken here is right.
In conclusion, I remind colleagues that there is one more very important report to come, my report on universal service, and many of the things you have talked about and, indeed, some of the provisions on mobile are actually more appropriate for my report and not for Mr Brunetta' s.
I am sure the Commission will remind us of that but I shall resist those sort of temptations when I come back to you in two months time.
The rapporteurs have done excellent work here.
Mr Paasilinna is an old hand but I would like to welcome Mr Brunetta and Mrs Niebler to the secret world, the secret language, of telecommunication junkies.
What are we actually about here?
What we are about is creating new rules to look at who can play and on what terms.
We are looking for a genuine pan-European single market.
We are looking at where regulation has succeeded and, if I could say to Mr Harbour, not only where regulation has failed but why it has failed, and that is very important.
Mr Paasilinna, in his written contribution, posed the question who will regulate the regulator and I think that the role of the Commission is absolutely crucial in this.
It is not only about who will regulate the regulator but why we need to regulate the regulator.
Mr Clegg spent an enormous amount of time just last year on the local loop unbundling rules and I am posing a separate question to you, Commissioner, to ask if you will give an indication of where already we are seeing resistance at Member State level to implementing local loop unbundling.
There are a couple of positive things that I want to draw your attention to, because we also need to make sure that access in its widest sense really is available.
I tabled amendments in the Industry Committee on the rights of disabled consumers, particularly because of inadequacies in the RTTE directive which I know the Commission are aware of, and I was pleased that the committee and, I hope, Parliament are going to continue to support this.
Going back to my original point, what this is really about is making sure that the European Union' s telecommunications industry has a climate in which it can thrive and survive and remain competitive.
These are important steps in that direction.
Three points: first of all on this important issue of SMP.
We have made a stab at trying to enhance and improve the text but I am concerned, as was Mr Harbour, that we may actually have complicated matters, so whilst I feel that we have added a menu of additional concepts, a mÃ©lange, a pot-pourri of new tools to deploy under the title of SMP, I wonder whether we should perhaps be a little more bold in the second reading and perhaps think of drawing back where we consider, on reflection, those new concepts might actually be adding to confusion rather than diminishing confusion.
Second point: NRAs.
This is really a point I would like to address to the Council, not that there is much point in doing it here this evening, but the Member States cannot have it both ways. They cannot have their cake and eat it.
They cannot wish to see a vibrant pan-European telecoms market established and yet not have any meaningful criteria attached to the way in which NRAs operate.
That is an unsustainable position and, politically, we should push the Member States harder and harder on this.
There need to be clear criteria of independence and autonomy and proper resourcing which we need to really push upon the Member States, and not be swayed by their slightly misleading claims that it is all to do with subsidiarity and therefore none of our business.
Finally, on the all-important Article 6 of the Paasilinna report and the vexed Amendment No 33, which Mrs Niebler spoke about earlier, we should perhaps have another look at it in second reading.
I am not sure if you have the balance right.
I am clear at this stage - and my group will vote against it - that those provisions should not cover 'must carry' provisions and we will be voting against that section of that amendment tomorrow.
Finally, I wonder whether as legislators we really do make good telecoms junkies, to quote Mel Read.
I just leave that as a question mark.
Mr President, the quantum leap made in telecommunications over recent years might, under different circumstances, have brought about a commensurate improvement in everyone's quality of life.
However, in a capitalist society, the only thing that matters is to maximise profits.
Now that everything can be bought and sold, we have the apparent paradox of radio frequencies being treated as a commodity, auctioned to the highest bidder.
The next step will be to market the very air that we breathe.
As a result, the whole telecommunications sector, which was once a public-sector service and which was developed using public funds, has already been handed over to the private sector.
And now we are in the ridiculous position of examining directives which qualify as intervention of a purely state monopoly nature by the European Union in a bid to regulate various monopoly interests in the context of the full liberalisation of the market and support for competition.
The sole purpose of a harmonised framework is to overcome national barriers restricting the unaccountable spread of supranational monopolies to all the Member States.
The pan-European market preached by the directives is no more than unaccountable action on the part of big business, despite the supposed interest in protecting small enterprises.
This being the case, the Communist Party of Greece will be voting against the directives.
Mr President, the telecommunications package is about to achieve its first goal.
Passions in one way or another will give rise yet to a colourful debate.
The rapporteurs, Mr Brunetta, Mrs Niebler, and Mr Paasilinna, in particular, as well as Mr van Velzen, have all worked very hard indeed to create compromises, and I would like to say a special thank you to them.
The definition of a dominant market position has been the main area of special attention.
The balance now achieved will be a clear message to the Council, which it will also then have to take account of.
The Commission at one stage was going to walk all over the national supervisory authorities, but that did not happen.
Owing to cultural differences the national regulatory authorities must be given some leeway and they must have their role strengthened.
The Commission is above the NRAs, and its role must be to monitor the adherence to rules common to all.
We must be able to intervene in roaming charges that are currently distorting competition.
A written question of mine last year was connected with the hampering effect these roaming charges have on competition.
The workings of an open internal market must be respected.
There must be further wide-ranging discussion with regard to the position of virtual operators.
We have to consider upon what terms and conditions a virtual operator can work in the network, to permit free competition and to guarantee a benefit to consumers, though, on the other hand, the rights of network ownership should be protected.
We are in a bipartite situation and we are hardly going to find a solution to it right away.
Mr President, I too should like to thank my fellow Members for their reports and the Commission.
I think that this form of cooperation has brought about a good compromise which may not, of course, be supported on all points by the whole House but which has demonstrated nonetheless that we are often able, through productive debate, to bring about a result which, on several counts, has real potential for development over and above the Commission's concept.
The crucial question throughout has been whether or not to support Mrs Niebler's amendment - my fellow Member, Mr van Velzen, is engaged in conversation just now, but he addressed this point and pleaded in favour of it.
I too am in favour of our supporting it, addressing as it does the crucial question of how harmonisation is to be organised at European level.
The Commission has rightly pointed out that we need more harmonisation in this sector and more uniform structures.
Of that there can be no question; we have been discussing this point for years.
I have in the past always been a fanatical advocate of a single European regulatory authority but this idea is now dead and buried.
We opted for a different variant and I think that numerous regulatory authorities have demonstrated that they are independent, self-sufficient and autonomous and that the state too is more than capable of developing excellent competition models here.
Of course, there are other models which fall short of our expectations at European level, of that there can be no doubt, and something needs to be done here.
The crucial question is how to configure the relationship between the European and national levels and here I would have preferred a lighter model, either along the lines suggested by me and my fellow Member, Norbert Glante, or along the lines of Mrs Niebler's model.
Which is why I shall call for a vote in favour of Mrs Niebler's amendment tomorrow.
Once again, we must pause for thought and I am most grateful to Malcolm Harbour and Nicholas Clegg, who have pointed out that they have been wondering in the meantime if the variations which they supported were the right ones and I think that is most intelligent of them.
We have enough time to consider this between now and the second reading; perhaps we shall have found a common approach by then.
I would like to support, in particular, Amendments Nos 13 and 16, 19 and 20.
I tabled similar amendments in the Culture Committee.
These were amendments to help to ensure that disabled users benefit equally from electronic communications.
Service providers must recognise their role in facilitating access to terminal equipment for disabled users and the framework directive must include, in my opinion, access to terminal equipment and software.
Article 7(4)(e) says that they are keen to address the needs of specific social groups, in particular disabled people.
That is meaningless without these amendments.
We do not want to regulate all equipment sold on the high street but the interfaces should be regulated for vision-impaired people, for instance.
The menu on television or mobile phones should have an audio alternative.
It is a small change.
It is not much to ask but it would affect the lives of disabled people and mean that they could be included in the electronics communications revolution instead of being excluded.
I would first like to thank the three rapporteurs, Mr Brunetta, Mr Paasilinna and Mrs Niebler.
These are not just any reports.
Firstly they cover three directives which will be central to the future competence of the European economy.
Secondly, the amount of knowledge of technologies, markets and regulation which is needed for drawing up these reports is exceptional, so let me sincerely salute the reports for their high quality.
I am not able to cover, due to the time-limits, all the issues of crucial importance that I would like to.
I apologise for this and will try to concentrate on the very core issues.
First, on the framework directive, the Commission is very pleased with the Paasilinna report, in particular as regards the consultation and transparency mechanism contained in Article 6.
This is the key provision to ensure that not only national interest drives regulatory decisions but that European interest is also taken into account.
After all, if we do not take into account European interest, we do not serve national interest in this business either.
This legislation will ensure a level playing field for operators across the single market.
Its application will lead to a European regulatory culture in the telecommunications sector which will help to even out those differences in national decisions that can threaten the single market and the whole sector.
I am referring here, as many here have already done, to different licensing conditions imposed by Member States for the third-generation services.
The Commission is happy to support those parts of Amendment No 33 which aim at strengthening the transparency and consultation procedure and the Commission is strongly against Amendment No 78 which would weaken this procedure.
However, we consider that the requirement to consult other national regulatory authorities on draft measures is necessary for the creation of the European regulatory culture.
The second key element is the SMP definition.
It is the Commission' s view that the definition in Amendment No 56 is too wide.
We are concerned that it could lead to over-regulation, which would lead to fear of over-regulation by the operators, which could in turn hamper investment.
We also believe that this definition could undermine consistency of regulatory action.
The Commission considers that its original proposal would better serve the fundamental objective of the whole package, which is to minimise regulation but provide regulators with flexible tools to ensure effective competition in every market segment.
On institutional issues, I am convinced that we must involve the European Parliament closely in the process of implementing the new framework.
We must seek together the most efficient and flexible mechanisms for involving Parliament but for institutional reasons we cannot go against the agreements on comitology.
Thus I regret that the Commission cannot support Amendments Nos 72 to 74.
Finally, on digital television, I will soon be inviting the market players to discuss how best to ensure that digital television systems are rolled out swiftly in Europe so that digital television becomes a viable alternative platform for Internet access.
For the time being, the Commission considers that voluntary industrial standardisation is the best process, and it is not ready to support Amendment No 63.
As far as the report of Mr Paasilinna is concerned, the Commission can accept in full Amendments Nos 4, 12, 29, 32, 34, 55, 65 and 68 and the Commission can accept in part or in principle Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 22, 25, 27, 28, 30, 31, 33, 35, 36, 37, 38, 40, 45 to 48, 53, 54, 57 to 61, 66, 67, 69 and 75.
The Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 5, 8, 14, 16, 18, 20, 23, 24, 26, 39, 41 to 44, 49 to 52, 56, 62, 63, 64, 70 to 74 and 76 to 79.
On Mr Brunetta' s report on access and interconnection, I am thankful for the support for the basic principles of the directive.
In competitive markets interconnection of and access to networks should, in principle, be agreed on the basis of commercial negotiations.
If this does not happen regulatory intervention is warranted but we have to ensure that regulatory intervention is done on the basis of a market analysis.
We have to prove first that the market is not competitive and only then impose ex ante regulation if necessary.
Therefore, I believe that imposing straightforward price regulation on mobile call termination or on roaming charges would be over-regulating.
The Commission cannot support Amendments Nos 39 and 40.
However, there is a field where all service providers have been subject to access regulation.
This is the conditional access for digital television.
This regime has worked well.
Moving away from the regime of Directive 95/48 would require wide consultation and careful analysis.
Therefore, the Commission does not support Amendment No 46.
To sum up, the Commission can accept in full Amendments Nos 7, 8, 15, 21, 29, 41, 44 and 48.
The Commission can accept in part or in principle Amendments Nos 1, 6, 9, 12, 16 to 18, 19, 23, 24, 26, 28, 30 to 34, 37, 38, 42, 43, 45 and 47.
The Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 2 to 5, 10, 11, 13, 14, 20, 22, 25, 27, 35, 36, 39, 40, 46 and 49 to 51.
Concerning Mrs Niebler' s report on the authorisation directive, the Commission is very pleased with the support for the basic principles of its proposal.
The move from individual licences to general authorisations will greatly improve market access and cut red tape.
In many respects, Mrs Niebler' s report strengthens and improves the Commission' s proposals.
For the key issue of usage fees for radio spectrum I welcome the elements that seek to strengthen coordination and to eliminate the possibility of unproportionate and potentially disastrous licensing conditions.
The idea of annual instalments for the payment of one-off amounts is a possible solution.
We will, however, have to look carefully at the exact wording.
The obligation on Member States to take account of the policy objectives of the whole framework in their systems for frequency pricing is likewise welcomed.
It is also one of the key objectives pursued in the Commission' s proposal for a regulatory framework for radio spectrum policy.
Specifying that frequency pricing mechanisms are subject to the consultation and transparency procedure of the framework directive is also useful.
All in all, we are happy to accept most of Amendment No 21, subject to some redrafting.
However, on the matter of administrative charges the Commission cannot support Amendments Nos 7 and 20. They would delete the provision that aims to ensure that such charges will not have a discriminatory effect.
Maintaining turnover as a key for dividing administrative charges seems the most appropriate way.
The Commission is willing, however, to consider some of the elements proposed in the new Amendment No 27 tabled by Mr van Velzen.
To sum up, the Commission can accept in full Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 23 and 25.
The Commission can also accept in part or in principle Amendments Nos 8, 11 to 14, 16, 18, 20 to 24 and 26 to 28.
The Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 4, 6, 7, 9, 15, 17 and 19.
Finally, I should like to touch briefly on the situation on the telecommunications markets and licensing for third-generation services.
Of course we are all worried - Europe is the world leader in mobile communications and we have to maintain this lead.
We know the facts.
The current legislation leaves Member States the choice of licensing methods and licensing conditions.
We know that it has led to a wide divergence in the sums paid for the licences.
The single market is fragmented.
Frequency actions which coincided with the peak of the new economy stocks led to price levels which would be unimaginable in today' s market conditions.
I am ready to reply positively to Mr Paasilinna' s request for a Commission report later on the licensing issue.
There is uncertainty and preoccupation in the market now, but we have to remember the fact that third-generation mobile communications will offer enormous potential for totally new types of services.
There will be a strong business case for it and public authorities must ensure that the right conditions are in place, and here we need to work together.
We have to safeguard Europe' s lead in mobile communications.
There is no magic wand but we absolutely must get the future regulatory framework right.
Our proposals, with Parliament' s support, provide for procedures that allow for coordinated or even harmonised assignment of radio frequencies.
The consultation and transparency procedure of Article 6 of the framework directive, the authorisation directive and the Commission' s proposal for a regulatory framework on radio spectrum policy provide us with the necessary instruments.
The new framework will also allow for secondary trading of radio spectrum which enables more flexible management of this resource.
More than ever we need to work together.
The European Parliament and the Commission should try to convince the Member States to take a more coordinated approach to frequency assignment.
I urge Parliament to debate soon the proposal for radio spectrum policy and thus send out a strong signal on the importance and the urgency of the matter.
Finally, on the proposals made by Mr van Velzen, I strongly agree with him that we need firm actions to stimulate the use of mobile Internet and take steps to keep the European lead in third-generation.
We have to see that new Internet protocol version 6 will be rolled out swiftly.
We have to stimulate European content production and we also need to increase the availability of public sector information for these purposes.
We have to see that sufficient research funding is available for future wireless technologies as foreseen in the Commission' s proposal for the sixth Framework Programme for research and also, the other proposals which he made, I am ready to look at them and the Commission will come back to this area.
Together we must guarantee that Europe' s lead in mobile communication will be safeguarded.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
(The sitting was suspended at 7.55 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)
Effects of globalisation on Mediterranean women immigrants
The next item is the report (A5Â­0058/2001) by Mrs AvilÃ©s Perea, on behalf of the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, on the consequences of globalisation for women immigrants from the Mediterranean countries [2000/2251(INI)].
Mr President, this initiative report which we are debating today in Parliament is being produced at the request of the Euro-Mediterranean Forum for women Members of Parliament and is part of the general concept of globalisation which is going to be examined throughout this weekend at the meeting which begins tomorrow in Malta.
The European Parliament took responsibility for producing this report on the effects of globalisation on female immigrants.
Emigration is an ancient phenomenon but it has recently taken on some new characteristics.
It is not only men who emigrate, with the women then using regrouping to later reunite their children with the husband, but rather the woman herself is now the emigrant. The woman is the head of the family and it is she who seeks, by changing country, by coming to the European Union, a better personal situation, a better future for herself and her family.
The woman comes as a person seeking opportunities that are not available in her country of origin.
In general, she works in the service sector, she does not have a high level of training and she finds herself in a vulnerable situation as a result of being both an immigrant and a woman.
She usually does work which the nationals of the various countries do not want, but which are necessary for the economy to operate properly.
Recently, female immigrants have also been important for maintaining jobs, for bolstering the active population, given the ageing of the population in certain Member States, and for future prospects.
These women do not come temporarily in order to resolve a problem, but they come determined to stay, to start a new life in a country which they believe is going to accept them.
In the majority of cases they come without sufficient information.
They have often been deceived and are victims of mafias that traffic in human beings, from which they are unable to escape, in many cases ending up in prostitution.
This lack of information is one of the most important aspects that we highlight in this report.
These women must be aware of the state of the job market, the legal requirements, what their living conditions will be and what they must provide in order to work legally in the country they are heading for.
There are also cases of highly qualified women who have to do work which is not appropriate for their training.
There are situations of abuse, resulting from their state of vulnerability in a country with whose language and legislation they are not familiar, living isolated in a world which is difficult for them.
We want these women to live in a legal situation with decent employment contracts so that they cannot become victims of exploitation.
This means that they must be provided with greater information in their countries of origin.
We therefore call for offices to be set up in order to resolve these problems so that these women may come fully informed about the work they are going to do.
I must point out that in the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, certain amendments have been introduced into the report which neither I, as rapporteur, nor my group, agree with.
They refer to the concept of 'Euro-Mediterranean citizenship' .
This concept raises legal problems. There is no precedent for this concept in any report or any declaration either by this Parliament or by the national parliaments.
Citizenship is a national competence of the Member States and I believe that introducing this concept into the report adds little and could, in fact, create legal problems.
We have therefore requested a split vote because we would like to remove this concept from the report so that we can support it without problems.
If it is retained, I think it will be very difficult for us to vote in favour of the report, which would be unfortunate since the report has some very positive aspects for women and is greatly needed given the situation in which the majority of these women find themselves.
I would like to ask you to reconsider so that, by removing these terms, we can have a report which is approved by the whole House.
Mr President, allow me to begin by congratulating Mrs AvilÃ©s Perea on her excellent report.
My congratulations are sincere because she has been able to deal in a full and balanced way with the consequences which globalisation have had on the world of immigration, specifically for women and in particular for women from the southern region of the Mediterranean.
I believe that the rapporteur has sought to produce a balanced text, which is necessary and possible, which reflects the differing views and sensibilities, while avoiding extremist and dogmatic positions, and a text which reflects the diverse opinions and the seriousness of the situation.
Of course, globalisation is not a panacea for all evils.
Globalisation does not necessarily mean well-being and wealth and, in many cases, it is or could be a source of inequality and greater poverty.
The Treaty of Amsterdam established for the first time the Union' s competence in the field of immigration and asylum, and the Tampere European Council agreed that the issues of asylum and immigration, which are different but closely related, make a European Union common policy necessary. This means that we need to evaluate present and future migratory flows in all their categories: humanitarian reasons, family reunification and economic reasons, as the rapporteur already mentioned, and demographic changes, the situation of the labour market and of the immigrants' countries of origin.
In political terms, I believe that we must choose between continuing to hold the view that the Union can continue to resist migratory pressures or accepting that immigration is going to continue and must be adequately regulated, working together to maximise the positive effects of immigration, both for the Union and for the immigrants themselves and for their countries of origin.
The situation is clearly more critical in the case of female migrants.
They are more vulnerable to abusive practices.
We must, therefore, accept any initiative which may make us reflect on this issue. Such matters include the demographic structure of each country of the Union as a whole, demographic development, the origin of existing immigrants in the European Union, jobs which they carry out in the place of others - in other words, domestic work done by immigrants allows women from the receiving country to work outside the home - marginalisation, prostitution and living and working conditions.
All of this must be considered within a balanced framework of rights and obligations for all nationals of third countries resident in the Union.
I therefore believe - and I appeal to the generosity required by the seriousness and the exacting nature of the issue - that it would be good to remove concepts such as 'Euro-Mediterranean citizenship' , which I believe create confusion and in my view are exclusive.
The Mediterranean, the birthplace of civilisations and culture, must be a factor for integration and not for exclusion.
I therefore believe that we must support action to integrate women and to provide them with dignity, and we must not forget that in many countries they are still not even considered to be citizens.
A broad consensus will no doubt give our demands and our actions more force.
Mr President, I feel that we should make the purposes of this report that we are discussing much clearer than is achieved by its entry on the agenda.
I do not know how many Members are aware that a Euro-Mediterranean Forum for women Members of Parliament is to start tomorrow.
This forum was not the result of a European Parliament initiative.
This is the second year it has been staged: the first took place last year in Naples on the initiative of the national parliaments.
Parliament did not take part at all precisely because the forum was not the result of consultation between the European and national parliaments.
In the meantime, the - in my opinion, wise - decision has been taken to participate in this assembly through the appointment of two representatives - Mrs AvilÃ©s and myself - as part of the Presidency bureau and of four Parliamentary representatives to attend the plenary forum.
It was decided by the forum bureau to give the women from the European Parliament the subject of 'Globalisation, migration and citizenship': this is the title of our contribution and also of the contribution of the speakers from Tunisia, for the reports expound two different viewpoints.
To be honest, I do not know whether it was wise to base a procedure involving a plenary vote on our contribution, a contribution which will have to be somewhat freer than a simple report.
This has caused problems: in fact, in tackling the subject of migration and, to a lesser degree, citizenship, we have raised problems for the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market - problems which I can understand - and some incomprehension within the groups, since this concept of Euro-Mediterranean citizenship is not a legal concept.
I should like to banish totally the suspicion that we might be discussing something which would then require formalisation.
We know how difficult we are finding it already to advance a meaningful debate on, for example, the idea of coordinating migration and creating a migration policy.
Nevertheless, we have begun to tackle the political and cultural concept of Euro-Mediterranean citizenship, for example in the Parliamentary Forum held a few weeks ago in Brussels.
What is the purpose of this initiative?
To enable us, within the partnership that we have initiated with these countries, to build a relationship on democracy issues, on respect for human rights, on the tendency of certain forms of progress in those societies linked to a concept of integration based on shared values.
In my opinion, it is possible to meet this challenge and it will provide us with the opportunity to tackle, together with them, for example, the issue of respect for human rights - a recurring subject in our relationship with these countries about which there is always a hint of interference in their internal affairs - on fresh, equal ground, which will challenge those societies - but also our own - where, for example, the issue of migration poses cultural problems and problems of integration and convergence.
I therefore appeal to the rapporteur.
If she insists on there being a vote in Parliament, I am afraid there is a danger that this report may not be adopted.
I suggest that we leave it as a contribution of the Committee on Women's Rights. A contribution which will not implicate Parliament as an instrument which we will be able to invoke, which will allow us to be freer in the forthcoming debate in Malta and which will not be binding upon this House.
I would ask you sincerely to consider this option.
Mr President, let me begin by saying that it is in itself a good thing that the rapporteur should focus attention on the problem of the consequences of globalisation for female immigrants.
However, I have some misgivings, because what is the purpose of this report?
The previous speaker made this point.
Does it contribute to the finding of work, and if so, how?
The problems are certainly not limited to women from Mediterranean countries. Women from other parts of the world often have to contend with the same problems.
In addition, it is not the case that the European Parliament has not concerned itself with these problems before.
I think, for example, of the reports on trafficking in women and the communication from the Commission on a Community-wide immigration policy, which will shortly be discussed in various committees in the European Parliament.
My group therefore considers that this report is, in fact, too immature and too superficial to provide a substantial contribution to the discussion.
There are also a number of shortcomings in this report.
I shall mention a few.
Naturally we agree with gender mainstreaming in this field, but I have problems with the text: in Section 15, the Dutch version speaks of the "channelling of migratory flows to Europe" , while the English text refers to "quotas of migratory flows" .
Channelling migratory flows is just about acceptable to my group, but the introduction of quotas is definitely not.
A second point.
Internally the European Union has still not solved the problem of the recognition of each other' s national professional qualifications and titles.
That is, of course, crucial to this problem group, which is why, during the discussion in the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, the Liberals invited Member States - also in the context of immigration from Mediterranean countries (and, in fact, from all countries) - to recognise professional qualifications and titles.
But I find the proposal contained in the report to set up, especially for immigrants, an information office on domestic services, very odd.
It sounds very limited.
Surely it is not just a matter of cheap domestic help?
A third point.
The report talks of Euro-Mediterranean citizenship.
Does such a thing exist?
Will we have Euro-ACP citizenship or Euro-Mercosur citizenship?
Because the European Union has entered into treaties with these countries too.
And what kind of status will such a citizen have?
A higher status, or a lower one?
Such a measure might well lead to discrimination.
And I could go on.
My group therefore concludes that while it is in itself useful for the problems of women immigrants to be highlighted, this has been done previously and better.
This report is too superficial, too one-sided and bears the marks of a one-sided approach to a very vulnerable group.
As a result, my group finds itself obliged, despite the improvement introduced by us, to withhold its support from this report.
Mr President, let me begin by saying that I am a little surprised to see this report before the plenary sitting, because we in the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities originally decided that it should only be adopted in the Committee.
I also hope that the Bureau and all the political groups are aware of the fact that the numbering of the recitals and the paragraphs in the report differ from one language version to another, which means that, in a possible vote in the plenary sitting tomorrow, it will be incredibly difficult to know what we are voting on.
When it comes to the actual content of the report, I do not think that the consequences of globalisation for women should be dealt with on the basis of the demands made by an ageing population upon the EU.
Humanly speaking, that is the wrong end at which to begin.
I am sympathetic to Mrs AvilÃ©s Perea' s personal views on the issues of refugees, asylum seekers and immigrants.
I completely share the view that they must be accorded human rights, but the report as a whole does not attach enough importance to these issues.
We cannot therefore vote in favour of the report in a possible vote to be held in the plenary sitting tomorrow.
I would also appeal to Mrs AvilÃ©s Perea to withdraw the report and to take on board the discussions in the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, together with the outcome of the vote taken in that Committee.
Mr Eriksson, I must tell you that the Bureau is aware of the linguistic problems that exist and that could conceivably jeopardise tomorrow' s vote.
Parliament' s language services are aware of this situation and are doing everything they can this evening to ensure that tomorrow' s vote can go ahead in Parliament with the utmost linguistic accuracy.
Mr President, to tell the truth, I was not aware of the issues raised by the previous speakers regarding whether it would be better to stop at the stage of a committee text or to take a text adopted in Parliament to the forthcoming international assemblies.
In any case, I feel that a text adopted in Parliament would provide the representatives of the European Parliament with a mandate which may well, so to speak, be less free but more representative: it would be up to the representatives of this House to strike a wise balance between these two criteria.
I see that the matter has already been the subject of debate and even argument, so I will leave it there.
I hope that those who have spoken on the subject will be able to come to an agreement.
I have taken the floor merely to express my satisfaction at a couple of points which have been expressed extremely clearly in this report, which the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, which is more directly concerned with migration issues, has hitherto not succeeded in expressing so clearly.
I refer, in particular, to the part of the report which "Stresses the link between unwarranted barriers to immigration and trafficking in human beings, particularly women; ... and calls on the Member States to improve and amend their national laws on work permits and regularisation of immigrants".
This point, which is expressed so succinctly, simply and clearly, appears to be the root of the problem, the tensions and the negative effects of prohibitionist migration laws, which, I feel, work entirely to the detriment of women migrating to Europe.
Another point which I strongly welcome and which has never been expressed so clearly by another competent committee, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, concerns the issue of work.
Indeed, the report "Calls upon Member States to legalise and accord an appropriate legal statusto service sector jobs, which are widely filled by immigrant women".
I would add, also to legalise in terms of deregulation, for here, too, the regulations are rigid and bureaucratic in granting permits and in defining those forms of work; they are constraints which are wholly inappropriate in Europe today, which drive immigrant women, in particular, to marginalisation and illegal activities.
We therefore welcome these two points.
However, I am much less enthusiastic about the proposal regarding a new observatory.
In my opinion, the experiment of European Union observatories should be fully analysed.
I see these experiments as extremely negative attempts at creating bureaucratic machinery which is extremely ineffective in achieving its established goals of provision of information and awareness raising, as, moreover, are the awareness campaigns themselves.
I would have much more confidence in rules which bring about deregulation but also grant much greater freedoms and rights to immigrant women rather than attempting to replace consensus on policies with awareness campaigns.
I have much more faith in rules which guarantee rights and freedoms than in investment in awareness campaigns.
The same may be said of the issue of citizenship.
In my opinion, when we have recourse to a term such as 'citizenship', either we have to define clear legal statuses, rights with corresponding duties, rights, therefore, which guarantee the new freedoms, or else the term will be likely to cause confusion.
That is what I wanted to say on the report under consideration.
Mr President, I too congratulate Mrs AvilÃ©s Perea on her excellent work and on having initiated tonight's debate on the report.
However, two points must certainly be stressed, which have emerged both from the debate which took place in committee and from a series of majority votes which have contributed to creating or fostering the presence of certain positions within the report which I feel are questionable.
I will therefore divide the report into two parts: a first part, which I totally endorse, in which the rapporteur extremely courageously raises a major question of legality, managing to pre-empt to some extent in this report the need, which is present in all the European States, to tackle the issue of migration as a whole once and for all, in the knowledge now that the countries of the Union cannot have differing individual policies in such a problematic, sensitive field, and defining the rights and responsibilities of both the immigrants and the host countries.
At the same time, within this policy, the role of the most vulnerable groups - women and children - must certainly be analysed extremely carefully.
From this point of view, this aspect of the report is very useful, particularly in that it includes certain guidelines and decisions already expressed by the Tampere Council.
However, I would express my concern essentially on two points.
I, too, find it difficult to endorse either the creation of another observatory - for, in my opinion, observatories lead to rigidity and problems - or the use of the term 'European,' or even 'Euro-Mediterranean citizenship', which has absolutely no legal status and would cause confusion.
Mr President, every Member State in the European Union applies policies on women and families.
The way in which they do so depends mainly on their constitution and political institutions.
Despite some progress in the treatment of women in paid employment and in implementing equal treatment boundaries throughout Europe, sexual inequality persists.
The main aspects are correctly presented in the report.
This applies to the description of the situation of self-employed women, to gender-specific wage differentials and to differences in types of employment and unpaid work.
These economic ups and downs have serious consequences on the standard of living of individual families, most of the responsibility for which is shouldered by women.
As 8 March approaches, we need to get the point across that a person's achievements count for more than his or her sex.
Domestic violence and stereotypes, not to mention mediaeval perceptions of a woman's place, should be consigned to the past once and for all.
I want a Europe with one culture, where the dignity of men and women and of foreigners and immigrants is an asset, not an economic burden.
The report considers that all is not well here.
Nonetheless, the number of immigrants is rising, begging the conclusion that it really is time to create optimum conditions in the European Union, otherwise conflicts may intensify.
The report should cover these tasks more amply.
I would remind you that enlargement to the East is imminent, bringing with it many women with different traditions and different cultures who need to be attended to, not sidelined.
Mr President, it is a common misconception that globalisation trends and related policies are gender-neutral.
This is important to bear in mind when we discuss the problems of immigrant women in Europe.
The Commission considers that zero immigration is neither realistic nor justified.
The policy has never been fully implemented, not only because of the legitimate need for family reunification, but also for economic reasons.
In the future, demographic factors - the ageing of our workforce and population as a whole - are likely to make immigration more, rather than less, necessary and understood.
In this process we have to prevent gender-based discriminatory practices.
The promotion of proactive gender equality is very necessary.
In its communication on a Community immigration policy presented on 22 November last year, the Commission stated that, in the short term, immigration can be an important element of population growth and could accompany other responses to demographic change.
It will not in itself be an effective way of dealing with labour market imbalances, but can help alleviate skills shortages within the context of an overall structural strategy.
Migrants, including women migrants, may have a particular role to play in some of the areas particularly affected by the increase in the number of older people, while legal migrants, the majority of whom will be of working age, will play a part in reducing the financial burden of the elderly on the population of working age.
In December 1999, the Commission launched a draft directive on the right of family reunification which, among other matters, gives family members the right to immediate access to education, vocational training and employment.
The next steps will be the presentation of a draft directive on the status of long-term residents and a proposal on the admission of third-country nationals for the purpose of employment and self-employed activities and for the purpose of study on the territory of the Member States.
The Treaty of Amsterdam explicitly includes gender equality among the objectives of the European Community.
This applies to our domestic, as well as external, policies.
In addition, there are several political decisions which explicitly call for gender-equality concerns to be acted upon in development cooperation.
In order to strengthen the promotion of gender equality as an issue which affects all policies, programmes and projects, I will, in the near future, present to the college a programme of action for the mainstreaming of gender-equality development cooperation.
The trafficking in human beings is facilitated by globalisation and by modern technologies.
Trafficking in human beings, and in particular girls and women, not only involves sexual exploitation, but also labour exploitation in conditions akin to slavery.
The traditional flow between certain Third World regions and Western destinations continues.
What gives rise to even greater concern is the increase in the numbers of women and children trafficked into the EU from Central and Eastern European countries.
The Commission has taken significant steps against this violation of human rights.
Freedom from discrimination is a basic human right, be it on the grounds of nationality, sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation.
That is why the Commission very much welcomes that the Treaty of Amsterdam gives the Community powers to combat discrimination on all these grounds under Article 13.
The promotion and protection of human rights is an integral part of the EU' s human rights policy.
Immigrant women are particularly vulnerable to discrimination and social exclusion.
The employment strategy and the social funds are both designed to combat discrimination and secure inclusion in society.
Two directives recently adopted deal with discrimination, one related to employment and the other to racial discrimination.
Both integrate the gender perspective and the programme will support transitional activities.
Turning to the position of women in the labour market, let me recall that the Community' s employment strategy with its priorities of employability, entrepreneurship, adaptability and equal opportunities is about supporting Member States' efforts to introduce structural reforms into their employment, social protection and taxation systems.
This is a matter of equality.
It is also a matter of replacing discrimination with the economic good sense of engaging the enterprise and creativity of all those who need and want to work.
This requires our social model to be reformed to engage all our people, both women and men, in an inclusive economic and social Europe with equal access to opportunity, skills, personal development and the support this implies.
The European Structural Funds play a major role in this process.
To secure the rights of immigrant women is now fundamentally about good governance on the basis of shared values in a changing world for both sexes.
It is about tolerance, modernisation and improvement of the various tools of policy.
It is also about democracy and solidarity.
Equal representation is a key issue here.
The participation of women in political and civil life is fundamental to good governance, whether in Europe or elsewhere.
Women' s voices are still not being heard sufficiently in major policy areas.
Structural changes are required to make them more audible.
Institution-building to meet the challenges of globalisation must be accompanied by equal and shared participation of women in the political process.
Many of these things are well-known, well-established challenges.
Hopefully the new thing we can do is to face those challenges with a more rigorous will to do what is politically needed.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Nielson.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
Development policy
The next item is the report (A5Â­0059/2001) by Mr Gemelli, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the Commission communication to the Council and the European Parliament on the European Community' s Development Policy [COM(2000) 212 - C5Â­0264/2000 - 2000/2141(COS)].
I would like to start by thanking the Commissioner, for this report has come back to the Committee on Development and Cooperation a number of times and this has contributed to enriching the debate within the committee.
I would also like to thank the Chairman of the committee and all the group coordinators, and all the Members who have contributed to the preparation of this report, taking up, with great sensitivity, my invitation to make this report a document which compels broad consensus and a broad majority in Parliament, reflecting all the positions expressed by the European Parliament.
Lastly, I would also like to thank the draftspeople of the other committees: Mrs Carrilho of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, Mrs Haug of the Committee on Budgets, Mrs Lucas of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy and Mrs SÃ¶rensen of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, who have contributed their opinions to this report.
The report is based on a number of fundamental principles: restoring the balance of nature in order to protect the environment; protecting the food chain as a way of protecting the ecosystem; developing a self-sufficient, sustainable economy; restricting exploitative industrial monocultures; and then, restoring the balance of nature also in terms of anthropological progress and responsible relationships between man and woman, adult and child, workers and elderly people, based on a unit of society made of a man, a woman and children.
Another principle is that of responsible, self-administered development, as a cultural factor, of the need for, and the development of a higher standard of living: projects which are self-created, in order to promote the development of local culture and help people to look beyond customs originating from local culture; then awareness of the role of the institutions and the need to involve the private sector in programmes encouraging development; lastly, great, very great attention to the world of children, who, in the political world, are an invisible group of society with no voice or rights; moreover, a powerful role for women, recognising the role that women have always had in society, starting with the family and the work place.
It was with on the basis of these guidelines that the debate on the European Commission's communication took place. We found the debate somewhat simplistic compared to what ought to be the European Union's perspectives within this world of development.
And so, since it has not been possible to produce a coherent report on such a complex work, I feel simply that I must say that the conditions of poor people are worse today than in 1960, that is 40 years ago, that the number of children in school has fallen and that people are not being considered as individuals, as individual people, but that all the poor people in the world are being lumped together as one economic statistic.
Debt is also an issue which can and must be tackled, provided that we succeed in monitoring the States' budgets in order to reclassify budget items and dedicate them to the eradication of poverty.
Similarly, rural development must be improved, properly valued and increased, apart from anything else to offset the rush to build huge cities.
Then, with regard to conflict prevention, I feel that this issue has been dealt with more or less exhaustively in Mrs Carrilho's opinion on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, and that it too can be tackled through the regionalisation of development policy.
I would stress one further point. It would appear that there is a tendency to attempt to deal with the issues of development and eradicating poverty by entrusting this task to the multinationals.
I do not feel that the multinationals are the right organisations for the task. Rather, the role of the NGOs, who should have a direct relationship with the peoples of developing countries, should be strengthened.
In conclusion, I do not know whether this report will enable us to deal with these issues, but I do know that there are many children, women and men in need of our help, and we must protect them.
Mr President, the aim of my speech, which will be brief, is simply to highlight some of the aspects that I referred to in the opinion of which I was draftsperson on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy.
First of all, this Commission document is to be welcomed, and not only because it seeks to put right specific aspects of the way in which development and cooperation policy is implemented. It also endeavours to place this action in a broader framework with wide-ranging scope, in line with what was laid down at the Helsinki European Council.
Mr Gemelli' s report has added depth and consistency to this objective and therefore warrants our approval.
Secondly, I wish to draw your attention once again to the advantage to be gained from greater intracommunity coordination of development and foreign policy.
We all know that European participation plays a substantial role in supporting developing countries and that we provide more money than any other donor. These facts are not sufficiently appreciated, however, either for what they mean in financial terms, specifically in terms of commitments and the expectations that are raised, or for the responsibility that they require with regard to the political influence exercised on the development processes in the countries involved.
A common strategy to confirm the international role of the European Union, given legitimacy by the principles of cooperation and human rights, can only benefit those countries that wish to progress from the level of the helpless or even of victims to the status of partners.
Thirdly and finally, we must make development policy more effective, principally through a more reliable system for the monitoring, control and assessment of programmes and their results on the ground.
This would probably involve the creation of new management bodies, but it will certainly have to entail a better use of existing resources, specifically the delegations, and a genuine reform of the Community' s external service.
Mr President, I should like to begin by congratulating Mr Gemelli on having had his report adopted unanimously by the Committee on Development and Cooperation.
It deserves the same accolade from the House.
It is fair to say there was considerable input from all the political parties in this House, as Mr Gemelli accepted a number of amendments during the committee stage.
It lays down the foundation for development policy for the coming decade.
Some of the statistics it throws up are frightening in their nature, for instance the number of people under the age of 15 in developing countries; the utter poverty in which most of them live; the scourge of diseases such as AIDS, malaria and TB; the huge and widening gap between developed and developing nations; the predictions, which I believe will never be reached in the timescales laid down.
Lastly, there is the enormity of the task we face as a European Union to help eradicate these problems.
It is encouraging that the Commission, of its own initiative, has realised we cannot continue as we have in the past and that new structures and formats have to be found to close the gap between commitments and payments and that better use must be made of developing funds.
Trade is the key.
I applaud much of its thinking.
We in Parliament must support its efforts.
Decentralisation is a must to make better use of our delegation offices and cut red tape and wasted time.
As the rapporteur for regional cooperation and integration last year, I am pleased to see progress being pursued in this direction with ECOWAS in West Africa leading the way.
Only by strengthening internal regional trade will many nations be able to face globalisation and WTO rules.
'Everything but Arms' is a major step forward.
But to make best use of development aid there must be closer cooperation between nation states, financial institutions and the Commission.
