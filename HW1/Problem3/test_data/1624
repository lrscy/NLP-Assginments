I believe it to be quite essential that we should do so, since refusal to debate is a cause of public suspicion, and we must take care to reinforce the confidence of the European public in the European project as a whole and to create more trust and more clarity.
That is one of my core concerns in my position as President-in-Office, and it is for that reason that I welcome the debate that is now underway.
It is because we need public support for the enlargement process that we have to improve the flow of information and our public relations work, while also explaining the individual steps better.
We quite simply have to make it clear that we will be thorough and circumspect, and that, while we will not act precipitately, we will not arbitrarily step on the brakes either.
This is something I regard as an essential consideration.
Heaven forbid that we should, by introducing this concept of âassimilation capacityâ, impose an additional and arbitrary obstacle; on the contrary, it is about being aware, becoming aware, and making others aware of certain quite central and self-evident fundamental truths.
Every step in enlargement, every new accession requires two participants, one of them being the European Union, and the other the country that is to become a Member State.
We want to prepare for the next accessions as best we possibly can.
In this sense, too, Salzburg was important to me, for it was important that we should look back over the last three years and forward to the next practical steps, in that it enabled all of us to be clearer about where we stand and what actual preparedness there is, whether at home or abroad.
We can also have confidence in the expert knowledge that we gained during the last enlargement and should be determined to apply the knowledge of transformation that we have on a partnership basis.
As was said in the earlier debate, ownership, too, underlines European standards, which, though fair, must be stringently complied with, as was made unmistakeably clear in the Commissionâs report in November 2005.
In this debate, though, we should also be honest about the expectations people have of the European Union, not least the expectations of the people who live in it.
We owe each other clarity, and it is we alone who can give it to each other.
We must not make out cheques with nothing to back them up.
Moreover, I urge a more nuanced approach to each individual country, for we need to be fair in our dealings with each and every one of them, and we must make that a certainty.
The presidency will therefore be giving particular attention, in the ongoing debate, to the contributions made by your House.
Let me sketch out, in just a few words, the actual decisions that we are currently working on.
The first has to do with Romania and Bulgaria, concerning which the reports are encouraging and we already have the goal of accession on 1Â January 2007, albeit with the possibility of its being delayed by a year.
Turkey and Croatiaâs accession negotiations have begun; the starting pistol was officially fired on 3Â October last year.
We are now engaged in screening the , that is to say in analysing the We, the presidency, have written to Croatia and Turkey to invite them to set out their negotiating position on the first chapter, âResearch and Developmentâ.
We share your Houseâs view that continued progress in the fulfilment of all the political and economic criteria and in the effective realisation of fundamental rights, the rule of law and democracy is required.
As regards Turkey, we in the presidency welcomed the closure of the Orhan Pamuk case and made it clear, at the recent meeting of the troika in Vienna, that we expect the trials still pending under Article 301 of the Turkish Penal Code to be dealt with similarly, or, indeed, the law to be changed.
We, too, are closely monitoring the implementation of the Ankara protocol and will ensure that it is reviewed this year in the relevant bodies and in accordance with the Council statement of 21Â September 2005.
We regard the commencement of the accession partnership with Croatia as equally important, and have welcomed the Croatian prime ministerâs undertaking to ensure unconditional cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and the continuation of the same.
We share your Houseâs view that Croatia is contributing more to regional cooperation and that further efforts are required.
I have said what needs to be said about the Western Balkans.
The Councilâs strategy for obtaining Serbia and Montenegroâs full cooperation with the International War Crimes Tribunal is also clear, and we sent out a very clear signal relating to it at our last meeting.
We support the UN special envoy in Kosovo, Martti Ahtisaari, in his work, and I believe that the European Union, through the efforts of its special delegate Javier Solana, is capable of helping, in an enormously positive and diplomatic way, to reach an agreement on the conditions for the 21Â May referendum.
Â Â  . Mr President, as he is still here, let me commend Mr Brok for his important report.
As he rightly said, enlargement is indeed one of the EUâs most powerful policy tools to pursue peace and prosperity, liberty and democracy.
The eastern enlargement of 2004 sealed the peaceful reunification between Western and Eastern Europe.
Now our energy is focused on a peaceful unification in south-east Europe.
Our gradual and carefully managed accession process is based on three key principles.
First, we have consolidated our enlargement agenda.
It means that we must be cautious before taking any new commitments, but likewise we must stick to our prevailing commitments towards candidate or potential candidate countries already in the process.
Our consolidated enlargement agenda focuses on south-east Europe: Bulgaria and Romania, and Turkey and Croatia and the other countries of the western Balkans.
Secondly, we apply rigorous conditionality.
Combined with a credible accession perspective, conditionality works.
It has helped to transform Central and Eastern Europe into modern democracies.
More recently, it has inspired bold and significant reforms in Turkey and increasingly in the western Balkans.
This is also proven by some recent important events, as General Ante Gotovina is behind bars in The Hague, while the novelist Orhan Pamuk is free to express his opinions.
Enlargement policy and neighbourhood policy complement each other.
Furthermore, the Commission is ready to deepen further and upgrade cooperation with our neighbourhood partners once the main priorities in the current action plans have been properly addressed.
At the same time, we should avoid the pitfalls of an overly theoretical debate on the final borders of Europe.
As we now have a consolidated enlargement agenda, a theoretical discussion, for example about whether Ukraine should even join the European Union, would benefit neither us nor the Ukrainians, now that Ukraineâs future path and democratic development is at stake.
Certainly, the pace of enlargement must take into consideration the EUâs absorption capacity.
The Commission has always had this view.
Enlargement is about sharing a project based on common principles, policies and institutions.
The Union must ensure that it can maintain its capacity to act and decide according to a fair balance within its institutions, respecting budgetary limits and implementing common policies that function well and achieve their goals.
For over three decades, the EU has successfully absorbed a very diverse set of countries, as we can see from the composition of this House, for instance, including the President in the Chair in charge of this debate and the Commissioner involved.
By developing its policies and institutions, the Union has responded positively to new circumstances, such as the fall of dictatorships, the collapse of communism and the rise of economic globalisation.
Enlargement has proven to be a successful shock absorber for Europe.
Thirdly, we need better communication.
The report rightly calls for a communication strategy and, indeed, broad public support is essential for everything the Union does, including enlargement.
I rely on the political and financial support of Parliament to pursue a well-informed debate on enlargement.
To conclude, consolidation was necessary to avoid overstretching on our enlargement commitments.
But let us also keep in mind our own strategic interest: it would be utterly irresponsible to disrupt a valuable process that is helping to build stable and effective partners in the most unstable parts of Europe.
If we were to go wobbly about the western Balkansâ European perspective, our beneficial influence, our political leverage, our impact would be seriously eroded, just when the region enters a difficult period of talks on Kosovoâs status.
The EU perspective is the key to a sustainable settlement for Kosovo and to democratic development in Serbia and the rest of the region.
It is the foundation that keeps the region on a peaceful and reformist track.
Therefore, for the sake of Europe, let us not shake this foundation, ensuring that the still fragile Balkans building does not collapse at our feet, in our own front yard!
Â Â  â Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I should like to start by congratulating the rapporteur and chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Mr Brok, on his very important report and, at the same time, congratulate you, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, for the interest and the decisiveness which you demonstrate, both as the Austrian Minister of Foreign Affairs and as President-in-Office of the Council, on the question of the Balkans.
Congratulations also to the Commissioner for the Commission's global and integral communication which you have presented to us.
I should very quickly like to make the following comments:
Firstly, the central view in the Brok report on the importance of the European prospects of a number of countries, most of which are in the Balkans, is correct.
At the same time, paragraphs 5, 9 and 10 of the report, if read together, give the reference point on the basis of which the European Union now sees future enlargements.
As far as Turkey is concerned, I want to say that I support the European prospects of Turkey, but I think, as you quite rightly said, that we need to focus, initially, on the question of the Ankara Protocol.
The Protocol alone â I repeat the Protocol alone â must be ratified, not the unilateral declaration, and, of course, the question of updating the legal framework within which this country operates.
As far as Kosovo is concerned, I agree that attention should be paid during negotiations to its final status, but we also need to prepare ourselves for how the decision taken on the final status of Kosovo is to be applied.
As far as the FYROM is concerned, it now has the status of a candidate country, that is correct but, precisely because it has the status of a candidate country, it also has rights and obligations, one of which is to demonstrate a constructive attitude in dialogue with Greece, so that the final issue pending, that of the name, can be resolved.
Finally, as far as Serbia is concerned, I agree with the need and with the fact that Serbia's cooperation with the Tribunal in the Hague is its obligation, but this is one part of a set of criteria which Serbia needs to meet and I want to ask that we be careful not to 'Croatise' the case of Serbia.
On this issue, Minister, you also have a personal view.
Â Â  . Mr President, the Commission, in its document, is not mincing its words: while there will be no fresh enlargement round involving a large group of countries at the same time, it is arguing â and rightly so, I believe â that the European Union is, and indeed will be, an organisation that remains open to new members, but under certain conditions.
Whilst the addition of ten new countries in 2004 was a success, not all citizens see it that way.
An extra effort to recount this success story is therefore called for.
On behalf of the group, I can say that we support the thrust of the Brok report, and I would thank him for the interesting preparation round we have been involved in over the past few months.
The SocialÂ Democrats are emphatically in favour of the extra attention that is being devoted to the criterion of absorption capacity.
The surrounding the ratification of the Constitutional Treaty plays an important role in this.
Without internal reforms, it will be difficult to steer the accession of new Member States effectively.
As expressed in previous resolutions, we take the view that the Treaty of Nice is not a basis for new decisions on accession.
There is, however, more need for more clarity surrounding the concept of absorption capacity, as laid down in the Copenhagen criteria, and the report is right to devote attention to this aspect too.
I should like to take this opportunity to outline where the Social Democrats stand in respect of the possible accession of various countries.
As far as our easterly neighbours Ukraine and Moldova are concerned, we think that now is not the right time to discuss their accession.
Instead, we should invest in practical cooperation.
We have concluded action plans with those countries, and we should try to bring them to a successful end.
With regard to the Balkans, we back the Councilâs position.
In principle, the western Balkan countries hold out the prospect of membership, although they will join at different times.
As for Turkey, as far as we are concerned, we will continue on the chosen path.
We are on the eve of starting a process that will last many years, and it is extremely important that we hold firm to the pledge, but also to the conditions, that we prescribed in this connection.
While I am on the subject of the Balkans, I should like to add that, whilst it goes without saying that the Copenhagen criteria remain of vital importance to us, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament continues to set great store by cooperation with the Yugoslavia tribunal as a criterion.
I also think â and there has been much talk about it â that regional cooperation can make a significant contribution to the of those countries to the European Union.
Finally â and this may well be the most important point of the whole discussion â the report mentions the possibility of setting up a fresh multilateral framework for European countries that have not yet joined the European Union.
For some countries, that could be an alternative to membership, while for others, this could be an intermediate step towards it.
For Ukraine and Moldova, for example, a structure of that kind could be a sound follow-up step, but for the countries that are already recognised as potential members, I would stress that this is an option, and not an obligation.
This is also how it is set out quite clearly in the Brok report.
It is something for which those countries can opt, should they decide that it would be useful to them to do so.
It is not an alternative to the prospect of membership.
That applies to Turkey as well as to the Balkan countries.
I want to stress that this is how we interpret paragraph 10 of the draft resolution.
It is in that way, and no other, that we in the Committee on Foreign Affairs have reached agreement with the rapporteur.
Â Â  MrÂ President, enlargement is the EUâs greatest success in terms of European cooperation.
The unification of East and West in May 2004 marked the end of the division of Europe and showed what power there is in the dream of a unified Europe based on democracy, free trade and respect for the rule of law.
EU membership was the spur that helped the powerful forces for reform in the former Communist dictatorships.
The prospects of EU membership are also hugely important to the negotiations and reforms in Turkey and the Balkan states.
In these regions, the EU has incredible reserves of what is known as soft power and which contributes to a more stable and more democratic Europe.
We in my group believe that it is important, as the Treaty says, for us to keep the door to continued enlargement open.
Naturally, the criteria must be applied, and the EUâs capacity to receive new countries is an important consideration.
We need, however, to change internally and to engage in the debate about enlargement without putting the blame on it.
I am aware of the fact that there is an ongoing debate in many countries and concern about the rapid pace of EU enlargement and about the way in which things might develop.
That conversation must be conducted respectfully and straightforwardly, but we must also dare to stand up for the advantages of enlargement and to call attention to these.
In that context, the debate about economic protectionism is extremely worrying.
We have a responsibility for neighbouring countries.
Our promises to the Balkan states and to Turkey must be kept.
It is they that set the pace, and we do what we can to speed things up.
We must also keep the door open for other countries such as Ukraine and perhaps also, one day, Belarus, even though the situation there now is incredibly troubled.
The hope of EU membership is what keeps the opposition and the forces of democracy alive there.
That is why we are opposed to defining Europeâs geographical borders.
This Parliament has given impetus to enlargement, and, a year ago, we stood in the Chamber in Brussels, wearing our orange scarves, and applauded President Yushchenko.
We adopted a resolution in which we talked of Ukraineâs prospects of membership.
That is an objective, and perhaps a distant one. Just as MrÂ Brok said, the Ukrainian people are poised between democracy and dictatorship.
If we establish borders for Europe, they will interpret this in terms of our slamming the door in their face.
It would be an historic mistake.
Instead of introducing new concepts such as multilateral agreements, let us â as Commissioner Rehn also said â take the opportunity to customise the neighbourhood strategy for prospective Member States and to give practical shape to it.
To now put forward new concepts which we have not properly debated and of whose implications we are unaware does not seem very productive at the moment.
Â Â  .
Mr President, in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, my group has voted in favour of the Brok report for two reasons.
We think that the concept of absorption capacity should be better defined.
It is a trendy, all-purpose concept on which everyone can hang whatever they like, and that means that the question of geographical borders will need to be answered, for we can no longer dodge that question.
We share the view that it is necessary that the EU will think about an intermediate step between full membership and neighbourhood, for the sake of those countries that have no membership perspective as yet.
I am not, therefore, talking about Turkey or the western Balkans, but rather about Ukraine, Moldova or Belarus.
I have to say that my group and I were deeply disappointed, and extremely vexed frankly, to see that in the run-up to this debate, the media twisted the words in the report, the result running counter to a number of central points.
If we read the media ahead of this debate, the ultimate conclusion is that an intermediate step should be created for countries including Turkey and the western Balkans.
It is no coincidence â for let us be quite honest about this â that this happens to be the view held by the rapporteur, and one that he never had any intention of concealing.
Mr Brok has always been opposed to opening negotiations with Turkey and has, since the rejection of the constitution, increasingly grown sceptical about the membership perspective of the western Balkans.
The rapporteur is fully entitled to his view, but that is not the view of the majority of the Committee on Foreign Affairs.
What is more, it is not what his own report states either.
It would become the rapporteur to spell out, outside of this Chamber, what is in his report, and does not mistake its contents for notions of his own.
What Parliament states in this report is that we do not want to tamper with the membership perspective of Turkey and the western Balkans and that intermediate steps would only be an option for those countries if they themselves were to decide in favour of it.
Everyone knows just as well as I do that all those western Balkan countries and Turkey do not want to go down that route; they want full membership.
Let us stop creating ambiguity in this Chamber, but, above all, also outside of it.
Â Â  . Mr President, up until recently, a swift and extensive enlargement of the European Union was suggested as a tremendous step forward, and as something meriting universal support.
It was seen as a reunification of Europe and as the victory of the West in the Cold War.
After the major enlargement of 2004, that climate changed dramatically.
Public opinion in the old Member States does not experience this enlargement as a success, particularly as a result of the increasing exploitation of the disparity between high-wage and low-wage countries.
The politicians too, are distancing themselves from it.
This change is palpable in the report on the enlargement strategy that is the topic of todayâs debate.
Attention is being drawn to the EUâs absorption capacity, to the external borders, the costs that are involved in enlargement and to administrative problems that are attributed to the absence of a European constitution.
As a result, Romania and Bulgaria are likely to be the last countries that are allowed to join in the short term.
Other European states are being referred to the neighbourhood policy.
Even for the three countries that have already been selected as candidate countries, no date of accession has been given.
Everywhere across the western Balkans, in recognised states, as well as in federal states or protectorates striving towards independence, where groups of people who speak different languages and practise different religions, and who, in the 1990s, were at daggers drawn with each other, public opinion now expects miracles of a swift accession process to the European Union.
The EU uses those expectations to demand reforms, and in that way, makes deep incursions into the administrative choices that are being made over there.
The EU does not, for the time being, want enlargement, but it does want influence outside of its borders.
That is why Bosnia and Herzegovina now have a tax system that nobody asked for, and the regional autonomy that was guaranteed in the Dayton agreement is being pushed back.
According to the propaganda posters, it is thanks to the EUâs military presence that this country is on its way to joining the European Union.
Public opinion in Montenegro and Kosovo, areas where four years ago, along with 12 Member States, the euro was introduced as legal tender, take it as read that they will soon be admitted to the EU as independent states, while the Hungarian-speaking people of Vojvodina expect protection against Slav dominance.
So far, the EUâs actions have left all these people disappointed.
Do we not have anything to offer those countries in the western Balkans other than the invitation to form a common market in the territory of the former Yugoslavia and to adapt their government and their economy to our wishes without them being able to join before 2020?
My group can muster little enthusiasm for this proposal.
We also recognise, however, that thanks to this text, it is possible to stress that the forthcoming referendum in Montenegro must be taken seriously and that the conflict about the use of the name Macedonia should be resolved quickly in sound consultation between Greece and its northern neighbour.
What is also positive is that in Kosovo, a solution must be found in the short term which accommodates the needs of both the large Albanian majority and the Serbian and Roma minorities.
Â Â  . Mr President, it is difficult to reconcile hyper-nationalism, also known as chauvinism, with EU membership, and that is of course equally true in the case of candidate countries.
Sad to say, there is one candidate country pervaded by chauvinism: that country is Turkey, which is the subject of enough controversy already.
Against this current backdrop, I have two questions I would like to put to Commissioner Rehn.
Is there any truth in the information, which I received from an expert last night, that the position of the Christian churches in Turkey has visibly deteriorated lately?
In light of this information, the assassination of the Italian priest, Andrea Santoro, on 5 February, in the port of Trabzon is not an isolated case.
An identical murder was attempted very recently in the town of Mersin and direct threats are against churches via the telephone or even in newspaper columns.
Incidentally, according to the Anglican vicar Ian Sherwood, who is active in Istanbul, the Turkish elite regards the spread of Christian literature in Turkish as intellectually unacceptable, if not potentially criminal.
How, Commissioner, can that be reconciled with freedom of religion in Turkey?
As far as I can gather, no progress whatsoever is being made with regard to this important item of the political criteria of Copenhagen.
I happened to hear last night that Trabzon is situated in what is called the valley of wolves.
âValley of the Wolvesâ is also the title of an original Turkish film production which literally oozes chauvinism and is known to be radically anti-Christian, anti-Semitic, anti-American and anti-Kurdish.
It is already a huge box-office hit in Turkey and has won euphoric acclaim from Prime Minister Erdoganâs immediate and the president of the Turkish Parliament.
I should like to ask the Commissioner whether he has taken Prime Minister Erdogan and Minister Gul to task over this Turkish chauvinism, which is completely incompatible with European values.
Â Â  . (Mr President, it is very important that the report drafted by Mr Elmar Brok has today provided us with the opportunity to speak about enlargement.
We definitely need to strengthen the Neighbourhood Policy and we need a new, more serious relationship between the Union and the countries with which it shares its borders.
Until now, the Neighbourhood Policy has not been sufficient as an instrument. This has been proved by the fact that during its implementation, the countries influenced by its scope experienced periods of crisis and destabilisation on a large scale.
New forms of cooperation as proposed in the report cannot, however, close the door to membership.
We have to be aware today that either we offer countries on our eastern borders the prospect of membership or our appeals for democracy, market economy and respect for human rights will remain empty words.
Unless they are offered at least the prospect of membership in the distant future, these countries will return to the sphere of Russian influence and all that this entails with regard to democracy and human rights.
However, in the very same report we see the development and strengthening of views on enlargement in terms of absorption capacity.
This term was never clearly defined and today is nothing more than a clever-sounding excuse, a cheap explanation for backing out of the enlargement process.
If absorption capacity is to be based on acceptance of the Constitutional Treaty, then one could have the impression that the authors of this text definitely want to close the door to everyone.
The Treaty, in the version we know today, can never resurface.
Demanding that the European Commission defines the borders of the Union is a mistake.
It will only bring embarrassing political discussions on the subject of geography and will definitely weaken the influence the Union has on the processes of democratisation, stabilisation and the strengthening of pro-western policy in neighbouring countries.
This Parliament has often been at the forefront of the integration process.
It has set far-reaching goals.
Today, this same Parliament is proving to be the most conservative and passive of bodies.
This begs the question: why?
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to draw your attention to a few imperfections and contradictions in the report on Turkey.
The report lists such a catalogue of fundamental problems that it is puzzling why people fail to draw the only logical conclusion, which is that it was a fatal mistake to start negotiations about Turkeyâs accession to the European Union in the first place.
As Mr Belder explained in detail a moment ago, there are violations of the rights of national and religious minorities.
Torture is still rife, and based on Article 301 of the criminal law among others, the free expression of opinion and freedom of the press cannot be guaranteed.
Also, Turkey blatantly fails to meet its obligations in connection with the customs union.
Cypriot ships and aircraft are still not admitted to Turkeyâs territory.
Over the past weeks, we have also noticed tension escalating between the Turkish authorities and certain Kurdish groups.
No one other than the second-in-command of Turkeyâs army is being accused of having stage-managed a bomb attack with a view to blaming the Kurds.
Some of the military see this indictment as a ploy directed by the government, which would like to destabilise the general in question on account of his attitude towards Muslim fundamentalism.
In some quarters, the possibility of a fresh military coup is even mooted, should the situation escalate any further.
It must be admitted that there seems little to look forward to, and that in a country that aspires to join the European Union in a few yearsâ time.
We should, in fact, come clean and say that it is totally absurd.
The report is right to remind us that the Copenhagen criteria include our own absorption capacity.
On that basis alone, we should reverse the decision to open negotiations with Turkey.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, speaking as chairperson of the delegation for South-Eastern Europe, let me say that I wholeheartedly endorse what Mr Brokâs report has to say about each individual country and what it demands of them.
Each of them has its own particular problems and needs to be judged on the basis of its own achievements, and so it would be highly desirable for consideration to be given to Croatiaâs accession at an early date.
To do so would send an important message of stabilisation to the entire region, since Croatia's achievements in both the political and economic spheres are in no respect inferior to those of the next two accession countries.
Now, though, that we are coming to the close of the debate, I want to address an idea â one that is concealed in the Brok report, but more prominent in the public media.
I refer to the allusions to changes in the enlargement strategy.
The question is asked as to where the borders of the EU are, but nobody is answering it.
Commissioner Rehn himself said earlier on that this is a question that has to be answered, and it is precisely this that has the public worried.
My personal view is that the accessions of Bulgaria, Romania and the countries of the Western Balkans will mean that the EU will have reached its limits.
For all the other countries, we have devised the new instrument of the Neighbourhood Policy and must get to grips with it.
The rushed negotiations with Turkey have done what remained to be done to make our citizens insecure and disoriented.
For ten years we have been saying that there must be no enlargement without institutional reform of the EU, but the Council did not begin to do justice to that until after the last enlargement, and for that we were all punished by the results of the referendums in France and the Netherlands.
But it would be fatal if we were, on that basis, to draw the conclusion that no further accessions must be allowed.
We must waste no time in laying hold of the necessary instruments, for which, of course, the Constitutional Treaty makes provision, and use them to restore our capacity to welcome new members.
If we do not want to jeopardise what has been up to now our great commitment to the Balkans, we must remain consistent and purposeful in continuing to bring these countries closer to the EU.
I very much welcome what both Commissioner Rehn and Mrs Plassnik have had to say on this subject.
All these states were rightly promised accession to the EU subject to their fulfilling the criteria.
That was and remains an important motor for change in the aftermath of the terrible conflicts in the former Yugoslavia and of Ever Hoxhaâs dictatorship in Albania.
It is apparent to any rational person who even casts a glance at a map that this region is in the middle of the EU.
If it enjoys stability, then so do we.
The 1990s saw us all experiencing and suffering the opposite of that, but I do fear â and I can tell the President-in-Office of the Council that the vagueness and imprecision of what was said in Salzburg gives me reason to â that certain Europeans are intent on leaving the South-East European states in the lurch a second time, and that is what we cannot allow to happen.
Â Â  â Mr President, I welcome the change of perspective that is set out in Mr Brokâs report.
Our debates can no longer be about our preference for one country rather than another; instead, we must, at last, face up to the question as to what sort of political system the European Union can actually afford if it is to become better able to take decisions and act on them.
That is the fundamental issue on which all others depend.
It is for that reason that our next step must be to clarify terms that have not as yet been defined.
The Copenhagen criteria make reference to the concept of âassimilation capacityâ, while not, however, defining it.
As I see it, it must involve at least the political and institutional arrangements set out in the Constitutional Treaty.
While I have listened attentively to what the Commissioner has said, he can correct me if I am wrong, but I have not heard him say anything about this.
Inherent in the decision as to what is a criterion of capacity to assimilate is the potential source of dissent between us and the Commission.
Among the important criteria are that the European Union should be funded in such a way as to have a viable future and its being accepted by the people who live in it.
If we are to talk in terms of credibility, that credibility, and the criteria that can properly be applied to capacity to assimilate, require that it should not be possible for another country to accede for the foreseeable future once Bulgaria and Romania have done so.
Credibility is about more than a promise to accept people at some unspecified time; it is also about specifying the conditions under which they can be accepted at all, and that means that we have to be more precise about such concepts as âenlargement perspectiveâ or âprospect of accessionâ.
We have to be very clear in our own minds that the belief that a countryâs accession will resolve tensions and internal security problems is an erroneous one.
Such tensions and problems must be resolved before accession negotiations start.
Â Â  Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Brok report asks pertinent questions and provides answers, even though I do not agree with all of them.
It also reflects the doubt felt by many in respect of further enlargement.
That is why such great store is set by absorption capacity, which, if the report were to be approved without any amendments, would even be given a geographical dimension.
I share the view of most in my group that absorption capacity does not require any prior geographical demarcation in order to be fleshed out, since the Unionâs demarcation will in the first instance be political â not that that will be easy, either.
What matters most is that the EU should deliver on its promise of enlargement, certainly also with regard to the countries of the Western Balkans.
Whilst the countries in question are still years removed from possible membership, the time has come to set down some firm agreements on this matter and even to put forward a time schedule.
Needless to say, all the criteria, particularly the political ones, need to be met.
From what I gather, that is exactly what the President-in-Office of the Council said in her response.
I take the view that vagueness about eventual membership and a fleshing out of the criteria will only delay the process, because this vagueness would be used as an excuse, from which nobody stands to benefit.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report calls for the geographical boundaries of the European Union to be determined and its nature defined.
Not only some Christian Democrats, but also some Social Democrats, are casting around for alternatives to membership of the European Union.
I would like to remind the House that, a few years ago, political scientists and analysts could not imagine that the day would come when the Iron Curtain would no longer be there.
But it has gone now, and in that we can rejoice.
I appeal to the House to be cautious in predicting what the European Union will be like in twenty, thirty, or forty yearsâ time, when most of us will have long ceased from active involvement in politics.
I believe that would become us well in view of the way in which most of us were wrong about what was going to happen in 1989.
The other thing I would like to say is that everyone has been talking about the need for the Ankara protocol to be implemented, and they are right to do so, but what also has to be said is that Turkey and Northern Cyprus are also in favour of a solution, and we have given undertakings.
The old ââ maxim applies, and what that means is that the isolation of the northern part of the island, must, as the European Union has promised, be brought to an end.
What I have to say to Mr Brok is that I wish Helmut Kohl were not consigned to the history books, but might also, from time to time, again play a part in shaping the CDUâs policy on Europe.
Â Â  â Mr President, my political group will not be voting in favour of the Brok report, mainly for the following reasons:
The report, especially point 10 with its deliberate obscurity, formulates a dual strategy.
It leaves the back door wide open for accession prospects to turn into a formula for a special relationship, about which the German Christian Democrats are passionate.
The point on Kosovo, with its hazy wording, reflects the doublespeak within the Union and the trend towards gradual disengagement from the clear requirements of UN resolution 1244.
My political group emphasises the demand for Turkey to implement the preconditions set with a specific timetable, starting with the faithful application, without infringements, of the Ankara Protocol.
Finally, my political group supports, among other things, Amendment 19 on a mutually acceptable resolution of the problem with the name of the FYROM and the revised Amendment 4 on Cyprus.
Â Â  â Mr President, the first question we need to debate is, where does Europe end?
We no longer know where Europe is: we have reached Diabakir and, if tomorrow the Americans tell us that Iraq needs to join Europe for reasons of equilibrium, shall we reach the Indian Ocean?
That is the question.
Who decides who will join Europe?
Until recently we said no to Croatia.
The prosecutor, Mrs Carla del Ponte, said no, Austria put on the pressure and Croatia is in.
Is this the political will of Europe?
Of course, it is not very smart to have to tell our friends the Turks that they must not insult the President of the European Parliament.
It is not very smart for us to take them EUR 139Â million in the occupied areas and for them to pelt the members of the European Parliament with eggs and stones.
They need to change their attitude, not just one article in their constitution.
They cannot have this special treatment.
They cannot threaten a state of Europe with war, with a , while we talk about letting them in.
Can they not recognise a government which has been recognised by the other 24?
These are not logical formulations.
That brings me to the FYROM which, of course, is claiming a name.
May I remind you that, when you applied to join the UN as the Germanic Republic of Austria, Germany â at that time vanquished Germany â vetoed it and you entered as Austria?
May I remind you that the Bretons did not allow Great Britain to enter because they had Brittany and they joined as the United Kingdom?
So why should you not support us, when we have a 3Â 000-year history with Macedonia?
Why do you not call a spade a spade?
Why do we not have, at long last, an independent policy and have to follow the Americans' game of upsetting Russia and taking their satellites and opening up a front with Iran and so on?
When at long last will Europe â and this is the question â decide that it is not the Americans' baby?
We do not need prefects in order to develop our own initiatives.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, the enlargement of the European Union to date has without a doubt been a successful formula, since it has fostered reforms in many states by extending the area of peace, stability and the rule of law in Europe.
Further enlargement of the European Union is necessary, but we will have to find new mechanisms and ways which will lead the European Union out of the impasse of its current capacity to absorb new states.
Certainly, by defining precise criteria the European Commission must develop this concept of absorption capacity.
In addition to the possibility of full membership we also need to offer various forms of multilateral cooperation and partnership with countries which, at least in the short term, will not be able to join the European Union.
Here I would like to express my full agreement with what MrÂ Brok said.
This could be a way to draw in Turkey, Ukraine and the Balkans for example, and later on, other countries to the path of reform and European values.
Â Â  (Mr President, it is a myth that, without further enlargement, the Union will be strong and competitive.
Yet it is also a myth that the Union can extend its borders indefinitely, for example with Russia joining the EU.
Let us simply focus on priorities when it comes to enlargement.
The countries of South-Eastern Europe should be in line after Romania and Bulgaria, which should accede to the European Union in 2007 and not 2008.
After Croatia and Macedonia we should open another set of doors to Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Kosovo and Albania.
This is the logical direction to follow.
It is a question of strategic thinking and also of increasing security on the Old Continent.
All in all, it will be beneficial from an economic point of view, as we will spend less on enlarging the Union by the next few Balkan states than on throwing money into the bottomless Balkan pre-accession coffers.
The resolution of permanent conflicts in this part of Europe costs more than it would cost to have these states in Europe and thereby have them following the political and economic rules of play of the EU.
Let us not fear expanding the Union as a result of the accession of the next few states.
I know that this fear has become what you might call âtrendyâ.
It is particularly useful in election campaigns which are continuously taking place in various EU Member States.
If our Union is to be more effective economically and is not to fall behind in relation to America and Asia, it should progressively abolish the division of Europe into two parts: Europe A, or in other words the European Union, and Europe B, meaning all that which is not part of the Union.
History has also shown that a Union that expands is a Union that is more secure.
An invitation to accession negotiations, even without the prospect of joining the Union in the near future, is like the starterâs flag that is raised at the start of a motor race.
The drivers must have a goal to aim for; they must know where the finishing post lies.
Then they may travel far, negotiating many turns and even overcoming engine failures.
What is important, however, is to set the wheels of accession in motion.
Parliamentâs motion for a resolution rightly highlights the fact that it is precisely this impulse that supported reforms in Turkey, Croatia and the Western Balkan states.
Yes, enlargement is expensive, particularly in the short term, but it is a worthwhile investment in the long term.
Â Â  Mr President, I welcome this generally positive report by MrÂ Brok.
I welcome its boldness in recognising the fact that the western Balkans should be an integral part of the European Union in the future.
I am convinced that we have to respect our commitments; we cannot close the doors to those countries that were offered a membership perspective or to those countries that deserve such a perspective in future in the light of the EU Treaty provisions.
Let us not, however, repeat our old mistakes.
We have to be prepared for enlargement.
First and foremost we have to provide the financing.
We also have to prepare our citizens for the enlargement perspective by explaining the great benefits of it.
We have to stop making past and future enlargement a scapegoat for our internal, mostly domestic, problems and inaction.
In preparing for enlargement, we have to be rigorous, we have to adhere to conditionality, we have to be sincere with our partners.
Let us not, however, be overly dogmatic.
It is perfectly possible to open the doors to Croatia without the Constitutional Treaty.
It is enough to introduce the necessary adjustments in the Accession Treaty.
Croatia should not be a victim or hostage of our problems with the Constitutional Treaty.
I welcome the reportâs innovativeness and courage.
We could discuss the idea of intermediate steps towards reaching accession provided they were not permanent â intermediate steps, yes, but not as a substitute for membership.
Various considerations should not be used as an alibi for inaction or for closing the doors to countries that will one day merit membership, such as Ukraine.
The Unionâs borders are already defined by the EU Treaty, which provides that âany European state which respects the principles ...â, etc.
Finally, let me repeat: enlargement is one of the most successful of the Unionâs policies and therefore we should make good use of its potential to build a strong, secure and influential Union, faithful to its values of solidarity, democracy and openness.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to highlight the particular responsibility the European Union has for creating a community of countries, nations and citizens on the European continent that is based on peace, liberal democracy, human rights, market economy and the rule of law.
However, today we face the question of whether the European Union is capable of further enlargement and of really opening up while also facing the problem of how to define the character of the European Union, including its geographic borders.
Absorption capacity is currently complicated by the impasse in the ratification process of the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe and by the obstacles on the path to the deeper political and strategic integration of the 25 Member States of the European Union.
At the same time, over the next few years, the institutions of the European Union have to implement enlargement strategies that are based on strictly defined terms that take into account the European Unionâs obligations towards Turkey, Croatia and all the Western Balkan states.
The European Union should also elaborate a long-term European perspective in relation to Eastern European countries, and Ukraine in particular.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when discussing enlargement, we are, in essence, discussing our understanding of the European Union.
Do we think of it as a means to an end or as a political entity in itself?
Do we want a free-trade OSCE to stabilise a problematic neighbourhood, or do we want a political union empowered to act on the basis of its own laws?
The Brok report is a good thing, in that it really does change the perspective in favour of the second option.
It is said of us politicians in general that we are incapable of giving praise, but the SPDâs Mr Kuhne has just spoken on the basis of an outstanding document that the German Social Democrats have adopted, and the absolutely marvellous thing about it is that it defines where the SPD stands on enlargement.
It is indeed the case that, as regards Bulgaria and Romania, the decisions have been taken, but we have to consider the possibility of treating them separately if their performance so warrants.
It is not the means that are crucial, but the ends.
It is quite possible that negotiations with Turkey will produce an outcome other than full membership, and here comes a key sentence: âWe will no longer go along with the progressive softening-up of the accession criteria,â say the German Social Democrats, and we German Free Democrats agree with them one hundred per cent.
Assimilation capacity is also defined; here, the main problem is that the European Unionâs capacity to assimilate the new members is in part dependent on the agreement in principle of the people in the Member States.
I see that as quite crucial if we want to carry the public with us.
If we want them to remain good and faithful citizens of the European Union, we will have to take their wishes into account.
Â Â  Mr President, I very much appreciate the references in Mr Brokâs report to the need to respect fundamental rights and freedoms, notably the rights of minorities in Turkey, Croatia and the western Balkan countries.
When debating the Turkish application to join the Union, I urged the Commission not to repeat the mistakes that were made in the case of the accession of my country, Latvia, in not using this process to promote the rights of minorities.
The European Free Alliance Group has called upon the European institutions to urge the Turkish Government to improve its policy on ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities.
Unfortunately, we do not see any progress here and, in particular, innocent citizens are still being killed in Kurdistan.
Two weeks ago the parents of Derwich Ferho, the prominent human rights defender and President of the Kurdish Institute based in Brussels, were killed.
Indications suggest that Turkish special forces were involved.
I am for further enlargement, but I am for enlargement based strictly on the Copenhagen criteria.
Â Â  â Mr President, as far as paragraph 29 of the report is concerned, the Council decision to block financial aid to the Turkish Cypriots was a development in the right direction and for that I should like to thank the minister.
As far as the question of trade is concerned, it can still be addressed within the framework of the recent agreement on discussions of a package of confidence-building measures.
In their joint statement after their meeting in Paris, the UN Secretary General and President Papadopoulos stated, among other things, that it would be beneficial for all concerned and would greatly improve the atmosphere for further talks if progress could be achieved on further disengagement of forces and demilitarisation on the Island, on the complete de-mining of Cyprus and on the issue of Famagusta.
In particular, progress on the issue of Famagusta might also result in progress on the question of trade.
We are all aware of the relevant proposal by the government of Cyprus, whereby the return of Famagusta to its legal residents and the re-opening of the port of Famagusta could resolve the question of trade from and to the occupied areas.
Unfortunately, however, Turkey and the Turkish-Cypriot leadership have not yet taken a position on this specific issue.
Â Â  Mr President, first our misguided rapporteur welcomes the fact that the Commission strategy paper âadvocates an outward-looking Unionâ.
He does not really mean an outward-looking Union; what he means is an expansive Union and not, apparently, a period of reflection following the Dutch and the French referendums â not at all!
They were saying ânoâ, particularly to Turkey.
All we are getting here is more centralisation at the same time as more expansion to make an unworkable whole, and this in the very week that Germany has been told to get its economic house in order!
Far from sending shiploads of money to Eastern Europe, they would do better to make sure that the prosperity of Europe as a whole is not compromised.
It is fashionable at this time to pretend there is a long queue of countries wanting to join this place.
The fact is that the Balkan countries have just left one bossy, bureaucratic, corrupt organisation called Yugoslavia, and do not wish to join an organisation with similar characteristics merely for the benefit of their health.
The truth is that they want money.
They want yet more money.
What they should not be doing in the Balkan countries is trading their sovereignty as though it was a commodity, for that way lies great disappointment.
I fear a great deal of disappointment lies ahead for them.
Â Â  â Mr President, members of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, in particular those from Germany and Austria, congratulations!
Rather than doing as you used to do, and using populism as a club â the term is your own â with which to beat your former party leaders or leading candidates, you have now hit yourselves over the head with it.
People are waking up to what the voters are saying, waking up to the real economic figures, and, it is to be hoped, coming to some sort of insight.
The debates that your group has been having for years on end have now brought forth a document with which we can actually do something.
Well done, Mr Kuhne!
Change of perspective, prospects for accession, capacity to assimilate â that is precisely what it is all about.
There is cause for hope there, for what you are arguing for is capable of gaining majority support not only among your own voters, but right across Europe too.
With a proper perspective, things can move forward, but they certainly cannot if we carry on beating about the bush in the way we have been.
Â Â  Mr President, enlargements have been beneficial to the European Union; not only the people of the newly admitted countries, but also, certainly, those in the others too, have done well out of them.
The predominant feeling in my country during the referendum was one of fear of being inundated by Polish plumbers.
Reality is different: since the most recent enlargement by those countries, the Netherlands has earned EUR 2Â billion annually.
It is precisely those people who have always advocated this enlargement that have to communicate this very information on enlargement, while at the same time keeping an eye on the balance between enlarging and deepening, for this balance is lopsided at present.
The Treaty of Nice was not really good enough for 25, and it will certainly not be enough when another two countries, namely Romania and Bulgaria, join us shortly.
I think it would be good for us to commit ourselves to putting our own house in order first with a new treaty before we accept two more countries.
We should commit to this off our own bat.
Secondly, I think it important that countries on the edge should not wait for the European Union to finish its homework before they can start the deepening process with a kind of partnership.
If they wish to become true members, and Europe appears to be able to cope, moving closer towards membership could then be the next step for them.
This report does not in any way detract from the rights of candidate countries that have this status at the moment, and I should like to make this quite clear.
This credibility, however, must also go hand in hand with us attaching credibility to the criteria.
This means, and MrsÂ Plassnik is right in saying, that Turkey must monitor the free expression of opinion, not only for the sake of this one author, but also for others, that freedom of religion must be guaranteed and also that we make progress where Cyprus is concerned.
We welcome the Age Package Deal, but it would be brilliant â and I hope the Commissioner is taking note of this â if Turkey could be persuaded to ratify and implement the protocol.
How do you intend to achieve this clarity, Commissioner?
For once that is done, much progress will also be made in relation to Cyprus itself.
From that point of view, I am completely behind Amendment 4, in which we in this House spell out once again that we want to do our duty for the sake of the people in the south, but certainly also for those in the north of the island.
Â Â  Mr President, enlargement is Europeâs greatest success story which has and will spread stability, security, prosperity and democracy across our continent.
However, when majority opinion in seven Member States, including my own, opposes future enlargement, it is time to make the case to the public and confront those who seek to block progress; to reject those who even in this resolution seek to use language like âoperational possibilitiesâ or âredrawing bordersâ to undermine Europeâs existing commitments; to confront those like the British Conservatives who say that Europe has to choose between widening and deepening â we do not; to confront the far right who deliberately stoke fears that new migration threatens peopleâs jobs and livelihoods, when the evidence is just the opposite; to expose those who, even in this resolution again, welcome progress in Croatia, but not the very same progress in Turkey; to recognise that majority Muslim populations in Macedonia, Bosnia and Albania share a European destiny too; and to underline that a pause for reflection on the Constitutional Treaty cannot be an excuse to put a full stop on new enlargement.
Â Â  â Mr President, regional integration in the West Balkans is a crucial element in the enlargement strategy of the Commission.
This endeavour is right, because it encourages cooperation and taking responsibility, and it also brings economic advantages.
It is not right, however, to force an economic or political unity that is not wanted by those affected, or is not viable in itself.
It would be much more effective to enlarge the already existing CEFTA, as proposed by the Croatian Government, because it has already proved to be a successful and good cooperation, and this is where the Balkan States should be included.
The true guarantee of stability in the West Balkans is the authentic promise of European integration.
In this respect, it is extremely worrying that on the basis of the proposal of the Council, affected countries will not receive adequate financial support in the future, and they will have less support next year and in the following years than they have had so far.
And this casts doubts on the credibility of the entire accession process.
Therefore, we want to see a considerable increase in available funds.
Thirdly: when assessing each country, we must consider their individual achievements, and en bloc or collective assessments of any kind cannot be accepted, because these countries must show their maturity individually.
Croatia has done a great deal in order to become a Member State of the European Union as soon as possible.
We must recognise these efforts, because Croatia deserves to conclude the negotiations successfully, as soon as possible.
Â Â  â First of all, I would like to thank Mr Brok for his very constructive and logical report.
I am sure that if the European Union was able to formulate its position on all matters in this way, it would certainly be better supported and understood by its citizens.
I would like to speak about the section of the report which talks about Turkey.
I entirely agree that the European Union's expansion strategy has undoubtedly encouraged democratic, political and other reforms in Turkey and the other states mentioned in the resolution.
However, it is equally important to note that, and I quote, âwhile a political transition process is still underway in Turkey, in 2005 the pace of reforms has slowed and the implementation of reforms remains unevenâ.
This is the exact reply I received yesterday from Commissioner Rehn to my verbal question on the implementation of the European Parliament's resolution on the start of negotiations with Turkey.
This is also indicated in the draft resolution we have debated today, that is, that the pace of reforms in Turkey in 2005 was not only insufficient, but it actually has slowed down.
This may be interpreted as Turkey's unpreparedness to carry out reforms which would bring it closer to the European Union, or perhaps even as an unwillingness to commit itself to the elementary obligations of possible membership.
I also share the regret expressed in Mr Brok's report and in the resolution over the unilateral declaration made by Turkey when signing the Additional Protocol to the Ankara Agreement.
I believe that it is necessary to remind Turkey that recognition of all European Union Member States is an indispensable component of the accession process.
True, what I am about to say is not in the report, but I am sure that the acts of genocide committed against the Armenian nation 90 years ago should be recognised by Turkey at the highest level, as this more than any other action would bear testimony to the fact that Turkey's position, even regarding these painful events of the past, is in tune with the spirit of the Copenhagen criteria.
Â Â  Mr President, the Brok report does not define anything concrete in respect of ethnic minorities.
The European Union often uses double or even triple standards when it requires and expects something completely different from two candidate states, while it hardly ever calls to account its own Member States in matters regarding ethnic minorities.
Following an armed insurrection, Albanians living in Macedonia were given administrative and even territorial autonomy of the widest extent, while in the case of Romania, the European Union does not press for territorial autonomy for the almost one million Hungarians living in SzÃ©kely Land.
The European Union promises independence to Kosovo, but for Vojvodina, it does not even recommend the autonomy that had been stripped away by Milosevic.
Please support the Hungarian amendment proposals aimed at the preservation of the multi-ethnic character of Vojvodina, the protection of minorities and the widening of provincial autonomy.
Commissioner Olli Rehn knows very well that there is no solution without autonomy for Swedish-speaking Finns in Finland, and there cannot be a solution in the Balkans or for the Kurds living in Turkey, either.
Â Â  â Mr President, we need to be particularly honest and accept that the enlargement strategy is not the reason for the current institutional crisis in the European Union.
However, as a strategic objective, enlargement can be the scapegoat for collective European impasses and that, in my opinion, should be avoided.
Within this framework, the message sent by the Austrian Presidency and the meeting of Ministers of Foreign Affairs in Salzburg on the final objective of the integration of the countries of the Western Balkans into the European Union is indeed especially important.
We are saying yes to the integration of the countries and no to special relationships.
From this side, the Commission should speed up the submission of its proposal for the granting of entry visas to the citizens of the Balkan countries.
The question is deeply political, not bureaucratic.
The doublespeak in the European Union on Kosovo is causing concern.
The absence of a joint EU policy will have negative consequences.
Finally, as far as Cyprus is concerned, I believe that the time has come for political initiatives to be taken to create necessary political and social osmosis at the level of civil society between the Greek Cypriots and the Turkish Cypriots.
The role of catalyst belongs to the European Union.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, rapporteur Mr Brok has done thorough work in showing the countries of the western Balkans the path to the European Union.
It is my duty as leader of the Moldova delegation, however, to remind us all of the fact that there are two countries even closer to the heart of Europe which need the promise of European Union membership just as much as the Balkan countries and Turkey.
The European Parliament has clearly expressed its support for the aspirations of Ukraine and Moldova to become candidates for membership of the European Union.
Moldova has been making a huge effort for two years.
Ukraine has also recently shown that it wishes to become a European country.
I sensed that very clearly when I visited Ukraine last week.
I am disappointed, however, with the excessive emphasis placed on the fourth Copenhagen criterion in the report.
At the same time, I agree with Elmar Brok that the European Commission should define the nature of accession capacity as soon as possible.
This should not be a vague excuse for rejecting countries wishing to accede to the European Union.
Since the Thessaloniki Summit in 2003, our union has been reformed.
This is the success story of those countries that fulfilled the Copenhagen criteria.
Potential candidate countries must in future also be evaluated on the basis of transparent criteria.
Expansion must continue, because Europe needs stability in the same way it needs air.
Â Â  . Mr President, I am grateful for this exciting and certainly tense debate, which the Council, too, will regard as important.
Ladies and gentlemen, I am from a country that, according to all the figures and data available, benefited very considerably from the last enlargement, yet, even so, the popular view of both the European Union itself and its enlargement is a very critical one, so let me make a few personal observations on the subject.

There will be no Europe without frontiers; yet Europe was always a political project.
That is why neither geographers nor historians nor rulers will be any use to us in the political decisions that we have to take; what will decide the issues will be the common will of those who share in this community of values and laws, namely us and â as is the norm in democracies â the people themselves.
Where, then, do we stand now?
Looked at objectively, 3 October last year saw the taking of political decisions with far-reaching implications; what is ahead of us now â âusâ being the Council and the Commission with our partners around the world â is a period of quietly working on the issues.
Let me just make three more comments on the geographical issues in the Balkans: what is this, in essence, all about?
What are we working on?
I believe we are working on Europe as a peace project, on its reunification, on the overcoming of the East/West divide, on doing away with the division created by Communism.
It is intolerable that the Balkans should end up in some European no man's land; we must again spell out where we see the added value for ourselves, for our own people, and for the peoples of the Balkans an added value made up of the rule of law, of security and of economic opportunity.
If I may turn to Turkey, to which many Members made reference, in the currently ongoing process, the Commission and the Council are addressing not only the progress Turkey has made with its reform process, but also, and quite specifically and directly, what remains to be done in such areas as religious freedom and the free expression of opinion.
We did this in our troika meeting.
Let me say something about Ukraine.
Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner and I were recently on a troika mission in Ukraine together, and I can give you the same message that I gave there: it is that Europe, the European Union, would like to see a stable, self-confident and successful Ukraine, but, above all, a Ukraine that faces up to the task of transformation and tackles it with determination.
The European Neighbourhood Policy and the action plan that is about to be reviewed for the first time during the Austrian Presidency provide us with a good and appropriate array of instruments.
There is also considerable potential for such things as a deeper agreement that might well include a broad-based free trade agreement.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to begin by imparting to you some breaking news: the decisions of late 2005 have created a solid political framework for our enlargement policy for 2006 to 2010, and in some cases even further.
For instance, the accession negotiations with Turkey are likely to take 10 to 15 years.
I do not expect anyone seriously to question our existing commitments in South-East Europe because it is really a matter of our own security and stability that we can enhance peace, democracy and increase prosperity in that very sensitive area.
We now have a consolidated and sufficiently demanding enlargement agenda.
The enlargement train is no bullet train, no TGV, no Eurostar; it is a normal train or, in some cases, even a local train, but, most importantly, this train is moving, it is in the process and is thereby transforming the countries that are in the immediate neighbourhood of the European Union.
Concerning the borders of Europe, the Commission works on the basis of Article 49 of the Treaty on European Union, which states that any European country that respects and applies the European values of democracy, human rights, the rule of law and fundamental freedoms may apply for membership of the Union.
That does not mean that every European country must apply or that the EU must accept every country, but at the same time it means that it is not sensible to close the door forever by drawing a line across the map to define Europe once and for all, which would seriously damage our possibilities of having a beneficial influence and strategic leverage in our immediate neighbourhood.
Meanwhile, although no final borders of the Union have yet been determined, the EU is developing other forms of partnership and cooperation with our neighbouring countries, for instance in the form of the European Neighbourhood Policy, which can be further developed and upgraded.
A few comments and points have been made concerning absorption capacity.
I would like to give a very brief historical overview.
That concept was first explicitly mentioned in Copenhagen in 1993 when the European Council stated that the Unionâs capacity to absorb new members, while maintaining the momentum of European integration, is also an important consideration in the general interests of both the Union and the candidate countries.
That concept and its consequences have been examined regularly by the Commission.
In its Agenda 2000 â and I am happy to refer to that because I was a member of the Steering Group for Agenda 2000, which was adopted in 1997 â the Commission examined the impact of the accession of central and eastern European countries from two angles: its impact on EU policies such as agriculture or regional policy, and its budgetary consequences.
As a result, this work led to the setting of critical parameters in the negotiations that followed, in the decisions of March 1999 at the Berlin Summit and in 2003, when the countries of eastern and central Europe were allowed to join the European Union.
This facilitated the accession of EU-10 and, by those means, we successfully combined our historic mission of reunifying the European continent and taking care of the practical considerations, which are also of concern to our citizens today.
Later on, we examined that concept during the accession negotiations, in some chapters in particular, such as that on the free movement of persons and the financial chapters, and more recently the Commission also examined that concept in our 2004 Issues Paper on questions arising from the Turkish accession perspective.
I would recommend this paper of October 2004 to all Members of the European Parliament.
It is still worth reading and outlines very well the broad consequences of possible Turkish accession to the Union if, one day, Turkey meets all the conditions for accession.
Thus, the upsurge in capacity is an important concept, and it has also been referred to in the negotiating frameworks for Turkey and Croatia.
I can assure you that we bear this in mind throughout the negotiations, and it is also a leading concept in our strategy document of last November.
We base our work on that concept and it is a very important consideration.
Finally, referring to what Mr Eurlings said about deepening and widening, I belong to the camp that thinks that the deepening of political integration is indispensable in order to make the European Union more effective and democratic.
We must make the Union function better, and that was and is the purpose of the Constitutional Treaty.
Therefore, we need a constitutional debate and, in time â sooner rather than later â we need to decide on how we reform our structures so that they are more effective and democratic and so that the European Union can have more clout in external relations, in Common Foreign and Security Policy and in preserving the security of its own citizens against international crime and terrorism.
That must be done in the near future, not in the distant future â not in 10 to 15 years, for instance, when Turkey might be able to join â for the sake of Europe, and we need it already for the European Union of 25 or 27 Member States.
Therefore, rather than talk about absorption capacity, I would prefer to talk about the functioning capacity of the current European Union to ensure that we serve our citizens better in terms of both policies and institutions.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday, at 12Â noon.
Â Â  â Mr Brokâs report is comprehensive and complete in terms of the current state of enlargement, and takes account of countries that are undoubtedly making genuine efforts to meet the political and economic goals requested for accession to the European Union.
In particular, we agree with the invitation to Croatia to âresolve on-going bilateral issues, particularly [âŠ] property related onesâ, but regret to note that no reference is made to problems concerning changes to that countryâs law in relation to access to the property market by Community citizens, specifically Italians and exiles from Giulia and Dalmatia.
No EU citizen can be prevented from taking up residence in a Member State and having access to the property market.
To justify the ban by application of the principle of reciprocity is not sufficient to show that Croatia meets all the requirements to be eligible to join the EU in the future.
Mindful of its failure to comply with a principle of freedom now accepted by all Member States, and although we are voting in favour of the report, we would request that Croatia be requested to remedy this serious breach which, if it continued, would make it impossible for us to support its accession.
Â Â  The next item is the Council and Commission statements on mergers in the internal market.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, this is a debate that will naturally be dominated largely by the Commissionerâs speech.
I can imagine that the Members present will be particularly interested in hearing what the Commission has to say.
I shall therefore confine myself to just a few remarks on behalf of the Council, as we are convinced that, in applying the new provisions and the EU competition rules, the Commission is showing great responsibility towards achieving the objectives of competition policy in line with the Lisbon Strategy.
The sector studies that the Commission is already preparing and wishes to carry out in further depth form a crucial basis for this, and the issue of market definition is also significant in this regard.
It is important to bear in mind that the medium- and long-term aspects should also be taken into consideration when making decisions on mergers.
The economy is not static but dynamic, and so enterprises are faced with the daily challenge of arming themselves for the future and remaining competitive.
There are more than 23Â million enterprises in the EU as a whole; every day sees the establishment of new enterprises and the closure of others.
Following on from the debate that we held this morning, it should be pointed out once more that 99% of enterprises are small and medium-sized enterprises, which between them account for 80% of employment.
Competitiveness also has a considerable impact on the labour market, therefore, and presupposes effective competition.
There must be no distortion of competition in the internal market: that is one of the essential bases for the success of the European economy.
Completion of the internal market and of economic and monetary union, EU enlargement, and the reduction of the barriers to international trade and to investment will lead to even greater reorganisation of enterprises, including in the form of concentrations.
Reorganisation such as this is welcome in so far as it meets the requirements of dynamic competition and is likely to increase the competitiveness of European industry by improving conditions for economic growth and by raising the standard of living in the Community.
This is perfectly in line with the Lisbon objectives that have been discussed today.
The present issue is currently being discussed in the light of the current examples of concentrations in the energy field, in particular.
Particularly important to the public and consumers in this regard are trends in prices, which are negatively influenced by a lack of competition, and considerations of job preservation.
Consumers can easily imagine that the only way of preventing unjustified price increases is through sufficient competition.
It also holds true, however, that jobs can only be safeguarded in the long term if enterprises are competitive.
In this connection, we should actively pursue a pan-European competition policy in the context of the four fundamental freedoms.
Another important task of competition policy is ensuring that instances of reorganisation and concentration cannot result in permanent damage to competition.
That is why, as you know, Community law comprises provisions regarding concentrations that could distort competition either throughout or in a large part of the common market.
To reiterate: we are convinced that the Commission will take the right action and proceed responsibly.
The rule of law and thus the predictability of decisions is also particularly essential to the success of Europe as a business location.
To this end, the work on the more economic-based approach will have to be carried out in even greater depth.
If, following an evaluation phase, it becomes clear that the legal framework for mergers needs to be supplemented in this regard, the Council will address this issue, too.
It is also clear that it is not possible to cast all eventualities in regulatory frameworks; instead, a certain level of abstraction is necessary.
The Council Presidency also assumes that, when making its now-imminent decisions, the Commission will exercise its judgment on such issues as market definition and the determination of efficiency with the utmost care.
Â Â  . Mr President, Europe thrives on breaking down barriers between Member States, not on erecting them.
Open and competitive markets are key drivers for growth and jobs in Europe.
Companies that are successful players in the European market are also well placed to compete globally.
The Commission will always look with concern at any attempt by national governments, directly or indirectly, to interfere unduly in the process of cross-border corporate restructuring in Europe.
The Treaty enshrines the principle that there should be no unjustified impediment to the fundamental freedoms it establishes â in particular the free movement of capital â or to the right of establishment within it.
Fundamental to these rights is the freedom for companies to re-structure, including by change of ownership.
To deny this possibility to companies as a matter of principle or by failing to implement correctly the provisions of the EC sectoral legislation introducing competition in the markets â such as energy, telecoms and financial services â would amount to a serious restriction of their ability to adapt to the challenges presented by the integration of markets in the EU, to the rapid advances in technology which many industries are experiencing, and generally to the evolving dynamics of doing business in the Europe of today.
European industry is rising to these challenges, including by the appearance of an increasing number of cross-border European businesses.
Whilst the effects of individual mergers must be assessed on a case-by-case basis in accordance with the relevant competition rules, mergers between companies based in different Member States are likely to increase competition in the Member State concerned, thereby contributing to the realisation of concrete benefits for European consumers in the form of lower prices and wider choice.
Take the energy sector as an example.
The Green Paper published by the Commission last week was very clear.
Sustainable, competitive and secure energy will not be achieved without open and competitive energy markets, based on competition between companies looking to become Europe-wide competitors rather than dominant national players.
Open markets will strengthen Europe and allow it to tackle its problems.
At the same time, the process of cross-border corporate restructuring enhances the competitiveness of European businesses by equipping it to succeed in global markets.
Any interference in this process by national governments which is not justified by legitimate interest as provided for in the Treaties, secondary legislation or jurisprudence, risks being seriously damaging to Europeâs prospects of benefiting from the opportunities presented by market integration and globalisation.
The Commission, as you know, has two principal legal instruments at its disposal â the single market rules in the EC Treaty and Article 21Â of the EC Merger Regulation â for addressing undue interference by national authorities in relation to corporate restructuring.
It has the duty to enforce these rules accordingly wherever appropriate.
As guardian of the EC Treaty, and as the institution responsible for merger control on competition grounds at the European level, the Commission is determined to guarantee that companies can effectively benefit from the advantages of the EUâs internal market.
That is why enforcement of these provisions is, and will remain, one of the Commissionâs central priorities.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the internal market is being tested; in the field of energy, in particular, it could even be said to be at risk.
The promotion of national champions results in national monopolies, which means that there is no competition, and this also means that there is no more competition in the European internal market.
This scenario is bad for consumers.
European energy enterprises face the additional problem that, if they are not competing in Europe, they will also no longer be internationally competitive in future.
That, too, aggravates the situation in Europe.
Incidentally, it also aggravates the situation for all other enterprises, as they have to pay the high energy prices and thus also lose out in terms of international competitiveness.
Although I explicitly support the efforts of the Commission and, in particular, the Commissioner on this issue, I believe that the Commissionâs options are simply limited.
The Commission is trying to present instruments of competition law, but the famous two-thirds rule in mergers law almost always applies in the field of energy, in particular â and, as a result, the Commissionâs scope for intervention is minimal.
I am aware that Commissioner Kroes is considering changing this, but to do so would require unanimity within the Council, and I do not believe that such unanimity will be possible in the present situation.
That is why it is vital that the Council, too, concern itself with this problem.
Governments can be expected to abide by the spirit as well as the letter of the Treaties and of European law.
Ultimately, the fact is that we want to see an internal market in the field of energy enterprises, in particular.
That is why I expect the Council to become involved with this issue.
I should like to make one comment on takeovers law: newspaper reports in the past few days have alleged that European takeovers law is promoting this development.
I consider that inappropriate.
Member States can be expected to transpose takeovers law, but this is a case of relations between enterprises; it has nothing to do with the exertion of political influence.
The exertion of political influence is not covered by decisions under takeovers law at European level, and should be avoided and prevented.
It is vital that this issue be put openly on the table in the Council and that an appeal be made to all those responsible within the Council.
Â Â  . Mr President, imagine that next weekend President Barroso called a press conference to announce the merger of Euronet, Deutsche BÃ¶rse and the London Stock Exchange.
A dream scenario or a nightmare?
I tend to say neither, but simply note that it is rather improbable that would happen.
The message of my group, nevertheless, is that President Barroso, the Commissioner and their colleagues should not be caught napping in the situation we now find ourselves in, with the mergers, acquisitions and developments we see in the financial markets, energy and other sectors â sectors that are all very important for the European economy.
We Social Democrats still believe that the state has a role to play in the economy as a facilitator, as a regulator and as a defender of the public interest.
I do not say that we politicians should take the leading role and be the stars at press conferences, but we should play a role in silent diplomacy and in creating the conditions in a dialogue with companies; we should not only commence with what has happened but also anticipate what will happen.
That is why I do not like your approach, Commissioner, which is only negative and seeks to prevent authorities from interfering in what is happening with companies.
I think there should be a proactive approach and I shall mention three questions on which we should have a thorough debate in Europe.
The first is industrial policy.
I was very happy with some of Commissioner Verheugenâs remarks this morning, which were made more from the perspective of industrial policy.
The second â which was also mentioned by Mr Lehne â concerns what is happening in takeovers and the way we organise this.
We need a debate there, not only on shareholder democracy, which the and are preaching, but on other aspects too.
The third is the European approach versus the national approach.
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are really facing a situation of great importance for Europe: the Member States are still attached to the perception of a national dimension still viewed as predominant in all circumstances, while we are forgetting that a change of dimension has occurred and that we must move consciously towards a continental dimension, aware that we are moving in that direction and also knowing how to manage it.
That is why I fail to understand the problems being raised, for instance, in relation to bank mergers in Poland; in Italy, we accepted a takeover offor precisely that reason.
I detect a conflict of interest behind these problems, because very often these are companies that are wholly-owned, or at least majority-owned by the State.
It is a conflict of interest between the immediate political interest and the long-term interest, not only of consumers, but also of the overall efficiency of the European system.
This also happened in the case of and , where a serious conflict of interest emerged between the need to rationalise our companies in order to equip them to compete on a global level and the need to avoid them being embarrassed in the very short term.
I also ask that the competitive framework be organised; this is something we also discussed this morning with Commissioner Kroes, whom I thank for her readiness to act on energy competition.
We need to create electricity networks, gas and electricity on a completely European level.
This is our mission and I urge quick action to achieve it.
Â Â  . Mr President, I fully understand the anger of Italy and Spain at what I would call German-French energy imperialism in Europe.
It is the German and French economies that pay the highest price for it.
Austria has electricity and gas prices that are 20% lower than those in Germany because it has lower grid costs and because it has more competition in its market than the German market has.
The answer to what has happened over the past weeks, Mrs Kroes and Mr Barroso, is not European champions.
European energy champions would squeeze out even more money from our major industry and consumers, and from us as citizens, and pass it on to the shareholders.
So the only answer is to have competitive markets, which have to be enforced by strong and independent regulators, strong competition authorities and full ownership unbundling.
Â Â  . âMr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have always said that energy and Europe did not need a laissez-faire approach, but rather valid policies on which a consensus existed.
The proof of this is what is happening now: Europe is finding it extremely difficult to develop an innovative energy policy commensurate with the problems raised by the Kyoto Protocol and the needs of a new and different kind of development.
The world is experiencing tragic wars for control of oil resources, and this conflict is now moving into Europe: obviously the solution is not protectionism, but instead a fairer use of available energy and the promotion of energy savings and renewable sources.
I reiterate our firm opposition to dangerous sources such as nuclear power.
We need to introduce economic and social models that are not âenergivorousâ, and emphasise cooperation with other continents; as we can see, this is quite different from becoming involved in trade wars that have nothing to do with our future.
To reduce everything to goods and trade is a serious error.
Neither laissez-faire nor protectionism, but a diverse and shared energy policy and one of solidarity for Europe and the world â that must be our role.
Â Â  .
(Mr President, I would like to speak on the subject of the merger of two banking groups: and . It is a subject that has caused a great deal of controversy in Poland.
In 1999 acquired a majority share in , one of the largest Polish banks.
It was, as it turned out, a very profitable decision.
Seven years on, the value of the shares has increased fourfold.
When buying the Polish bank, the Italians had to agree, however, that they would not invest any capital in any company in competition with that bank in Poland.
The acquisition of and, by that token, also of another Polish bank, , is therefore a clear breach of the privatisation agreement.
The Polish authorities are therefore obliged to block this merger and to enforce the terms of the agreement.
It is worth pointing out that this dispute is by no means about the Polish Government seeking to prevent a foreign entity gaining control of a national company, as has been the case recently in France, Spain or Italy.
Accusations of protectionism levelled at the Polish Government are therefore completely unfounded in this case.
We should also remember that, while the European Commission has control over mergers at a Community level, obligations relating to agreements and the control over banks remain the competencies of national governments.
I therefore hope that the European Commission will take these arguments into consideration and that Poland will cease to be on the receiving end of a barrage of threats related to this subject.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the unification of markets is a fundamental aim of the Union, but it is also more than that: the market is one of the pillars on which the whole process of European integration was â and is â based.
A true market requires, firstly, that capital should be able to circulate freely and be invested where it earns the best return; secondly, it requires companies to have a cross-border dimension and the ability to set up wherever the interests of their competitiveness dictate, through the medium of mergers and acquisitions, which may even be hostile.
The market does not tolerate the abuse of a dominant position that prevents free competition.
An open market and one that operates smoothly is crucial for European competitiveness in international markets.
Protectionism causes the opposite effect, as we have seen in recent months; states blocking cross-border takeovers, mergers or acquisitions to protect strategic national interests.
Protectionism really serves to defend weak and inefficient companies, or to create national champions artificially.
The damage caused is significant for clients unable to obtain goods and services at the best prices, and is a serious matter for a society forced to bear the costs of uncompetitive companies.
Moreover, protectionism is inherently incapable of guaranteeing workers safe and sustainable employment prospects.
Protectionism means putting Europe into reverse.
To operate properly, the market must be efficient and avoid distortions.
Everyone must play by the rules: we cannot accept unfair competition from those States and companies that, on the one hand, protect themselves, and, on the other, exploit the virtuous openness displayed by others.
This is why we are asking the European Commission to take firm action to ensure freedom of movement for capital and unfettered competition.
We are therefore pleased to hear the comments of Mrs Kroes here in Parliament.
To have the courage to take that decision means really being a serious European: competitiveness, growth and the well being of citizens, based on an integrated market, are vital to prepare the ground for the birth of the European Constitution.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, you want the market to operate properly.
You must therefore renounce this frenzied liberalism that you are proposing to us and that clearly does not achieve its objectives.
What we need is a mergers strategy that works, certainly, but one that also comes with a well-regulated industrial policy strategy and with business strategies that respect objectives relating to the environment and social standards.
I believe that the President-in-Office of the Council was right to say that it is also necessary to include medium- and long-term objectives, which an unfettered liberalism cannot fulfil.
Furthermore, if we want the takeover bid directive to work properly, the Member Sates will have a great responsibility.
We will have to also perhaps provide for its review âÂ this is included in the textÂ - so that the power of shareholders is not that kind of blind power that, without taking account of any interest, or the State in question, or the industrial strategy in force, or the interests of the employees, could destroy companies that, over the years, have accumulated a know-how and a business strategy that could also contribute towards a European industrial policy.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, we find ourselves faced with two possible mergers.
The first, between and , is undesirable, because it creates an energy monopoly in the Belgian gas and electricity sector and further closes off the French market to competitors.
The second merger, however, between and , could give rise to a diversification of the French and Belgian energy market.
The principle of reciprocity in relations between European countries in the energy sector seems essential for a European energy market that benefits the consumer, and for a common European policy in the energy sector.
In Italy, ample space has been given to energy companies from other countries by means of privatisation and liberalisation policies.
This has also happened in other European countries.
Franceâs breach of the principle of reciprocity in this case cannot be justified by a need to guarantee an autonomous energy sector by means of national champions, but is rather an expression of an excessively nationalistic policy.
France already has its national energy champions: it does not need to create any more.
The merger between and , which controls the Belgian company , carries a serious risk of encouraging protectionist trends, not only in the energy sector, but also in other industrial, financial and service sectors.
In other cases, the European Commission has strictly applied its antitrust instruments to prevent the development of dominant positions and retaliation by international competition.
This has happened recently in the cases of , and , which now seems to have gone in favour of , a French bank.
It is to be hoped that the Commission employs a similar strictness in ensuring the free movement of capital, because even in these circumstances the principle must apply to everyone, for we cannot allow some countries in Europe to be more equal than others.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, we are holding this debate this afternoon in the context of extremely serious events in the energy markets, essentially in electricity and gas.
We are seeing takeover bids led by governments â as in Spain â or prevented by governments â as in France.
This is all the wrong way round, and is contrary to the spirit of the European Union.
We are hearing political arguments from top politicians of important European countries who have no hesitation in questioning the fundamental principles of the European Union: the free movement of capital and full competition in the markets.
These include arguments such as those we have heard over recent days from Ministers who appear to be talking about planning: the most antiquated and failed form of economic planning.
They are quite happy to talk about protectionism, about economic patriotism, about nationalism; in short, they are using the worst kinds of populist argument.
In light of this, we must commit ourselves fully to European construction, which means the free integration of markets, acknowledging that there are asymmetries in those markets.
Of course there are asymmetries!
We have hardly seen a single example of economic integration in which there have not been asymmetries.
But despite that, here we are, we have come this far, and these political positions simply add more problems and difficulties to the problems and difficulties we have already had to face.
We are talking about strategic sectors, but equally strategic are communications, transport and finance.
Faced with these nationalist temptations, we would call upon the Commission to prioritise the objective and ideal of European integration and, in the face of this populist and isolationist attitude, to dedicate itself to the objective of creating a single market.
In short, we are calling upon the Commission to do its duty as guardian of the Treaties and to promote real development and employment policies for all of the European citizens.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the process of industrial and financial concentration can strengthen the European Union on the world stage.
In certain cases and for certain phases this process can usefully occur through national channels, but all too often these are defensive and run the risk of triggering a dangerous spiral of protectionism that must absolutely be stopped.
We have to move the legal framework further and promote greater convergence of national regulations for mergers and acquisitions, otherwise the race for reciprocity clauses will swamp all these countries beneath more closed and protective legislation.
Finally, we will inevitably have oligopolistic structures in certain sectors, for example in the energy sector.
These structures must not be collusive or unfavourable to consumers, nor must public control of certain companies facilitate market abuse.
In conclusion, we need the regulatory authority to be strengthened and integrated, antitrust to be strengthened and, in the immediate term, a more active and effective attitude from the Commission.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, you know that very many eyes in Belgium are fixed on you at the moment.
The general expectation is that you will tell the newly merged French groups Suez and Gaz de France in no uncertain terms that their position on a market as small as the Belgian one is untenably monopolistic.
I know that your offices have not been officially told about the merger, but we do not believe that that means that you cannot, at this stage, send out a clear message to the effect that situations of that kind contravene European law, because the newly merged group is set to supply no less than 90% of the gas distributed in Belgium.
I hope you can confirm that a company with a market concentration of that kind will be required to surrender a substantial share of its activities.
Commissioner Kroes, you are the only guarantee the customer has, and I mean both private persons and industry, that they will not have to pay an unacceptably high price for their gas and electricity in future.
You also have the power to restore public confidence in Europe, at least to some extent.
You can do so by making it clear to those mammoth industrial groups that they are cashing in on liberalisation, that what they are doing is illegal and is in contravention of those competition rules.
You have also said that soon, you will table fresh proposals in order to put an end to the concentration of power in the energy distribution.
I would like to know if you can confirm that what you mean by that is that major producers will be required to relinquish their blocking capacity in distribution companies.
I should like to finish off, Commissioner, by saying that you can write history by asserting your influence and spelling out that the European authorities are equal to these monster mergers.
You have the reputation of being a tough cookie, and we would appreciate it if, in the next few weeks, you could give us reason to believe that that reputation is warranted.
Â Â  Mr President, I agree with the Commissionerâs view that it makes no sense to talk about national champions and continental giants and that the approach taken in competition law is to decide on a case by case basis.
The competition policy is key, but it does not resolve everything in the field of energy, and nor does the internal market policy.
To talk about energy is to talk about security and general interests.
Energy is vital and it essentially falls within the Member Statesâ current competences.
There are currently 25 energy markets with great disparities, asymmetries in regulations and operators who work according to differing strategic options and foreign policy commitments.
We need a homogenised system with harmonised conditions of play.
The big operators cannot impose or predetermine these conditions.
A European energy market, with European energy services, will not create itself, but will result from the European method, from common commitment and action.
Europe needs an agenda and leadership in order to make this possible.
We Socialists advocate a European energy policy, as laid down, for the first time, in the European Constitution.
Rather than resentful words condemning patriotism, we need intelligent action in favour of Europeanism.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in the last few weeks the Italian UDC-SVP delegation has presented a written question to the Commission in order to highlight the contradictions of a European energy policy apparently in crisis.
The decision of the French Government to create another energy giant by breaching the principles of the European market will have negative consequences.
The merger between the companies of and risks setting Member State against Member State just as Europe is about to embark on a 100% liberalisation of the market of this sector.
This political initiative flies in the face of all plans for transparency and free competition, replacing, in fact, the right to financial wrangling that ought to be a part of a single market.
Furthermore, Franceâs adoption of the directive on takeover bids, which the National Assembly will, after a long silence, take up tomorrow, gives cause for concern.
A draft law such as this could obstruct âs potential capital transactions by granting excessive powers to companies that are subject to a takeover bid.
Faced with such an anomaly, we had no choice but to raise the problem responsibly, asking ourselves what kind of energy policy our Europe intends to pursue.
We wish to make clear in this House, MrÂ President, our fear of a dangerous drift towards a Europe made up of nations that are against the ideals and spirit of the Treaties, and against the spirit and values handed down to us by Alcide De Gasperi, Konrad Adenauer, Robert Schumann and Jean Monnet.
A Europe that has created for itself a single currency, that seeks to harmonise laws, legislation, statutes and institutions, that has created a central bank and that has established the Schengen area, cannot be reduced to a game in which national interests prevail over community interests, and where policy is fast taking the place of the market.
The prospect of a pan-European industrial context, relaunched by PresidentÂ Barroso with the approval of the Green Paper on Energy, at last gives cause for hope.
The Commissionâs main objectives in the coming months must be to create open markets that benefit the consumer and to focus on global European policies that protect against national self-interests.
Â Â  Mr President, when I hear Members of this Parliament treating the principle of the free movement of capital as sacrosanct, forgetting about the social objectives laid down in the Treaty, such as employment, the development of a balanced economy or the maintenance of solidarity and cohesion, I get the impression that some Members of this Parliament have not read the European Union's Treaties.
With regard to takeover bids, in general, we must take account, for example, of the interests of the workers, which are recognised in the Directive on takeover bids, and, secondly, we must take account of public service obligations.
As Mr Turmes said earlier, the large multinationals are currently demanding higher sums from their subscribers in certain countries than in countries where that free movement does not exist.
Those of us from outlying island regions are wondering who is going to pay the additional cost that will arise for these regions in deficit.
Finally, I would like to point out that it is not true that the Directive on takeover bids does not provide for political interventions: Article 4(5) provides for the establishment of exceptional measures in accordance with national circumstances.
European Union regulators will have to take this into account.
Â Â  Mr President, I am going to take notice of my compatriot SÃ¡nchez Presedo and talk about the takeover bids â plural â for the company, Endesa.
What has the Spanish Socialist Government done in this case?
Firstly, it has systematically occupied all of the regulatory bodies and the Competition Court.
For the first time in the history of Spanish democracy, the three are presided over by persons of known political affiliation.
Secondly, it has blatantly supported a particular takeover bid for Endesa, to the extent that the Council of Ministers approved it contrary to the opinion-report of the Competition Court.
Thirdly, it has built a wall â repeated today by the Minister for the Economy and the Minister for Industry â to prevent the takeover bid by another Community company.
To the Prime Ministerâs cry of âthey shall not passâ, the Minister for Industry deployed all of his âweapons of mass obstructionâ to the point of changing the rules of the game in the middle of the match â which incidentally had to be rectified during the stage between the Cabinet and the Official State Bulletin â turning Spain into a kind of banana republic in which legal certainty is trampled upon.
If we are to talk about economic patriotism, what Spain needs in order to continue growing and creating employment is more competition rather than more protectionism, more liberalism rather than political interference or haggling, more energy security, which means integration into Europe, rather than continuing to be an island where energy is concerned.
I would ask the Commission, firstly, to clear up the political doubts surrounding these operations.
As soon as the takeover bid took place, I asked the Commissioner to seek a resolution of the issue, because I warned her of the political risks involved in that bid.
She did not wish to do so, and that has brought us to where we are today.
Secondly, I would ask that the application of the competition rules as they stand be guaranteed.
Thirdly, as she has said, I would ask for integration into a common market, which will be the only way to ensure energy sufficiency and cheap energy and into an internal market, which is what we want to see.
That is Spanish patriotism and it is also European patriotism.
Â Â  (Mr President, Community law governs mergers and acquisitions on the internal market by creating a competition policy which is one of the main Community policies and also one of its earliest.
It is supposed to guarantee the removal of barriers to internal trade within the single market and to ensure that they are not replaced by other actions by businesses or governments which would distort competition.
Unfortunately, recent events have shown that in some Member States protectionist and short-sighted activities are being carried out.
This applies to the German company which is trying to acquire the Spanish company , the merger of the French gas giant with , the Italian-based, multinational fuel and energy group and the recent blocking by the Polish Government of the merger involving the . bank and bank, which is the product of a merger between the German and the Italian .
The opposition of the Polish Government has a dubious legal base with respect to Community law and shows Poland in an unfavourable light in relation to foreign investors.
Unfortunately, this case has also become a weapon for the right-wing government in its fight against the independence of the Polish National Bank, which is also the central bank.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, did you know that yoghurt is a matter of national interest?
That was the argument put forward by a large founding Member State on the question of whether a takeover of Danone was permissible, even though the companyâs turnover and profits are predominantly generated abroad.
The present discussion is astonishing.
Everyone is in favour of his countryâs enterprises going on a buying spree around Europe and the world â but not in his own country.
I did not hear anyone in Spain complaining when the Spanish TelefÃ³nica took over the GermanâBritish enterprise O2 or when Banco de Santander took over a large British financial services provider.
I did not see anyone becoming agitated about France seeking to buy up an Italian bank, or ElectricitÃ© de France acquiring a stake in Energie Baden-WÃŒrttemberg AG, or UniCredito in Italy acquiring Hypo-Vereinsbank, even though ABNÂ AMRO encountered problems when it tried to take a similar course of action in Italy.
We are seeing a great deal of hypocrisy here on the part of Member States and the Council.
They are closing their own doors behind them and seeking to do business elsewhere; and thus weakening the European economy.
We are labouring under a misapprehension if we believe that the Lisbon objectives can be achieved and we can become stronger by means of national protectionism, when we cannot even withstand the relevant competition in our own area.
We need strong enterprises, and also enterprises that go to other countries and introduce more competition there.
The Commission faces challenges on two levels.
It must examine each case carefully and answer the following questions.
Does the fusion benefit consumers?
Does it enhance competition?
That is the Commissionâs real task when it comes to examination, and the answer is often âyesâ, and occasionally ânoâ.
The Commission must take a strict line towards the Council, as confidence that Member States and the Council are thinking in terms of a European approach and of the internal market has suffered greatly in recent years.
Â Â  â The Commissionâs initiative to review the regulation on mergers is a welcome one.
The legislation has become ineffective, as evidenced by unbalanced and economically unsustainable legal decisions in relation to the energy market in Portugal and Spain.
The recent upsurge in large-scale operators in Europe exacerbates regulatory problems, especially in smaller countries with more fragile resources.
Essential goods and services that should be universally available at the lowest possible cost are now being provided by private companies operating monopolies or oligopolies.
When the imperfections of the market become the rule rather than the exception, the objectives that competition should be able to produce become unattainable, and it is in this area in particular that the role of regulation is vital.
Commissioner, will the ongoing legislative review provide answers to some of these questions?
How does the Commission envisage regulating the power of the European oligopolies?
Can Europe live without deep reflection on industrial policy and services of general economic interest?
I thank you in advance for answering these questions.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I do not have a great to deal to add to what I said at the start.
I declared my support clearly, on behalf of the Council, for competition in the interests of consumers.
At the beginning of the debate, MrÂ Lehne requested that the Council deal with this issue.
MrÂ Radwan made a similar appeal to the Council.
I can only say that, where an effort is required on the part of the Council, and where we have the competence, the authority, we shall of course take action, and we shall do so in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Treaties.
I should like to take this opportunity to engage, if I may, in a little self-promotion.
I should like to draw the Houseâs attention to an event that is being organised jointly by the Austrian and Finnish Council Presidencies, which may be of interest to those present.
On the occasion of the now traditional European Competition Day, Austria and Finland, the two Council presidencies for 2006, are holding an event entitled âCompetition law and its surroundings â links and new trendsâ in Vienna on 19Â JuneÂ 2006.
The main emphasis of this event will be on current trends in mergers and merger control.
Under the heading âDo mergers keep what they promise?â, the issue of the extent to which the Merger Regulation has brought in a new approach will be discussed on the basis of examples of a merger and the situation in an economy in transition.
We shall have the pleasure of welcoming CommissionerÂ Kroes and also Martin Bartenstein, the Austrian Federal Minister for Economic Affairs and Labour, to this event.
I can imagine that this will meet with some degree of interest.
Â Â  . Mr President, I am grateful for the initiative of the Austrian Presidency in organising, together with the forthcoming Finnish Presidency, a very important day in June: Competition Day.
With regard to other matters, I am impressed by the priority that has been given to the SMEs.
The issue has been approached in a way that really represents a great step forward.
The Presidency has not only fulfilled an agenda, but has also been very pragmatic in trying to find solutions.
We are aware that it is not only Members of Parliament who are interested in the issue but others too, especially the SMEs themselves.
I am very grateful to all the Members who, in their remarks, gave quite clear backing to the policy of the Commission.
I also take into account that not everybody agrees on the policy.
However, I sincerely hope that we are all aware that open and competitive markets are key drivers for growth and jobs in Europe.
It was rightly mentioned that this is what we promised to deliver in the Lisbon Agenda: more jobs, better jobs and economic growth.
As many of you have recognised, an internal market has enormous potential.
We have to let our businesses and industries exploit it to the full.
That is what was decided.
It includes, by the way, the process of corporate restructuring.
That is looking promising and it is not only a matter of looking at the internal market itself, but also of looking at the position of the internal market outside Europe.
For we have to be aware that there is a global competitiveness and if we are serious in saying that we want to play that game then we need to be aware that we have to restructure in some circumstances.
While the effects of individual mergers must be assessed on a case-by-case basis in accordance â there is no doubt about this â with the relevant competition rules, mergers between companies based in different Member States are likely to increase competition.
This in turn leads to concrete benefits for European consumers in the form of lower prices and wider choice, and that is why the Commission would look with great concern at any unjustified interference in this process by national governments.
As regards the free movement of capital rightly mentioned by a number of Members, the Commission will uphold the single market rules, as you expect us to do.
We will be tough against Member States which fail to implement correctly the provisions of the EC sectoral legislation introducing competition into markets such as energy, telecoms, financial services or banking.
As regards individual mergers, we will enforce the Merger Regulation in a fair, objective and coherent way.
You will recall that under the Merger Regulation the Commission has exclusive competence for controlling, on competition grounds, the effects of mergers with a Community dimension.
I take careful note of the concerns expressed here about specific cases in the energy sector.
I have no information at this point so I cannot discuss them.
I say once again that we control mergers on competition grounds only, and that is the basis on which the Court reviews our decisions.
As you know, ArticleÂ 21 of the Merger Regulation also gives us a tool for addressing any undue interference by national authorities in relation to corporate restructuring.
I would add that I will not hesitate to use this tool wherever it is necessary.
Regarding the two-thirds rule for mergers touched upon by some Members, will that rule for mergers be amended? The split of competences due to the two-thirds rule may lead to inconsistency in the approach to substantially similar mergers.
That is basic.
I think this seems particularly inappropriate in the energy sector, where an EU-wide policy on liberalisation is currently being implemented â it is not ready yet but it is currently being implemented â and where different players should be treated in a similar way across Member States.
So, no different treatment in one Member State than in another.
However, the Commission is at a very early stage of its thought process.
The first step is a consultation with stakeholders in the Member States on the question of whether it is advisable to modify the two-thirds rule.
I am aware that we need the backing of the Council and I am aware how difficult that will be.
That is a possible instrument and I am in favour of tackling it, but that is not my goal.
The goal is to ensure fair and equal treatment, rather than one being more equal than another.
So, if there is a possibility of arriving at that policy, from whatever direction, then it will be D-day for this part of my policy.
The Commission has a duty to enforce the rules wherever appropriate.
As guardian of the Treaties we will do our job fairly but firmly, as was rightly said by the Austrian Presidency.
I thank you again for your support; I am grateful for it.
We badly need to do our job as quickly as possible, for it is indeed quite hectic in merger country.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the Euro-Mediterranean policy and the preparation for the next meeting of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly in Brussels.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in the course of the short debate on the Middle East that has been held today in response to current events, Euro-Mediterranean cooperation has also rightly been mentioned.
This cooperation is of the utmost importance, not only with regard to the Middle East issue, but also in other contexts.
I do not wish to reiterate at this point what I have already said today on behalf of the Council about the events in the Middle East.
In the meantime, the Presidency, too, has issued a statement on this.
I should now like to turn to the Euromed process itself.
The Austrian Presidency follows on the heels of last Novemberâs Summit in Barcelona on the tenth anniversary of the first Barcelona Summit, which adopted a five-year work programme for the Partnership, oriented towards political and economic reforms, and also a Code of Conduct on Countering Terrorism.
I believe that these documents and agreements are of the utmost importance.
We and our Mediterranean partners have also agreed to increase investment in education and to tackle together all aspects of legal and illegal immigration.
That is another very important issue.
It is now up to the Austrian Presidency to work towards implementing all of these projects.
This we shall do willingly, vigorously and with conviction.
I should also like to take this opportunity to announce that a meeting of Trade Ministers is to be held in Marrakech on 24Â March, and there will be a meeting of Euromed Finance Ministers in Tunis on 25Â and 26Â June.
We shall also be giving particular support to the Commission in prioritising the media, because we are convinced that the media plays a particularly important role in intercultural understanding.
In this connection, the Euromed Seminar on Xenophobia and Racism in the Media that has been planned for a long time is now scheduled to be held in May, during the Austrian Presidency.
As the House has already heard from the Austrian Minister for Foreign Affairs, President of the General Affairs and External Relations Council, the Council has been intensely preoccupied with the issue of the caricatures in recent weeks, including at the informal meeting of Ministers for Foreign Affairs in Salzburg.
This issue is another about which I have already had the opportunity to speak to you here.
This problem, in particular, has made clear to us that we have to specifically take the route of forward-looking dialogue between the EU and the Islamic world and with Muslim communities in Europe.
The Euro-Mediterranean Partnership offers an ideal, particularly important forum for the dialogue with Mediterranean countries in this regard.
I consider this dialogue to be particularly important at all levels, particularly the direct contact between young people, and I believe that the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership can, and must, indeed play a key role.
It was with this aim in view that the Anna Lindh Foundation for the Dialogue between Cultures was established last year.
This Foundation has a key role to play, particularly at this time.
The Conclusions of the EU General Affairs and External Relations Council of 27Â FebruaryÂ 2006 expressly mention the Barcelona process and the Anna Lindh Foundation, along with other multilateral organisations playing a role in this field, a fact that we consider most welcome.
It is now important to take all the available instruments of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership and use them to defuse tensions, such as those seen recently.
A meeting of leading Euro-Mediterranean officials has already taken place, on 22Â February: this enabled a very open exchange of views on the events and gave all the participants the opportunity to propose specific measures.
In essence, there is agreement on the fact that the structures required to tackle this problem are already in place; I do not believe that we should create new ones.
The challenge for us now is to make use of all the appropriate opportunities for dialogue to successfully continue the long-standing efforts towards bringing the peoples on both sides of the Mediterranean closer together.
The Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly brings together representatives of the peoples on both sides of the Mediterranean.
We expect it to make a particularly important contribution to further calming this situation and to better understanding.
The Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly has given the Barcelona process an urgently needed new dimension and, in particular, increased its legitimacy.
Relevant working committees were put to work even at the stage of preparing for the Barcelona Summit in NovemberÂ 2005.
The Committee on Political Affairs, Security and Human Rights of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly debated the problem of the caricatures calmly and in detail at its meeting on the sixth of this month and it, too, pointed to the necessity of increasing dialogue.
I am convinced that the plenary session to be held on 26 and 27Â March will also be able to provide an appropriate response to the questions that have arisen.
The Austrian Presidency is following and supporting the diverse initiatives that are being taken in this regard.
Just today, at the meeting of the Senior Officials Committee for the Barcelona process, the Euromed Committee, the title of a seminar to be held in Vienna was changed at the request of our Mediterranean partners, to take account of their request for religious feelings to be respected.
It is my conviction that there is scope for further improvement in communication between the traditional Euromed committees and the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly.
I hope that, with a little imagination, we are able to achieve further progress on this issue under the Austrian Presidency, to the benefit of all of the Euromed committees and the Partnership as a whole.
Furthermore, particularly in the light of current events, enhanced cooperation could be initiated, for example with the OSCE or even with the âalliance of civilisationsâ â which, as we know, is a SpanishâTurkish initiative under the auspices of the United Nations.
Austria would like to continue its involvement in this wider context, and has already invited the High Level Group on the alliance of civilisations to hold its third meeting in Vienna at the end of May.
Â Â  . Mr President, we are here to discuss the Barcelona Process and the preparations for the next meeting of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly.
Let me just say a few words about the recent events in the Palestinian territories, because today the time was so short during the speeches on the Gymnich and there were only two Commissioners.
I ceded my place to Commissioner Rehn for the Western Balkans debate and now, if you permit me, I shall say a few words on yesterday's events.
It is not only topical but also goes to the heart of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership, to our shared objective for a region of peace, stability, prosperity and opportunity.
I fail to see how any of the actions yesterday in any way contributed to those objectives.
The Israeli attack on the prison in Jericho and the Israelis' public treatment of prison guards and inmates is unacceptable and should be condemned.
I also deplore the violence, the kidnappings and the attacks on the Commission offices and other offices of the Member States in Gaza and the West Bank.
The first victims of this breakdown of law and order are the Palestinian people themselves.
In the current circumstances, with key political deadlines ahead in both Israel and the Palestinian territories, it is more important than ever that both parties show restraint and responsibility.
Attacks, such as the ones that took place yesterday, and provocative statements do nothing to improve prospects, and the Palestinian Authority must put an end to violence and insecurity.
Yesterday evening, I had a good discussion â as you, Mr President, no doubt did â with President Abbas before he returned to deal with the mounting violence and confrontation.
He is doing one of the most difficult jobs in the world just now, which was not made any easier by yesterday's events.
How he manages to compose a new Palestinian Authority Government will affect the prospects for peace in the Middle East and will also have repercussions for us all.
The European Union is a reliable partner of the Palestinian people.
No donor has done more to help them.
I told President Abbas once again that we want to continue our support for a better, peaceful and prosperous future, but that we stand firm on our principles, leaving the door open to positive developments.
All future assistance to a new Palestinian Authority Government will be reviewed in relation to its position on the key principles of an end to violence, recognition of Israel and compliance with the existing agreements, including the Roadmap.
Those with whom President Abbas negotiates must know and understand that their decisions on their issues will have important repercussions.
Let me now say a few words about the Euro-Med Partnership.
The Barcelona Summit last November achieved notable results for the future.
The five-year work programme agreed at the summit and the Code of Conduct on counter-terrorism constitute a very ambitious agenda which will render the partnership more tangible, more politically relevant and more operational.
To follow up on the summit, we must now ensure constructive and effective contributions by all partners to attain the commonly agreed objectives on political and economic reform, growth and job creation, human rights and gender issues, education and management of migration, regional stability and the fight against terrorism.
The Commission has already launched work on the implementation of that five-year programme.
Initiatives have been taken with the current and the incoming Council Presidencies, as well as with Mediterranean partners, to ensure the success of this common endeavour.
We have reserved appropriate funding for assistance and support, provided through MEDA and the future European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument, including a substantial facility to encourage progress on governance reform that we call a 'governance facility'.
As of this year, several new and innovative activities will be launched.
Preparations are well under way to organise the first Euro-Med ministerial meeting on gender issues at the end of the year.
Two sub-regional conferences, one in the Maghreb and one in the Mashreq, will pave the way for government and civil society representatives to examine the importance of gender equality for economic and social development and propose practical measures to improve womenâs access to jobs and public life.
At the Barcelona Summit, Euro-Med partners highlighted the importance of migration, social integration, justice and security as issues of common interest in the partnership, which should be addressed through a balanced and comprehensive approach.
Work has begun on preparing a ministerial meeting to tackle all issues from illegal migration to trafficking in human beings and people smuggling.
This regional initiative is complemented by our bilateral programmes aimed at strengthening institutional capacities, managing legal migration, improving border controls, fighting illegal immigration and people trafficking.
Mr Winkler has already mentioned the Trade Ministerial Meeting, which will be attended by Commissioner Mandelson and will advance the objective of a European free trade area.
We also hope to see similar progress on South-South trade â the 'Agadir process'.
The so-called cartoon crisis has highlighted the dangers of leaving prejudice, misinformation and misunderstanding to fester.
We regret the offence caused by those cartoons to Muslims across the world, but we also strongly condemned all violent acts and threats against individuals and property of the European Union and other countries.
Support for intercultural dialogue at all levels is important.
I am glad that in Salzburg this has been very strongly recommended.
We are convinced that the Barcelona Process has a framework for it and that the architecture is already there: there is the Anna Lindh Foundation and 35 other structures within an entire network.
We must reach out to civil society and the media, and all the media seminars that are being planned by the Austrian Presidency are very welcome.
In this context, I am very happy with the initiative to exchange views on this subject during the next Euro-Med Parliamentary Assembly.
From there, I would go to the Arab League summit in Khartoum, because it is highly important that we now use every opportunity to really talk to our Arab friends and colleagues.
At this critical juncture, our message has to be clear: it is through a vigorous but also peaceful dialogue of opinions, with full respect for freedom of expression, that understanding can be deepened and respect can be built.
Indeed, that is the essence of the Barcelona Process.
Therefore, what we want to do is give more hope to progress.
Together, we want to realise the objectives of security, stability and prosperity.
Â Â  . â Mr President, it is a great pleasure to see you in the Chair at the beginning of this debate on the Euromed Parliamentary Assembly, which you do so much to elevate and enhance.
Of colleagues here in the Chamber, the pioneers of the Euro-Mediterranean policy are very numerous on the left, but not so numerous on the centre-right, with the distinguished exceptions of MrÂ Busuttil, Mr Kasoulides and Mrs SaÃ¯fi, but more may come.
As was mentioned earlier today, Veronique De Keyser and I had the honour to meet the President of Palestine last night.
We profoundly regret the circumstances in which he had to return home.
I believe it is ironic and tragic that the two countries who talk most about encouraging democracy in the Middle East â the United Kingdom and the United States â should be the very countries who left their posts in Jericho yesterday.
The governments of both those countries should have reinforced and not withdrawn their garrisons.
It would be appropriate at the Euromed Parliamentary Assembly that we should hear, particularly from the Council, where the responsibility lay for the decisions, who took them, when and why they were taken.
I hope that, if possible, we will get a statement from the Council at that meeting, with the assistance of the Commission.
The work of the Euromed is based largely on its committees.
We are deeply grateful for the work that takes place there and for the opportunity that the Assembly provides, uniquely in the world, for Palestine and Israel to work together.
It is an unusual meeting, taking place on the eve of an Israeli election, and following the election in Palestine on 25Â January.
It may be that representatives from those two countries are not present, but that does not mean they have gone out of our minds.
They are very much at the forefront of our concerns.
I believe that this meeting â the last under your chairmanship under the Presidency of the European Parliament â will be a great opportunity for the Commission, the Council and Parliament to underline our commitment to giving the parliamentary dimension of the Mediterranean real substance.
I hope that the work I am doing on my subcommittee may give the European Parliament the opportunity to become the operational and organisational heart of the Euromed Assembly in the future.
That is my intention.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, Commissioner, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, the dramatic events of the last few hours in Palestine force us to reach a view and, as you said, Commissioner, go right to the heart of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership.
I would like to say to the Israeli authorities that an electoral campaign, however important, cannot permit the distortion of existing legal frameworks.
One of these frameworks, the main one, is the role of PresidentÂ AbuÂ Mazen, damaged and deprived of authority by the irresponsible attack on the prison in Jericho and by the capture of prisoners whose detention was the competence of the Palestinian authority.
I would also like to hear a view from the Council on the conduct of the United Kingdom and United States forces present in the area.
All our moral and political support goes to the President of the Palestinian Authority, who should have been among us here today.
We are aware of his very difficult position, particularly after the result of the legislative elections in Palestine.
As you said, Commissioner, Europe must remind the Israeli authorities of the need to respect the law and their legitimate partners, just as we demand of Hamas itself.
Defying the legal framework means opening the door to the sort of retaliation and violence that is already going on and that we need to try and stem.
We are relieved in this matter by news of the freeing of the hostages.
As for the crisis in Iran, another sorry chapter, I welcomed the words of MrÂ Straw, which I hope he will hold to completely.
He stated that no military option exists.
He made explicit a position that the whole of Europe ought to take and to which the Socialist Group in the European Parliament fully subscribes, as it is also our position.
Stopping negotiations would lead to the disastrous state of affairs already seen in Iraq.
This does not make us weaker: on the contrary, it opens up the chance for close dialogue, and reassures the Iranian and Syrian people, who feel threatened.
Let us relieve the tension and avoid creating undesirable alliances forged in the name of the fight against the West.
Let us keep the international community united in putting pressure on Iran to respect the obligations it signed up to under the Non-Proliferation Treaty, with a view to disarmament in the Middle East and in the whole of the Mediterranean.
It is to be hoped that over this extremely delicate period Europe can express itself with one voice, autonomously and effectively, and that the next Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly can become the perfect occasion to confront these issues.
Â Â  . Mr President, I too wish to condemn yesterdayâs assault by the Israeli Defence Forces on the Jericho prison.
Such actions can only make Hamas's policy more radical and hence make the already very tense relations in that region even more complicated.
In view of the violations of international law and human rights and of the democratic challenges in that region, we must deplore the fact that the declarations and commitments resulting from the Barcelona Summit have not been accompanied by a stronger and more concrete commitment to promoting human rights and democracy.
Freedom of expression is a universal right, which is both crucial and essential to the development of any democracy. The European Union should not, therefore, spare any effort in defending and promoting it.
We are not just talking about the events following the publication of the cartoons.
In Algeria, people who attack the President are being tried for slander and being imprisoned or fined.
They include Ali Dilem, the correspondent of , Bachir El Arabi and Hakim LaÃ¢lam, the columnist for
Mohammed Benchicou, the director of , has been held in the El-Harrach prison since 14 June 2004.
Despite his constantly deteriorating state of health, the authorities refuse to treat him.
He has been convicted of or is charged with almost fifty press crimes.
He is a prisoner of conscience and not a criminal prisoner, as some people claim.
In Tunisia, whose delegation will soon hold the presidency of the EMPA, Mohammed Abbou, the human rights activist and lawyer, has been in prison for more than a year, following the publication of two critical articles.
He had already sown up his own mouth in protest against his imprisonment and the conditions in which he is being held.
He now plans to stage a hunger strike.
In Morocco, Aboubakr Jamai and Fahd Iraki, of the newspaper , have been sentenced to pay the equivalent of 143 times the minimum Moroccan annual salary.
The 2 February 2006 edition of the Spanish daily was banned from distribution as a result of an article written by Ali Lmrabet.
Journalists from the weekly have also been convicted of slander.
I shall end by calling for more account to be taken of human rights and democracy in the discussions within the EMPA, as we are urged to do by the winners of the Sakharov Prize 2005, Reporters without Borders.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, at the Karni crossing checkpoint in Gaza, a man called Ayman told me he wished us and our money to the devil, not because he did not actually accept our help, and was ungrateful for it, but to say that he and his people had had enough, that they needed freedom and dignity and not just humanitarian aid.
At the same time we ourselves cannot have an easy conscience just because we continue to help; what we really need to do is continue to help the Palestinians.
Yesterdayâs action, like so many others, was illegal, cynical and inhumane.
Illegal because it was illegal, but cynical because it was done with a thought to the elections.
It was actually an example of vengeance and brutal colonialism.
I think it is time Israel understood that its very existence, its very love for democracy, can only exist if it respects other peoples.
Yet Israel is not doing this, and we certainly cannot be a party to this, and we are not.
The Commission and the Council stated this very openly this morning.
Our Parliamentary Assembly is extremely important, but we ought to face up to a problem: the involvement of Palestinian representatives in the Parliamentary Assembly.
We must accept absolutely the presence of whoever is recommended by the Palestinian Legislative Council.
It is a shame that this is happening the day before the Israeli elections because it means that an essential component of the Assembly will not be present.
We must, however, make sure that the Assembly works, that it functions, not least because if we do not solve the Palestinian question our Assembly will constantly have as the focus of its discussions the subject of Palestine and Israel.
Nor will we be able to confront the problems that the Commission and the Council have very clearly set forth, namely how to succeed in establishing a Mediterranean that is truly cooperative.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to take advantage of this debate to congratulate the bureau of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly on the communication that it has published on the infamous cartoons.
The figure of Mohammed is what we might call the point of communion for an Islam that is more fragile and diverse, and even more divided, than we might think.
Targeting that figure means targeting its heart.
There is no way we could not have known that, just as there is no way we could not have considered the consequences of what was being done, namely inflaming the conflict between civilisations.
Who exactly do these cartoons serve: who has an interest in stirring up these conflicts?
I would like to put that question.
Certainly not us, the Europeans, surely not France anyway, which is the main Mediterranean coastal power and whose influence depends on a fine balance between its European continental policy, on the one hand, and its Mediterranean and African policy, on the other.
Admittedly, there comes with this statement a dual concern: on the one hand, the EMPA and Euromed are still like frail barques cast out to sea.
Frail not just in terms of resources, but above all in terms of their intellectual inspiration, since it seems to me that they are still clinging to a very Eurocentric view of democracy and human rights â we have just seen yet another illustration of this â which not only smells of colonialism, but which furthermore prevents us â we saw this in December in Barcelona as well â from dealing with what is really important, that is to say, economic, financial and commercial cooperation and the management of migratory flows.
Contrary to what the Commission has just said, I personally would talk about cooperation, rather than a free-trade area, which I believe to be a very dangerous formula.
The second concern is that the issue of civilisations has been an obvious one for a very long time, which we have known about since Charles Martel: we have not had to wait for American thinkers to point it out to us.
One would have to be foolishly immersed in the delusions of globalisation to be all of a sudden amazed to discover that civilisations are not interchangeable and men even less so, and that coexistence between different peoples is not automatic.
This kind of Huntington approach is clearly intended to send a different message, namely that we are all destined to be part of a âWestâ â in emphatic inverted commas â the capital of which would have to be Washington, with the Europeans simply having to follow the warlike ventures of the United States.
This very idea of the West is, as we know, an ideological sham.
It is precisely because civilisations endlessly clash that we need a policy, that we need politics, that we need a will to live collectively, something for which, in short, the EMPA and Euromed offer a framework.
So let us begin by strengthening them, since it seems to me that they are getting increasingly fragile while becoming increasingly necessary year by year.
Â Â  â It is a pity that no sooner than we take a step forward in the Barcelona Process, than something happens in the Middle East which sets back the development we would have made.
However I wish to remain focused on our theme and I wish to talk as a member of the Economic Commission of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly.
I wish that both the Commission as well as the Council analyse a study which was done by the University of Manchester entitled âSustainable Impact Assessment Study of the Euromed Free-Trade Areaâ.
We started to discuss this study in the Economic Commission of the Assembly and it gives a worrying picture of the impact of the European Unionâs policy on the setting up of a free trade area in the Mediterranean.
It forecasts a rather negative effect on our partner countries in the Mediterranean who are supposed to benefit and not lose by the Barcelona Process.
Among the negative effects it mentions the possibility that in these countries there could be an increase in unemployment, a decrease in the level of wages, as well as a great impact on resources such as water and biodiversity and other environmental impacts.
Naturally the report is not telling us to halt or to dismantle the plan for the setting up of a free-trade area, but it is saying that we should take these negative effects seriously and we should take preventive measures now, before it is too late.
Therefore I wish to ask both the Commission as well as the Council to tell us what is their opinion about this study and what measures they intend to take to address any negative impact which could be brought about by the setting up of a free trade area in the Mediterranean.
For example there is the need, no doubt, that the European Union policy towards these countries should balance the commercial aspect with a more intensive cooperation in the financial, social and educational sector as well as in the environmental sector.
I conclude by appealing to both the Commission as well as to the Council to take a more active part in the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly and also to reply to the questions put by the Members of Parliament.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like first of all to thank you for being here and above all to congratulate you on having led the work of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly so well over the six months that it has fallen to this House to head its work.
We must be able to acknowledge what we do well and also what we do badly.
In this case, let us acknowledge what we do well.
The Euro-Mediterranean process has been a success and so was the Barcelona Summit of last November.
This is a live and developing process.
Let us consider the situation had the Euro-Mediterranean process not existed, in light of the events we have seen surrounding the cartoons crisis and the events yesterday in Jericho for example.
It would be an enormous problem: how to establish dialogue, how to seek methods of cooperation in order to resolve the problems.
The action plan approved in Barcelona contains some extremely important points â some have been mentioned.
I would like to mention something that seems to me to be essential: yes to the free trade area, but with economic and social cohesion as well.
We know a lot about this in Europe and this will be the key to the success of the first objective.
Another issue that was dealt with was the Code of Conduct on counter-terrorism.
In an area such as this, such a Code of Conduct was unimaginable just a few years ago.
Today we have one.
Furthermore, the Barcelona Summit accepted the joint Spanish-Turkish initiative on the alliance of civilisations, which does not mean accepting cultural relativism, but rather guiding cultures in the same direction: the defence of democracy, freedom, human rights and equality between human beings.
Within this context, the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly provides us with an extremely important forum for political debate.
I believe that, with a view to the meeting on the 26th and the 27th, we need to do four things: speed up decision making, refocus the debates around rapporteurs by committee, ensure that the Commission and Council attend and participate, as President Borrell demanded this morning at the beginning of our sitting, as events require, and finally to involve civil society.
In that way, we will be moving in the right direction.
Â Â  Mr President, in the one short minute available to me, I would like to make a very specific proposal.
I entirely agree of course with the opinions expressed in relation to the events in Jericho.
From a political point of view, given this spiral of violence and following the cartoons of Mohammed conflict, now more than ever we must strive for peaceful co-existence in the Mediterranean.
In the context of the EMPA committee responsible for cultural affairs, we have proposed the creation of a cultural contact committee made up of respected experts who are capable of dialogue, in order to respond to cultural and religious conflicts, to mediate, clarify and diffuse cultural and religious tension between the two flanks of the Mediterranean.
The Anna Lindh Foundation, based in Alexandria, is in a perfect position to organise this committee of experts, which could act in a preventive manner in the event of similar conflicts, in order to clear up misunderstandings of the cultures of others, in order to clear up any doubts about what really happened.
I believe that in this way, at the Assembly on the 26th we could take a small step towards the tolerance that we want to see in the Mediterranean.
Â Â  Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, we have to admit that the work of the Barcelona Summit has been disappointing in the face of enormous challenges.
We must therefore look to the future with greater determination and achieve results now.
In view of recent events, the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly is the ideal place to reinforce our partnership, on the basis of dialogue, exchange and mutual understanding.
More than ever, the action of the EMPA needs to be reinforced and supported.
More than ever, the objectives of establishing peace and guaranteeing security should be the focus of our decisions and accompanied by concrete action.
Urgent action is needed in order to deal with a difficult local situation and an increasingly uncertain regional context.
I believe that the European Union has a heavy responsibility today, and I am saying that as chairwoman of the political committee of the EMPA which, flanked by a Palestinian vice-president and an Israeli vice-president, wishes to place the resolution of the Middle East conflict at the heart of our work.
The Union must speak with one voice and condemn the perversity of actions that increase the escalation of violence and undermine an already fragile peace process.
It is regrettable that the Palestinian President, Mahmoud Abbas, has not been able to speak to our Parliament following the events in Jericho, and I would like, in this Chamber, to express my concern about this situation.
Commissioner, we have listened to you.
