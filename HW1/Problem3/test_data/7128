We have had a packaging directive since 1994, which we can use as a basis to work from.
The packaging directive has a dual purpose: to reduce the harmful environmental impact of packaging to a minimum and to guarantee the functioning of the internal market.
It is important for Parliament to consider how the directive operates in practice, for we must learn from experience.
Compliance with legislation is important, but the effectiveness of the legislation is at least as important.
In the field of compliance, there is good news and bad news.
The good news is that nearly all Member States have implemented the directive well.
Most objectives have been fulfilled, and Greece recently became the last Member State to inform the Commission of its measures and the results it had achieved.
The Member States all did it their own way: Germany by means of the green dot system, the Netherlands by means of the voluntary agreements, etc.
However, there is also bad news, and I should like to mention four points.
Firstly, the volume of packaging waste is still on the increase.
Prevention of excessive packaging was an express objective, although it is not further specified in the directive.
Only in four countries has the volume of packaging materials diminished.
We clearly need to be more ambitious in this respect.
Secondly, the proportion of plastic in waste is growing.
The directive prescribes a very modest target for plastic: at least 15% must be recycled.
But even this minimum target has only been achieved by four countries, namely Germany, Austria, Belgium and Sweden.
More than 50% of all products are wrapped in plastic.
As it is difficult to recycle plastic, something must be done about this.
Thirdly, reliable and comparable data is lacking.
The Member States all have their own way of collating data and it is unclear, for example, whether plastic waste that is exported is also included in the figures.
Political decisions must be based on sound data, and the directive must be adapted accordingly.
To finish off, I should like to mention one major point: it is, in fact, unclear what the environmental effect is of all the collection, sorting, recycling and re-use.
We think it is positive, and that is probably the case, but a sound assessment of environmental effects is required in order to continue to motivate consumers to separate their waste.
Furthermore, the effect on the internal market, this directive' s second pillar, is equally vague.
Ladies and gentlemen, it is clearly time for a change.
We need better reporting, better definitions and in addition to this, I would suggest a threefold approach.
First of all, we must devote more attention to recycling.
The targets must be raised considerably and we must encourage the use of recycled materials.
Special attention must be given to plastic. To date, plastic has had no positive residual value.
In order to make the collecting and sorting of plastic profitable nevertheless, a levy is required, and I would ask the Commission once again to quickly present the revised proposal now.
Secondly, I would ask the Commission to promote re-use.
For that purpose, situations must be identified where re-use is useful from an environmental point of view.
That is connected with transport distances and the materials.
Thirdly, we must accord prevention a far more prominent role.
For that purpose, I suggest making the manufacturers responsible.
On the basis of a lifecycle analysis, manufacturers must demonstrate that they have chosen the best possible packaging for their product from an environmental point of view.
The question is, of course, how this can be measured.
The emission of CO2, the use of natural ancillary resources, harmful substances and residual waste must definitely form part of the equation.
By adopting this approach, environmental costs can be charged on as part of the product, and that is the direction in which we need to be heading.
We must define clearer environmental parameters within which the market can go about its business and manufacturers can make choices.
Manufacturer responsibility must be further detailed and the Commission must now take the stakeholders dialogue seriously.
The interested parties from each sector, not only from industry but also consumers and representatives of environmental organisations, must be invited.
This can lead to a refreshing approach which can be incorporated in clear guiding principles.
In addition to the three above-mentioned points, fellow MEPs have added a number of useful suggestions: clear responsibility not only for products but also for retailers; paying attention to the role of local councils and of consumers; and paying attention to planning and transport packaging.
I welcome these suggestions with open arms.
The long-overdue revision of the packaging directive is an opportunity to demonstrate that the internal market can be reconciled with the environment, and we must not let this opportunity slip.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by acknowledging the great work done by Mrs Corbey in drawing up this report.
It is clear that in this particular case we are dealing with a directive whose implementation has been very complicated in the majority of Member States, given that the fine-tuning of the mechanisms needed to meet the objectives of the directive is in itself a very complicated issue.
It is one thing to issue a piece of legislation, because everything holds up on paper, and a completely different thing to put it into practice.
I thank the rapporteur for the commitments we have been able to make and I regret that we could not agree on certain points, which are by no means trivial ones.
Firstly I would like to make it patently clear that this should have been a report on the implementation of the directive on packaging, but it has turned into a report that is trying to tell the Commission the direction it should be taking with regard to the revision of the directive in question.
It is a clear example of the temptation that we frequently give into in this Parliament, which is to forget that it is the Commission that holds the legislative initiative.
We in the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats propose the following: Firstly, that the objectives for the prevention and reduction of packaging waste should not be binding, nor should they be classified by material, in order that competitiveness is maintained between them.
For we should not forget that the legal basis of this directive is the environment and also the internal market.
We think, however, that these objectives should be linked to the quantity of the product that is packaged and put on the market.
Secondly: the responsibility for the prevention and removal of packaging and packaging waste must be shared between producers, packaging companies, retailers and consumers, and not only the producer, as the draft report proposes.
Thirdly: Life Cycle Analysis is a very useful method from an environmental point of view, that should be taken into account, but it cannot be proposed as the standard norm to ensure that the requirements of Annex II are being met.
These standard norms should be issued by the European Committee for Standardisation and this body, in turn, should continue working in this direction.
Fourthly, we are against introducing any other new standard apart from the so-called 'green dot' , already in use in most countries.
Lastly, we propose that the recitals alluding to the situation in specific Member States in 1998 with regard to compliance with the objectives of the directive be removed, for at this time the directive was in the process of being transposed, and the data, and I quote directly from recital B, "are not meaningful for the purpose of assessing the real degree to which the directive's objectives have been met" .
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank Mrs Corbey for addressing these issues and writing this own-initiative report.
We really need to discuss packaging.
I nonetheless think - and I say this following 30 years' experience of environmental issues and environmental debate - that, as usual, we have an incredible talent for running after problems and battening upon them.
To discuss packaging solely from the perspective of waste, as we are doing now and have always done, is completely wrong.
I address the Commissioner with responsibility for environmental issues directly and appeal to her to allow us to discuss the whole chain.
We have to discuss logistics, transport and the packaging that eventually becomes waste.
Above all, the amount of consumer packaging must and can be reduced.
You and I come from the same country, and we know that experiments led to a 30 per cent reduction in the quantity of material in consumer packaging over approximately three years.
It is possible.
I might perhaps be allowed to appeal for the forthcoming White Paper on Integrated Product Policy to address the whole of the logistical chain, something which did not feature in the Green Paper.
That would be a merciful answer to our prayers.
Mr President, my group very much supports the report by Mrs Corbey and the compromise amendments, which improve the text.
We also have some amendments of our own which we would urge Members of Parliament to support, particularly as the directive makes it more difficult for Member States with more progressive policies to go ahead in a more environmentally friendly way.
There should be nothing to prevent Member States from making progress.
I received a briefing from my own Department of the Environment in Ireland today, bemoaning the fact that it was going to be very difficult for Ireland.
That is only because Ireland has done nothing about the waste problem or about packaging.
In two other amendments we look to the Commission to present a proposal which takes proper account of the role of packaging throughout the logistics chain.
It should also be putting forward proposals on prevention and reduction.
That is where the problem really lies.
We need to reduce and prevent the amount of packaging first of all, not look at what we are going to do with it afterwards, particularly the amount that goes into landfill.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Corbey, thank you for the work you have put in on this report.
I would very much like to start by asking you, Commissioner, why you have brought before Parliament a report on the implementation of the packaging directive when the revision of the Packaging Regulations is already before us.
I would very much like to know if there is a strategy for this, whether you need more time for a new debate on strategy and whether you are in the process of moving over from a product policy to a materials policy.
As I now observe, that is a vain labour of love, as you are now applying yourself to other things.
You are right, Mrs Corbey, to say that packaging waste is increasing, and so it is entirely right and proper for us to concern ourselves with these Packaging Regulations and with those to be enacted in the future.
I simply think that we must first discuss what has actually been done by the Member States.
Were the old Packaging Regulations from the Nineties right, or did we make mistakes?
Did we rightly see how things would turn out today?
Is there not a multitude of loopholes?
As you mentioned, databases are largely lacking.
Has transposition into national law really taken place punctually and in the way we intend, and is the hierarchy envisaged by the Packaging Regulations actually as flexible as we need it to be in the future?
I do not believe so.
Yet we must, now that the Commission has imposed on us this report on implementation, concentrate on these important matters.
It is unfortunately not our present task to consider what quotas have to be set for landfill dumping, recycling, and so on. Let me make clear that I regret that.
There are a lot of other points I would like to make.
Having lost the first minutes, though, I shall admit defeat and carry on debating in the next round.
Can you please briefly repeat the question you have just put?
Commissioner, I would like to know why you are presenting us with a report on the implementation of the Packaging Regulations, because we all know well enough that the revised Packaging Regulations have already arrived.
My question is whether this is to do with a new strategy.
Is it the case that you want in future to leave product policy behind and turn your attention to the torrents of refuse?
Mr President, these oversight reports by Parliament are very important because we need not only to examine new legislation but to look back to see what has happened to the legislation we have adopted.
Mrs Corbey is quite right to name names.
The Member States were supposed to bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with the packaging directive before 30 June 1996.
That did not happen.
Two things should flow from the findings Mrs Corbey has put before us.
Firstly, we must ask whether the original directive, as Mr Florenz has said, was defective or whether ministers were not honest with themselves about what they could achieve when they adopted it.
The answer is probably a combination of the two.
Secondly, we should ask why the Commission did not act more quickly than it has to investigate why the directive was struggling to gain universal compliance.
I regret that Mrs Corbey did not focus on these questions.
Individual countries have had very different experiences as each has put a recovery system in place.
My own evidence from the United Kingdom is that our system has been too bureaucratic.
One businessman in Cornwall complained to me that he had to employ a graduate specifically to keep a track of his firm's obligations under the directive.
What lessons are there from our experience which could underpin the revision of the directive, or at least a revision of the way that Member States are applying it?
The Commission is wrong if it proposes higher targets for recycling.
This is the easy way out, but the wrong way.
Such targets cannot take account of the considerable variations and circumstances between Member States, so we will end up with an even bigger range of results than we have now, creating trade barriers and distorting competition.
If we are to get EU environmental law that really makes a difference, we must, within much broader targets, allow Member States to adopt solutions best suited to their respective local environments and economies.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, allow me to accord due recognition to Mrs Corbey as rapporteur.
I would thank her for her work on this own-initiative report including a resolution on implementation of Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste.
The report addresses relevant issues and will be of great importance when the Commission goes on to prepare the revision of the directive.
We have also noted that the European Parliament would like to carry out a more extensive review of the issues affecting packaging waste.
I think this is necessary, but things must be done in the right order.
We have now committed ourselves to tabling before long a proposal for revision of the existing proposal and for new targets.
This, moreover, is something we are going to do. I anticipate the Commission' s being able, before the end of the year, to take a decision on the promised revision of the Directive on Packaging and Packaging Waste.
After that, we must look to the longer term considerations addressed by Mrs Paulsen and Mrs Jackson.
We must therefore adopt several different approaches to this work.
The first revolves around an Integrated Product Policy.
I want to state in no uncertain terms that we have specifically emphasised life cycle analysis and this way of looking at the issues.
Certainly, further efforts are required and further proposals and ideas about how to proceed, but the life cycle analysis contains the whole mode of thinking and way of approaching this issue.
It is important that we continue to work with an Integrated Product Policy.
The second revolves around the thematic strategies we have promised under the Sixth Environmental Action Programme.
In the course of next year, there will be two such strategies which will be of great importance to our attitude towards these issues: recycling and use of resources.
In connection with these strategies, there will be the opportunity to review the whole of our policy in terms of looking at each individual waste stream.
Are we to continue to do this, and how are we to look at this issue in broad outline?
It is important for us to take this major initiative, but we must do it in the right way and at the right time.
In my judgment, we must handle the problems via Integrated Product Policy and via the thematic strategies.
Before the end of the year, the promised revision of the specific targets for packaging and packaging waste will take place.
It is perfectly correct to point out that we need to review the whole of this issue in order to obtain a policy which will last for many years into the future and which will mean that we do not need to go chasing frantically after problems.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Insurance mediation
The next item on the agenda is the Report (A5-0359/2001) by Mr Berenguer Fuster on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive [COM(2000) 511 - C5-0484/2000 - 2000/0213(COD)] on insurance mediation.
Mr President, even at this unreasonably late hour, I am honoured to submit for your consideration the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive on insurance mediation.
In my opinion it is a good proposal, on which the Commission should be congratulated.
Above all, it is a proposal that manages to find a balance between the various interests concerned.
In the area that it is intended to regulate, these interests include those of intermediaries, of insurance companies, and also, and this must not be forgotten, the interests of consumers, although these usually put less pressure on Members than the aforementioned interested parties.
All of these interests should be taken into account, and when I say that this proposal is a balanced one, I am referring to the fact that there is a balance between all of the various interests concerned.
Not to mention that the amendments tabled by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs must aim to uphold this balance that the Commission has scrupulously maintained.
There are also other interests which are, in my opinion, less worthy of consideration.
I am talking about sectors whose main aim is to uphold the status they currently enjoy in their respective countries, which will be impossible to sustain when we attempt to produce a harmonisation standard.
If the aim of each country, or of each sector in each country, is that the forthcoming directive should not in any way affect the status quo, the only possible solution will, therefore, be not to have a harmonisation standard, or if it is required in an area such as this, that there should be no internal market in the specific sector in question.
This aspiration can disguise an attempt for the harmonisation standard to respond exclusively to the current model in a specific country; or, put in more favourable terms, to suggest that Member States should not apply important parts of the directive.
Ladies and gentlemen, do you not think that these exceptions could render the harmonisation standard meaningless?
Do you not realise that taking this route will cause problems for the internal market?
The proposal for a directive included certain exceptions, and it is true that the report enlarges on some of these, but I think that these exceptions are within the bounds of what is reasonable.
The idea that those who sell insurance on behalf of travel agencies or veterinary surgeons have to be registered intermediaries should be excluded, for this falls within what is reasonable.
Even now, I firmly believe that the further extension of exceptions could end up in nullifying the effect of the directive or, to put it differently, could end up by limiting, to a certain extent, the creation of an internal market in insurance mediation.
I still insist, and please forgive me for doing so in this way, that the resultant report includes several special features that certain countries have to ease the adoption of the directive.
For example, amendments relating to the tied agent that were designed to find a solution to ease the adaptation of legislation in those countries in which there is currently no regulation in this field.
There are, evidently, other formulas, and one of these was the one set out in the Commission proposal, and another that consists of my personal viewpoint stated in my original report.
However, neither the original formula nor my original proposal would be completely satisfactory to a good number of my fellow Members, who hold different positions, which is why compromise amendments had to be tabled that, I think, should resolve the problem reasonably clearly.
I would like you to be aware, ladies and gentlemen, that the result that is being submitted for your consideration is the outcome of a compromise between different points of view that, when seen as a whole, are acceptable.
It is only for this reason and out of respect for this compromise that the Group of the Party of European Socialists has decided not to table any more amendments, with the exception of three that are simply of a technical nature, that aim to correct inconsistencies in the text.
Clear proof of this fact is the refusal to table any amendments such as those tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, that were subsequently defeated at committee stage and with which I personally agreed, because these are not only in line with the main points of my original proposal, but they also seek to provide better consumer protection, something with which I will always agree.
Mr President, I feel that, as Mr Berenguer Fuster said, the Commission proposal fills a large gap in the internal insurance market which has been created by the huge development in insurance and reinsurance transactions recently, particularly relating to the insurance of specific interests, and here I refer to the major industrial and commercial risks, while the market for private individuals and other smaller risks has been left rather to its own devices, resulting in a sort of free-for-all.
We know how sensitive insurance mediation is, and our directive concerns precisely the mediation aspect.
That is why we found the Commission' s proposal both balanced and interesting, although possibly a little overcomplicated, which is why we have endeavoured to streamline it with a series of amendments - I am, of course speaking on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, which has drafted its opinion - to make the sector which does not focus primarily on insurance rather more mobile and marketable.
There are, in fact, many entities, such as travel and tour agencies, whose main activity is not insurance but which do sell risk and life insurance as part of their business. Such transactions clearly lie outside and are not bound by the usual conventions of professionalism and honour, by the extremely stringent and far-reaching requirements, that is, which guarantee precisely that good faith and reliability and credibility that should be high priority in insurance.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there are four points I would like to address.
The first is that the insurance business is based on trust.
Trust has a dual basis: trust in the product on the one hand, and on the other, trust in the other party's sales personnel and in their way of doing business.
It needs, then, to be said today that the absolute majority of all sales personnel and brokers do their work in a proper way; otherwise the insurance business would not be flourishing and justifying the trust placed in it by its customers.
Secondly, I would like to thank all those who have worked on this report.
Thirdly, many States' laws on insurance and banking already impose strict duties of consultation and information, which are binding also on brokers.
Insurers and credit institutions are subject to supervision and obligatory registration and to clear regulations on policy.
Quite independently of that, I share the directive's desire to guarantee the creation of a high professional standard for insurance brokers, to establish a single register for cross-frontier operations and to secure a high level of protection for insurance enterprises.
Over and above what has already been said, Mr Radwan and I have tabled three amendments - Nos 57, 58, and 59 - in which we intend, firstly, to have it left to the Member States to decide whether to exempt insurance brokers dealing in commercial risks from the requirements of the directive; secondly, to have the intermediary activity end with the conclusion of the contract, as is customary; and thirdly, to make a clearer distinction between those who work as insurance brokers as their main occupation and those for whom this activity is incidental to another.
Mr President, the PPE-DE Group broadly welcomes this long-overdue overhaul of the original 1977 directive as part of the single market in financial services, which utilises the financial passport or single licence concept.
This involves minimal harmonisation, the setting of professional standards and consumer safeguards as well as mutual recognition between Member States, to enable brokers to enjoy freedom of establishment throughout the Union with rules to ensure prudential care for the good conduct of their business.
I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Berenguer Fuster, on his largely cooperative cross-party approach in committee, appropriate to a technical report which provides quality assurance to the consumer.
It is worth noting that approximately 95% of European consumers use the services of insurance brokers and will be affected by this directive, along with 100 000 insurance practitioners in the Union.
The vast majority of areas of political difference were resolved in a series of compromise amendments, as well as those requirements due to the peculiar structure of the German industry.
I was delighted at the adoption of a large number of my own amendments, ranging from exemptions for the travel industry, to recognition of the role of the computer and the Internet and the future role of e-commerce for insurance, as well as safeguards for a three-yearly review of eligibility for registration, and protection for businesses located offshore outside the EU.
I hope this report will not increase the burden to intermediaries, in terms of cost or difficulty, or of conducting normal business practices, but will open up a competitive and transparent market throughout the 15 Union Member States, which ultimately, by providing volume and economy of scale, will provide real savings which will be handed down to the citizens of the Union.
Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking Parliament for the efforts to complete its first reading of the proposal for a directive on insurance mediation.
I would like to thank in particular the rapporteur, Mr Berenguer, and also Mr Ferri, for the quality of their work which has resulted in the recommendation submitted to this plenary.
The proposal for a directive on insurance mediation, scheduled in the action plan for financial services, is a key text to achieve a true internal market in insurance, in particular as regards retail markets.
Insurance intermediaries play a fundamental role in the sale of insurance in the Community and their importance would increase with the emergence of more complex and sophisticated insurance products.
Although the internal market in insurance has been completed as regards insurance undertakings, especially concerning the prudential rules, insurance intermediaries continue to be confronted with several obstacles which prevent them from taking full advantage of the freedoms of the Treaty.
The proper functioning of the internal market is therefore hindered.
I am particularly pleased that Parliament agrees with the essential objectives of the Commission's proposals.
It seeks to ensure that insurance intermediaries possess a high level of professional competence and that an intermediary, duly registered in his home Member State, may conduct his activities throughout the internal market.
The proposal also aims to guarantee the protection of customers by setting appropriate information requirements.
I now turn to the amendments submitted to the plenary session.
The Commission can accept the following amendments: Nos 1, 4, 5, 8, 9, 17, 28, 30, 37 and the second part of No 58.
It can also accept either partially or in their spirit the following amendments: 3, 7, 11, 21, 23, 24, 26, 27, 29, 32, 44 and 51.
Amendment Nos 15 and 16 may also be accepted in part.
The Commission is not, however, in a position to accept the other amendments tabled for the following reasons.
Amendment Nos 2, 10, 13, 14, 46, 47, 49, 52 and 57 aim to exclude from the scope of the proposal some activities such as those of travel agencies, veterinarians and persons acting on an occasional basis, and therefore these amendments cannot be accepted.
These exclusions would affect the sale of insurance products involving important risks and are therefore rejected.
The same reasons explain the non-acceptance of Amendment Nos 12 and 50.
The Commission considers that the term "insurance intermediary" is defined in an appropriate manner.
The scope of the directive is well balanced.
Amendment Nos 15 and 16 are therefore not necessary since the definition covers all intermediation activities, including those carried out by electronic means.
The same applies to Amendment Nos 19 and 25 which relate to sub-agents and also to Amendment Nos 20 and 58.
As regards the issue of "bancassurance", all forms of "bancassurance" activities should fall within the scope of the proposal.
It is an increasingly important way of distributing insurance.
Amendment Nos 18 and 22 propose a definition of "bancassurance" activities which only takes account of one of the possible forms that "bancassurance" may take.
They are therefore rejected.
There are amendments relating to registration and professional requirements of insurance intermediaries.
Amendment Nos 31 and 56 would imply less strict rules to cover professional negligence of insurance intermediaries.
They would jeopardise the objective of ensuring an appropriate level of professional liability cover for insurance intermediaries in the internal market.
Amendment No 33, 34 and 54 would affect the overall coherence of the proposal which is based on the principle of home country control.
Amendment No 35 and 36 concern complaint schemes and out-of-court redress mechanisms of the proposal.
Amendment No 35 is already implicit in the text of the proposal and is not necessary.
Amendment No 36 does not seem appropriate in the context of a directive since it contains a specific reference to a Commission recommendation which is not legally binding on the Member States.
Thirdly there are amendments referring to information requirements.
A key element of the Commission proposal is to ensure a high level of protection of consumers through the provision of appropriate information and advice.
Amendment Nos 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 55, 60 and 61 would compromise considerably this objective.
Finally, Amendment Nos 6, 45 and 48 which provide that non-registered persons excluded from the scope of the directive should comply with information requirements, would be extremely difficult for the Member States to implement in practice.
I am sorry to have talked so long about these amendments, but Parliament has a right to know what the Commission thinks.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
I have always had the childish ambition to have us finish at midnight.
Tonight we have missed it by only ten seconds.
(The sitting was closed at midnight.)
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
Mr President, I have two observations with regard to the Minutes.
The first is the least important: on the first point, with regard to the votes on request for urgent procedure, the first point voted on was on the fisheries agreement with Morocco.
I was here and voted in favour, but this has not been recorded in the Minutes.
I was here, and I spoke immediately afterwards.
I would now like to refer to the second point.
With regard to the Global Fund to fight HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, yesterday morning a deadline for tabling amendments was set for 10.00 a.m. this morning, in order that the debate may be held tonight, probably at the last minute.
The political groups were working yesterday in order to be able to table amendments, and today I see in the Minutes that the item has been added to the agenda of Wednesday 28 November and that the deadline for tabling amendments has been set for Thursday 22 November.
I would like to point out, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, that we cannot work upon the text submitted by the Commission, that we were working on yesterday.
There is only one version available in one language, and, in addition to this, in this language there are different versions of the same text with various discrepancies between them.
Lastly, to give just one example, and I shall finish on this note, Mr President, it states that the Commission is proposing a single contribution of 120 million, yet it does not state whether these are euros, dollars, condoms or DDT.
I think that the Commission should provide a text that is correct, tell us which of the texts is the final version, and make this available in all of the official languages.
We will make sure your vote is recorded.
Regarding the question of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, the documents are not ready, as you correctly say.
That was the reason why it was put back to 28 November.
That will also give the committee some more time to deliberate on the matter and make sure that the text is correct.
That was the basis for the reasoning and you are quite right to raise it.
Mr President, as someone who has consistently called in this House for an early report from the presidency on the progress of our own staff reforms, can I be the first to welcome the fact that we received a letter from the President yesterday on this subject.
It was an undated letter but I assume it was issued yesterday.
However, I should like to register again my concern that we still need more information.
Mrs Fontaine says in her letter: "I believe the time has come to provide all Members with the fullest possible details".
I am afraid this is not the "fullest possible details", since half of it is a letter to Mr Prodi.
I should like you to ask the Bureau and the presidency to give us in this House, as soon as possible, a comparison of the proposed personnel reforms in this parliamentary institution with the reforms proposed in the Commission.
And bearing in mind that on 28 October the Commission adopted their new personnel strategy, can we please have an early debate in this House with Mr Kinnock about his reforms and with the presidency about their reforms, so that Members can be properly informed.
We must have a chance to debate this and to understand why the presidency of this House is proposing in one instance radically different changes to those proposed for the Commission.
I, along with many other colleagues, am concerned about that different approach.
Mr Harbour, your point is well made and well understood by the Bureau.
The House is sovereign at the end of the day.
I will certainly pass on your message in the strongest possible terms to the presidency, so that the matter can be resolved.
I am sure everybody is aware that there is an ongoing discussion within the Commission itself at the present time.
Until the overall situation is clarified Parliament cannot come to any firm conclusions itself.
I do not have the letter in front of me, but in it the President has pointed out that the Conference of Presidents and the Bureau were fairly unanimous in the point of view they have adopted.
Parliament is sovereign, as I have said, and the matter will be open for further discussion.
There is no doubt about that.
(The Minutes of the previous sitting were approved)
European Research Area (Multiannual Framework Programme 2002-2006)
The next item is the joint debate on the following two reports:
(A5-0376/2001) by GÃ©rard Caudron, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the multiannual framework programme 2002-2006 of the European Community for research, technological development and demonstration activities aimed at contributing towards the creation of the European Research Area [COM(2001) 94 - C5-0087/2001 - 2001/0053(COD)];
(A5-0355/2001) by GÃ©rard Caudron, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a Council decision concerning the multiannual framework programme 2002-2006 of the European Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM) for research and training activities aimed at contributing towards the creation of the European Research Area [COM(2001) 94 - C5-0171/2001 - 2001/0054(CNS)].
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, before I begin my speech as general rapporteur for the Sixth Framework Programme on Research, I must first express my heartfelt gratitude to all those who have helped me in this difficult task. As you know, this is an important programme.
It has a provisional budget of EUR 17.5 billion, including Euratom. I would like to thank the Swedish and Belgian Presidencies, the European Commission, Commissioner Busquin, Mr Westendorp, the Secretariat of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, the ITER Committee, the administrators of the different groups, my assistant GaÃ«lle Le Bouler, the shadow rapporteurs of the ITER Committee, the draftsmen of the opinion, the shadow draftsmen of the committees consulted and the group coordinators.
I think that I am now in a position to declare that together we have completed a truly remarkable task. I am sure you will all agree with me on this.
You will express your view when we vote. I am sure that the result will not be the same as the outcomes of the votes on the Fourth, and especially the Fifth Framework Programme on Research and Development.
I believe that the results of our work can largely be attributed to two guiding principles.
Firstly, in my capacity as rapporteur I have always wanted to be the representative and spokesman for a broad majority in Parliament.
In addition, Commissioner Busquin was, from the start, willing to support the framework and the overall budget of the project.
In addition to this support, we have received many proposals for adjustment. These have resulted from our wide-ranging consultation with the European research sector, European politicians and all the organisations and citizens with an interest in the European research sector.
I can personally list more than 250 meetings, talks and discussions on this project and this report since the beginning of 2001. Furthermore, I have tried to ensure transparency during work on this project.
I have published all available information and views on the subject in real time on my website. In recent months, this website has been visited more than 3 000 times per month, excluding the summer holiday period.
Clearly, all of us, myself included, have agreed to set up a genuine European Research Area and all the necessary structures, including the Joint Research Centre, on the basis of the Framework Programme on Research and Development.
We have agreed too that we need to act upon the idea of European added value, as proposed by the European Commission.
But, at the same time, we have all declared that we should take into consideration another aspect of added value: the added value of giving research a European dimension.
This supplements the accounting added value of the European Commission.
As I have already said, we should not allow there to be any perception or feelings of exclusion, and we should back researchers who believe that their work needs to be carried out at a European level.
All this translates into two new, secondary priorities. Firstly, there is the fight against major diseases.
This goes hand-in-hand with research on the human genome, with its anticipated results for health. Secondly, we need to consider terrestrial and maritime transport.
The objectives here are to improve links between different means of transport, and to improve flexibility, security, efficiency, and coherence. In this regard, the quality and improvement of the environment are important considerations.
So far as the functioning of the framework programme is concerned, there are proposals to ensure that there is a smooth transfer between the old instruments of the Fourth and Fifth Framework Programmes and the Commission' s three new instruments. In addition, there is the fourth 'stairway of excellence' instrument.
Further, all this translates into a compromise on the specific programmes involved. The proposal is for a single programme with eight sub-programmes.
This will increase coherence while providing sufficient scope for participation and adequate control. There are also specific measures to improve professional life and mobility for researchers, while taking account of the requirement to strengthen the role of micro-enterprises and small and medium-sized businesses.
As regards the Euratom section, the majority of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy also agreed on the principles and the structure of the Commission' s text, especially regarding the need to ensure security of energy supply, risk reduction, and the processing of nuclear waste.
Lastly, the majority of the Committee on Industry agreed on the importance of research on nuclear fusion. They also agreed on the need to construct an experimental reactor soon, and for it to be located in Europe if possible.
This is necessary so that we may have some chance of meeting our energy requirements in fifty years' time.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament will today establish a firm and sound position after our first reading.
I am delighted that progress has not been hindered by what occurred on Monday evening. The situation where the adoption of my reports would have been dependent on the conclusions of the Temporary Committee on Human Genetics has been avoided.
By midday I hope that we will also reach agreement on ethical rules and on stem cell research on supernumerary embryos.
The vote today could also benefit the debate and votes to be held on the Fiori report during the November sitting in Brussels.
In this, we must be guided by common sense and tolerance and respect the views of others.
The result of the votes held by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy on 16 and 22 October has already been noted by the 'Research' Council of 30 October, judging by its final communiquÃ©. A new 'Research' Council will publish its common position next December.
I hope it will then be possible, through the codecision procedure, we will be able to reach a common decision by favouring informal discussions. I would not like to place a bet on our not needing to resort to conciliation.
We might or we might not.
However, I would like to reiterate this point: the sooner we finish our work in 2002, the sooner partners working in the research sector will be able to prepare and so ensure the best possible transition to the Fifth Framework Programme. Also, the sooner we finish our work, the sooner we will be able to develop international partnerships with candidate countries and associated countries, and pursue all our other international ventures.
I would like to finish where I began, by thanking all those involved in this splendid project. I call on the Commission and the Council to listen to us, and, more importantly, to ensure that they understand us.
Our demands are not unrealistic; neither are we engaged in politics here. They are proposals by European citizens, considered and debated at length.
We therefore call for them to be studied.
Further work will of course need to be undertaken when it comes to the final agreement, but for the moment we simply need to be free to define our own position.
I would like to conclude by reminding you of an objective set in January.
We set out to turn this work into an opportunity for a wide-ranging debate to strengthen the important link between science and society. We set out to convince people that, although science does not have all the answers, we cannot hope to tackle the world' s greatest problems without science, research and researchers.
I hope that our work will have made a positive contribution in this regard. I also hope that it will provide the Commission and the Council with proposals from the European research sector which will form the basis of a Sixth Framework Programme on Research and Development for Europe in 2002.
I really believe we should call it the Sixth Framework Programme.
The programme will be innovative, realistic, and effective.
It will be a firm foundation for the development of the European research sector, a sector we all support.
, draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets.
(DE) Mr President, I would like to express my thanks to the rapporteur, and also my gratitude for the debate he has stimulated.
He has really tried to make a reality of the wide-ranging citizens' debate of which he speaks.
He has tried to involve many people, within and outside Parliament, and in research circles, in order to have an intelligent discussion here and prepare a good compromise.
From the point of view of the Committee on Budgets, I must say, I support the rapporteur, but I am being pulled in two directions, because I at the same time have to announce that my group has misgivings and will not vote in favour of this resolution in its entirety.
I am here, then, primarily playing my role as draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets.
It has to be said on this point that the budget for this Sixth Research Framework Programme ranges between the right limits.
A slight increase was achieved, but at the same time the allocation was not exceeded, in other words the programme is, in budgetary terms, within proper and sensible limits.
I think we can achieve real European added value with this proposal.
We also had discussions with the Commission about possible simplification of the procedure, that also being one of our Committee's concerns, so that approval might be granted more quickly.
The Commission has made good proposals on this point, and we are very confident that this speeding-up of procedures can be achieved in order that the partners in projects can access their funds more quickly.
At the same time, our side urged once more that proper account should be taken of the smaller project partners and that smaller projects should not fall by the wayside in a slimmed-down procedure, because it is in the sphere of the smaller projects that a lot of important work has been done.
There is one bitter pill for our group above all others to swallow, and that is the issue of renewable energies and the issue of the Euratom resources.
Speaking from my group's point of view, I have to say that we have problems with the fact that renewable energies have not been developed as they should have been, and that too much has been approved, especially in the fusion field.
Mr President, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs on the Caudron report, I should like to offer the rapporteur our Committee' s congratulations and thanks for the job he has done, which was not a simple one.
His report provides a balanced discussion of all the main arguments on which the European institutions should concentrate their attention as regards scientific research and the potential for technological and social development.
The Committee on Freedoms particularly stresses the need for the public promotion of research to be done with the greatest possible transparency and involvement of the citizens.
A European knowledge-based society, like the one the Union is proposing, requires not only huge-scale initiatives in literacy, including scientific literacy, for all the citizens but also an increasingly intense, active involvement of the citizens in decisions regarding the direction that investment in this field should take.
Non-specialist citizens, in other words, should not just enjoy or, as is often the case, suffer the results achieved by science, but should also join with the experts in deciding on the objectives that research should pursue.
We believe the validity of a European science policy should be measured especially on this criterion.
The Caudron report quite rightly addresses these aspects.
I believe the Caudron report also invokes the transparent and democratic nature of decisions on scientific research when, instead of invoking principles of natural law, which are, in fact, only held by certain authorities, it refers, in the case of the ethical problems of research, to charters of rights, the documents which have effectively been approved and sanctioned by our Institutions.
This means, for instance, in the field of stem cell research, respecting the feelings of a large number of European citizens by ruling out the production of stem cells for research, but allowing research to be conducted on those supernumerary cells that would otherwise be destroyed.
On this and other matters I believe we should go with the Caudron report.
Mr President, the European Commission is proposing an appropriation of EUR 17 billion, fully recognising the importance of research and technological innovation in Europe.
Unfortunately, research projects today often do not achieve the hoped-for success which would allow them to compete at an international level, and the European Union does not hold enough attraction to lure back the top researchers who have chosen to work abroad.
The new scheme should bring in some changes: firstly, concentrate financial aid on a restricted, specific number of priority subjects for Europe; secondly, invite researchers to collaborate more closely; and thirdly, increase the mobility of researchers by creating a working environment in Europe that is attractive to them.
These priorities form the framework for the 42 amendments tabled by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, many of which have been incorporated, for which I thank the rapporteur and the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, which is competent in this matter.
These amendments concern employment, health and safety at work, access to work for the disabled, small and medium-sized enterprises and European Community research centres.
With regard to employment, we have seen an amendment adopted which seeks to extend research to the development of operating systems and computer hardware in Europe in order to increase employment and stop us from being so heavily dependent on the United States and Japan in this area.
This is a key sector for the new economy and would entail considerable risks for the sake of economic and employment growth.
Then we asked for action in the field of health and safety at work, in order to encourage access for the socially excluded and disadvantaged, such as people with disabilities.
Research support for small and medium-sized enterprises has also been accepted with very favourable terms, it has gone up from 15 to 30 %, and the same may be said of support for JRCs, which are to receive EUR 725 million.
In conclusion, Mr President, I must move in favour of approval, since science and research are there to serve the people, for that right to life that no one is entitled to jeopardise.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has worked intensively on the research framework programme.
We have submitted many proposals on sustainable development, food safety and other subjects, which were, thankfully, generally adopted by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy.
We focused on medical research, as we believed that it was in this area that there was the greatest need for change to the Commission's proposal.
The Commission's suggestion that only biotechnology should be promoted in the health context is too narrow.
Other research fields, too, promise much for health and need to be supported.
I thank Mr Caudron, the rapporteur, for his commitment to this as well, and also the shadow rapporteurs, in particular Mr van Velzen, for whom this was also a matter for concern.
It is regrettable that the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy could not follow us as regards the ethical boundaries of medical research.
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy spoke out clearly in favour of research and for the curing of illnesses, but also in favour of clear boundaries for the sake of human dignity.
In particular, our Committee demands the exclusion of exploitative research on human embryos from the research framework programme.
This ban is necessary not just because human life is involved, but also because we must counteract the danger of the female body being seen as raw material for industry.
Embryo research is not possible without women's egg cells being made available, and the donation of egg cells puts a woman under great strain and at medical risk.
It is for this reason that many feminists, too, are opposed to exploitative embryo research.
As I have said, the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy could not follow us down this road, and so, together with Mr Fiori, I have tabled an amendment that follows the line taken by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, which is also taken in the United States.
'Yes' to stem cell research, but 'no' to exploitative embryo research.
The Americans can be accused of many things, but not of being hostile to research.
I therefore ask for support for Amendment No 332, tabled by Messrs Fiori, Liese and others.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Caudron for his report. The Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport welcomes it for a number of reasons.
It particularly welcomes the fact that the report deals with a number of matters which concern our committee. These include the technology and methods used to convert products and works into a digital format, the protection and development of our historic and cultural heritage.
We are also pleased that it deals with drug taking, as our committee is also responsible for youth and sports. Other areas of concern contained in the report include the history of Europe, distance learning and mobility for researchers.
I regret that digital cinema, the cinema of tomorrow, has disappeared from this list. It might have required specific research.
I hope that specific programmes will be able to make good this omission.
I would also like to say that I am delighted the life sciences have been recognised as a scientific subject and are not regarded simply as an instrument for other sciences.
The life sciences constitute a distinct discipline and the fact that the Sixth Framework Programme has recognised this is a great step forward.
Perhaps the first title of the seventh thematic area: 'Cultural and social research' was the most appropriate.
I am sorry it has been changed to 'Citizens, democracy, social and political institutions' .
I think the first title was better.
If we had used the title 'Cultural and social research' , it might have been easier to include research on women, and not just research carried out by women, as in the paragraph 'Science and society' .
Mr Caudron, I regret the fact that research 'on women' and the thinking included in your intermediary reports were not retained in its final version.
I would like to finish on this point.
I have been involved in drawing up reports which have gradually transformed the notion of centres of excellence. The latter became the stairway of excellence.
We, the members of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, were very concerned that research should not be confined to an elite. Rather, when it comes to building the European Research Area, research should be shared amongst younger researchers, a range of relevant institutions, and universities.
I note that there have been adjustments here too.
I am glad that the paragraph 'Science and society' has doubled. The matter of research 'by women' is at the heart of this paragraph.
The Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities has an interest in this subject, but so does the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport.
Mr President, as draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, I submitted a series of amendments which principally endeavoured to enshrine the principle of gender mainstreaming in the Sixth Research Framework Programme, which is in any case the largest programme, for which we are voting approximately EUR 17 billion.
Concentration on other topics has meant, as Mrs Fraisse has already explained, that there has been less research into gender issues and less emphasis upon opening science and research to the full range of people with the right potential.
In 1999, 66% of the research workers in the State sector and 72% of those in higher education were men.
In only a few countries did the proportion of women exceed 40%, and that was in Ireland and Greece.
Only in Portuguese higher education, with 53%, was a balance achieved.
Women are particularly underrepresented, at 9%, in academic teaching posts in Germany.
The highest levels were in Finland with 36%.
It is therefore in the European interest and adds value if women are involved in research and teaching at every stage, from planning, via decision-making to project management, as well as in EU initiatives for prizes and competitions in all disciplines.
I had already demanded this in this House in connection with the McNally Report on women and science, and, in order to implement it, the Commission set up a Gender Unit, which now has some early successes to show.
Focused efforts have achieved a percentage of nearly 40% of women involved in the EU's research bodies and the same proportion receiving Marie Curie scholarships.
We must, then, build on the successes of the Fifth Research Framework Programme, one contribution to which might be the doubling of the budget in the 'Science and Society' subdivision, and here, too, there is a need for research into gender issues.
One final remark: In my language, the entire draft has to be revised in gender-neutral language, because we are setting the course for the future, above all for young women scientists.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should first of all like to address the rapporteur and congratulate him on the outcome, but also on the excellent working relationship.
You have found an innovative method, for which we are very grateful.
Needless to say, that also applies to the shadow rapporteurs, Messrs McNally, PiÃ©trasanta and Plooij-van Gorsel.
We worked well together.
I should also like to extend a word of thanks to my own fellow MEPs who have invested a huge amount of energy in this dossier.
This is truly a joint outcome, and I therefore hope that the Commission, as well as the Council, is prepared to take this outcome seriously.
Indeed, we have developed a structure by means of which, within the restricted margins available to us, everything has become clearer.
More emphasis has been placed on bio-sciences; a better link has been established between research on the human genome and related diseases; far more attention has been devoted to a coherent package of industrial policy, information society, nanotechnoloy, as well as aviation and aerospace.
Additionally, food safety has been accorded considerably more attention.
Furthermore, unlike the Commission, we have given transport a much higher place in our list of priorities, alongside more attention for energy.
Agriculture is also more involved.
In my view, the package is looking better now all in all.
The budget is also of major importance in my opinion.
We have expressly adhered to our pledge to the Council that we would not increase the budget.
We have slightly shifted the priorities.
We would therefore make an urgent appeal to the Council to accept our budget now and not to start bargaining, for we will then have a war on our hands.
Next, we should be emphatically aware that although the EU' s contribution to research in the Member States carried out by the national governments and industry is limited, it is still of fundamental importance.
If, specifically, the EU can play a complementary role, the added value will be significant.
Not for nothing did we include a fourth instrument to guarantee the smoothest possible transition between the Fifth and Sixth Framework Programme and to allow minor projects too to take place.
More than 15% has been set aside for small- and medium-sized enterprises, and that too is one of our priorities.
The decentralisation of the Sixth Framework Programme is important, but it is just as important not to weigh down the newly integrated projects, centres of excellence, with an enormous amount of red tape.
That is why I believe our amendments are excellent.
One final point: we have struggled greatly with the ethical principles.
Indeed, on the one hand, it is important to create a framework within which research is to take place, but on the other hand, it is important, by means of further research, to create space for solutions to be found for existing illnesses with a genetic hereditary factor.
Our greatest challenge was to strike that balance, and I hope that we have succeeded in this.
Mr President, I thank the rapporteur, Mr Caudron, and Commissioner Busquin, who have both helped us to work efficiently, as have the shadow rapporteurs.
The Sixth Framework Programme is the first implementation of the European Research Area, which itself is a consequence of the Lisbon Summit and its wish for us to have a successful knowledge-based economy, because of the strong correlation between research and development and economic success - inadequate in most EU countries outside Scandinavia, I should say.
We welcome the emphasis on looking for European added value, not scattering the limited funds over the whole range of research carried out.
So I am glad that we are now targeting cutting-edge research, particularly in areas like nano-technology, which will be very significant in the future.
There are, however, some gaps in the proposals which we wish to see filled. They include, of course, health, other than strictly post-genomic research, non-nuclear energy and land and water transport.
I come to international activities, because the research framework programme must look outside the EU as well.
It is essential that there is both earmarked money for international cooperative research - we suggest EUR 400 million - and mainstreaming across all the research, particularly on HIV/AIDS malaria and tuberculosis.
We must involve the countries that suffer from those scourges in the research.
The sums allocated in the Commissioner's proposal for science and society were inadequate.
We propose to double the spending on science and society.
We do not think that having one specific programme with one management will lead to transparency and adequate monitoring.
I therefore hope that our suggestion will ensure that we are able to have both openness and good management of each individual part of the programmes.
Although we welcome networks of excellence and integrated projects, we must maintain more familiar mechanisms at the early stages.
We must at all costs avoid the creation of scientific cartels.
I am pleased with the new mission of the JRC.
I served on Mr Davignon's panel and it is certainly consistent with the panel's views.
As far as the Euratom section of the Sixth Framework Programme is concerned, I have very grave doubts as to whether the ITER project will be implemented and my personal view - this is not the view of the rapporteur - is that extra funding is not therefore needed.
It will be available in any case.
The framework programmes are one of the big success stories of the European Union.
Let us build on their past success.
Mr President, I would first like to thank Commissioner Busquin for the way these proposals were prepared, for listening to the views of others and for his excellent collaboration.
I would also like to extend my sincere thanks to GÃ©rard Caudron. He listened attentively to all the political groups and to the shadow rapporteurs, and others.
We have worked very well together. I believe that he did everything he could have done.
Although there have been differences of opinion on some conclusions, the work was completed to a high standard.
My thanks also go to my fellow shadow rapporteurs.
In my opinion, this report on the Sixth Framework Programme on European Research is the big report of the moment, despite its faults. It has European added value, it is innovative as the Commissioner wished, it has networks of excellence and integrated projects.
We have a lot to do. We have also made significant progress on matters concerning young people, grants and women and preventing brain drains.
We cannot ignore all the innovative proposals in the Sixth Framework programme.
There are three issues of great concern to the Greens.
Firstly, the ethical questions. We do not want the European Union to fund the modification of the human genetic inheritance and the creation of human embryos for therapeutic reasons.
We also want to see a ban on financing research using supernumerary human embryos and the stem cells of supernumerary embryos.
From what I have heard, I think all the political groups will reach a compromise on these points.
Secondly, we would like to see an assessment of the effects of new technologies, like electromagnetic radiation for example, on populations, on health and so on.
Thirdly, we would like to achieve a fairer balance between research on renewable energies and research on nuclear energy.
I would like to reiterate the sentiments of Eryl MacNally. We do not want to see an increase in the nuclear energy or the ITER project budgets.
That is very long term.
We would however like research credits for renewable energy to be more on a par with those for nuclear energy.
Mr President, Commissioner, first of all, I want to emphasise that I am not speaking on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party.
There are a good few of our members who have genuinely attended to this issue, who are on the way here to our debate today but who will not perhaps be in time for the vote.
I personally believe that we shall be adopting too many amendments.
If we examine research programmes and research issues, there is scarcely any research programme in the whole of Europe that is so driven by politicians.
That is in total contrast to, for example, the assessment made by Manuel Castells - yes, it is legitimate to call him a sociologist - together with the Finnish philosopher Pekka Himanen as to why Finland is successful as an information society.
In their perhaps otherwise rather vague book, they observe that our technology and innovation policy are successful because we have a complete and autonomous centre for technical development.
That is something which I think invites reflection.
In other contexts, it is usual to applaud Finnish innovation policy.
I think that a certain lesson can be drawn from this.
In addition, I want to emphasise an aspect of this proposal that particularly bothers me, namely that the social research proposed would certainly be allocated to the wrong place, under the Information Society DG.
Social research does not belong in that context.
I do not properly understand how this has happened.
We are also aware that interest in research issues has, to a very large extent, revolved around stem cell research.
Today, we can adopt a position on the Caudron proposal in peace and quiet.
I personally view the committee' s proposal as being well balanced.
The committee' s proposal also shows the modesty and respect that is required when we debate research issues.
I think that those who say that we should now concentrate first and foremost upon stem cells from adults are not showing the required modesty faced with this new area.
In the course of the work in the Temporary Committee on Human Genetics, I learned that we know extremely little.
We must adhere to the old principles and proceed further within the various frameworks.
Furthermore, I learned that the research projects for both forms of stem cells are dependent upon each other. It must therefore be possible for them to be given the same priority.
That, I believe, is extremely important if we are to be able to move ahead as a successful society.
I hope that these comments are not too alarming, but that they lead to reflection on the part of all who are interested in our researchers' really being able to carry out good research.
Mr President, the amount of EUR 17.5 billion of EU membership funds will be used in the next few years on scientific activities through the framework programme.
The size of this sum indicates how significant the matter in question now is.
Codecision procedure removes power from the Commission and brings it to Parliament.
In this matter it is particularly well-founded.
There are good grounds to support Mr Caudron' s model on programme coordination and administration as well as informing and listening to Parliament in decision-making at levels more detailed than that of the framework programme.
The primary research areas selected by the Commission are well-founded as are also Parliament' s complementary priorities, which are not all mere information technology and artificial intelligence.
The health of a human being depends on what he eats.
It is justified to use funds to research the whole of the food chain.
The new biotechnology involves the ethical foundations of all kinds of life, and therefore technology must also be complemented by results from human sciences.
Science must not be dependent on the ethics of big corporations, and that is why it must receive public funding.
When the health of the environment depends greatly on energy production, several adjustments made by Parliament endeavour to improve the research into new forms of energy.
It would be justified to direct more funds into the research of fusion energy than what the Commission is proposing.
There is need to build a new Tokamak for the joint use of all Member States and Switzerland, Canada, Japan and Russia.
When funding is cut, this important project is delayed, further delaying the opportunity to produce energy by fusion power, which even in the current circumstances is going to be postponed by as much as fifty years.
When the framework programme was drawn up, not enough attention was paid to the activities of the Joint Research Centre of the EU.
It will also use scientific resources.
During the coming five-year period its position within the research community of the EU and its Member States must be clarified; research resources must not be wasted.
Mr President, I should like to express concern at the Commission emphasis on large integration projects, which would impact badly on small community-based enterprises as promoted within the framework of rural development programmes and research in the agricultural and associated food sector.
It is now clearly established that the EU-assisted programmes, such as Leader, have the potential to create sustainable employment in rural areas where more centralised programmes would have failed.
I do not have the time to concentrate on the need for ongoing research in the food sector and the potential of new technology in improving product diversification, quality and consumer satisfaction.
How soon can we expect a clear and definitive view on the potential or otherwise of genetic research as applied to practical farming?
Delays in this area are leading to confusion on the part of consumers and may well be depriving European agriculture of the tools necessary for sustainability, quality and competitiveness.
What have we learned from the recent scares such as foot-and-mouth and BSE?
Will we know what to do to avoid a repetition of the demoralising experience of a foot-and-mouth epidemic out of control?
Finally, and not for the first time, I want to express my concern about research on human embryos.
This Parliament must exercise the most stringent controls in that area.
Mr President, the Caudron report is threatening to become problematic from a Christian-ethical point of view.
Controversial activities should not receive active support from the Union.
Moreover, the community of values which, after all, the EU aspires to achieve, will definitely be at risk.
Intervening in life created by God is non-negotiable.
That must be the basic principle.
In this light, the funding of research activities on surplus embryos with Community money cannot be justified in any way.
Citizens would then be forced to contribute towards research which is punishable in a Member State such as Germany and which a number of national parliaments have declared themselves openly against.
Neighbouring countries of a Member State which apply less stringent rules find themselves facing a related dilemma.
A shift of European research to the relevant Member State undermines the effectiveness of the rules.
A situation should not, however, arise in which ethical differences are exploited as a competitive factor.
That could also lead to a brain drain.
In this respect, the establishment of one European Research Area will function as a catalyst.
That is why I make a serious appeal to you to support my amendments.
They aim to prevent this.
Europe must commit to finding a solution to this pending cross-border issue.
Has the Commission looked into this?
Finally, within the research framework of cross-border problems, it is not funding but cooperation which deserves a central role.
The funding of research into surplus embryos only complicates this cooperation.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I fundamentally welcome the Commission's proposal for the Sixth Research Framework Programme, above all the Europe-wide coordination and the emphasis laid on basic research.
Two points cause me concern.
The first is that, when it comes to the definition of fundamental ethical principles, the mind of this House is divided between, on the one hand, banning embryo stem cell research outright and, on the other, permitting it.
Where the boundary lies between a mere heap of cells and a human life is something we all no doubt have to decide for ourselves.
It is a choice with far-reaching implications, one to be made on the basis of conscience.
I would remind you, though, that research on embryo stem cells is prohibited in several Member States, including Austria.
To use EU funds to finance research in one Member State which would be banned in another is unacceptable.
The second thing that concerns me is that research funds totalling EUR 1.2 billion are being made available within the framework of the Euratom programme, over two-thirds of which go to nuclear research.
Safety issues play only a subordinate role.
I consider increased research into non-nuclear energy sources to be imperative.
I regret that there is no reference to it in this report.
- (EL) Mr President, the European Union's Sixth Framework Programme covers high-priority areas and areas of pioneering research from which we expect quantum leaps in science.
I should like to draw your attention to the pioneering area of research into the human genome.
This research is expected to have future applications in four areas of medicine: first, hereditary illnesses, secondly, the most common fatal illnesses, namely cancer, cardio-vascular and degenerative neural illnesses, thirdly, an understanding of the mechanics of various illnesses, which will lead to new, more efficient treatment and drugs and, fourthly, the prevention of disease.
New knowledge about human genetics will help us understand at which points genetic dynamics are vulnerable and open to environmental factors and pressure and the way in which we live, thereby allowing us to develop new strategies for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of the illnesses which I have already mentioned.
Stem cell research may well have new applications in treating illnesses such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's, leukaemia and many others.
However, the boundaries on research in these fields must be marked out if we are to avoid ethical problems.
This was the point of the amendment which I tabled together with Mr NisticÃ² and Mr Purvis.
This amendment will allow the pioneering research which I have described to progress while striking the balance needed in order to avoid ethical problems.
So we can look forward to the beneficial medical applications which this research promises.
I trust that the European Parliament will support the line being marked out and strike the right balance between progress and ethical considerations.
Mr President, I would like thank the rapporteur for his good method of preparation, in which he has been willing to take into account colleagues' views.
Several of us Members have been concerned about the possibilities of SMEs to participate in the framework programme, because the Commission' s original proposal does not make these opportunities concrete enough.
The Commission proposes so-called horizontal activities, in which it will be very difficult for small and medium-size enterprises to participate, at least at the initial stages.
Therefore it is necessary to make adjustments approved by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy to the direction that the already existing Craft programme arrangements will continue to take.
The same applies to preparation funds.
Enterprises have already become used to these measures, which have produced plenty of good results.
Why should a good arrangement be abolished?
Amendment No 265 concerns this matter.
A share of 15% funding from enterprises has been proposed.
Also this fact must be made concrete in the actual guideline funding schedules, when decisions on them are made at a later stage.
Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteur for his hard work and for the many additions to the Commission's proposals, particularly on health and disease and sustainable transport.
However, this was undermined in committee by what Mr Van Velzen has already referred to as the joint result.
The proposals on health and transport emerged very much weakened.
Our citizens will want to know why we want to spend more on space research than on sustainable transport.
It is not their priority.
On ethics in biotechnology, the proposals allow funding of research into the alteration of the germline of human beings.
This is unacceptable to mainstream science.
The Greens have tabled an amendment which is congruent with the position of most researchers in the field and this must be supported.
On stem cell research, the production of human embryos for research is unacceptable and it is very unacceptable to most of our citizens as well.
The Temporary Committee on Human Genetics has come to very useful conclusions here and its report should have been taken before this debate.
However, amendments have been tabled in line with its proposals and these must also be accepted by the House, otherwise we will be in deep conflict with our citizens.
As regards GMOs and plant genetics, the proposals that were adopted in committee would put genetically-modified foods on our table and will be forced on European consumers, quite contrary to what many want.
This is again a recipe for conflict and it was not in the Commission's proposals.
Regarding energy, equivalent funding for renewables and nuclear is required.
We have allocated over EUR 1 billion for nuclear funding and nowhere near the equivalent for renewable energy.
This again is completely unacceptable to our citizens.
If we are not to have a conflict between science and society, which the Commissioner has been very anxious to avoid, we will need to revise these priorities.
For example, proposals on fusion are out of date.
Both the US and Japan are pulling out of this research completely.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have before us a very important text, the substance of which will not only determine how the European Union applies research in practice, it will also set the tone for guidelines and practices in all the Member States, especially those like Greece which, to all intents and purposes, have no national research programme of their own.
One of the weak points identified in research in the European Union is its poor application and yet the European Commission's proposed overall budget does not respond to the need for a bold increase in funding and, unfortunately, the Committee on Industry, despite proposing research activities, has not increased the budget.
A second important point is orientation.
The draft before us leaves little room for free research which may not bring in results which can be directly applied in practice but which helps to increase our knowledge and acts as a basis for future applications.
This being so, we feel that the Committee on Industry's proposal to reduce expenditure on so-called priority 8 is not a move in the right direction.
This does not, of course, mean that we disagree with the seven thematic priorities proposed.
The third major issue is who is to benefit from funding.
The structure of the proposed programme is such that it benefits companies, both directly and indirectly, because the guidelines are tailored to their needs.
In our view, corporate research should be funded from company profits, not the public purse.
We are also afraid that small research teams will have trouble finding funding, although the Committee on Industry's amendments will help here.
One comment on the Euratom programme: whatever our reservations about the safety of nuclear fission, we need to be equally hopeful that the continuing debate will provide a long-term solution to the energy supply problem.
From this point of view, I welcome the fact that the Committee on Industry has recommended an increase in funding for the ITER reactor.
Finally, what worries me is that the so-called ethical issue has become much more important than it deserves and has even had a disorientating effect.
Public funding for research is no way to resolve this sort of problem.
It would be a serious oversight on my part if I failed to thank Commissioner Busquin and his staff and, of course, our rapporteur, Mr Caudron, and all the shadow rapporteurs on their tremendous work.
Mr President, Mr Caudron and Mrs McNally both mentioned the fight against AIDS, TB and malaria.
EUR 400 million have been set aside for this purpose, but the money appears in the budget under 'integration of European research' in Amendment No 339.
Could the Commission please tell me whether this means that the money can only be spent in Europe or whether it is possible to use this money to finance the pan-African malaria vaccine-testing network, which, unlike the EU, is ready to test the malaria vaccine now?
If the EUR 400 million can only be spent in Europe, can the Commission tell me whether mainstreaming will make it possible to fund the African network?
If not, I would urge Mr Van Velzen to reconsider accepting an oral amendment to Amendment No 339, which would place the EUR 400 million under international activities.
We are discussing a research programme which will end in 2006.
By then, if we do not finance the pan-African network, more than 400 million people may have died in sub-Saharan Africa and in other poor countries, and more than 50 years of development policy efforts are likely to be ruined by then.
This is extremely important, so even if Mr Van Velzen does not support this oral amendment, I hope that the plenary will.
Thank you, Mr President, and I should also like to thank the rapporteur. The Sixth Framework Programme for Research and Development is of crucial importance for the Member States and for the Union as a whole.
Research ought to be aimed at development.
This is how we must follow up the declarations made at the Lisbon European Council. We were charged with turning the European Union into the most dynamic and successful economy in the world, whilst also aiming at full employment.
After all, what use would research be if we did not make that our common aim? In my view, the preparation and adoption of the Sixth Framework Programme for Research and Development provides the ideal opportunity to implement this conclusion of the Lisbon Summit and to give substance to the European Charter for small enterprises.
Enterprises play an important role in disseminating scientific innovation. I am therefore delighted that substantial resources, substantial compared to the immense requirements of other areas, have been devoted to growing businesses, especially small businesses and craft industries.
We must support and encourage research and innovation in SMEs, and also facilitate access to the best technologies, including those of the traditional sector too.
It will then be possible for the enterprises to respond to the challenge of full employment.
I should, however, like to refer in particular to the biotechnology industry, to which we must pay special attention because it is involved with the science of living beings.
Regardless of the stage of its development, no human being, whether an embryo or an adult, should ever be used as material with which to treat another human being.
Funding research into embryo stem cells or supernumerary embryos would be contrary to the principle of human dignity. This principle is affirmed in several of the founding texts of the European Union and more recently, in the European Charter of Fundamental Rights.
Furthermore, such research is now no longer required because encouraging results have been obtained through the use of adult stem cells to treat incurable diseases.
Mr President, in line with Lisbon and Stockholm Summit declarations and with the report of this Parliament on the future of the biotech industry, the life sciences are a top priority of the Sixth Framework Programme.
This priority is upheld in Mr Caudron's excellent report.
Parliament must continue to be consistent and add its support to the progress which our scientists and researchers can provide.
Yet as representatives of the people of Europe, we in this Parliament must also define the limits which will provide an appropriate ethical context for this progress.
Genetic research promises much in preventing and curing many of man's most dreaded hereditary diseases.
But genetic engineering for this purpose must not extend into eugenics.
Embryo research must not lead to the deliberate creation of embryos for research, though we may accept that early stage supernumerary embryos genuinely resulting from in-vitro fertilisation, from spontaneous miscarriages or from therapeutic abortions for the mother's health, and which are destined for destruction in any case, can legitimately and ethically be available for research in Member States where there is strict regulation and supervision.
The amendment submitted by Mr Trakatellis, Mr NisticÃ² and myself - No 333 - seeks to restrict and define more exactly than the existing text where these limits lie.
I commend it to the Parliament.
Mr President, I will start by saying something about money.
The EUR 17.5 billion are in my view insufficient, above all when you consider the ambitious goals that Europeans are always setting themselves.
It is certainly far too little when you consider the imminent enlargement of the European Union.
These funds are one day to be invested for 25 or even more Member States, and that is not enough.
That, though, is how things are these days.
I hope in any case that the Council will approve at least these EUR 17.5 billion, or else, and here I agree with Mr van Velzen, there will be trouble.
European research policy is very much seen in terms of participation in the research programmes.
I want to vigorously urge the Commission to do everything possible to make the submission of applications and their processing easier, so that the researchers can spend their time on real research rather than on filling in forms.
My third observation is on fusion.
We wrangle about this over and over again, and I respect the different opinions that are held on the subject.
The only thing I cannot accept is that this research will not bear fruit for a very long time.
We urge the young to start early on providing for old age, even though, from a young person's point of view, old age is a long, long way away.
We are talking here about the same sort of provision.
Whether a fusion power station is eventually built or not, is for those who come after us to decide.
We should, however, give them the option.
I have always considered it very important that the European Union should concern itself with highly sensitive questions that had formerly been beyond our scope, for example, new methods of detecting and removing landmines.
It is fortunate that we have had a programme of this sort within the European Union for a number of years, and it has achieved noteworthy successes.
My heartfelt plea is that this programme should be continued, ambitiously developed and coordinated, if possible, by a single office within the Commission.
I am thinking here of the Joint Research Centre, whose achievements to date deserve to be highlighted.
An attempt is similarly being made, incidentally, to involve European Union research in the elimination of weapons of mass destruction, be they nuclear, biological or chemical.
I would remind you that the Commission will be making a statement this afternoon about the banning of biological weapons, which has to do with the fight against terrorism.
In the former Soviet Union, today, there are still enormous stockpiles of biological and chemical agents that cannot be destroyed for lack of the necessary funds and often also of the necessary technology.
This is an opportunity for the European Union to do something for the security of Europe and of the world.
As far as bioethics is concerned, I urge support for the proposal by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, which simply takes account of the different understandings of the law on this subject in the Member States, and we as European legislators cannot supplant the Member States on this point.
Such a respect for sovereignty is reflected in this proposal.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to endorse the congratulations and words of thanks to Mr Caudron.
Mr Busquin, the Sixth Framework Programme has the great ambition of establishing a European Research Area, and I truly hope that the small, yet excellent, research teams which we even have in the more peripheral regions will be able to play a role in this.
In European research, we must take a step forward both qualitatively and quantitatively speaking.
Female researchers must have a part to play in this and in the next few years, forge ahead to take up leading positions in the research programme.
Research which attempts to solve the mysteries of life remains important. That is not only applied research, but also fundamental research.
There is no doubt that bio-genetics will create new opportunities in future in the fight against incurable diseases, such as Alzheimer' s, Parkinson' s and some forms of cancer.
Within the parameters set out in the Caudron report, particularly in Amendment No 22, and under strict ethical supervision, including that of parliaments, we are of the view that it must be possible to finance stem cell research within the Member States' legal framework.
It is of the utmost importance for us to outline this ethical framework and for the European Parliament and the Member State parliaments to follow the developments in this field, for we must avoid at all cost that everything is allowed for some, as long as it is commercially viable, while nothing is allowed for others.
We must be led by our conscience to jointly outline this framework, even if we fail to see eye to eye on this matter.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, the Italian radical members unreservedly support the Caudron report and congratulate the rapporteur on bringing such a difficult and significant task to a successful conclusion.
The task is significant because it opens new horizons for European research.
This is sorely needed, because our research is stagnating, our continent and our Union are not at the cutting edge. By this, I mean scientific research and research in many other essential fields, not only scientific progress, but also employment, which are beneficial to the economy and to the progress of human kind.
From this perspective, we are particularly pleased with the position adopted by the Committee on Industry regarding research into human genetics. Tremendous progress has been made everywhere and more is being achieved every day.
Researchers and scientists are working away in laboratories. They are responsible individuals, not at all unbalanced, as many believe.
They hope very soon to make it possible for untold millions of human beings to escape a dreadful fate. These people would then be able to resume a normal life and regain their dignity as human beings.
Diseases such as Alzheimer' s, Parkinson' s, diabetes, cancer and cardiovascular disease constitute vast research areas still to be explored. I have in mind stem cell research in particular.
The Caudron report presents us with this new challenge, which is dealt with in depth.
Since Galileo, ever since time began in fact, scientific progress has always challenged the established order.
Indeed, given that it ushers in a new order, the one previously in place is bound to collapse.
Nonetheless, certain Members of this House have voiced their opposition to all this. They are trying to prevent what I believe is obvious progress.
In any case, even if Parliament rules against the report, progress will continue.
Clearly, millions and millions of human beings are at risk and threatened with death. There is, however, a strong chance that these new technologies could produce cures or improved treatments.
This is why I say yes to the Caudron report, yes to the hope that European research may rise to the challenge presented by the United States and other world economies. With this in mind, we should invest in European research capable of taking our values to even greater heights.
Our scientists must be allowed to work in the most promising domain possible, namely embryo stem cell research. Frankly speaking, this is the issue which will very shortly highlight the rift between us.
Ladies and gentlemen, the future is at stake here.
It cannot be held up because it is already upon us.
Sooner or later it will overcome.
Mr President, I want first to express my thanks for the exciting, inspiring and business-like work in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy.
It has been a delight to participate in the work on the framework programme.
I also want to thank Commissioner Busquin for the way in which he began the discussion with new ideas about the European Research Area.
I have seen how the ideas floated by the Commissioner have taken root in the countries of the EU and created a new dynamic of a kind we had not known before and which I would to a large extent ascribe to the Commissioner' s initiative.
I am very pleased about the opportunities under the framework programme also to involve countries which do not directly receive aid from the European Union, for example, even Iran and Taiwan can participate, to cite two extremes, if the countries themselves pay and if we find that they add value to the programmes.
That means exchanges involving young people in areas that are important for the future.
It provides the opportunity for new creativity and new understanding within research, something that will be very valuable, especially in the world of today.
With regard to nuclear research, I believe that Europe should promote this in areas which can contribute to our actively participating in the elimination of weapons of mass destruction, weapons grade plutonium, etc. We have facilities.
We have knowledge that can be made use of.
The international mood today is such that there is now a possibility of having these things destroyed.
Let us make sure that they are destroyed, and allow Europe to take part in their destruction.
Finally, I hope that the Commissioner, together with his Director-General, will take the lead when it comes to the simplification that is necessary if small and medium-sized companies, together with university departments, are happily able to participate in the programme without experiencing financial difficulties.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for the Sixth Research Framework Programme is an ethical minefield.
Amendment No 22, providing for Community funds for embryo research, is utterly unacceptable, being a flagrant offence against human dignity.
Embryos must not be degraded to the level of being research material.
Embryo research is banned in four Member States, including Germany.
We must not permit the use of Community funds to finance something that is punishable in these Member States.
Even research on embryo stem cells would offer an incentive to create even more surplus embryos, and we decisively reject it for that reason.
The proposal even offers support to germline therapy.
This would mean the European Parliament distancing itself, politically and scientifically, from the rest of the world, for nobody in the scientific community is demanding or promoting germline therapy, far from it, they are calling for it to be outlawed.
So I ask you to let us clear these ethical mines from the research framework programme and make the programme we adopt a responsible one.
Mr President, first of all I too should like to thank Commissioner Busquin and the rapporteur, Mr Caudron, for the excellent work that has been done with a view to the approval of this Sixth Research Framework Programme.
This document is, I believe, so excellent and innovative that it is almost a sin that the debate in Parliament should concentrate on ethics and the use of stem cells, important though that issue may be, while losing sight of all the novel, highly significant elements present in this Sixth Framework Programme.
I believe that identifying the eight priority thematic areas for research is an innovative, important and positive idea; there is, however, a danger that small and medium-sized European enterprises might be excluded from the identification of areas structurally more suited to large businesses.
Mr Caudron' s proposal of the instrument of the stairways of excellence seems to me to be a valid compromise, and I therefore agree with it, although I still ask the Commission and the Commissioner always to pay the greatest attention to the requirements of small and medium-sized enterprises.
The danger that European research funds might end up being monopolised by large companies, which, by definition, are those that perhaps need them least since they patently already have the capacity to propose and run research programmes, is still very real.
If, however, we wish to build that knowledge-based society that was sketched out in Lisbon, research must permeate our whole society and therefore impinge, first of all, on small and medium-sized European enterprises.
Lastly, to conclude, a remark on the Euratom programme: I agree with the appropriations proposed in the report; we need to give the green light to the ITER project, which must not, however, be confused with the nuclear power schemes we know today.
Here we are talking about research and the future of clean energy.
Mr President, first of all I should like to thank Commissioner Busquin for his extraordinary commitment and for the enthusiasm he has managed to raise in the European Parliament for the creation of a European Research Area.
I should also like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Caudron, as well as the shadow rapporteurs, Mr Van Velzen and Mrs McNally, for their contributions and the respect they have shown towards those individual Members who have sought to improve this framework programme with their amendments.
The text originally proposed by the Commission has been considerably supplemented and rejigged, now both specifying more clearly the research priorities in Europe in the various sectors and rejigging the initial financial architecture.
With regard to the biomedical sector, I must express my satisfaction with the EUR 500 million increase given to biomedicine, not just for genome and post-genome research but for all research aimed at adding to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms at the basis of diseases as well.
I should like once again to affirm a fundamental idea already expressed by Mr Trakatellis, which is that no research in Europe can be more important or deserve greater priority than that which concerns people' s health and their physical and mental suffering.
That is why I now ask Commissioner Busquin, on behalf of the whole scientific community and of a number of Nobel prize-winners, such as my friend Renato Dulbecco, Rita Levi Montalcini and John Vane, to maintain this increase in funding for biomedical research for the next five years.
Through scientific research we can at last, thanks to new technologies, combat terrible, hitherto incurable diseases such as cancer, AIDS, Alzheimer' s, Creutzfeld-Jakob disease, heart disease and so on, not least by using advanced technologies, as specified, for instance, in the Trakatellis, Purvis and NisticÃ² amendment, which embodies a good balance that should gain the consensus of the whole House.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by thanking GÃ©rard Caudron for his difficult work.
As we might say in German, it is easier to guard a sack of fleas than draw together the different interests in this House, and I would therefore like to express my sincere thanks for his successful efforts in this regard.
With the research framework programme, we want to make a contribution to enhancing the competitiveness of European industry.
We want to underpin and support our European policies through research.
However, we also want to bring research closer to citizens.
I am pleased, therefore, that in this latter area, we have been able to make some improvement to the Commission's proposal through three important steps.
As part of this process, it is important, in my view, for us to ensure that research complies with the principle of sustainable development as set out in Article 6 of the Treaty of Amsterdam and the Gothenburg Council Conclusions.
We must bring ecological criteria into line with social and economic criteria, and so it is only right and proper that research should be subject to this principle too.
This is reflected in a number of the amendments relating to energy and sustainable transport.
I also think it is important, and necessary, to interconnect research and society, firstly by examining every research project to determine the effect of research on society: in other words, by carrying out technology impact assessments, and secondly, by actively including citizens in the research dialogue and strengthening this dialogue between research and society.
It is only right and proper, in my view, for us to increase the available resources in this area.
The third building block to bring research closer to citizens is undoubtedly to enhance the opportunities available to SMEs, universities and small research institutions for participation in this process, as they, of course, offer great potential for innovation, and many people, many Europeans, are involved.
We must therefore ensure that the processes are simple, transparent and speedy, and above all, that those who are rejected also receive a response which signals that researchers are taken seriously.
If we are able to realise these three dimensions: sustainability, dialogue between research and society, and an effective approach to SMEs, then, I am sure, research will find a place not only in the minds of Europeans, but also in their hearts.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to begin by thanking the Commissioner for his outstanding work.
Of course, I would also like to thank our rapporteur, Mr Caudron, for his two excellent reports.
I would like to express my appreciation of the positive and constructive cooperation within the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy as well.
I too found this a very enjoyable experience, thanks, not least, to the sterling work carried out by our shadow rapporteur.
I would like to raise two issues.
Firstly, genetic research: genetic and biotechnology offer great opportunities in medicine and the environment, and it is certainly right to give massive support to these areas at European level.
However, as soon as human embryos become the subject of research, I believe that for ethical reasons, clear limits must be set.
Some Member States, including Germany, have banned the use of human embryos for research purposes, and this naturally includes associated activities such as the cloning of human life.
I think that our consideration and respect for other Member States make it incumbent on us to exclude activities which obviously raise serious issues of ethical responsibility from joint European research funding, and I therefore urge this House to vote for Mr Posselt's Amendment No 334 or Mr Liese's Amendment No 332.
The second issue which I would like to address briefly is fusion research.
I wish to voice my clear support for the funding of fusion research.
I believe that nuclear fusion can be developed as a future-proof technology.
It produces virtually no carbon dioxide emissions which impact on climate.
It also produces very little in the way of radioactive waste, and in particular, in contrast to nuclear fission, has no significant harmful effects over the long term.
In this respect, we Europeans should take the opportunity afforded in this area, in which we have a unique status worldwide - to continue appropriate research. We should not cut the budget but leave it, at least, at the level originally proposed.
Mr President, as someone who suffers from a neurological complaint, to wit Parkinson's disease, I am naturally biased in this matter, but I am a little shocked by the frequent use of terms like 'unacceptable' and 'dignity' applied to people who wish to find a solution through medical research to the terrible problems facing those who suffer from neurological disease, such as Alzheimer's, motor neurone and Parkinson's.
There is no dignity in dying of motor neurone disease and there is precious little dignity in suffering from Parkinson's either.
So I want to commend to the House the view of the sufferer as well as the view - if there is to be one - of the person who is concerned above all about preserving the embryo.
If I thought that an embryo had the same human rights as a child or an adult human being, I would not, of course, not be in favour of anything that meant the destruction of human life.
But the laws of our Member States by and large accept that there is a difference between an embryo, a fertilised egg and an adult or child who is already a human being.
The human rights of the one are not quite the same as the human rights of the other.
That is what the law says in most of our Member States.
I do not believe that the founder of the Christian religion, who set great store by healing the sick, would inhibit those who simply want to cure sick people.
I cannot believe that this is the intention of the Christian ethic.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to begin, of course, by congratulating the rapporteur Mr Caudron.
I know from experience how much work is involved in bringing a framework programme to a conclusion, at least in draft form.
We will now formally adopt this programme today or tomorrow.
It is a time for great words, and great words are needed.
I would also like to take this opportunity to express my thanks for the cooperation with the Commission.
Paper does not blush, however.
We will have a good programme, but the work is only just beginning.
What are we going to do with all these objectives set out on paper?
How will we achieve these goals?
At the moment, this is written not so much in the stars as in the heads of the civil servants or, indeed, the Commissioner.
We therefore urgently need more precise details of this entire project.
We urgently need the specific programmes.
That is the first point.
We also urgently need further cooperation with the Commission if these specific programmes have to be amended by this House.
The second point is this: there is no sense in allocating EUR 17, 18, 16 billion - the figure has not yet been finally decided - if these funds are not used where they are most needed, that is, in the universities, in industry, and in the SMEs.
It is therefore vital to ensure that the rules governing participation in this framework programme are practicable, in line with the realities of the research world, and meet the needs of companies seeking to develop their innovations on the basis of this funding.
After all, we should not forget that research and innovation are not ends in themselves.
The purpose of research and innovation is to bring products to market and improve our competitiveness.
This can only be achieved if there are significant levels of participation, if the allocation instruments are transparent, and if everyone, from Finland to Sicily and Greece, knows what his or her position is.
The real work therefore starts here, not only for the Commission staff but also for us.
After the framework programme means before the next framework programme, but, above all, it means during implementation.
This House must therefore look very closely to determine how much continuity exists between the Fifth and Sixth Framework Programmes, how reliable the instruments used by the Commission are, and how this money is spent.
We will also carry out an ex post audit.
Thank you very much. I look forward to further years of cooperation.
Mr President, I am in favour of research.
We all want to find cures for illness and I am sure that in each of our families we have personally experienced the sadness of incurable disease.
Over the past year in the Temporary Committee on Human Genetics and Other New Technologies we discussed various ways of finding answers to these medical problems.
We voted last week to support the funding of uncontroversial stem-cell research using placenta, umbilical cord and adult stem cells.
We voted with cross-party support to ban funding of research resulting in the destruction of human embryos, any kind of cloning, the use of surplus embryos and germline intervention.
The majority, therefore, in the temporary committee, whose aim it was to draw up ethical guidelines for the European Union, rejects the research funding suggested in the Caudron report.
EU funding should not be promoted for controversial research, banned in four Member States, my own country included.
Respect for the dignity of the human person is a fundamental principle upheld in all European and international agreements.
I urge that we do not desert this principle.
Many citizens, myself included, believe that there is a more acceptable, ethical and moral way forward than the one which leads us to destroy one innocent human life in order to cure another.
I urge you to reject the funding suggested in the Caudron report.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, research policy is one of the areas in which we clearly need more involvement by Europe.
Munich is one of the most modern locations for research in the European Union, and Franz Josef Strauss set a course 30 years ago which has ensured that there is still an aerospace industry today.
As a location for research, Munich has never suffered from the fact that research policy has always set clear ethical limits.
On the contrary, these clear ethical limits include banning research on embryo stem cells, the import of embryo stem cells and the creation of embryos for research purposes, for such techniques are nothing but cannibalism.
Even if human life is saved through the killing of other human life, I believe this is ethically unacceptable.
It is cannibalism.
I am delighted that in all its decisions since 1988, since the Ghergo report, the European Parliament has adhered to this position by a clear majority and that the German Bundestag's Study Commission adopted this line, also with a clear majority, on Monday evening, referring in this context to the Fiori report which we adopted last week by a substantial majority in our Committee on Human Genetics.
I think it would be most regrettable if this important, high-quality research framework programme were associated with any attempt to undermine the European Parliament's clear ethical line on embryo protection and the protection of human life.
I urge to you to vote for the Scallon/Posselt amendment, and if this is not adopted, to support the Liese/Fiori compromise amendment and reject all the other amendments on this issue.
The European Parliament's reputation is at stake: a reputation associated with its position, for more than 10 years, at the forefront of those who strive to protect human life.
Mr President, the sixth framework research programme is a serious and fundamental attempt by the European Union to achieve its strategic objectives, that is, to become the most competitive knowledge-economy based area in the world over the next ten years.
It will also help it to benefit from progress being made in other corners of the world, while helping it to contribute towards the development of mankind.
We all have to meet this challenge, at both European and national level.
This means bold funding for research in all sectors, coordinating research at European level, in contrast to the current fragmentary approach, and disseminating it throughout the economic and social fabric.
Our success in achieving our political and development objectives will depend directly on how we use the results of research for the benefit of the health and quality of life of our citizens, full employment and social cohesion.
I should like to focus on the need for research in the social sector.
Our development depends first and foremost on the viability of our social model.
The social agenda which we have adopted and are currently applying is the basis for this policy.
Economic and social change has led our economy and society into an impasse.
Ageing, widespread poverty and social exclusion, large numbers of accidents at work, the need to successfully integrate large groups of citizens such as the Roma, the need to integrate the disabled into the job market, the constant need to help women enter the job market, new risks to employees' health and our increasingly multicultural society in Europe are such that we need scientific research on which to base our policy over coming years.
This will encourage European countries with no tradition of social research, which are the very countries which face the worst development problems.
Finally, I should like to stress the need for public information and consultation on all our research objectives.
Research in all sectors, from biotechnology to social research, is carried out a long way from the ground, in closed laboratories or study firms.
Our citizens are unable to read the articles not just in scientific journals, but also in the broadsheets.
We need to make an effort to ensure that information is provided on a systematic basis.
Mr President, the report and the framework programme have been extensively modified since they were first presented to this Parliament.
Citizens should be aware of this extensive transformation, so that they can see the good cooperation between the institutions.
I think that this is due, to a large extent, to Mr Caudron' s flexibility and capacity to listen, and this is also true of rapporteurs from other political parties, such as Mr Van Velzen, who has been listening throughout and welcoming the amendments and various suggestions from all Members.
I have never worked in a committee where all requests have been treated in this way and incorporated.
I would like this spirit to be maintained throughout the implementation process, because it is clear that this is a European project that needs to continue growing and expanding.
I also have to say that this journey has been carried out on the basis of a policy that aims to reduce work, reduce the work of the committee and to create fewer projects, but larger ones, and Parliament has been able to break down this centrality with regard to large projects, large companies and various research programmes that are essentially covering work that on many occasions is quasi-public with regard to the large research centres or large industries, such as the aeronautical industry.
Parliament has been able to open this project up in more directions, extending its range of priorities to territories that, up until now, were not covered or that were not considered important.
There are various innovations which citizens should be aware of: one of these, the most important one in my opinion, is the introduction of a fourth instrument.
Introducing a fourth instrument means opening the door to smaller projects, facilitating the entry of SMEs and making the European Research Area a possibility, for Europe comprises many small States and Research Centres.
The average European team has no more than six people, whilst an American team consists of 24 people.
Europe needs protection measures and incentives that are suited to its dimensions.
Europe is still a collection of individual initiatives.
For this very reason, the escalier d' excellence seems to be very effectively set out in Amendment No 305.
We have also introduced important aspects of relevance to culture.
Cultural heritage belongs to the world of non-renewable resources.
When the tomb of a mediaeval King disappears, with its costumes and clothing, or when we lose track of a wrecked ship at the bottom of the sea, new technologies have to be used to recover these relics.
Architecture, engineering, the structure of buildings, are all in the realm of science.
We have supported the safeguarding of cultural heritage and we think that the European Union should also continue to do so.
Thank you for your speech, Commissioner Busquin.
I believe everybody here would like to thank you just as warmly for the very proper manner in which you have conducted your relations with our institution.
Mr President, since the Commissioner has now indicated that he will be adopting so many of Parliament' s amendments, I have one pertinent question for the Commissioner.
Does that also mean that you will now first be fine-tuning the specific programmes which you have drafted earlier before they can be discussed in Parliament?
Obviously, it follows that in the next few days specific programmes will be adjusted to bring them into line with any amendments adopted.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
EU/Latin America relations
The next item is the report (A5-0336/2001) by Mr Salafranca SÃ¡nchez-Neyra, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on a global partnership and a common strategy for relations between the European Union and Latin America [2000/2249(INI)].
Mr President, on a point of order, I would like to bring to your attention, and I hope this will not take up part of my speaking time, that I have received no news relating to the absence of the Commissioner responsible, Mr Patten.
I was wondering whether the presidency had received any news of his absence and if it could provide any information.
I cannot see the Commissioner here, which is very strange because he always comes to debates on foreign policy when he can.
I would like to know whether the presidency or the Commission have any information that justifies, as will surely be the case, the absence of the Commissioner responsible, Mr Patten.
Mr Salafranca, from the point of view of the presidency I cannot answer your question.
The Commission is, however, present in the person of Commissioner Bolkenstein, who will, of course, speak on behalf of the Commission at the end of the debate.
I do not know whether Commissioner Bolkenstein intends to answer your question straight away.
Commissioner.
Mr President, my colleague, Mr Patten, is at present in New York attending the General Assembly of the United Nations.
I hope that Mr Salafranca SÃ¡nchez-Neyra will take this as sufficient apology for his absence and that he will be happy with the answers I give him and other Members in the debate that follows.
I shall certainly do my best.
Thank you, Commissioner Bolkenstein.
I think Mr Salafranca, like the rest of us, has been given a clear and satisfactory answer.
Mr President, I would like to thank both yourself and also Mr Bolkestein for his kindness and his cooperation.
I naturally understand the reasons he has given for Mr Patten' s absence.
As you all know, the Heads of State and Government of the European Union, some time ago, in June 1999, decided to form a strategic global partnership between the European Union and Latin America.
More than two years have passed since that date and the truth of the matter is that we have to admit that no great progress has been made in reaching this objective set by the Heads of State and Government.
This, Mr President, is precisely the reason why the European Parliament has wanted not only to discuss, but also to adopt an own-initiative report in order to add fuel to the debate on the next summit, the second of the Heads of State and Government, which will take place next spring, and present a document that could offer a strategic vision with regard to these relations, in order that the European Union will not arrive at this summit empty handed, at least with regard to the responsibility of our institution.
I would like, in the first instance, to praise the spirit of cooperation that the political groups have shown me during the production of this report, which has been approved by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy by an overwhelming majority (48 votes for, 0 against and 2 abstentions).
I would also like to thank the committees who were asked to give their opinion for their cooperation.
In this report, Mr President, we are asking for something of fundamental importance: that is that, just as the European Union has a common strategy for relations with Russia, with the Balkans, with non-EU countries in the Mediterranean or with the Ukraine, it should also have a common strategy for relations with the countries of Latin America.
This strategy, Mr President, in my opinion, should involve three aspects: in the political sphere, a revision and updating of the biregional agenda; secondly, a renewal and updating of political dialogue at ministerial level; and thirdly, the constitution of a transatlantic, Euro-Latin American assembly, through the signing of a Euro-Latin American charter for peace and the implementation of a Euro-Latin American political and security partnership.
In the economic, financial and commercial field, Mr President, we think that the European Union should complete the agreements that are currently under negotiation with Mercosur and Chile.
These agreements need to be concluded in a balanced fashion and, naturally, as quickly as possible, depending on their own merits.
We think that there can be no distinction, at least from the European Union' s point of view, between first- or second-class countries or groups of countries.
For this reason, we are asking the Commission, in the medium term, to put forward some negotiation guidelines with the aim of reaching new agreements with the Andean Community and with the countries in Central America.
I am talking, Commissioner, about the short and medium term, given that in the short term we believe, here in the European Parliament, that the facilities granted by the Community Generalised System of Preferences have to be maintained.
In the same respect, Mr President, we are asking for the implementation of a global interregional association agreement that can give institutional support and total geographical coverage in relations with the subcontinent, in order, amongst other things, not to be second rate when compared with the developments that are being made in the United States.
We are also requesting the creation of an area of shared prosperity through the strengthening of regional markets between now and the year 2010.
I would like to add, Mr President, that it is a shame that there should only be one country in Latin America which, although we have diplomatic relations with it and apply the Community Generalised System of Preferences to it, is not linked to the European Union by means of an agreement.
I am, naturally, referring to Cuba.
For this reason I think that - in the spirit of the doctrine of the European Union in general and in the spirit previously adopted by this Parliament in the Newens report in particular, we should seek a formula which, within the framework of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, would allow us to progress in order to find an institutional formula in our relations with this country.
In the social and cultural field, Mr President, we are proposing an emphatic and ambitious development cooperation policy in the social, culture, education, emigration, internal affairs and justice fields, with a whole series of concrete initiatives, that I will not explain here right now for lack of time.
Mr President, I believe, and I think that my fellow Members believe the same, that the commitments made at the Rio Summit and the whole strategy formulated around the new commitment with Latin America should take shape as quickly as possible and give a strong impetus to relations with this region, although this should not be done to the detriment of economic sectors and the civil society.
The next summit of Heads of State and Government will have to result, in our opinion, in a palpable success, sending a clear message with regard to this new European commitment with Latin America.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating Mr Salafranca SÃ¡nchez-Neyra on his clear and comprehensive report.
It is indeed time for the European Union to revise its strategy on relations with Latin America.
There is still a great deal of room for improvement, especially in the field of economic cooperation, and for us Socialists, this also includes Cuba, a country with which we must finally commence negotiations on a framework agreement, without any preconditions.
Economic cooperation must include and take account of appropriate social and ecological minimum standards; after all, we do not want to worsen the social inequalities in Latin America but help to defuse them, for these countries are still marked by massive variations in social conditions.
There are wealthy industrialised enclaves surrounded by regions with crippling poverty.
We therefore also call, in the field of structural development, for measures to achieve sustainable economic development which promote SMEs in particular.
Above all, wherever it is necessary and appropriate, the groups concerned and civil society, especially indigenous ethnic groups, must be included from the planning stage onwards.
This applies especially to the Puebla Panama project.
The European Union should only participate in this project on the basis of clearly defined substantive agreements.
Technology and knowledge transfer, but also the opening of the European market to the partner countries' products, are further steps which must be taken quickly.
This House wants an equal economic partnership with the citizens of Latin America, not just with a handful of major corporations.
Mr President, the terrorist attacks of 11 September have finally brought it home to us that global crises have global consequences and that the European Union can no longer afford any eurocentrism.
This does not mean downgrading the importance of EU enlargement and the stabilisation of the Balkans; it simply means that the Rio process must not suffer the same fate as the Barcelona process or the policies on the Mediterranean.
It should not take a terrorist attack for us to give relations with these marginal areas of Europe or the Latin American region, a region which has strong historical and demographic links with Europe, the attention they deserve.
The European Parliament's own-initiative report by Mr Salafranca is therefore timely, coming as it does in advance of the Rio follow-up summit in Madrid in May next year.
We need to develop a strategy and give greater priority to our policies on Latin America at every level in order to combat poverty on this continent, consolidate democracy, tackle organised crime and drug trafficking, and, finally, to protect our economic interests.
The conclusion of the association agreement with Mexico has had a positive impact on the European business presence in that country, which has benefited both sides.
The association agreement with Chile will, we hope, be signed in Madrid in May.
Unfortunately, the negotiations with Mercosur are not progressing as smoothly. I hope that in this context, the Commission and the European Parliament will do their utmost to overcome the hurdles concerning Argentina and Brazil.
Free trade is not a one-way street, and more or less concealed protectionism should be a thing of the past.
We must also increase awareness of the Latin American region.
The establishment of a Centre for European and Latin American Studies would be a welcome step.
What Latin America needs, however, are not only association agreements but general strategies to promote an investment-friendly climate, and this can only be achieved if there is political stability and an end to capital flight.
Not every dollar earned should be transferred directly to Miami.
Mr President, the Salafranca report comes at an opportune moment.
The implementation of a global partnership and common strategy with Latin America, driven by Europe, is something that has always been worthwhile, but now more than ever, since 11 September, when international relations are clearly in a state of upheaval.
This strategy and partnership driven by Europe comes at a time when a partner, in a different region, is going through difficult times, of which we are all aware.
However, as Europeans, we should have clearly defined ideas.
The partner to which I am referring will get through its bad patch over time and will once again turn its attention to Latin America.
It has a right to do this, but Europe has values and interests that are not always the same as those of the United States.
We only have to mention the mere existence of Mercosur or Alca or, simply, the different positions we maintain with regard to areas such as the death penalty or the Permanent Court of International Justice.
With regard to the objectives of the common strategy that have been mentioned, it is laudable, of course, to aim for the implementation of a Euro-Latin American area of peace and stability, in addition to the signing of a peace charter, a task that in my opinion would be difficult to achieve, but not as difficult as reaching equivalent objectives, such as those sought by the Barcelona process for Euro-Mediterranean cooperation, whose execution has not so far made it possible to solve the Middle East conflict.
On the other hand, I applaud the intention of sharing prosperity through the creation of a free trade area by 2010, or thereabouts.
However, I would like to allude once more to the Barcelona process in order to warn that the process that we are hoping to achieve for Latin America should take account of inequalities, that is to say, the different economic weight of the partners, because this could lead to trade being free for all, in theory, but, in practice, being subjected to the most onerous of burdens, that is to say, true inequality that as we all know can be widespread throughout Latin America.
This could mean that our supposed free trade will become nothing more than a slogan.
So, if our intention is to create a partnership between members who are supposed to be equal, when it is obvious that they are not, it is important that we can resort to a fundamental instrument.
I am referring to a genuine development cooperation policy, which is the only thing that can minimise, although I fear this will not happen before 2010, the enormous socioeconomic differences that exist today between the European Union and Latin America and even between Latin American partners themselves.
Lastly, I would like to remind the ultra-liberals that not only is development aid compatible with free trade, but that it requires it, except when free trade is understood to be solely based upon cynical and even cruel inequalities.
On occasions, decent trade is not possible without efficient and transparent development cooperation providing the basis for a free, but fair, game.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I can only express my hearty congratulations to Mr Salafranca on the thorough work he has done.
It is true that to give real substance to all that was decided in Rio de Janeiro by the first Summit between Heads of State and Government of the European Union, Latin America and the Caribbean, the solemn declarations must be made concrete by transforming them into facts, strategies and opportunities that can give new life to the dialogue between the European Union and Latin America.
We should not be surprised, then, that the Salafranca report states firmly that the only way the European Union can establish a genuine, bi-regional strategic partnership is to launch a new joint strategy with force and determination, and that the best time to do so may be precisely at the Madrid Summit in May 2002.
It is right, therefore, to lay the foundations straight away and to find the simplest instruments that can be most readily understood by the citizens of both the European Union and South America.
The creation of a single EU-Latin American Transatlantic Assembly will be most welcome; it must have the broadest remit, including, particularly, the fight against poverty and social exclusion, and the fight against drugs and organised crime, and it must also focus greatly on the basic sector of education, culture and free trade which, as the previous speaker pointed out, must come about without generating inequalities.
The strategy, as the rapporteur suggests, could be one of a single bi-regional solidarity fund, clearly identified and thus more easily controlled.
But apart from the technical financial instruments, what is fundamental is that there should be clear political will, that we should take on a greater burden, that the Union can and must commit itself to implementing a strong development cooperation policy.
The historical, cultural and blood ties that link so many Europeans to Latin America mean that whenever one of us is in Latin America, Mr President, we feel at home.
These ties impose a moral as well as a political obligation on us to continue to uphold with renewed vigour the specific nature of Europe' s role, which is based on the strength of those values that have been at the root of our project for integration.
It is also for these reasons that, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party, I confirm our full support for this report.
Mr President, the common strategy on Latin America is a strategy that may contain highly novel elements for Europe in this ever more complicated world.
This novelty will be seen in the way the relations between Europe and Latin America are to be organised around three themes: the first is the debate on the rules of the game in the process of globalisation and, particularly, the question of democracy and the reduction of poverty; the second is the question of regional political integration; and the third is the joint management of major environmental crises.
In this sense, although we in our group support the general approach taken by the Salafranca report, it contains a few elements which we believe still reflect a view that does not give enough attention precisely to the novelty of the issues we should be responding to.
In particular, my group strongly questions the emphasis placed on the commercial dimension of relations between Europe and Latin America, especially the need for them to be subject to the current rules of the World Trade Organisation, rules which are widely challenged not only in Latin America but in Europe too.
Secondly, we do not agree with the a priori positive assessment of the Puebla-Panama plan, which is a plan for large infrastructure works which will have considerable social and environmental impact.
Before the European Union joins the financial community in contributing to the success of this plan, as called for in the report, I think we should carefully assess this impact.
Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate and thank Mr Salafranca for his report, which is very comprehensive, well-written and apt, because it is only when the enlargement process has been completed on paper, that we realise that there are still two issues that have yet to be resolved: Euro-Mediterranean strategy and this matter of Latin America.
And it is precisely Latin America, with its growing organisational process, that offers more possibilities and at the same time has international repercussions that we should view positively.
The influence of the European Union on Latin America within the United Nations in terms of finding peaceful solutions for conflicts, is, my view, a cause for hope, when compared with the militarisation and aggressive use of force practised by the United States at this time.
I think that this issue is both important and appropriate, and Parliament is showing us that we are working in real time.
For this reason and without reservations, our group will be supporting Mr Salafranca' s report.
We do not agree upon certain, very specific, issues, but we will deal with these when the time is right.
We are thinking here of the inclusion of Cuba, which for us is of fundamental importance, and also the choice of a peaceful solution of the Colombian conflict, which is what the European Union wants to see.
Mr President, the countries of Latin America and the European Union have a cultural basis in common, which greatly facilitates the mutual relations between our peoples.
Despite, however, certain promising prospects opened up by the first EU-Latin America-Caribbean Summit held in Rio de Janeiro in 1999, along the lines of a strategic partnership on an economic, social and ecological level, the concrete results so far achieved have been far from satisfactory.
The reasons for this shortcoming are varied in origin and responsibility for it lies in different places.
For the part that lies with us, there seems at times to be a kind of European self-inhibition, perhaps due even to the geo-strategic primacy, and not only that, of the United States throughout the American continent.
As we know, the countries of Latin America are confronted with joining the American free trade area, which may happen from 2005 onwards (so we are nearly there!).
Now that there is a clear need to establish strong partnerships on the international scene, now more than ever, since the end of the Cold War, the European Union must not shirk any of its responsibilities or the challenges placed before it.
One of the most important is precisely that of being able to define coherent joint strategies and endow them with effective political content.
Thus the proposals presented in this own-initiative report by Mr Salafranca, whom we congratulate on his excellent work, deserve all our support. Not only because they explain and list practically all the aspects that have to be taken into consideration in a joint strategy to intensify EU-Latin American relations, but they also deserve our support because they come at just the right time, prior to the preparations for the second Heads of State and Government Summit to be held next May.
Mr President, it seems to me that something is sorely missing from the report we have before us.
I refer of course to the Native Americans, and by that I mean the indigenous peoples of this subcontinent.
We tend to overlook them all too often, because they prick our conscience somewhat.
How can we discuss relations with that part of 'Latin' America and fail to refer to these people?
Where it did not wipe them out, our so-called civilisation reduced most of them to poverty.
In its opinion, the Committee on Development and Cooperation has, quite rightly, highlighted this omission.
To take an example, item 50 of paragraph g of the report envisages a financial contribution by the Union to the Puebla Panama plan.
How can such an idea be entertained when the plan covers areas with a majority Native American population, in Chiapas and Guatemala, yet the American Indians have not been consulted?
I would be hard put to vote in favour of this report.
Mr President, the establishment of a common strategy between the European Union and Latin America, as decided in Rio de Janeiro in 1999, is a matter of justice that will finally give the appropriate dimension to interregional relationships that have historically been undervalued.
The Socialist Group in the Committee on Development and Cooperation agrees with the objectives set out in the resolution proposed by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, for which I would like to congratulate Mr Salafranca.
In our opinion, we need to increase the content of the political agenda and deepen dialogue at all political and institutional levels, within the framework of a true partnership.
We think that the signing of association agreements with the Andean Community and Central America is necessary, with the aim of creating a Euro-Latin American free trade area.
We also consider, however, that we need to give priority to the resolution of development problems in many Latin American countries, where there are 200 million poor people.
We are particularly concerned about the Andean area, Central America and the Caribbean.
In the Andean area, instability, institutional violence, problems of drug trafficking and the management of migratory flows have to be dealt with from a global perspective, that integrates development cooperation, trade liberalisation, institutional transformation, human rights and the rights of indigenous peoples in particular.
The creation of a Euro-Latin American area of peace and stability has to be founded upon the principles of human rights, democracy and the fight against drug trafficking.
In Central America, aid to social development and the fight against poverty have to take precedence over any other initiative, such as the information society.
To do otherwise would be to put the cart before the horse.
I would also like to make a special reference to the Caribbean and, specifically, to Cuba, as have other Members this morning.
Cuba is not part of the Cotonu Agreement nor does it have an institutionalised relationship with the European Union.
We think that development potential in Cuba, where, for some time, European companies have been investing, and the situation of its people merit treatment from the European Union that goes much further than the indifference it has shown to this country until now.
Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Salafranca on his magnificent report and also Mr Kreissl-DÃ¶rfler for his opinion, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on this subject.
The Salafranca report is, generally speaking, very comprehensive and quite ambitious.
I am only going to make one point, relating to paragraph 60, referring to the need for the Commission and the Council to provide adequate funding; and I would like to relate it to the report presented to us yesterday by the President of the Court of Auditors on economic management in the year 2000.
In this report, in paragraph 5.5.8, something very serious is pointed out: that more than 25% of commitment appropriations allocated to Latin America in the year 2000 could not be used, because of administrative shortcomings.
It was not made very clear in the Court of Auditors report whether administrative shortcomings were restricted to those countries receiving Community aid or the Community' s administration itself.
In response to the Commission, a series of measures have been referred to which would prevent this taking place this year or next, and Mr Salafranca himself refers to another issue, which is the need for extra personnel in the Directorate-General for Latin America.
Some time ago the Director of this Directorate-General told me personally, and I am talking about more than ten years ago, that the Directorate did not need more money, but more staff.
I still have no idea whether this particular bottleneck has yet been resolved.
Finally, one of the proposals put forward by the Commission is to strengthen delegations' decentralisation functions.
I would also like to insist upon something Mr Salafranca has also stressed, which is that a very large country in Latin America with which we have a privileged relationship, Ecuador, still has no delegation, despite previous agreements and commitments made by this Parliament and the Commission itself.
Mr President, in the time available, as Mr Salafranca will understand, I would like to concentrate on paragraph 7 of the resolution on the urgent and overriding need to keep support for the peace process in Colombia as a priority within this strategy.
In particular I want to state two points.
First, that the pledge made by President Pastrana personally to this Parliament on the dismantling of paramilitary groups has not been, and is not being, honoured.
So say the UN special representative on human rights, the Mexican observer commission and the relations of ten fishermen killed in Santa Marta, and of the 18 people forced face down on to the ground and shot dead by paramilitaries in Buga within the last month alone.
This is a continued gross abuse of human rights and, as my own UK ambassador has said, in these troubled times the guerrillas and the paramilitaries are both terrorist groups and should be combated through all means as part of the current anti-terrorist programme.
We feel that particularly due to the killing of the British backpacker Jeremy Parks on 28 October.
The Belgian Presidency rightly included action against paramilitaries as one of its four priorities in Colombia, in August of this year.
Could the Commissioner please tell us in his reply what progress is being made as a result of the pressure that is being applied.
Secondly, we support Commissioner Patten's proposal for a peace laboratory at Magdalena Medio.
It is a major contribution towards the peace process, in contrast to the American military aid in Plan Colombia, which we have roundly condemned.
But this Magdalena Medio region has been subject to an incursion by those same guerrillas.
They are there, threatening campesinos that they must plant coca or they will die.
They are there running their own businesses, having their own taxes and they want to co-opt NGOs to ensure that our European money goes to them to undermine the peace process rather than to support it.
I call on the Commissioner now to show how he will introduce control and verification mechanisms so that our European money will achieve progress in the peace process, and not be abused by the paramilitaries to undermine our very aims.
Welcome
I should like to extend a welcome to a delegation from the Mercosur joint parliamentary commission.
The delegation, headed by its acting president, Mr Washington Abdala, is composed of twelve members of the upper and lower houses of Uruguay, Paraguay and Brazil.
During this visit, the delegation members will take part in the fourth interparliamentary meeting between this joint parliamentary commission from Mercosur and the delegation for relations with the countries of South America and Mercosur.
These meetings began in 1996.
Relations between Mercosur and the EU are going through a very important period, since the negotiations for a free trade area have reached their sixth round and are proceeding at a fast pace.
On behalf of the European Parliament, therefore, I welcome this delegation and express this Institution' s support for a profitable outcome to the negotiations.
EU/Latin America relations (continuation)
Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking Mr Salafranca SÃ¡nchez-Neyra for his excellent report.
I should like to express my recognition of the arduous task that he has undertaken, namely to synthesise the different aspects of our relations with Latin America.
This report looks forward in an ambitious effort to give more vitality and further impetus to our already intense relationship with Latin America.
The report takes a comprehensive approach to the objectives that should be pursued within the wider scope of our relations and the Commission completely shares this focus.
Political, economic and cooperation aspects cannot be dissociated from each other if we want our relationships to develop in a balanced way.
In this context, one of the major advances in recent years has been the establishment of a strategic bi-regional association, agreed upon at the first summit for Heads of State and Government of the European Union, Latin America and the Caribbean.
The report underlines the importance of the priorities decided upon at the summit and uses them as a springboard to propose specific objectives in the political, economic, social and cultural fields.
In the political field, we support and share the desire to enlarge our bi-regional political agenda and to update the ministerial political dialogue.
Political dialogue is the central instrument for structuring and giving content to the strategic association. This strategic association builds on common values which include diversity, tolerance, humanism and solidarity; it should allow both regions to assert their common positions and converging interests on international and multilateral issues of great transcendence.
Many of these issues are addressed in the report and some of them, such as the prevention of conflicts and the fight against terrorism, have just taken on a new meaning.
In the economic, financial and commercial field, I cannot but share your wish that the negotiations in progress with Chile and the Mercosur conclude with success as soon as possible.
The entry into force of the agreement concluded with Mexico is already having a very positive impact on our commercial relations and on our investment.
But I believe that we should be careful about using the same schemes that we are applying to Mercosur, Chile and Mexico for other regions of Latin America.
We should always take into account the particular characteristics of each region, its level of economic development, the structure of its commerce and the level of regional integration which it has reached.
