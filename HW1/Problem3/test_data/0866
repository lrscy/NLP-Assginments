Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is more and more going on in the skies above Europe, and, fortunately, also in European policy in the field of air transport.
The consequences for the air transport sector of 11 September appear to have been almost overcome, and annual growth rates of up to 5% are again being assumed, which means that air travel will increase twofold by 2015.
Whilst we are responding in political terms to this challenge by creating a single European sky, we still need greater capacity at our overstretched airports.
There is also a need for more airport infrastructure, but none of us can seriously imagine that we might manage to double the number of runways by 2015, and so we have to generate additional capacity.
It is vital that this be done by as efficient as possible a system of allocating takeoff and landing rights on overloaded airports.
The old Regulation on slots dates back to 1993 and can no longer cope with present-day challenges; its lack of precision meant that it was not uniformly applied by the Member States.
It failed to guarantee fair and transparent allocation of slots, put new applicants at a disadvantage and gave rise to problems such as illicit trading in slots.
The Commission proposal on new rules for the allocation of slots is a necessary intermediate step.
A final regulation must result from discussions over the next few years.
Even though the intermediate step we are taking today appears to many to mainly bring with it technical improvements to details of the old Regulation, it does at the same time have political implications that are necessary from the point of view of regulatory policy and will seem to some people to have a very broad scope.
At this point, I would like to thank the members of the committee for their fine cooperation and their concentration on the issues.
Despite some differences of opinion, we have succeeded in keeping the balance of the regulatory package as a whole before our eyes.
Our improvements to the Commission proposal are intended to make the Commission text more precise, to establish standard European criteria for granting the status of coordinated airports, to further enhance the coordinator's authority and independence, to retain flexibility and security in terms of planning for established air carriers and to promote the new applicants' flexibility and opportunities for gaining access to the market.
I want to say something about the individual points.
Firstly, at the heart of the Regulation lies a new definition of the slots as a right of usage, and thus the property neither of airlines, nor of airports, but rather a public good.
The committee has additionally stipulated that the whole of the airport infrastructure required for a flight falls within the definition of a right of usage.
We have for the first time pointed out the connection between airway slots and airport slots, which will make it easier to synchronise the two in the future.
My second point is uncontentious but not, for that reason, insignificant.
We have further strengthened the position of the coordinator, freeing him from any obligations to pay compensation, which I believe to be indispensable to his independence.
We have defined his competences more clearly over against the coordination committee; he has the right to withhold slots if airlines fail to comply with their duty to provide information, and he is entitled to compare his data with other coordinators and schedules facilitators in order to bring to light any inconsistencies in schedules.
Thirdly, we should discuss the established airlines' legitimate interests.
Contrary to the Commission proposal, we are in favour of them continuing to have the option of re-timing in order to progressively optimise their schedules. We have widened the exceptions to the 'use-it-or-lose-it' rule in order to be able to take the impact of events like those of 11 September, for example, and we have set aside the Commission's proposal that 'grandfather rights' should be linked to the size of aircraft, believing as we do that the companies need greater flexibility, which is desirable both for economic and environmental reasons.
The alternative would no doubt have been counterproductive.
I turn, fourthly, to the legitimate interests of the new carriers.
The Commission's definition of new applicants was, admittedly, not agreeable to many of the established airlines, but we consider it right in principle, as there is a fundamental contradiction between the concentration process which can be observed in air transport and the competition for routes that liberalisation is actually seeking to bring about.
We have tightened up the definition of new applicants in order further to strengthen them and make it easier for them to transfer and exchange slots.
Fifthly, where there are clear rules, there must also be the possibility of sanctions.
We have laid it down that slots can be withdrawn after one warning if they are being misused.
Member States can also impose fines.
Please allow me to end with a glance into the future.
Many members of the committee wanted to have new fundamental rules as soon as possible, and that I can understand, as the intermediate step we are taking today does not yet satisfy the need for renewal.
However, the effects of this Regulation need first to be evaluated, as the air transport market is both a highly sensitive area and one of great importance to the economy, making a rush job inappropriate.
We also still have time - which we need - to seek the consent of the main actors in the air transport market.
The study on models for the allocation of slots, produced at the Commission's behest, has speeded up, but certainly not yet completed, this process of reaching a consensus.
Our attempt at finding air transport a place in the logic of optimising transport overall could not, unfortunately, be enshrined in the Regulation on slots.
I think that is a pity, but we should not lose sight of this facet of future legislation.
I hope that the report will get as big a majority in plenary tomorrow as it did in the committee.
Mr President, firstly I should like to thank Mr Stockmann, the rapporteur, for meeting with me and organising the seminar last December in Brussels.
It was clear then that all sides of industry, including airlines large and small, airports and others, fully supported the update of Regulation 95/93, in other words the technical revision, but believed that changing the rules on market access at this stage were premature and the consequences had not been thought through.
This proposal is both complex and contentious.
It is obvious that there is a gulf between us on some of the key elements.
It is the point that attempts to deal with these proposals, slot definition, market access issues, slot transferability and new entrants, etc., that should have been considered in a second phase.
I will highlight some of the particular difficulties later.
Not only is the inclusion of these elements uncalled for in Phase I, but some will also reduce the much-needed flexibility required in the system.
The amendments initially submitted by myself and some of my colleagues were designed to maintain and enhance the flexibility in the system that all airlines currently have, which works to the advantage of passengers.
To remove those rights, as proposed by the Commission, would be severely detrimental to the system and cause it to break down.
I and others have re-tabled three key amendments, which will be voted on tomorrow.
These deal with the slot allocation process and the slot exchanges between carriers.
I hope the House will support them.
On a general point, it is worth reminding the Commission that the definition and use of a slot cannot be decided in isolation by the European Union.
There are 168 slot-coordinated airports worldwide and many third country carriers operating into Europe.
Any changes to definition and use would need to be agreed at international level in order not to cause chaos.
There is no reference to that in the Commission's proposal.
Initially I deliberately did not get into the argument of slot ownership, not least because it is highly contentious and will, I believe, encounter serious legal challenges.
But, whatever the argument, I find it naive to say that the Commission's view that slots belong to the people is bizarre.
Perhaps the Commission believes that it should own them on behalf of the people.
The fact is that the ownership of the slots should be determined by contracts between parties.
That brings me to my final point.
I believe that a slot is a commodity which should be traded if necessary.
This is also the view of the AEA, IATA and fourteen Member States in recognition of the future shortage of airport capacity across the EU.
I also strongly disagree with the myth - which is perpetuated - that only the major airlines benefit.
This is not the case.
It has been proved by the fact that at Heathrow BA's share of slots has declined since secondary trading began over ten years ago.
The choice for consumers has drastically improved.
We need a proposal that will produce a more transparent, more practical, more efficient and effective slot regulation, one that does not harm the legitimate interests of the aviation industry.
Unfortunately this is not it.
Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of my group I wish to thank Mr Stockmann for an excellent and competently prepared report.
It is vital to have careful coordination of slots to improve efficiency and safety at airports.
Take-off and landing times are also of considerable economic importance for air carriers.
Our group supports the rapporteur's efforts to adopt the key elements of the Commission proposal: an independent coordinator, priority being given to new entrants, and the legal status of slots specifically as a right of use.
It is important to have a system of allocation of slots that is as flexible as possible for those companies, for example, that do business abroad.
The right of Member States to limit 'grandfather rights' to operate aircraft of a specified minimum size serves little purpose.
Discriminating against small aircraft could, for example, lead to problems for a small country's traffic heading for another Member State.
Our group has tabled two amendments.
The purpose of Amendment No 56 is to clarify the Commission proposal regarding the allocation of slots to new entrants.
The amendment preserves the idea of priority being given them, but at the same time specifies that priority should be dependent on the number of slots requested.
In my opinion, Amendment No 45 weakens the position of new entrants.
I would also ask what the Commission's view is of this proposal.
The Commission has started to take action to avoid congestion at airports.
The purpose of the new market mechanisms is to more effectively coordinate supply and demand regarding slots.
Finding long-term solutions has nevertheless been a very slow process in recent years.
Amendment No 57 represents the desire of our group to have the Commission commit to submitting a more comprehensive proposal on slots.
Our group believes the present system must be radically revised.
There has to be greater access to the slots market than there is at present.
On taking up office, Commissioner De Palacio made the state of affairs in aviation one of her key priorities.
Now - halfway through the Commission's mandate - this is also evident in practice.
This proposal is one of many.
The problems in aviation are making themselves felt in the air and at the airports.
It seems as if the problems on the ground are less pronounced than they are in the air, but appearances are deceptive, in my view.
Parliament has nurtured the wish to review the allocation of slots for a long time.
The intransparent manner in which these rights have been 'allocated' to airline companies to date is not so much creating clarity as raising more questions.
This, in fact, touches the very core of this proposal. Namely the question whether these slot rights are 'owned' or constitute a 'right of usage'.
I take the view that the latter is the case, given the public nature of airports.
If agreement exists in this matter, there is, in my view, no reason to decide on changing the rules of the game at this stage.
Indeed, if we have to wait until a general consensus has been reached, a decision might be a long time coming.
An important line of approach for this proposal is the opportunities offered to newcomers on the market.
In the interest of an effectively functioning market, it is necessary that they are afforded the opportunity to join.
However, we should remain mindful of the fact that a qualitatively sound network should continue to exist.
The policy must be adapted accordingly.
The distribution of slots must therefore not result in newcomers being accorded discarded slots only.
A good mixture of applications of current providers and newcomers is essential.
This means, Mr President, that we can largely identify with the Stockmann report as it has been submitted by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.
We will support it accordingly.
Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, I too, on behalf of my group, would like to warmly welcome Mr Stockmann's report, as it is an excellent one, and one which deals with its subject very much in depth.
I speak for the majority of my group when I say that my colleague Mrs Foster, for whom I have very high regard, has this evening put forward an opinion held by a minority in our group.
The majority in my group, just as in the committee, supports the Commission proposal to unambiguously clarify the legal nature of slots and to finally make clear that trading in slots between one airline and another is illegal and will remain so.
As rights of usage, the slots belong neither to the air carriers nor to the airports, and have only an ancillary role.
They enable air space to be used efficiently, economically, and in a way that treats the environment with respect, and so my group will be voting against Mrs Foster's three amendments tomorrow, believing as we do that the Commission is very much in the right.
Secondly, I believe that the new version of the slot regulation aims at formulating the rules for the allocation of slots in a way that is more transparent and more favourable to competition.
Of course, the 'grandfather rights' of the existing airlines are to be safeguarded, but only to some extent.
We need competition, and I hope that my British colleagues will agree with me on that.
We need competition, and so we also need new slots for new air carriers, in order to better organise competition in air travel and for the passengers' benefit.
The end result is that the coordinators' roles and independence are strengthened.
This is to enhance the possibility of taking unused times from the existing airlines and allocating them to others, thus improving the efficiency with which airspace is used in an economical and environmentally friendly way.
That is the objective.
Mr President, Madam Vice-President, please let us conclude by pointing out that I hope that the Council will, under Spanish Presidency, take a significant step in June.
We have done our homework.
We have, admittedly, produced 52 amendments in committee, but they are in the interests of greater precision.
I hope that the Commission will work a miraculous transformation and support most of them.
In any case, it strikes me as important that the Council should reach a decision quickly, as we want the revised slots regulation to benefit air carriers, and we want it without delay.
Airlines have found themselves in difficulties as a result of the general economic recession and of the events of 11 September.
We believe that a revised slots regulation will help airlines, airports and passengers, and so we ask you to support the Stockmann report.
Mr President, Mrs De Palacio, ladies and gentlemen, the airline market is an example of how national egoism is crumbling.
No one can have the sky to himself.
The liberalised airline market makes the free movement of goods and people possible and you can even find your very own flight attendant on board an aircraft, which is what happened to me.
We can promote competition through proper control of slots.
Mr Stockmann has in my opinion succeeded splendidly in balancing the position of the large dominant companies with the need of new, dynamic companies to exploit their own innovative approach.
Consumers and the business world will benefit significantly from this sort of development both in the form of lower prices and new services.
At this stage the Commission has submitted a proposal to us that is slightly larger and broader in scope than the original one, but we cannot wait around for a year in a rapidly developing aviation industry. I therefore earnestly support the approach that has been chosen.
It is of crucial importance to open up the market to the new entrants and it is more than fair that they should have half the vacant slots.
The slots must also be fairly allocated to foreign companies.
Protectionism must have its wings clipped, whatever the cost.
Good air connections have intrinsic value, but that is something national airlines cannot have.
Monopolies are the poor man's worst enemy, and new Sabenas simply cannot any longer be supported out of the taxpayer's pocket.
Next we must create transatlantic airspace and end the bilateral agreements between the Member States of the EU and the United States of America.
The current practice very obviously favours the Americans, and I also expect the Commission to act quickly after the Court of Justice has given a decision in this matter.
There is still a lot of room in the airline industry for greater efficiency, and that might be said of us here too in the European Parliament, and for that reason I will end my speech here.
Mr President, I come to this debate having been the Chairman on the Committee on Deregulation of European Air Transport with the DTI and the National Consumer Council in the early '90s appointed by Mr Norman Tebbitt.
We found the regulation of open skies a very difficult issue.
I am also a former director of the second largest airline in Britain.
I am also concerned to tell you that I left London at one o'clock this afternoon and I arrived here at nine o'clock this evening.
That is as a consequence of a complete monopoly on this route to and from London.
That is not the reason why I am standing up although I am taking action about what happens to me and my other colleagues from the English contingent regularly when we fly from London to Strasbourg.
Deregulation is important, competition is important and in Mr Stockmann's report ably shadowed by my colleague, Ms Foster, we have struck a balance of some kind.
It is also important to understand that although we want to open things up quickly and deregulate quickly and introduce competition the aviation industry also requires heavy investment.
Therefore it is not just like starting a taxi firm to start an airline.
I speak as someone who has started two airlines.
Therefore we have to be careful that we do not destabilise the European aviation industry like the reforms in the United States where the entire American aviation industry went into a tailspin.
We must be careful that we do not destabilise it by moving too quickly without carrying industry with us.
It requires heavy financial and capital investment to be able to do this and I would like to ask the Commissioner to be careful when she implements some of these proposals.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the current rules relating to slots have worked relatively well considering the extra pressure on the system resulting from the increase in air traffic.
But I say 'relatively' because the reality is that studies and complaints indicate that, unfortunately, there is often a total lack of transparency in the functioning, the allocation and the development of the use of these slots, and that, furthermore, the various Member States of the Union have not been interpreting the current rules in a uniform manner.
Far from it. On this basis, on 20 June 2001, the Commission decided to review the rules and to approach it in two stages.
I must point out that all of this coincides with what has been said and repeated in this Parliament on various occasions.
As for the two stages in which we propose to implement this reform, the first stage is aimed at clarifying the different provisions of the Regulation which, on being applied, have proven to be clearly deficient and have led to differing interpretations amongst the Member States.
But furthermore it is a question of resolving a series of deficiencies which have been pointed out to us by the airlines and the airports, and by the different operators.
Finally, some of you have pointed out something fundamental: the need to define what a slot is and we clearly opt for defining it as a right of use.
We must be aware, however, that this is extremely important if we want to achieve legal certainty and move beyond the current situation in which there is nothing, there is no concrete definition of the nature of slots.
Because how can we possibly establish a right of ownership, ladies and gentlemen?
There are slots for taking off, for landing, but also for overflying.
There are no rights of ownership, but rights of use in relation to a public asset such as airspace, the take-off and landing possibilities other than the facilities of the airports or the areas to be overflown in accordance with the support and assistance provided to air traffic from different locations.
While this is the first stage, which is essentially technical - and I thank Mr Deva for saying that we have achieved a good balance, for that is what I believe we are doing - the second stage is the revision of the possibilities for distributing slots, introducing transparent and non-discriminatory market mechanisms.
Of course, we will do so carefully, prudently, in order to prevent any excessive or unbearable shock to our air sector.
Our intention is to consolidate the European air sector; in no way do we intend to weaken it.
However, while awaiting this second proposal - for which we are preparing studies which guarantee that this shock does not occur - the current situation must be made clear.
With this approach in mind, the proposal intends to guarantee the greatest possible efficiency in the use of such a scarce resource as slots and ensure uniformity in the interpretation of the regulations and the application of the Regulations and therefore in legal certainty.
To this end, the proposal introduces effective and transparent procedures and the system of penalties which will allow us to achieve the greatest degree of efficiency without having to modify the system of acquired rights.
I would like to thank Parliament, and especially Mr Stockmann, for the work you have done - in which you have always taken a constructive approach - and for your dedication.
We particularly appreciate your balanced and pragmatic approach: we believe that, of the 57 amendments presented, the majority (35 in total) add clarity to the proposal and make it more efficient and therefore the Commission can accept them, with modification in some cases.
However, we reject the other 22, which I will refer to briefly.
Firstly, Amendments Nos 53, 54 and 55, which could significantly upset the balance of the proposal, affecting essential points such as the prohibition on creating a black market by means of false exchanges, as well as those relating to penalties.
Furthermore, these amendments have not been adopted by the RETT Committee and the Commission must reject them.
Secondly, we must reject Amendments Nos 1, 7, 18 and 28, which would significantly change the balanced objectives of the proposal we are presenting today.
Amendment No 8 exempts the coordinator from all responsibility, despite their greater obligations and capacities, and the Commission cannot therefore support it.
However, we could accept Amendment No 48 with modifications to the wording in order to guarantee that coordinators are held responsible in the case of serious negligence or wilful misconduct.
Amendment No 20 is incompatible with the definition of a slot and ignores the need to always analyse capacities before imposing the coordination of slots.
It must therefore also be rejected.
The Commission considers Amendment No 23 to be excessively broad and does not agree with it; we feel the same about Amendment No 25, which ignores the procedural rules, which are an operative requirement for the coordination committee if transparency is to be guaranteed.
We therefore reject both.
Likewise, Amendments Nos 33 and 34, except the reference to the guidelines at Community level.
We must also reject Amendments Nos 35 and 43, since they impact negatively on the recognised Community law on intermodality and public service obligations.
I would like to add that Amendment No 57, which Mr Pohjamo referred to, introduces a time period which is impossible to comply with.
The Commission has just begun a procedure for selecting an expert who will have to produce a report and we will have it in the summer of 2003 at the earliest.
The Commission has committed itself to consulting the air transport sector and the Member States on the results of a study on the market system for the allocation of slots before proceeding to a new legislative proposal on this issue.
Finally, we believe that Amendments Nos 2, 15, 26, 38, 45, 46 and 50 are either redundant or inconsistent with worldwide practices in the allocation of slots and therefore we cannot accept them.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say that I agree with what Mr Jarzembowski said in relation to urgency.
Let us hope that the Council can adopt a decision at the next meeting, although I think that will be difficult, given the development of the technical work.
In any event, I would like to thank you for your contributions and your work, with a very special mention for Mr Stockmann, whose work has been tremendous.
I hope that you will support this Commission proposal in the vote tomorrow.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
, rapporteur.
(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today we shall, I think, wrap up the parliamentary procedure to establish a European Maritime Safety Agency. The three parties involved, Parliament, the Council and the Commission have, I think, worked well together on the common objective of completing the procedure as quickly as possible, and all the members of the institutions involved in the procedure deserve our congratulations.
Just to recap, in completing the first reading last June, Parliament adopted seventeen amendments, the main purpose of which was to strengthen the agency's independence vis-Ã -vis the Commission, to strengthen the powers of its administrative board, to allow Member States to ask the agency for technical assistance in certain cases and to include a provision on combating fraud.
As regards the composition of the administrative board, Parliament rejected the involvement of European Parliament representatives in this agency, taking the view that experience in maritime safety should be the criterion for the appointment of members.
Finally, it demanded that the evaluation report on the agency's activities be carried out by external experts.
In its common position, the Council accepted the European Parliament amendments which provide for the power of the agency to assist states applying for accession without the specific request of the Commission, the obligation of the agency to forward the findings of its visits to the Member States, not only to the Commission but also to the Member State concerned, the purely consultative role of the Commission in the adoption by the administrative board of the agency's work programme, the obligation to appoint members of the administrative board on the basis of their degree of relevant experience within the remit of the agency, the obligation of the executive director to respond to any requests for assistance from a Member State, the power of the administrative board to appoint or dismiss the executive director, with the Commission entitled to propose candidates who need not necessarily be appointed, and the concern to combat fraud.
Some of Parliament's amendments were partially incorporated in the common position, such as the provision concerning the composition of the agency's administrative board, on which Parliament decided not to be represented and which will finally consist of one representative from each Member State, four Commission representatives and four professionals appointed by the Commission, and the provision referring to the procedure for drawing up the work programme, where the Council specified that the executive director would submit the work programme to the administrative board after consulting the Commission and not just once it had received preliminary approval.
This also applies to most of the provisions concerning the agency's budget and the provisions regarding the evaluation of the agency within five years of the agency taking up its responsibilities.
The new elements introduced by the Council in the proposal for a regulation include the rewording of Article 2 on the duties of the agency which makes the text clearer without altering its content, a reference to transparency and the protection of information, the removal of the reference to the seat of the agency, not that this will stop me from referring to it, the special adoption procedure for the work programme in the event of disagreement by the Commission, the representation of all the Member States on the administrative board and the participation of professionals not representative of branches without the right to vote, the power of the administrative board to examine specific issues without the presence of its professional members and the possibility of appointing or dismissing the executive director by a special majority of four-fifths of members.
On the basis of the above, we find that, in formulating its common position, the Council has taken account wholly or partly of a significant number of European Parliament amendments and that, generally, the Council has adhered to the spirit of the original proposal, which seeks to address problems in the sector of maritime safety and protection of the marine environment.
Nevertheless, we would draw your attention to the following points in the common position: representatives of professional branches are excluded and replaced by professionals appointed by the Commission who have no right to vote but may be excluded from meetings where this is considered advisable.
A curious procedure has been introduced for the adoption of the agency's work programme in the event of disagreement by the Commission and, in order to maintain the balance between the two institutions, the common position requires, for the programme to be adopted in this specific instance, either a majority of two-thirds of members, but including the Commission representatives, or a unanimous vote by the representatives of the Member States.
This ensures the balance between the Council and the Commission, if at the expense of making the decision-taking procedure more difficult.
Apart from these reservations, the common position should be welcomed because it corresponds to Parliament's main objective, which is to make maritime transport safer and protect the maritime environment.
We believe that this proposal must be adopted without delay.
Finally, as far as the seat of the new agency is concerned, I trust that it will be located in a city with a large, very old port, near a modern airport with direct flights to all the countries of the European Union, with all the necessary infrastructure, in a country of islands with a maritime history stretching back thousands of years, with the biggest merchant fleet in the world.
Obviously, I am referring to Luxembourg...
Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Mastorakis.
I believe that his work has been serious and responsible and that furthermore he has been able to bring together a consensus within the committee which has meant that today we are able to hold a debate and approve during this plenary a report which has been difficult and complicated and which has been drawn up as a result of his work and I believe that this achievement deserves credit.
At the same time, if you will allow me, Mr President, I would also like to congratulate the Vice-President on behalf of my group, since if one thing characterises the work over these years, it is reflected in this report: it has been a challenge which stems from the problems relating to accidents off European coasts and a challenge from the public, and it is work which has resulted in the creation of various safety agencies (at the moment we are witnessing the creation of the Maritime Safety Agency) and furthermore it is a shared challenge, supported by the parliamentary committee.
Furthermore, I believe the really positive thing is that, in her work, the Vice-President has the trust of the parliamentary committee and this takes the form - if we look back at events over these three years - of the support she has received for her management and her projects, which in many cases have been controversial and complicated.
As I have said, together with this agency, we are trying to adopt one of the multiple measures proposed by the Commission to respond to a European public demand: safety at sea.
And we now have a challenge; that that agency should function transparently and efficiently, but that it should not only function in relation to the two important challenges - that of the safety of sea transport, including passenger and coastal shipping, and that of the protection of the marine environment - but also in relation to those small details and areas which are not apparently as essential as the big issues, such as recreational boating - including the issue of jet skis and speed-boats which cause concern amongst the citizens of Europe.
I believe that the agency is able to respond to these questions.
Finally, I believe that this response should be a quick one so that the work of the Commission and the work of Parliament are shown to be connected and capable of responding to the concerns of the European citizens.
Mr President, I would also like to support the rapporteur, in particular his recommendation to the House that we endorse the common position on the establishment of the Maritime Safety Agency, albeit with the important provisos so clearly stated.
I would like to thank the rapporteur, on behalf of the Socialist Group, for the way in which he has skilfully piloted this part of the Erika package through Parliament, keeping all sides together.
The fact that we have a better product at the end of the process than we did at the beginning is a tribute to his skill in particular.
This is the final part of the Erika package so we also ought to thank the Commissioner, who has been working relentlessly to ensure that disasters like the Erika and so many others in EU waters in recent years do not occur again.
We did have many new laws in the 80s and 90s, but they were not fully implemented or complied with.
I hope that this new EU initiative, the Maritime Safety Agency, will coordinate, monitor and enforce maritime law.
I hope it will come up with fresh proposals where necessary, but in an open and transparent way.
We all hope that it will work with us in the European Parliament to make our seas safer and protect our coastal environment.
For too long in Europe, the laws of the sea were more appropriate to the 19th than the 21st century.
I hope that by agreeing to endorse the Commissioner's recommendation and the common position we can help modernise EU maritime safety and have EU safety laws that we can all be proud of, but of course the proof will be when we no longer have terrible maritime disasters.
You can never have 100% safety, but this proposal will do a lot to make our seas safer, save lives and protect our coastal environment.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am extremely happy to be attending this debate today.
I would firstly like to thank Mr Mastorakis for his magnificent work.
As he pointed out, we are coming to the end of the negotiation, since Amendments Nos 2, 4 and 5 are accepted by the Commission, because they clearly improve the text we received from the Council.
And not only are they supported by the Commission, but this morning the relevant group in the Council has expressed its support and willingness to incorporate and accept them.
We can therefore conclude this negotiation, the approval of this legislative text, if tomorrow Parliament supports the text with these amendments, which would then be approved by the Council at its next meeting.
I would like to say that, as Mr Ripoll y MartÃ­nez de Bedoya and Mr Watts pointed out a moment ago, we have been debating maritime safety for a year and a half now.
We have confronted challenges and we have cooperated in order to prevent a repetition of horrendous events such as the sinking of the Erika, which not only endanger human lives, but which also pollute the sea with terrible consequences for the inhabitants of coastal areas and for flora and fauna and environmental protection.
Of the six initiatives which made up the Erika I and Erika II packages, this is the fifth.
The sixth initiative, the only one we are yet to deal with, the most essential, the increase in the guarantee of the level of support and the guarantee relating to oil pollution is being debated at the moment within the International Maritime Organisation, and let us hope that a decision will be achieved which will allow for an international solution, since the maritime sector is an international one, and which does not oblige us to turn to a European initiative.
An international solution would be much more positive.
If this is achieved, as we hope it will be, within the International Maritime Organisation, it would be the last initiative for the Erika I and Erika II packages and we would have concluded our work.
In this regard, I would like to thank all of you and in particular the various rapporteurs who have been involved in the different proposals - the five of them - which we have debated and worked on, but also the whole House and particularly the services of the Commission, of the TREN Directorate-General, since it is thanks to their effort, their work, their professionalism and the speed with which they have responded that we have got this far.
I would also like to thank the Council for having responded for once to what the citizens are asking us for: that we provide a framework for greater safety and greater protection for the maritime sector in general and for pollution caused by the dumping of oil in particular.
Such a tough reality has allowed us to move ahead on other initiatives which will improve maritime safety and benefit maritime traffic and therefore the maritime sector as a whole.
Thank you very much.
I believe we will now very possibly be able to conclude the Erika package and the agency will be implemented as soon as possible, but, as you know, ladies and gentlemen, it is not us who decide the headquarters, but we hope that the next European Council will come to an agreement and finally tell us where it will be, and the sooner the better, since it is very urgent.
Thank you very much, Mr Mastorakis.
Thank you very much, Mr President.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Vote on request for urgent procedure
Mr President, I hope that the House will not accept this request for urgency.
I was rapporteur for the legal basis issue when this report originally came before the committee and this House.
At that time it was proposed to create a common market organisation for ethyl alcohol alone.
In committee that was amended to cover synthetic as well as agriculturally originating ethyl alcohol.
The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, after studying it carefully, came to the view and reported back that there was no satisfactory legal basis that could be devised for that proposal.
On that account the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development proposed to this House, and the proposal was accepted, that the project be withdrawn for reconsideration by the Commission.
Instead there was very quick reconsideration, and a substantial change.
The Legal Affairs Committee, having had a look at it last week, concluded that the same objection concerning the legal basis applies because there is still an attempt, under Article 37, to bring together agricultural and synthetic ethyl alcohol.
This is unsatisfactory.
Where a serious question has been raised about the legal basis, the committee responsible, upon considering a new solution to the problem, should surely once again ask for the legal basis issue to be properly looked at, not rush it through under urgent procedure.
Mr President, I cannot go along with the Liberals on this.
I would inform you,
my dear Mr Schulz, that is simply because the Liberals indicated yesterday that they intended to reject it, and so I assumed that the honourable Member was among their number, but that is obviously an oversight.
But that which is not, may yet be!
Turning to the matter in hand, I would like to inform you that this second Ayuso GonzÃ¡lez report refers to the Council's compromise proposal, which does not provide for a common organisation of the market, but only for a market regulation.
This will result in Article 10 being dropped, as Article 10 states that national subsidies are prohibited in an organised market.
That has lapsed, and so I ask you to agree to this urgent procedure.
With regard to the speech by Mr MacCormick, I would refer you to Rule 63(4) on the verification of the legal basis.
Your comments will be taken into account in the vote on the content.
(Parliament approved the request for urgent procedure)
Mr President, I wish, on behalf of my group and also in consultation with all the shadow rapporteurs and with the coordinators of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, to ask that my two reports on the rules on participation in the Framework Programme and the Euratom Programme and on dissemination of their results should be adjourned to the July part-session.
Yesterday evening we succeeded, after intensive work, in reaching an agreement with the Council.
It was not possible to have this agreement formally voted on in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, and so I now ask for consideration of both reports to be adjourned.
The next item is the joint debate on:
the Commission statement on the visit by the EU troika to Algeria and the signature of the EU-Algeria agreement;
and the report (A5-0175/2002) by Mr Morillon and Mr Cohn-Bendit, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on relations between the European Union and the Arab Maghreb Union: a privileged partnership (2001/2027(INI)).
Mr President, the signing of the association agreement in Valencia on 22 April will give a new framework and new impetus to our relations with Algeria.
The Commission encouraged Parliament to give its approval to this agreement as quickly as possible.
The Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy has already had a first exchange of views on this agreement.
The Commission shares most of the views expressed during this debate, especially as far as the human rights situation is concerned.
In particular the issues of missing persons and access by certain human rights organisations to Algeria are worrying.
The troika, headed by Mr Pique, met last week in Algiers with Algerian authorities, and in particular with President Bouteflika and Mr Belkhadem, Minister for Foreign Affairs.
As Mr Pique has indicated, the political dialogue was rich, free and fruitful.
It was the first troika visit since the signature of the association agreement, which opens a new chapter in our bilateral relations.
The possibility of negotiating an interim agreement was considered, although there is no agreement on this for the moment.
The presidency expressed our satisfaction on the establishment of regular political dialogue, which will be reinforced when the association agreement enters into force.
It was recognised that the recent parliamentary elections constituted substantial progress in the strengthening of the democratic process in Algeria.
The issue of human rights and missing persons was tackled, but unfortunately, taking into account the brevity of the meeting, too briefly.
The Commission recalled that a list of missing persons was transmitted to the Algerian authorities and that the Commission was still waiting for a response from the Algerian Government.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I admit that I am a little surprised by the Commission statement on the troika visit; perhaps I will have the opportunity, in the second half of my speech, to describe the situation in Algeria.
General Morillon and myself are presenting a joint report on EU/Maghreb Arab Union relations.
Mr Morillon, who is currently contesting an election campaign, is unfortunately unable to be here today, but his colleague, Mr Galeote Quecedo, will be standing in for him.
The aim of the report is to define the nature and the structure of EU/Maghreb Arab Union relations.
By this, I do mean Maghreb, and not the individual countries of Arab Maghreb.
That is the fundamental idea behind the report.
Although we state there is a need to draw up reports on the situation of and relations with the individual countries, such as Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria, Mauritania or other Maghreb countries, our original idea was to try to see if we could move forward relations between the South Mediterranean as a whole, as a possible collective subject, and the North Mediterranean, in other words, the European Union.
I am aware that some Members were not or are not entirely in agreement with the position that has been adopted. Although we have not discussed the specific situation in certain countries in this report, this is not because we believe that this would be the wrong approach, but because we feel that this approach is not suited to the structure of our report.
Our essential aim is to force the hand, as it were, of the Maghreb countries so that they create a Maghreb Union, in other words, so that they succeed in developing a form of cooperation and that they present themselves as Maghreb to the people of Europe.
That is why we want, for example, the assessment of the association agreements of each country to be carried out within the framework of a structure that is common to the European Union and the Maghreb Union, in other words, a joint delegation, and that Members of Parliament also take part in this assessment and not simply governments or the Commission.
As you know, Article 2 of the association agreements stipulates respect for human rights.
To some extent, Article 2 is a phantom clause.
It exists, but we do not really know how to apply it.
To the best of my knowledge, there has, so far, been no genuine dialogue, no genuine assessment of the progress made in developing freedoms in the region, nor any debate in Parliament.
What we want, first of all, is an initial debate on the development of democracy within the Maghreb countries, and secondly, a debate with the European Union on secularity.
In my view, the main problem of all the Maghreb countries relates to the fact that, in the name of the fight against terrorism and against religious fundamentalism, increasing numbers of laws and government measures have been adopted whose ultimate effect is to suppress these freedoms.
The idea of the report is to establish a structure, to create a Maghreb Union, as a whole, and to form an alliance between the collective of the Maghreb Union and that of the European Union.
I would like to add some of my own thoughts on Algeria.
It is still hard to believe that a troika has visited Algeria, and is discussing a situation where 45% of the population did not even participate in elections; where, in Algiers, this figure was not even 25%; where, in a region like Kabylia, the participation level was barely 2%. It is still hard to believe that the troika is telling us that yes, Sir, everything is going well, that democratic change has begun in Algeria.
Algeria is experiencing economic crisis, Algeria is experiencing political crisis, it is experiencing democratic crisis, and the European Union must really ask itself whether it has chosen the right time to sign an association agreement that does not tackle any of these problems.
Mr President, I naturally could not start without acknowledging my colleague and friend, Philippe Morillon, who, as Mr Cohn-Bendit has said, cannot be here today as a result of electoral obligations in his country.
We in my group are very pleased to congratulate Philippe Morillon because we think he does almost everything well, and I am therefore going to sing the praises of the two rapporteurs who have reached an agreement on a text which has won the almost unanimous support of the parliamentary committee and I hope that there will also be such unanimity in the vote in plenary, because relations between the European Union and the Maghreb and the impetus we are generally trying to give to the Barcelona process undoubtedly require a generalised political will, as we saw with the Valencia Ministerial Summit, since this process will no doubt meet with difficulties along the way.
One of the keys to the success of this report has been the consensus reached by the rapporteurs in order to provide the report with a strategic vision of this relationship, thereby preventing - as Mr Cohn-Bendit has just said - getting bogged down in the debate on the internal situation of any one country in the region and I therefore call on the different parliamentary groups to ensure that we maintain this consensus and do not accept the amendments presented on certain specific countries, which the European Parliament will no doubt have to give its opinion on, but there will be other opportunities to do so.
Furthermore, in the cases of Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia there are various reports under discussion in other places.
Like the rapporteurs, my group believes that this is not the place to begin this debate.
On the other hand, I am glad that there have been amendments on three issues I consider to be essential to the report.
The first is the commitment to the fight against human trafficking, for which the European Union must provide countries of origin with incentives, using association agreements and its policy of cooperation in order to combat the mafias which promote illegal immigration.
Secondly, and in parallel, we must also commit ourselves to the development of those countries and therefore the fact that the European Parliament has not missed the opportunity in this report to promote the creation of a specific financial body for the Euro-Mediterranean area also seems to me to be worthy of praise.
Finally, I believe it to be essential that we develop a parliamentary dimension for this Euro-Mediterranean relationship by creating a joint parliamentary assembly similar to the one which exists with the ACP countries.
I hope we will be practical and that this formula will be applied in the debate next week in Bari.
And here in this House I hope we conform to our duty of mutual loyalty which the rapporteurs have given an example of and that their work therefore receives the support of the whole House.
Mr President, our group attaches great importance to this report, which comes after Valencia and follows the Esteve report, which received huge consensus in this House.
It also informs the Commission and the Council of the European Parliament's desire to make the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership a political, strategic priority for the Union, and the Maghreb dimension of this partnership must be fostered and supported.
Mr Cohn-Bendit is right: we need to progress from a bilateral to a multilateral vision of this relationship.
Moreover, there are positive signs coming from the countries which have resumed contact and cooperation after many years; the desire for cooperation is clear from the fact that a meeting of Arab Mahhreb Union Foreign Ministers was held last January and that it has been decided to hold a meeting of these countries' Heads of State in Algiers on 21 and 22 June next.
This signal must therefore be sustained, not just as regards regional free trade but also as regards social issues, the management of complex phenomena such as immigration and the development of human rights and the rule of law in these countries.
In this regard, I would point out that there is a desire on the part of these countries to cooperate in the management of immigration policy, and this is important for us if we want to protect the Union's external borders, but we cannot, as Europeans, focus solely on this aspect: we must also be open to discussions with these countries on how and under what conditions managed, lawful immigration is possible.
Often, however, European governments' policies run counter to these principles, and that could place us in a position of conflict with these countries too.
Then, as regards human rights, I will not repeat what Mr Cohn-Bendit said - with which our group fully agrees - about using Article 2 to introduce dialogue and evaluation with a view to advancing the development of the rights of the people and institutions which enforce it.
As regards Algeria, I too am a little disappointed by the Commissioner's words.
I myself had the opportunity to be in Algeria during the recent elections with a Parliamentary delegation and I would warn that the situation in Kabylia should not be underestimated, for the rift is deep.
Similarly, we need to encourage greater openness on the part of this country for its attitude towards other countries is still too closed and lacks transparency.
I feel that we should pursue this objective through the association agreement, but dialogue on these issues is a requirement of the association agreement.
Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate Mr Cohn-Bendit and Mr Morillon because the working approach proposed in this report reflects the approach drawn up in the resolution on the Euro-Mediterranean Ministerial Conference in Valencia.
Therefore, we will do everything possible to ensure that the consensus approach will allow this report to be effective.
I am going to refer directly to the issue of human rights, as Mrs Napoletano did previously.
It is especially appropriate that today's debate on Algeria, proposed by the Liberal Group, is taking place so soon after the elections that a delegation from Parliament attended.
I must also say that I was surprised by the Commissioner's comments on human rights in relation to the visit of the troika, a visit which furthermore took place after the elections; I would like to remind you that our visit took place before the elections.
The Committee for Information on Algeria is at work and will publish its conclusions at the appropriate time, in expectation of the work on the report on ratification which is being prepared by Mr Obiols i GermÃ .
I would like to point out that the almost complete lack of participation in the elections in Kabilia, the very low turn-out in Algeria as a whole and the fact that the majority of the population has not been involved and that there have been significant complaints about human rights is extremely worrying.
In this regard, I would like to insist once again that in our resolution on the Valencia Conference, we express our unanimous concern at the human rights situation, we defend the need for the situation not to worsen in certain countries with which we have signed association agreements - and the conditions are worsening - and we propose the establishment of mechanisms for applying the democratic clause.
If we do not move in this direction, our credibility will hit rock-bottom.
Therefore, Mr President, I insist that the report by Mr Morillon and Mr Cohn-Bendit moves in the right direction; we will try to persuade them to support our amendments, at least the general ones, not those relating to specific countries.
If over the coming months we are not effective in our defence of human rights, through mechanisms and instruments rather than through declarations, I do not believe we will be moving in the right direction.
Mr President, I would like to congratulate the two rapporteurs, Mr Morillon and Mr Cohn-Bendit, on their work.
I believe we should not forget the special situation currently affecting relations between the European Union and the Arab Maghreb; the economic association agreements are leading to a genuine unofficial enlargement towards the South and must bring us closer together on such important issues as immigration.
The Maghreb representatives are constantly telling us that they will do nothing about immigration until the European Union offers them clear compensations.
Neither must we forget potentially explosive situations such as the Western Sahara, which is impeding the creation of the Maghreb Arab Union, which is so important if the economic and political union of the Maghreb and its relations with the European Union are really going to be what they should be.
Mr President, I too have just returned from Algeria, having been a member of the parliamentary delegation. I wish to use my speaking time to describe the expectation and hope that many Algerians have placed in relations with Europe and to describe their thoughts and demands as well.
Today, Algeria has, of course, passed a milestone, shall we say, by holding elections, in which the absolute majority was gained by the so-called new FLN.
First and foremost, however, Algeria is a country with disastrous social conditions in which hundreds of thousands of families are struggling for survival. Eighty per cent of the country's population consists of young people, whose sole future prospect is unemployment.
An additional concern is that the acceleration of the liberalisation process and our future privatisations risk making the situation worse.
This social situation is, without doubt, connected to the record level of non-participation in the last elections.
The Algeria of today is defined by the citizens' movement in Kabylia, formed in spring 2001 to condemn the repression and killing of 115 young people, is still active in Algeria.
It is defined by the women's collective, by the lawyers who are defending more than 150 of the movement's militants who have been detained, some for more than two months.
Algeria is also defined by remarkable aspirations to construct a society which reconciles its identity, fundamental freedoms and development which will benefit all people.
The future of Algeria certainly does not lie in repressing democratic aspirations, in restricting the freedom of the press. Instead, it lies in taking into account the often courageous action of many different associations which defend, for example, women's rights, which call for the family code to be repealed, which care for children who have been scarred by violence, or which defend human rights.
Yes, we must revive formal EU-Algerian relations, since the Algerian people have almost single-handedly been coping with an explosion of terrorist extremism for a decade now, whereas other countries only realised the extent of the danger after 11 September.
A great deal of criticism and also many expectations have been expressed by our Algerian counterparts, originating in particular from associations, independent trade unions, students and the Kabyle movement, regarding the lack of prior consultation in Algeria and also the content of the association agreement.
With regard to the latter, Algeria must, first and foremost, respect its international commitments on freedom but there is also the question of the social consequences of opening-up the borders and markets and of a policy that, it is claimed, is entirely liberal, at a time when the Union is presenting itself as a fortress.
Lastly, it would, without doubt, be tragic if the genuine democratic potential that exists in Algerian society continues to be wasted, or even stifled.
The Algerian authorities, as well as the European Union, must listen to these aspirations.
I support what my fellow Members have said with regard to the Union; namely, how can the troika that visited Algiers some days ago openly bring up the question of human rights, which is a positive step, and also welcome the organisation of elections, which caused a general uproar among many Algerians?
Given that these elections were boycotted by several democratic parties and by an entire region, Kabylia, I feel that we should, at least, be slightly dubious.
It is true, the economic and social situation of the Maghreb people is explosive and the measures introduced by the partnership to defuse the situation have fizzled out!
I would like to end by warning the European Parliament against taking any decision contrary to international law which, since 1991, has been calling for a referendum on self-determination in Western Sahara.
Parliament has so far resisted giving in to the politics of the fait accompli and any deviation or change of position is not likely to be of help to the Arab Maghreb Union.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am one of the Members whom Mr Cohn-Bendit referred to, who does not share the approach taken, although I do congratulate Mr Cohn-Bendit and General Morillon, who is unfortunately not here with us this morning, for the efforts that they have made to try to develop, using this strategic concept of 'Maghreb integration', a possible key to relations between the European Union and Maghreb.
I do not believe in this solution, because I think that it is impossible to promote integration mechanisms between such different countries, some of which are fundamentally anti-democratic, several of which are becoming increasingly so.
I wholeheartedly support the criticism of the Commission expressed by Mr Cohn-Bendit and other Members on the question of Algeria.
The question of Tunisia still remains.
I think that the problem faced by the European Union today is that of strengthening democratic opposition in these countries.
We cannot be seen to be demanding with regard to the extremely poor countries of Central or Western Africa, and totally indulgent, as we are, with Tunisia led by President Ben 'Ã  vie' - you are aware that he has changed his name and is no longer President Ben Ali, but President Ben 'Ã  vie' [for life].
This is the result of a referendum in which 99% of voters voted in favour of this change to the Constitution. It is absolutely intolerable!
I would like to thank Mrs Napoletano, because we have at least managed to ensure that the Commission undertakes to no longer admit defeat by the local governments in the democratisation programmes.
I think that this reform is fundamental and we will closely monitor the way in which the Commission implements this.
I have taken careful note of the comments made by Mr Galeote Quecedo and other Members.
Specific reports must at once be drafted on each country, particularly Algeria and Tunisia.
Mr Cohn-Bendit undertook to do this in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy.
I note that the Group of the European People's Party agrees with the position adopted.
Mr Esteve's comments lead me to believe that he also agrees with this.
I therefore feel that the calendar of the Committee on Foreign Affairs must include the reports on each of these countries which, I reiterate, differ greatly from one another, because most of them have very little democracy.
Mr President, in a recent survey in Morocco, 82% of secondary school students expressed their desire to emigrate to Europe.
Last year, more than 100 000 Maghreb citizens tried to enter the European Union illegally.
The differences in economic growth and wealth and the democratic differential between the European Union and the Maghreb is increasing.
The gulf is widening.
Furthermore, the most recent political processes in the European Union are demonstrating the extent to which this tragedy of the mass exodus of population leads to greater social and political upheaval, with the risk that this may lead to a growth in populism and the extreme right.
We do not have much time left to reverse this trend and it seems to me that neither the Council nor the Commission realise how extremely serious the problems relating to the development prospects of the Maghreb and the countries of the South and East of the Mediterranean in general are.
There is not much time left, perhaps a decade, but not much more.
This Parliament had expressed the view that Euro-Mediterranean policy should be the top priority of the European Union's external policy.
Given the way things are developing, perhaps we should reach the conclusion that the European Union's policy on the Maghreb and Euro-Mediterranean relations should also be one of our main internal priorities.
Mr President, the European Union's foreign policy in the globalised world we are living in must not recognise borders, but the neighbouring countries must receive special attention, both those of the East and those of the Mediterranean, and in particular the Maghreb countries, whose relations with the European Union are the subject of today's report.
I must therefore thank the rapporteurs for having included in their reports one of my amendments, which relates to another working group within the Euro-Mediterranean Inter-Parliamentary Forum, in addition to the one dealing with the situation in the Western Sahara.
That group must deal with the problem of migration, especially that which originates from Africa, where Morocco plays a decisive role, because, as well as economic dialogue, we need political, social and cultural dialogue.
Commissioner, in relation to Algeria, I am concerned about Kabilia and the future of the Berbers.
Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate Mr Morillon and Mr Cohn-Bendit on their excellent report, which has tried to incorporate everybody's contributions.
However, despite the work done, our group cannot vote in favour of the report because certain elements we consider to be important are lacking and this could be corrected.
One of them relates to the respect the European Parliament must show for international law.
The European Parliament draws up laws and directives and therefore its relationship with the UN must be one of respect and support.
We are therefore concerned about the fact that a crucial issue such as the holding of a self-determination referendum for the Saharaoui people is not suitably dealt with in this report.
This would mean guaranteeing and promoting greater democratic respect in that region, both for the countries of the Maghreb and in their relations with the European Union.
We are therefore presenting an amendment in this regard.
The second issue, which is also very important, and which is partly included in the report, is the recognition that our influence and participation in the economic development of the Maghreb is contradictory.
We are investing and increasing trade and, nevertheless, the consequence of that investment is that the rationalisation of the countryside, and that of trade and services, is creating more unemployment and depriving young people of their future prospects, which is leading to an increase in emigration, which is horrendous but understandable.
We believe that the fact that this report does not adequately deal with this crucial phenomenon is a shortcoming which must be corrected, together with others which relate to improving democratic conditions, as other speakers have already said.
Mr President, cooperation between the European Union and the Maghreb countries must be based on a number of basic principles.
However, I feel that we have the duty, first and foremost, to point out the report's serious omission to mention the religious persecution of Christians and Jews, who are not free to practise their faith publicly in these countries.
There has recently been an extremely serious incident in these very countries in which a Jewish religious building was damaged, and this should have been mentioned.
Moreover, we cannot continue to maintain the populist stance that opening up our borders is a way to help these countries in future.
Exactly the opposite is true: if anything, the solution is to set up effective measures in fields such as small and medium-sized enterprise and European craft trades in these countries, but such measures are not receiving support.
Therefore, we oppose the indiscriminate opening up of our borders to immigration but we would like, if we may, to stress a fundamental point, namely that the Maghreb countries must undertake to take back the illegal immigrants which the Member States are labouring to repatriate.
Mr President, of course, like all the previous speakers, and particularly the rapporteurs, I am in favour of a strengthened Euro-Mediterranean partnership.
This partnership is of interest both to the countries bordering the Mediterranean and to the whole of the European Union.
And I feel that we should focus, first and foremost, on our relations with the Arab Maghreb Union.
The Maghreb Union remains a pious hope, however, with the creation of this Union encountering a series of obstacles which, unfortunately, have not yet been overcome.
In a few days' time, the meeting of the AMU Heads of State will be held in Algiers and I would like to highlight one of the obstacles which continues to sour relations between Algeria and Morocco. I wish to discuss the conflict in Western Sahara and the future of the Western Saharan people.
The rapporteurs quite rightly touched upon this.
As chair of the ad hoc delegation sent on behalf of Parliament to this region, to Tinduf and El-Ayun, I cannot stress enough that we must find a political solution, it is a matter of urgency.
The fate of thousands of Western Saharan men, women and children is at stake, people who, for 26 years, have been living in extremely harsh conditions and are awaiting a solution that recognises their rights and their dignity.
To resolve the situation, a good-will agreement must firstly be reached between the main countries that are directly involved, namely Algeria and Morocco.
I sincerely hope that the meeting between the AMU Heads of State will enable progress to be made in this area.
Mr President, as some of the previous speakers have pointed out, and as the rapporteurs for the report also observe in recital G, the present conflict concerning Western Sahara remains an obstacle to further regional integration.
It cannot be emphasised enough that this 27-year-old conflict is a major problem, and not only for parties directly involved.
What, therefore, I in actual fact miss in the report is a considered opinion discussing the peace plan in actual fact adopted in 1991 by all the parties directly involved in the conflict.
Along with this, there is a more detailed agreement signed by the parties, that is to say Morocco and Polisario, in 1997 in Houston.
Instead, the rejected third way, or what is termed James Baker's framework agreement, is talked of and continued with, instead of a conclusion being reached as to what we are to do to implement the peace agreement adopted by the parties.
That, I think, is a major shortcoming.
Mr President, I wish to begin, very briefly, by expressing my agreement with what Mrs LalumiÃšre has said, because I believe that the issue of the Western Sahara must be looked at before any report on the Arab Maghreb Union can be considered.
In any event, with regard to the report - and I offer my congratulations to both rapporteurs - I wish to highlight some points that have been made and some omissions.
Amongst the points that have been made, I would highlight in particular the value attached to the political dimension; with regard to the omissions, I would mention in particular the insufficient value attached to something that could be extremely important and which concerns the Agadir declaration - and also the Valencia declaration - which enabled a significant partnership effort to be made in the field of Justice And Home Affairs, and consequently, for there to be a support base for combating terrorism and trafficking in human beings.
Although economic issues are of undeniable importance, the political value attached to this partnership is, despite everything, and I repeat, in terms of resolving the problem of Western Sahara, a fundamental aspect, which must be emphasised.
Mr President, I would like to ask for your forgiveness since the Convention on the future of Europe is going to change things, as it is going to mean many meetings and much effort, but we will get there if we make that effort and if we are willing to talk, and that is what I wanted to do, by saying the following:
We all have an interest in there being a constructive relationship between the European Union and the Arab Maghreb Union, but surely that constructive relationship must be based on a whole range of aspects, including political ones.
If the Union wishes to act correctly on an international level, that action must be based on conflict prevention and crisis management and regrettably there is an historic conflict in the Maghreb region involving several countries and peoples which has not gone away: the Sahara conflict.
The positive thing about the report presented by Mr Morillon and Mr Cohn-Bendit is firstly that it acknowledges the existence of that conflict, something which the European Union had not done for many years.
This conflict was not on the Union's agenda.
This conflict must now appear on that agenda as a priority so that we can contribute, on the basis of international law, to the quest for a fair and negotiated solution which safeguards the rights of the peoples, beginning with the Saharaoui people's right to self-determination and so that we can thereby put an end to an issue which causes great instability in terms of the future of the Arab Maghreb Union and the countries it consists of.
In this respect, the situation is still regrettably deadlocked and it falls to the European Union to apply pressure so that it ceases to be so, and to apply pressure in a good sense, because it would benefit the region and would benefit Europe.
Mr President, the intentions set out in this resolution appear, at least on the surface, to be good.
In fact, the meaning of this document is, as usual, elusive.
In reality, Europe says a lot but does very little, simply because, deep down, it attaches little importance to its relationship with the Maghreb.
This situation arises from the distribution of power in Europe: this European Union, which is dominated by the northern countries - and, what is more, the list of speakers this morning shows this very clearly - is somewhat indifferent towards the Mediterranean.
It could also be due to the fact that, for certain Atlantic interests, it is important that the Mediterranean does not become an autonomous framework for cooperation.
We talk about it, but we almost always talk about it from the point of view of human rights.
That is a way of not talking about it and, what is more, I would point out in passing, allowing ourselves to be used by an opposition which is never asked to justify itself with regard to democracy.
This being the case, our Maghreb neighbours need not fear: France will do what Europe does not.
France will do it because of its history, its natural inclination, its interest, and also because it naturally cooperates with the Maghreb countries as part of the French-speaking community and also, in quite a broad context, as part of the community of French-speaking culture.
I do not think that Europe's lack of concern about the Mediterranean matters much.
In fact, it is better for it not to be concerned, for France will implement a policy dictated by the historical and geographical context, even if, for now, its politics and Eurocentric perspective tend to somewhat hinder its actions in this field.
Mr President, the Commission endorses the excellent report by Mr Morillon and Mr Cohn-Bendit and the accompanying resolution.
Regional development cooperation with a grouping such as the Arab Maghreb Union is entirely in keeping with the policy guidelines formulated by the Euro-Mediterranean foreign ministers at their summit in Valencia on 22 and 23 April.
Thanks to seven newly signed association agreements, North-South cooperation between the EU and its Mediterranean partners now has a proper legal and economic framework.
An agreement will be signed with Lebanon on 17 June and negotiations with Syria are continuing.
Once these are finalised, the whole set of association agreements between the EU and Barcelona Process partners will be completed.
But there is something more we have to do if we want to put this on a really solid footing.
We have to persuade our partners to engage in South-South cooperation.
That point was made again at Valencia. It was made in the decisions on trade taken by the Barcelona Process trade ministers when they met in Toledo on 19 March.
The same issues were also raised at the meeting of the industry ministers which I attended a week later.
This decision sets out to facilitate trade and investment amongst the countries of the southern Mediterranean.
Working parties will look in detail at how this closer regional cooperation will function.
From a more general political point of view, the Commission welcomes more frequent meetings between the Arab Maghreb Union countries and looks forward to an AMU summit in the near future.
There is another initiative that the Commission wants to encourage: the Agadir Declaration of 8 May 2001 in which four Arab countries - Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt and Jordan - proposed the setting up of a free trade area.
The Commission hopes that other countries in the region will join this initiative.
In addition to political support the Commission is willing to provide technical assistance, not just for the AMU but also for the Agadir Declaration.
There are two additional points I would like to make on the report.
As far as democracy and human rights are concerned, the Commission obviously shares the view put forward in the draft resolution on the importance of respecting the provisions of the association agreement.
In this respect, sustained action is needed by the EU institutions to improve the situation.
The Commission is currently planning programmes in Algeria and Tunisia through MEDA and the European initiative for democracy and human rights, and will continue to do so independently.
With regard to financial cooperation the Commission is fully aware of the importance of covering the regional dimension.
Ten per cent of funds available under the MEDA programme will be earmarked for regional measures.
Some of these resources could be dedicated to fund intra-Maghreb cooperation.
I will pass on the message from the debate to Mr Patten, who is responsible for this dossier.
Unfortunately he is on mission today.
Thank you very much, Mr Liikanen.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
The next item is the recommendation for second reading of the report (A5-0180/2002) by Mrs Roth-Behrendt, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council directive amending Council Directive 76/768/EEC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to cosmetic products (15073/1/2001 - C5-0072/2002 - 2000/0077 (COD))
Mr President, I hope we will manage today to conclude a legislative process that was first discussed in Parliament a number of years ago.
This legislation is, of course, concerned with the protection of health, and we all naturally want cosmetic products - soaps, shampoos, perfumes - to be healthy, which means not presenting any hazard to the people who use them.
All Members of this House have a natural interest in making the European cosmetics industry competitive and keeping it that way.
We have, of course, always borne in mind that jobs are tied in with the manufacture of cosmetics and that these jobs deserve to be safeguarded.
Presenting as rapporteur the committee's second reading to Parliament today, I can tell you that the committee adopted it by 44 votes in favour, with two abstentions, that is to say, with a very, very large majority right across all the political groups.
That is the way we want it.
What do we want to achieve here today?
We want this second reading to alter the Council's Common Position, which is poor, feeble, and far from forward-looking.
The Ministers of the Member States, assembled in Council, have missed their chance to set a course and also to hear what their peoples want.
What, then, do the people of Europe want?
If you were to conduct a survey, it is likely that you would, in many countries, hear very diverse opinions.
Most, though, would agree that there is a sufficient choice of soaps, deodorants, perfumes, and lipsticks.
We do not need hundreds and thousands of them if animals have to undergo lengthy torture to produce them.
So let there be a stop to animal experiments in the field of cosmetics.
You would certainly find an overwhelming majority of the public in favour of that, and in Parliament as well.
Right, we said in the committee second reading, let there be no more animal experiments in the field of cosmetics.
We also go even further and say that, from a certain point, sales of cosmetics tested on animals must cease.
We are convinced that this is the only way that we will step up pressure in favour of alternative methods of testing and on the search for tests in which animals are not tortured, in which animals do not have to suffer.
What do we want in addition to that?
We want perfumed ingredients that bring out allergic reactions in people and are recognised by experts as allergenic, to be indicated on labels.
Not in the least do we want to ban them.
We want them to be labelled so that people with allergies can make their choice.
We also want consumers to be better able to ascertain how long cosmetics will last, so that they know, when they open a cosmetic or a sun cream, whether they will be able to use the product next year or whether it will have become harmful to health or have lost its effectiveness.
All groups in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy were very much of one mind on these various proposals.
I hope that, when we vote at noon today, we too will be united in an overwhelming majority that will show the Council how very poor we consider its Common Position to be.
I would have liked the Commission and Commissioner Liikanen to have been a bit more courageous and not waited for an absolute majority at second reading in Parliament to force them to change their mind.
I would have liked the Commission to have demonstrated a bit more flexibility and courage on some points, as, in my experience, Mr Liikanen otherwise usually does.
I hope that we here are at least in agreement that this partnership works.
I would now also like to say something about this partnership.
There is indeed a great deal of disagreement in this House, and some of us still maintain that disagreements are a good thing, in that they make clear to the public the differences between us and the reasons why they should vote for one party or for another.
I must admit that I am, at the moment, more concerned about the matter in hand.
I am very grateful to members of the other groups for their cooperation, which has been extremely fair and thoroughly accommodating.
Looking up at the representatives of the cosmetics industry, who are sitting up in the gallery and waiting with understandable interest to see what is to be decided today, I can only say that I value the largely fair cooperation afforded by the cosmetics industry, who have an important stake in these matters, and I know that constructive cooperation also builds trust.
All the bodies which have played their part so far - Parliament, industry, consumers' organisations, and also the organisations representing people with allergies - are convinced that Parliament, today at noon, will have a unique chance to at last enact a law that will, in a couple of years, activate legislation that people want and need.
I hope that, at noon today, we will be courageous enough to show this to the Council and the Commission by an overwhelming majority.
My dear colleagues in other groups, you will have my support in doing so.
I hope that I will also have yours.
We will confirm this today and, if necessary, in a conciliation procedure.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the seventh modification of the directive on cosmetic products has once again brought two issues before this Parliament which have been widely debated since the first directive was adopted in 1976.
The last revision was the sixth, in 1993.
The issues I am referring to are the prohibition of animal experimentation and the prohibition of the marketing within the European Union of products which have been tested on animals.
The rapporteur, Mrs Roth-Behrendt, has worked hard and seriously, maintaining the coherence of the Commission's text and improving it, particularly in view of the illogical proposal of lifting the prohibition on marketing.
My group has always supported this amendment and has agreed with the rapporteur that, after so many years of work and unfulfilled expectations in relation to ending animal experimentation, we must deal with this issue once and for all, setting precise timescales, urging and motivating the cosmetics industry to mobilise all its available resources so that, without in any way jeopardising the safety of its products, experiments on animals will be stopped for good as soon as possible.
The Group of the European Peoples' Party, however, has always believed that full compliance with this directive made it necessary for the rapporteur's initial proposal to show a degree of flexibility, while allowing for certain exceptions since, although it is true that the majority of cosmetic products offer the consumer complete safety without their ingredients having to be tested on animals, there are certain cases in which scientists have still not been able to find reliable alternative methods for particular products which are not totally superfluous, such as sun products or creams, which provide a degree of protection from sunlight.
In this respect, the work not just of my group but of all the parliamentary groups has focused on the identification of these cases and their incorporation into the text of the directive, and the rapporteur has been highly receptive to this.
Without allowing the cosmetics industry to delay eliminating its animal experimentation practices, the proposal for a directive allows exceptions for very specific tests and for a maximum period of ten years.
Fortunately, I believe that this amendment has the support of the whole of the European Peoples' Party and that, when it comes to it, it will have the support of the whole House.
I am convinced that a vote in favour by the European Parliament, not just in relation to this amendment, but the whole of the proposal, will finally bring into being regulations which combine animal protection and consumer protection in a balanced and fair manner.
Mr President, I support both the line of the proposals which have come from our colleague Mrs Roth-Behrendt and the objective which many people in Parliament have been trying to achieve for the past ten years.
No other issue has taken Parliament so long to deal with as that of animal testing in the matter of cosmetic products.
So I think the message that should go back to the Member States is that this Parliament believes that, until we get serious, the industry will not get truly serious.
I accept that there are a large number of areas where there is cause for concern in terms of medical research and extremely difficult and serious tests for which no valid alternatives have yet been produced.
But I remain convinced that, unless we are able to send a clear signal by reasserting the position we took at first reading, there will not be that incentive that comes from the clear knowledge that these sanctions are there and will be implemented.
The test ban and the marketing ban have not been complied with.
We cannot afford further delays.
I would say to everyone, including the Member States who tried very hard to bring us a common position that we could accept, we still have to try harder.
The answer is to send a signal at second reading, so that the rapporteur and our colleagues of all parties have the strongest possible negotiating position when we come to one of the most serious processes of conciliation we have ever had in this Parliament.
Mr President, animal testing is carried out on a huge scale across the European Union and the world to ensure that products like chemicals and new medicines and pharmaceuticals are safe for humans to use.
The public has long made clear that it wants an end to animal testing for no better purpose than to ensure the development of yet more vanity products to fill our bathroom shelves, such as all the deodorants, soaps, and hair shampoos to be found on supermarket shelves.
Yet this debate has dragged on year after year with it becoming increasingly difficult for the public's wish to be turned into practice.
Now we have a classic conflict between the Parliament, which has made it clear that it wants an end to animal testing, and the Council, which has done its best to ensure that no marketing ban is introduced.
We have made it quite clear that an animal testing ban within the European Union alone is insufficient.
It simply means that animals will be tested upon in countries outside the European Union where no proper supervision can be undertaken.
A marketing ban has to be introduced, pressure has to be put on industry to ensure that new alternatives are developed.
The proposals being put forward by the EPP have been particularly helpful.
My group will be supporting Mrs Roth-Behrendt's call for a marketing ban to be introduced at the earliest moment.
However it is likely that it will be the EPP amendment which goes through today.
That leaves open the option for us all of an ambitious and yet realistic settlement, an agreement between the Parliament and the Council which can end this matter once and for all, putting pressure on the industry but not creating insoluble problems.
I hope that today in the vote later in this plenary we can once and for all put an end to this issue and put an end to unnecessary animal suffering.
Mr President, I support the rapporteur's position.
It is completely unacceptable to torture animals in order to, supposedly, improve ourselves.
Contrary to what the cosmetics industry states, it is possible to produce and sell safe products whose ingredients have not been tested on animals.
Many companies moved away from these archaic practices years ago and the overwhelming majority of consumers want an immediate ban.
It is unfortunate, therefore, that both the Commission and the Council are still taking the side of the cosmetics industry and those responsible for profit-driven torture of animals.
The proposed ban would apply only to products tested in the EU and would allow companies to export testing to other parts of the world.
This is unacceptable.
We want the practice to stop, not to be relocated.
The Commission's failure to implement a marketing and test ban - which was meant to come into effect in 1998 - is completely unacceptable, and to argue that a marketing ban would face problems in the WTO is nonsense.
There is a legal precedent.
The adoption of the Dog and Cat Fur Act in the US showed that animal welfare can be a legitimate reason for restrictions.
As far as labelling goes, I am very disappointed that the Council did not adopt Parliament's recommendation in the first reading that "tested on animals" should be clearly stated on the product label.
The consumer has a right to know this.
In relation to CMR substances, which are allowed in cosmetics, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy reaffirmed its first reading request to ban CMRs in cosmetics unless evaluated and accepted as safe by the Scientific Committee.
In fact, the committee's position on CMR substances has been strengthened in line with the latest position of the Scientific Committee.
In the light of the fact that the Commission recently banned CMRs in its review of chemical directives but has included it as an exemption, it is ridiculous that a substance can be banned from paint and polish but not from something that is put on your body.
It is completely hypocritical to argue for the continued torture of animals in the interests of safety, whilst at the same time allowing dangerous products.
Mr President, on this issue, we are completely in agreement with the rapporteur, Mrs Roth-Behrendt, and with the decision taken by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
We believe that animal experiments should be restricted to those areas in which they are of vital importance to human health, for example that of medical products.
Obviously, animal experiments must not take place in connection with cosmetic products.
We are therefore in favour both of a total ban on such animal experiments and of a marketing ban.
It must also be realised that an effective ban of this kind in the EU would have a very beneficial effect on the whole of the world market.
It would provide arguments in the global market for completely doing away with animal experiments in this area.
It would show that there are alternatives.
This issue has been discussed for a long time, indeed for too long.
I am amazed at the Commission's attitude, which must be characterised as antiquated, and at the failure to realise that it is time to take this decision.
A genuine decision in favour of a marketing ban would expedite technical developments leading to alternatives.
That is in itself something positive.
The possibility has been mentioned of a conflict with the WTO.
I think the risk was exaggerated earlier on but, if a decision of this kind is challenged in the WTO, it is obviously a battle in which the European Union must engage, and engage in fully, for it would be an important conflict of principle concerning the right to enable animal and human health to take precedence over the free market.
That is a right one should of course be prepared to fight for.
Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur on her excellent work, although some of the issues she has dealt with have caused some confusion.
With regard to the majority of them, we believe that we cannot make any exception to the fundamental ideals relating to growth and civilisation in which we firmly believe and which Parliament has never failed to uphold.
This applies to animal experimentation, amongst other practices, where continuing to fail to apply a limit, thereby delaying research into alternative methods of experimentation, means failing to encourage research itself and continuing to use practices which are in conflict with those goals of prosperity and civilisation.
The only point in Mrs Roth-Behrendt's report which I do not understand is the point relating to Amendment No 28, previously Amendment No 26, to the Commission text, which contains the list of allergenic substances.
Clearly, the respect to be shown towards animals must also be shown in equal measure to human beings, and it is therefore our responsibility to place a limit on the use of substances with proven allergenic capacity.
Out of the 23 substances listed in the amendment, there are certainly 13, as the rapporteur rightly points out, with proven allergenic capacity, and it is therefore justified to place a limit on their content in products.
Then there are another 13 whose excessive toxicity has yet to be proved, as the rapporteur implies, moreover, specifying that the Scientific Committee has recommended limits to be placed on their use, purely as a precautionary measure and pending more thorough analysis.
This is an indirect precaution in the sense that there can be absolutely no risk of toxicity - always assuming that their might have been - in the use of these ingredients according to the limits laid down.
The fact is that these last 13 substances include 11 defined as natural essential oils which may as well not be used at all as be used in the quantities laid down, and the concern is therefore not that the quality of the product will suffer but that local farming economies, particularly in the south of Europe and particularly in France and Italy, which produce the basic ingredients - jasmine, citrus fruit in general and bergamot, in particular - will be wiped out.
Our group has always stressed how crucial it is to lay down strict standards in the field of animal welfare that apply right across the European Union.
I believe that all animals are God's creatures. Accordingly, each animal should be treated by us with respect and not - as is unfortunately often the case these days - used as a disposable item.
I am convinced that we received animals to use as food and - insofar as strictly necessary - to develop and test medicines.
Any other use of animals, or should I say, abuse of animals, is simply unacceptable.
We are therefore in favour of a European ban on the use of animal testing for cosmetic products.
However, unlike the Council, we are of the opinion that a European testing ban alone is not sufficient, because this means that animal tests outside of Europe will simply continue.
Only a testing ban in combination with a European trading ban on cosmetics tested on animals will force the cosmetics industry to look seriously into developing alternative methods.
However, I would like to note in this connection that we must ensure that producers in developing countries are not treated any worse than European producers, particularly as this contravenes the WTO regulations.
It is therefore of major importance for countries outside of Europe to be brought up-to-date in good time in order to be able to comply with the bans.
I would therefore ask you to vote in favour of Mrs Roth-Behrendt's proposal.
In this way, we send a clear message to the Council that we believe that only in this way can unnecessary and unacceptable animal suffering which accompanies the development and sales of cosmetics be brought to an end.
Let us hope that with this, after years of unnecessary delays, the abuses in this sector will come to an end.
I thank you for your attention.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my dear Mrs Roth-Behrendt, animal experiments in the field of cosmetics need to be done away with, and as quickly as possible.
This House decided that as long ago as 1993, but at that time we had a weak partner alongside us.
It appears that we still do.
The weak partner in question is the Commission, which has, over recent years, not got a grip on consistently putting these European resolutions across at the WTO and getting our partners there to grasp soon enough that we are ready to go ahead.
We want to force them to take positive action.
That is why, Mr Liikanen - despite the high personal regard I have for you - I find your presentation very disappointing and hope that our next debate will see us at last getting a ban on animal experiments, which as far as I am concerned could be in five or six years' time.
What is crucial, though, is that, after those five or six years have elapsed, the cut-off point must be reached.
Everyone must be aware that, after five or six years, experiments on animals will be over, apart from those scientifically-justified exceptions that we intend to lay down here and now.
We know that there is an exception to every rule, but exceptions must remain just that and nothing more.
That is why we cannot, in five years' time, have a new document presented to us and the debate starting all over again from the beginning.
We cannot explain it to our children and nor can we explain it to the animal.
The Commission has enough clout to sort this out at a sufficiently early stage with our WTO partners around the world.
Our experience with leghold traps, and traps with animal skins, is an outstanding demonstration of this.
If we involve our WTO partners in the debate at an early enough stage rather than take them by surprise, a way can very well be found.
Commissioner, I really would like to encourage you to go down this road.
You are in character enough of a man to play the part of an outrider throughout the world.
I very much want to motivate you to do that.
It is dreadful to derive beauty from animal suffering.
Animal tests should only take place as an absolute necessity, and that is not happening in the case of cosmetics.
This is why a ban on both sales and testing should be introduced.
The sooner the better.
It is unfortunate that compromises are required in this respect.
Labelling on all products tested on animals must now become compulsory with immediate effect.
It is of major importance for industry, science and the government to invest more in alternative methods, as far too little use is still being made of current knowledge due to this approach.
The validation procedures must be accelerated.
Forty thousand animals annually are forty thousand animals too many.
The replacement, reduction and refinement of animal tests are a question of civilisation.
Animals are far too beautiful to be treated so dreadfully.
Mr President, I should first of all like to express my appreciation for Mrs Roth-Behrendt, for her sound work and for her perseverance in this debate.
As Mr van den Bos said a moment ago, forty thousand animal tests annually are forty thousand too many.
Twenty-five years ago, the Body Shop launched cosmetics that were not tested on animals.
It has proved for 25 years that it is possible.
This Body Shop policy should now become standard European policy.
At the earliest opportunity.
It is beyond me why the Christian-Democrats want to wait for another ten years.
If we really want this, we simply have to say: as soon as possible.
Even if this results in a trade conflict with America or any other partners in the WTO.
A reduction in animal suffering is the express wish of the European people, and we as MEPs must comply with this.
Mr President, the appeal is often made that the United States of America and those countries participating in its unilateral war against terrorism share common values.
What they are is never spoken aloud.
It is nevertheless well known that Bush's values do not incorporate a high level of commercial ethics.
There are no moral values in the United States that can be used to justify hormone-free food, plant varieties that are not genetically modified or cosmetics that have not been tested on animals.
In this context the Council common position on effecting a marketing ban on animal-tested cosmetics, subject to permission by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, is untenable.
At the OECD, decisions are taken on the basis of unanimity and they do not have to be explained.
That makes it possible for the USA to dictate to the EU on the question of values.
It would be more honest to clarify whether a marketing ban on animal-tested cosmetics is incompatible with WTO rules.
If necessary the matter could be referred to the WTO's dispute settlement procedure where a ban could be upheld without the opposing party being able to dictate the final outcome alone.
The WTO must look into whether world trade is also possible with reference to ethical criteria.
The European Parliament has used the same solid criteria in its desire to ban animal experiments and in its demand elsewhere for a sales ban on animal-tested cosmetics in the EU.
Mr President, this is a debate which is bedevilled with hypocrisy.
We see products on sale claiming to be free from animal testing when the manufacturers know perfectly well that the products may not have been tested on animals, but that the ingredients were.
We see countries like my own, claiming to have banned animal testing, when all they have done is export the problem to countries where animals are even less respected.
What we need and what this report brings us towards is a ban on the marketing of products tested on animals.
Of course, what we need is to ensure that safety is our key criterion.
Human health must not be put at risk by what we are doing.
We must bear in mind the range of products that we are talking about - it is not just the cosmetics that we put on our faces; it is also the toothpastes, the sunscreens, the baby products, the lens cleansers and so on.
Our aim must be a realistic timetable to phase out products which have been tested on animals by setting a deadline for each of those tests.
We have to reconcile the interests of human health and those of animal welfare, and it can be done.
Our amendments would ban with immediate effect those tests for which alternatives have been validated.
It would set a deadline for each of the others, according to the stage reached in the process of validating an alternative, up to a maximum of five years.
It would acknowledge that for the three tests for which there are as yet no alternatives there would be a maximum of ten years in which to find alternatives, after which those tests would stop too.
We are tired of waiting on this issue.
We have waited five years; we have waited 1,825 days since this measure should have been brought in.
In that time, we have seen 190,000 animals suffer and be destroyed.
We want to bring that to an end.
We need safe cosmetic products.
We need human health to be ensured and we need animal testing to be stopped.
It is time to bring this issue to a conclusion.
Mr President, I have been most surprised by the arguments from the Council and the Commission suggesting that a marketing ban would be, as they say, "not WTO-secure", yet the WTO rules in this area are distinctly unclear.
It is just as likely that a marketing ban will prove to be "WTO-secure" as it will "WTO-insecure".
The point is this: the arguments about WTO rules are purely hypothetical.
It is not entirely appropriate in my view to move from the arguments of substance for and against a marketing ban to a much more convoluted and esoteric debate about WTO law.
A more honest approach - the approach advocated by this Parliament - is to adopt a marketing ban as soon as possible, and then deal with the WTO aspects separately in the unlikely event that our laws are successfully challenged in the WTO.
That would be a better approach, both right in principle and right in practice.
Commissioner, today I have to accuse you of hostility to industry.
What do you actually think will happen to European industry now?
First we are told that, yes, the end will be in 1998, then it is 2000, next 2002, and now you come along with a presentation and have absolutely nothing to say.
How on earth do you think industrialists work?
Such a thing could only occur to a functionary who has never had to put even a brass farthing into his own industry.
The potential has been there for ages for European industry to have a whole new boom in cosmetics.
It is you who have prevented it!
In 1996, four million people signed up; they were artists and beautiful women who like using cosmetics.
Now you come along and tell us that, in the European Union, we do not want to torture animals any more; instead, we will do it just over the border.
This Parliament, the artists, the beautiful women - how stupid do you think we are?
What do you take us for?
Do you really think we are the sort of racists and xenophobes who will not have dumb beasts tormented here in the European Union, but will let it happen to dogs in Hungary or Poland?
That strikes me as monstrous, and as an insult to the four million people who signed their names to protest against such things.
You know, there is a fine saying to the effect that 'the day will come when men will look upon the murder of animals as they now look upon the murder of men.'
That was not said by some crazy animal rights activist, but by Leonardo da Vinci, perhaps the greatest artist who ever lived.
Never again, Commissioner, will you be referred to in the same sentence as Leonardo da Vinci.
You are certainly not a great artist, you are certainly not sensitive, but I do think you might have some idea of what we are talking about today.
I would like to thank Mrs Roth-Behrendt for what she has achieved, and especially also Mrs Christina GarcÃ­a-Orcoyen.
An alliance the like of which you rarely come across, and I think that you, Commissioner, should be afraid of them.
Mr President, Commissioner, I wish first to congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work, at both first and second readings.
This report formalised proposals on issues on which the Commission proposal was not sufficiently wide-ranging or ambitious and the common position has once again failed to take up some of these proposals.
I therefore feel that there are three matters to which Parliament must draw the attention of both the Commission and the Council.
Firstly, the need to ban all potentially carcinogenic or toxic substances in cosmetic products; secondly, a ban on the use of fragrances in products specifically designed for children, given the risks of allergic reaction potentially associated with these fragrances; and, thirdly, the hottest topic of this debate; testing products on animals.
In my view, both the Council and the Commission's positions are unacceptable.
On the one hand, the Commission is taking a step backwards with regard to previous legislation; in other words, when faced with non-compliance with previous legislation, the Commission prefers to stop talking about a marketing ban.
Where the Council is concerned, a step forwards has been taken, because it has referred to the OECD the regulation of a matter that falls to the European Union to define.
I do not know whether this recourse to the OECD is just another symptom of the intergovernmental shift that has been affecting the Council of late and I therefore believe that the rapporteur's position is the most appropriate one: we must ban testing on animals in Europe, we must move towards a ban on the marketing of these products and towards alternative methods.
Mr President, I shall endeavour to confine my comments to one point which I feel is important and which has to do with the facility to use animal testing to check certain products where there is no alternative method available.
In brief, we need to make sure we vote in favour of the amendments which allow alternative methods to be used, especially for toxicity and reproduction, for which there are currently no satisfactory alternative tests.
For the rest, I too am in complete agreement with the rapporteur that, where there are alternative methods which allow animal testing to be avoided, we should use these alternative in vitro methods.
Consequently, what I and my fellow Members who tabled this amendment are trying to do is to allow alternative methods to be used, but not in cases in which there is no alternative to animal testing.
I must point out that the first priority is human health and then, of course, respect and protection for animals.
I hope that Parliament will vote in favour of these amendments which give us this facility until such time as these tests can be replaced by alternative in vitro methods.
I must reiterate and stress that, as there are no satisfactory in vitro methods available, it would be irresponsible and absurd to do away with every facility for which there is, as yet, no alternative method.
Mr President, I agree with all the speakers so far.
It is unacceptable that when we are making such enormous scientific advances we still accept the infliction of pain on small animals in order to find out whether a new face cream is safe.
I would like to express my strong support for the report.
The rapporteur has struck the right compromise: the ban would not be immediate but could come into force in five years, and that means that, in effect, we have given the companies concerned at least 15 years' notice since we first started discussing this about ten years ago.
I also support the idea that we should demonstrate our own responsibility - a concept which is foreign to the Greens - by introducing a marketing ban as tests are developed where at present there are no alternatives available, even though we then have to set a deadline for these tests, perhaps ten years ahead.
Parliament's report will give the search for alternatives a new urgency.
I have two questions to the Commission and I hope that when Mr Liikanen answers he will address himself specifically to my points on Amendments Nos 21 and 28.
Mr NisticÃ² and Mr Nobilia raised this earlier on.
I am very concerned that, on the labelling of fragrances, aromas and essential oils, Amendments Nos 21 and 28 involve the introduction of unnecessary requirements which may have a very unfortunate effect on the composition of products, their continued availability and indeed the viability of some of the smaller firms that make them.
The rapporteur proposes a very comprehensive system of labelling when perfumes and aromas are present in products, even in tiny amounts.
In fact, although this is designed to protect the few consumers who have allergies to certain fragrances, the proposal is unlikely to provide a significant public health benefit.
There may be no safe fragrance for some allergic individuals.
The best they can do, as they well know, is to steer clear of products with fragrances in them altogether.
The rapporteur is reacting to representations by the European Consumer Bureau, which says it is putting the case for allergy sufferers and clearly sees the issue as part of its war on chemicals.
I have to say that I have received no representations from allergy sufferers on this point.
The European Flavour and Fragrance Association points out that the amendments will saddle consumers with products carrying references to up to 50 ingredients in 11 languages. This is stupid and unnecessary.
Furthermore, there is a danger that some essential oils would be removed from formulations, thus damaging the economic interests of some countries, including some very poor countries.
These amendments are a bad and unnecessary deal for consumers and the industry.
I hope that the rapporteur will consider withdrawing them and that the Commission and the Council will reject them.
Mr President, I thank you for giving me an opportunity at the end of the debate to express my gratitude for the way it has gone.
It has been a very lively debate, characterised by emotion and level-headedness, and touching on various points.
For that I am very grateful to the Members of this House who have spoken.
I am grateful to Mrs Flemming for making me aware of what Leonardo da Vinci said, and I have been constantly trying to think up points of similarity between him and Mr Liikanen, who, when he responds, will perhaps astonish us by telling us that the two of them have much in common and that he, in the depths of his heart, actually has great sympathy with Parliament's proposal.
I am very grateful to all the Members who have supported me and a similar number of whom will, I hope, support the proposals when we vote at noon today.
Should cosmetic amendments - and 'cosmetic' is the appropriate word - be necessary, I am convinced that we will have to make them in the course of the conciliation procedure.
I would like to briefly address the points made by Mr Nobilia and, at the end, Mrs Jackson.
I have to tell Mrs Jackson that I could not withdraw the amendments even if I wanted to, because the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy had adopted them with 44 votes in their favour.
It has therefore now become the Committee's position and not just my own, and I have to make a true and faithful report of that to Parliament.
I would like to say in addition that I am a lawyer rather than a natural scientist, and so I have done something very simple.
I have borrowed the position of the Scientific Committee on Cosmetology, composed of European Union scientists, who have established that 26 substances result in allergic reactions, 13 of them to a severe degree.
That labels should indicate the presence of these substances I find the most utterly obvious thing in the world.
We have labels for nuts in chocolate and everything else for people who suffer from allergies, and we have to have labels for this as well.
The aromatic oils industry having belatedly woken up to this, I can well understand why, three days before the vote, it was trying to influence us.
I do not want to ban its products, but I do want the substances listed, in one language rather than in eleven, and with their chemical names, in the list of ingredients, which is, incidentally, what the Scientific Committee on Cosmetics proposed.
It is my conviction that we owe that to the European Union's consumers.
Mr President, on behalf of the Commission I would like to thank Mrs Roth-Behrendt and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy for this report and congratulate them on the impressive work they have done.
The wish expressed by Parliament in its opinion for the first reading to improve consumer protection has, to a large extent, been taken into account in the common position.
That said, I am aware that Parliament's assessment might be different and I fully respect it, as has been confirmed here today.
The Commission and Council welcome in particular the proposals relating to some categories of products, such as products for children or intimate hygiene or the extension of the minimum durability date requirement.
They would be of clear benefit to consumers.
The Commission shares Parliament's concerns on the use of substances classified as carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic for reproduction (CMR).
The cosmetics directive already regulates the use of CMR substances in a sectoral manner.
However, to find a consistent and sustainable solution for the substances specific provisions have been introduced to strengthen the legal framework, while complying with the key principle of risk assessment.
Furthermore, the Commission has proposed new measures on these new substances in its White Paper on the new chemicals policy and we are now working on concrete proposals with my colleague, Mrs WallstrÃ¶m.
Regarding the fragrance allergies issue, the Commission and Council welcome the introduction of a labelling system for allergenic fragrance ingredients.
This will improve the current labelling requirements to allow consumers who are sensitive to certain ingredients to avoid products containing them.
As regards the issue of animal testing, we all know how difficult and sensitive it is, especially because it creates a great deal of concern among the public.
We all share the objective to reduce animal pain inflicted during experimentation.
This issue is linked to many other policy areas and we are therefore working in constant and close cooperation with my colleagues, Mr Byrne and Mr Lamy, who are responsible for health and consumer protection and trade issues respectively.
The Council common position compromise has taken these aspects into account in a new global approach. It leads to a balanced solution offering a genuine benefit to animal welfare, whilst safeguarding consumer health and taking into account the impact of our internal decisions at international level.
We thought that this approach would be a positive step and give a political signal that your concerns have been considered, as it reintroduced a marketing ban.
The proposed solution to ban animal testing within the EU whenever possible and to make mandatory use of all alternative methods at the earliest opportunity seemed an improvement.
It will lead to the management of animal testing within the European Union, thereby answering the criticism of exporting the problem.
Acceptable validated alternative methods are still lacking for a number of key toxicological parameters.
They are necessary for a full health risk assessment of cosmetic ingredients to ensure a high level of consumer protection.
It is impossible to predict when all the necessary alternative methods might be available.
Finally, the European Union is bound to ensure compliance with its international obligations, but an essential objective is to provide the highest possible level of safety.
A total ban on all animal testing would endanger the safety of cosmetics and therefore human health.
The marketing ban, linked to the acceptance at OECD level and excluding any cut-off date, reduces the risk of a challenge under the disputes settlement system of WTO.
The European Union, with the strong support of the European Parliament, is seeking to promote considerations relating to the welfare of animals with the WTO.
However, this proposal has so far found very little support among the WTO members.
Some colleagues have argued that the EU should implement such a ban and see whether it is challenged by other WTO members and then if necessary consider the measure in the light of WTO opposition.
I put the question to my colleagues who are responsible for WTO relations and their reply is as follows: Such a course of action has a political cost.
We would reinforce the suspicion already widespread among developing countries that, regardless of their commitments in the WTO agreements, developed countries intend to use their trade power to impose their own ethical priorities and values on others.
To provoke a WTO case under those circumstances might, therefore, be counterproductive, increasing the polarisation between developing and developed countries and reducing the chances of success of the EU's effort to bring such matters as animal welfare and environmental and social considerations into the WTO discussions.
That is the opinion of my colleagues who are responsible for this field in WTO relations.
I am convinced that further work, in close cooperation between Parliament and the Council and Commission, will finally lead to a balanced solution that genuinely benefits animal welfare while safeguarding consumer health and our international commitments.
Mr Jackson put two detailed questions on Amendments Nos 21 and 28.
On the second part of Amendment No 28, we could accept in principle the listing of these recognised fragrance allergens in Annex 3, according to the suggested modalities, but it should be in the form of a Commission directive.
The Commission would reject the first part.
The proposed amendment to Annex 3 has to be implemented via a Commission directive adapting technical progress adopted under the comitology procedure.
As far as Amendment No 21 on fragrance listing is concerned, this amendment requires a full ingredient listing, including perfume composition.
Given the large number of ingredients in fragrance compositions, indicating all the fragrance ingredients on the labelling would neither be feasible nor helpful to consumers or dermatologists and would be disproportionate to the anticipated risks.
Furthermore this deletion would remove the legal basis for requesting that fragrances with potential allergenic effects be indicated as requested in Amendment No 26, which has been introduced in the common position.
In conclusion, the Commission can accept in principle Amendment No 1, first part, Amendment No 5, first part, Amendment No 27, second part and Amendment No 28, second part.
However, the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 1, second part, Amendments Nos 2 to 5, second part, Amendments Nos 6 to 27, first part, Amendment No 28, first part, and Amendments Nos 29 to 33.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0141/2002), by Mr NisticÃ², on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the Council common position for adopting standards of quality and safety for the collection, testing, processing, storage and distribution of human blood and blood components (14402/1/2001 - C5-0069/2002 - 2000/0323(COD))
Mr President, I would like to express my immense satisfaction at the adoption in committee on 23 April last of the directive setting quality and safety standards for blood, essentially without any significant shift from Parliament's position and amendments.
At last, I feel that a directive can be adopted at second reading which provides the greatest possible guarantees, particularly for patients and consumers, of the quality and safety of blood and its components in order to avoid infections and complications such as those which have caused so many scandals and disasters in the past.
The adoption of a new European directive laying down uniform quality standards for blood will, at last, allow the free movement of blood and its components throughout the countries of the European Union and the removal of unwanted restrictions on the movement of donors from one country to another.
There will have to be high quality and safety standards for all the stages of the transfusion process, from donation to testing by means of specific, updated laboratory tests, to the collection, processing, storage, distribution and use of human blood and blood components.
As I am sure you will all remember, the point of the directive which was most critical and most disputed in our committee and in the House concerned what are known as 'voluntary unpaid donations'.
In my opinion, the common position adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy resolves all the disputes over this point.
Indeed, Article 4 states, according to the principle of subsidiarity, 'This directive shall not prevent a Member State from maintaining or introducing ... more stringent protective measures .... In particular, a Member State may introduce requirements for voluntary, unpaid donations, including the restriction of imports of blood and blood components'.
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy deleted the clause 'provided that the provisions of Article 30 of the Treaty are met'.
A new amendment has now been tabled by the socialists to the effect that all the Member States may prohibit or restrict imports of blood and blood components to secure a high level of protection of health and to achieve the objectives laid down in Article 19(1), provided that the conditions laid down by the Treaty are met. This seems to me to be a good, acceptable compromise.
With regard to voluntary and unpaid donations, Article 19 of the common position lays down a number of specific provisions, including, in particular (Paragraph 1) that Member States are to encourage voluntary and unpaid donations and ensure that blood is in so far as possible provided from such donations.
I feel that this is a very balanced provision and this position has already been endorsed in committee.
Article 19(2) lays down in general terms that the Member States are to inform the other Member States and the Commission of the actions taken by them to achieve the objective set out in Paragraph 1.
In this regard, I would like to table an oral amendment requiring the Member States to provide this information every three years instead of every two years, for this tallies with the text of a subsequent article.
In addition, still on the subject of voluntary unpaid donations, some of the Members called for the Council of Europe definition to be included in the text, particularly in Article 3.
I broadly support the Council of Europe definition but I feel that it is sufficient for reference to be made to it in recital 23, precisely as it is currently worded, to the effect that this definition 'should' - not 'must' be taken into account by the Member States.
I therefore oppose both Amendment No 7 and Amendment No 19, which seek to include a literal, rigid definition of 'voluntary and unpaid donation'.
Indeed, I feel that some flexibility is necessary in order to encourage donors.
Commissioner, each Member State has a different attitude, different traditions and a different culture when it comes to the definition of 'unpaid', which I feel must be wholly respected.
It is not for Europe to impose rigid definition criteria on the individual Member States.
The important thing is to have enough donors to achieve the most important objective, which is to avoid a shortage of blood and blood components.
Another point of controversy concerned the responsible person.
In my opinion, there should be a compromise amendment giving Member States the freedom to choose the type of qualification required of the responsible person, in line with the principle of subsidiarity.
In conclusion, I hope that this directive will, at last, see the light of day and be adopted.
On my own behalf, I should first of all like to thank Mr Bowis for letting me go first, because I am having to receive a visitors' group, a choir, that will be opening the Dutch week shortly.
This is why I should like to leave at 11 a.m.
Mr President, it is not the first time that a very emotional and very passionate debate is taking place on the subject of the supply of blood.
The opinions on this subject are diverse, even between my good friend, Mr NisticÃ², and myself.
We do however agree on one thing, namely that the safety of the supply of blood must be paramount because too many people rely on blood products.
Patient organisations - and I would quote haemophiliac associations - were right to get involved in the debate, but their opinions are also diverse.
Moreover, these different opinions run parallel with whether or not a Member State is self-sufficient in the organisation of the supply of blood and blood production.
I come from a Member State where self-sufficiency is paramount, and the voluntary, unpaid donation, the so-called 'gratis principle', underlies the organisation of our supply of blood.
I am not able, or prepared, to impose our principle on other countries, and I am talking to Mr NisticÃ² when I say this.
He asked for subsidiarity a moment ago.
This should not, and cannot, entail the undermining of our principle of voluntary 'gratis' self-sufficiency.
For this reason, I would ask Mr NisticÃ² to bring up for discussion the principles that were laid down at first reading in Parliament and confirmed at second reading by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
This means that we need to make a positive recommendation on the agreements in the framework of the trilogue, involving Mr Lund, Mr NisticÃ² and others, namely in order to continue to enable the Dutch people, the northern Member States, to maintain their own organisation, which is also the gist of Amendment No 19.
Mr NisticÃ², I am prepared to withdraw my support for Amendment No 7 if you can assure me, in the framework of this subsidiarity, that Amendment No 19 will also be supported, including by Members whose countries operate a different system.
Please allow me to comment on a second amendment.
We will support Amendment No 20, Mr Lund's compromise to replace Amendment No 10, which enables a Member State to continue to determine its own organisation and its own blood policy. This is also backed by Mr NisticÃ².
This compromise receives my unqualified support, for I think it is an improvement on the original amendment which I had tabled on Amendment No 10.
I should like to urge all of you once again to support Amendment No 19.
Mr President, I am sorry that my giving way to Mrs Oomen-Ruijten seems to have caused her some anguish but I do not think she is any need of any blood products.
This is a very welcome report and I congratulate our rapporteur.
The safety of blood, as we all know, is paramount.
Some of our Member States have had horror stories to remind them of that.
But the supply of blood is also paramount for those whose lives depend on it.
Our preference is for unremunerated donation - that is the British practice and that is what we want to see - but, in practice, Europe imports nearly 50% of its plasma and plasma products.
I am not talking about the standard blood transfusion service that comes around to your church hall and you pop in for half an hour, have a cup of tea, and go back to work.
I am talking about plasma donation, where you have to travel some distance to fixed machinery and it takes half a day.
We have to import some of those products and a lot of them come from the United States, where many of the products are remunerated.
Research shows that remunerated blood is perfectly safe in itself. The key, of course, is the screening of blood products wherever they come from.
The hyper-immune plasma products are nearly all imported into the European Union and 2,166,367 people in the European Union depend on them: some 400 thousand in Britain, 400 thousand in France, 100 thousand in the Netherlands, 40 thousand in Finland and so on.
These are people with haemophilia, primary immune deficiency, albumen tetanus needs, acquired deficiencies, auto-immune diseases and Rhesus negative pregnant women.
Without supplies, their health and their lives can be at risk.
Of course we must encourage unremunerated donation.
That is our custom and practice but in a world of BSE and CJD, we cannot be purists. Otherwise we are putting the lives of our fellow citizens at risk.
Mr President, I had really prepared myself for making a positive speech about higher quality European blood products, but I have to say that the way in which Mr NisticÃ² has acted as rapporteur on this matter is beneath contempt.
As late as last week, we made an agreement with Mr NisticÃ² while the Commission and the Council were present, and this agreement led to our compromising by tabling Amendment No 19 through which the definition of unpaid blood donation is transferred to the recitals.
This was a compromise, even though Mr NisticÃ² is now shaking his head.
What is happening in this case is simply dishonest.
What Mr NisticÃ² is doing is beneath all contempt, and I should therefore like to say that, in connection with the vote later today, you should be prepared for our requesting a postponement.
I will not tolerate this approach.
It is not the way to treat fellow MEPs in Parliament.
Both the Commission and the Council, whose presidency was represented at the meeting in question, accepted this draft compromise, as did Mr NisticÃ² on behalf of his group and as rapporteur.
To come here to the second reading in Parliament and, in spite of everything, state an unwillingness to stand by the agreement we had entered into is therefore quite extraordinary.
That is in any case the last agreement I enter into with Mr NisticÃ² and, as I say, we shall do what we can to have the vote on this matter postponed so that we can have it debated in detail with the leaders of the Group of the Europe People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and with the coordinator of that group in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
What has happened in this matter is simply awful, and we shall not tolerate it.
Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr NisticÃ², for his cooperation throughout the process of putting this report together.
I would like to add to Mr Lund's comments that what I find unacceptable is the fact that a compromise discussed between two groups, without the participation of the shadow rapporteurs, at least, of the other, so-called smaller groups, is being presented as a parliamentary compromise.
Having said that, the liberal group, which I am representing here, considers that the common position adopted by the Council is an excellent compromise.
It takes equal account of the concerns expressed by blood donors, in particular with regard to ethical requirements in the field of donations, and by patients, who are demanding that products derived from plasma be available as needed throughout Europe, as has been amply illustrated by Mr Bowis.
In other words, any amendment whose effect might be to threaten this balance would appear to be dangerous, and I would add, in particular, that we believe fighting over the obligation for donations to be entirely without remuneration is a mistake, as making voluntary donations the sole method means favouring one national collection system over another, which would be completely counter to the Treaties.
Why must we be forced to choose between the German mixed system, for example, the monopoly of the Red Cross in Belgium, or even the French system, which, since the tragic contaminated blood affair, has set up an effective blood monitoring system which many Member States now use as a model?
That is not the key issue.
The most important thing, and we would stress this, is to promote the highest possible quality and safety standards for donations of blood and blood components, and it is not by extolling the virtues of obligatorily entirely unpaid donations, I repeat, or by proposing assimilation - thus far scientifically unfounded on grounds of both ethics and quality, as stated by Amendments Nos 7 and 10 adopted in committee and Amendment No 26 - that we will be laying down proper foundations for the future of the blood sector in Europe and providing a practical, sustainable solution to the question of self-sufficiency.
The liberal group will therefore vote against these amendments.
Yes, of course you must listen to voluntary blood donors.
Of course their contribution is priceless.
But you must also listen to patients when they tell you that no one with haemophilia or primary immune deficiency will inject plasma products that are untreated or of uncertain quality just because they come from voluntary donors.
The message we must send here and now to donors and recipients is one of generosity and solidarity.
We believe it is unproductive to set their points of view against each other.
The main threat to the blood sector and the lives of patients lies in the lack of medicinal products derived from plasma.
It is in accepting this reality and accepting all healthy donors without excluding anybody that the battle for self-sufficiency will one day be won in Europe.
Mr NisticÃ², you have asked to speak on a personal matter, I would ask you, in the light of Rule 122, to wait until the end of the debate, because Rule 122 states that all personal statements shall be heard at the end of the discussion.
Mr President, I am pleased that Mr NisticÃ² has included many of our amendments.
There are, however, some gaps, requiring amendments to be tabled with a view to ensuring the maximum level of safety of blood products.
We therefore consider that all undesirable effects and incidents relating to any stage of the blood donation and transfusion process must be reported, no matter how serious they are.
We also consider that it is genuinely essential, in the interests of quality and patient information, for a medical examination to be carried out on all blood donors before blood is taken.
Secondly, the question of remuneration for blood donations is fundamental.
Most European countries have a system of voluntary, unpaid blood donations.
We cannot accept any challenges to this principle, and we believe it should be extended to the whole of the European Union.
From an ethical point of view, we cannot defend the idea of selling blood or, indeed, any other component of the body.
The human body is not a commodity.
In this respect, we find it extremely shocking that companies can make a profit from free blood donations.
The remuneration of donations could be counter-productive in terms of quality.
Donors motivated by financial gain might be led to deny any health problems they may have, which could have tragic consequences - as in China - for their own health and for the health of recipients.
I am not denying the risks in terms of blood supplies, but I think we can motivate potential donors by means other than money.
It is in order to ensure that the objectives of this directive, the quality and safety of human blood, are achieved that I am calling on my fellow Members to vote for our amendments.
Mr President, in 2001, 55% of the European Union's blood products originated from donors who were remunerated for their effort.
Of the plasma used to supply the EU market, 73% originates from people who receive remuneration for donating it.
It is only through these donors that full supplies of plasma products can be kept up.
Secure supplies of blood products save lives and must therefore be given absolute priority.
The Common Position is a good basis for this.
A ban on remunerated donation is not feasible in terms of health care provision.
I can see nothing immoral in this - quite the opposite.
I remember my own student days, when we students derived part of our income from donating plasma.
Mr President, Commissioner, this is the second reading of a very important directive, a directive which concerns our strategy on public health and the safety of European citizens.
The European Parliament has examined this directive setting standards of quality and safety for blood and blood products very closely, because we need to use strict scientific criteria to describe the terms and conditions which must be met in order to safeguard the health of both donors and recipients of blood and blood products to the maximum.
Incidents such as we have seen in the past in the European Union, where people have lost their lives due to contaminated blood, must not be allowed to happen again.
I am delighted that the European Commission adopted a series of important amendments at first reading; however, it also needs to look favourably on another series which it rejected at first reading, but which has been re-tabled and re-adopted in the Committee on the Environment.
I should like, if I may, to comment on a number of them.
I consider that patients who are due to undergo a blood transfusion have an inviolable right to be informed by those responsible of any possible adverse reactions or health risks.
Of course, it goes without saying that the confidentiality of personal data is assured because third parties will not have access to them.
I disagree with the European Commission's proposal in Article 9 as it is currently worded.
The person responsible for the establishment must be not only a doctor, but one specialised in blood donation, because complications or side effects which require medical care or action often occur during blood donation.
I should also like to mention an ethical matter.
Under the Treaties and the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the human body and its organs cannot be treated as commodities.
Consequently, I agree with the principle of voluntary, unpaid donation because I believe that, apart from the ethical implications, this impacts directly on the quality and safety of blood.
Finally, it would be an oversight on my part if I failed to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work.
Mr President, in many EU countries - including my own - a lot of work still needs to be done to restore full confidence in the blood transfusion and blood products services generally after a period of tragic lapses in safety.
This directive will go a long way and is extremely important because of that.
I will come straight to the point I have difficulty with, and I support completely what colleagues - in particular Mr Bowis - have said.
I cannot understand why blood from a remunerated source must necessarily be banned in Europe.
Quite frankly, the biggest threat to our hundreds of thousands of patients in the EU who need blood and blood products is the lack of an adequate supply.
The supply must be safe but, by definition, a voluntary patient who might have HIV is no safer than a person with no health problems and who is paid.
It comes down to the proper screening and treatment of the product regardless of the source.
We must not become emotional about this issue.
I wish that all blood and blood products came from voluntary, unpaid sources.
It is the ethos in my own country, and I would like to encourage it.
We must encourage the public to donate blood.
There is a scarcity of donations in my own country and many others.
We are 50% dependent on imports into the EU.
Self-sufficiency has to be a goal.
However, to even consider, by definition or otherwise, banning all products that come from remunerated donors is a retrograde step.
I am not alone in saying that.
The voluntary organisations that look after the interests of patients who need these products are pleading with us in this Parliament and the EU not to ban all sources of paid donations.
We must encourage the ethos of voluntary donation, but we cannot ban paid donations.
If the patients - not the pharmaceutical or blood companies - are asking us, we should listen to them and respond to them.
With the greatest of respect, it would be arrogant on our part not to do so.
Mr President, blood safety is an important issue for citizens across the European Union.
There have been far too many scare stories and accidents across the EU involving blood and blood components.
This directive setting standards of quality and safety of collection is absolutely vital.
With EU citizens travelling more and more and visiting other EU Member States, we must ensure that when any unfortunate accident happens, whether on holiday or at work, the people are safe in the knowledge about the quality and safety of the transfusion that is going into their bodies.
Quality and safety are the watchwords, that is why in principle I support voluntary donation.
This has been the topic, as we have heard, of a very heated debate and I feel that the rapporteur has given a strong sense of the feeling that voluntary donations are the preferred option in the EU.
However, in the United Kingdom there is a special case to be made.
Due to the impact of CJD, known as mad cow disease, we have to import our plasma products from outside the Member State.
Most of these products come from the United States of America as there are not enough sources in the other Member States and, sadly, the products have to come from paid sources.
This is a difficult issue but one where the United Kingdom has a particular problem.
The United Kingdom Government has been left with no alternative than to take plasma products from paid sources to avoid putting United Kingdom citizens' lives at risk.
In conclusion, I welcome this directive and its objectives, I welcome the principle of voluntary donation and I look forward to seeing EU citizens benefiting from the quality and safety of blood and blood components.
Mr President, right at the outset it has to be said that my colleague, Mr NisticÃ², as rapporteur, has done some excellent work in his improvement of the articles on the issue of safety in this directive.
It is of the utmost importance for all EU citizens that the single market in blood and blood products that has been set as an objective cannot work without reliable safety standards.
At the same time, however, it must be said that we have managed to reach agreement on how levels of safety can still be substantially increased by making unremunerated blood donation a fundamental principle.
The Council of Europe has undertaken some important work to increase safety with regard to blood donations and promote the principle of non-remuneration.
This would not prohibit the payment of travel expenses and compensation for lost working time, which is important for donors of plasma in particular, who often have to travel to another area and give up a lot of their time.
It is a good principle for the EU too, but if we are just going to be satisfied with making recommendations to Member States regarding practices in the manner of the Council of Europe we shall have lost something essential in our role as legislator. If, on the other hand, we give Member States the right to refuse imports of blood and blood products that have been donated for payment from second and third countries we shall at the same time be weakening the basis of the original aim of the whole directive, the creation of a single market.
Community legislation is generally of a high quality and easily manages to control even the small details of human life - too small, one is tempted to say. One cannot help but wonder why this particular directive was unable to distinguish ordinary blood donations from others, such as plasma donations.
In the case of the former, we could have introduced an absolute ban on remuneration without any need for exceptions and, regarding the latter, we could have permitted remuneration as long as the shortage of plasma and other special products make it necessary.
I shall wait for the Commission to submit a new proposal in which this important detail can be corrected.
Mr President, Commissioner, I wish to congratulate Mr NisticÃ² on his excellent work and say that, throughout Europe, the issue in question is to resolve the extraordinarily difficult situation involving blood.
The European public feels that the discrepancies between the Member States' legislation provide no guarantees of safety given the increasing circulation and import of blood products, on the one hand; on the other, they feel equally unsafe due to the events that have taken place in various countries in recent years.
What we are dealing with here, therefore, is not so much the issue of price, of whether or not donations of blood should be remunerated. It is rather a question of whether we can guarantee levels of safety and of not forgetting the importance of the issue of blood for Europe's citizens.
Various leaks have taken place recently at the heart of this debate and I am sorry that the issue of whether or not donations of blood should be remunerated has been given centre stage.
With regard to this issue, I would say that the rapporteur is right and that we should stick to the common position since, on the one hand, it does not ban remuneration, which is essential in some cases in order to overcome shortages, but, on the other, encourages voluntary donations and even allows some Member States to go further by defining more rigid rules that could even prevent the import of blood products that do not adhere to these rules.
However, once again, Mr President, what is at stake is safety and finding a solution to the problem of blood shortages.
Mr President, people who suffer from the bleeding disease of haemophilia are gravely concerned, as, if payment for blood donation is actually banned, there may be serious difficulties with the supply of blood products.
Indeed, some people could even die.
Half of all the plasmatic clotting factors currently used in the European Union comes from remunerated donors; either they have made their donation in the EU or their plasma has been imported.
It can readily be imagined what a threat it would be to patients if new legislation meant that the supply of these products were to be halved.
There is at present no evidence that medicinal products from unpaid donors are in any way safer than those from donors who have been paid.
The fact is that the medicinal products authorities in Europe have been checking the safety and effectiveness of all plasma products in the European Union and this has not led them to see the payment of donors as a problem.
There is something else.
Contrary to prior expectations, the provision of genetically manufactured Factor 8 - which is only one of the blood clotting factors - has been constantly beset with problems.
That precombinant synthetic blood clotting factors would bring with them a boundless range of low-priced compounds, as the pharmaceutical industry originally asserted, has quite simply not, to date, been demonstrated to be true.
The products have become more expensive and also hard to obtain.
It is a cause of dismay that between 400 000 and 500 000 people around the world are dependent on clotting factor compounds; only 10% of them are provided for to the standard of the industrialised countries of the West.
Of the world's haemophiliacs, 80% have no supplies.
If we now dispense with remuneration, the position of these people - who do not live in the European Union - could get much, much worse.
Mr President, Commissioner, the report Mr NisticÃ² has presented is an excellent one, the content of which I fully endorse.
I do not want Mr Lund's statement to give a false impression.
There is a need for this directive to achieve uniformity across the Member States in matters affecting the safety and quality of blood and blood plasma.
Both in terms of infection and the maintenance of supplies, the protection of patients has the highest priority.
Two things, therefore, must be safeguarded as a matter of fundamental principle: blood quality and the availability of sufficient blood and blood plasma in the European Union.
I will go on record as supporting the Council's Common Position, which enhances the safety of blood and blood components and, at the same time, puts us on course to achieve maximum availability of lifesaving drugs.
Plasma is needed in the manufacture of drugs which are essential to life, for example the clotting agents 7 and 8 for haemophiliacs and immunoglobulins to prevent infections in patients with congenital weaknesses of the immune system.
Any bottleneck would put many patients' health at risk, something that we as politicians certainly cannot justify.
Voluntary and unpaid blood donation is a basic principle and so let it remain.
The payment of expenses to plasma donors in the EU cannot, however, be excluded for the future.
Almost 50% of the human blood and blood plasma needed in the European Union has to be imported, mainly from the USA.
The directive must not prohibit the import of plasma originating from paid donors either.
The EMEA study published at the end of last week clearly shows those blood products from paid and unpaid donors are without doubt equally safe.
There is therefore no reason to make unpaid donation mandatory on safety grounds, which would inevitably block supplies even of medicinal products manufactured from blood plasma.
This makes Amendments Nos 7, 19 and 20 unacceptable.
Mr NisticÃ² has asked to make a personal statement under Rule 122 of the Rules of Procedure.
Mr President, I have taken the floor briefly for personal reasons and I would like Dr Lund, to whom this appeal is addressed, to be so kind as to listen to me.
In the first place, after a long university career and coming from a region in the south of Italy, I consider myself to be a man of honour, of the highest intellectual and moral integrity, and I always work for the general good of the patient. Secondly, as a neurologist, my brief diagnosis is that Mr Lund may have suffered temporary minor loss of memory regarding our agreement.
I repeat: I agree to include the definition of 'unpaid voluntary donation' in recital 23, but I consider, as I said in the meeting attended by the Commission and the Council, that, ultimately, this should be taken into account by the individual Member States.
If Mr Lund agrees with me on this point - and I feel the important thing is this - I would leave his proposal totally unchanged but I would conclude with an oral amendment at the end to the effect that 'this should be taken into account by the single Member States'.
I feel that, in this way, Mr Lund, we who have worked together with great enthusiasm and commitment with both your and my group, might resolve an issue which is extremely important to both the donors' and the patients' associations.
Mr President, I shall merely make the one observation, to the effect that I stand by every single word I said in my speech.
I am very pleased that, with the position he and the Commission have adopted on the amendments, Commissioner Byrne has confirmed the agreement entered into with regard to Amendment No 19.
I understand that it is an agreement by which Mr NisticÃ² still does not wish to stand.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
The next item is the report (A5-0139/2002) by Mrs KlaÃ, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the indication of the ingredients present in foodstuffs [COM(2001)433 - C5-0404/2001 - 2001/0199(COD)]
Mr President, Commissioner Byrne, ladies and gentlemen, we are now going about the amending of Directive 2013/EC on the indication of the ingredients present in foodstuffs, which is a significant step towards maximising consumer protection in the states of Europe.
The fundamental change in eating habits and the resultant transformation of the way food is produced and processed - for who, after all, still washes their own vegetables or still cooks according to basic recipes? - mean that ready-produced food constitutes an increasing part of our diet.
There must be a political response to this in the form of new rules to improve consumer safety.
People with allergic reactions to certain ingredients must also be enabled to recognise with certainty from the packaging when substances dangerous to them are present.
Already, 8% of adults in the European Union, and 3% of children, suffer from allergies, the effects of which can range from respiratory illnesses to life-threatening symptoms.
Only the avoidance of the foods that are hazardous to them can give these people a high degree of security, and so there is an urgent need for notification of ingredients that trigger allergies.
In labelling, there is a need to strike a balance between practical and clear identification on the one hand and the consumers' justified demand for complete information on the other.
The Commission proposal provides a good basis for doing this.
