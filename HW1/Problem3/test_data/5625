I propose, Madam President, that we put this question at the top of the agenda for the great debate that has been announced on the future of Europe, and we shall see what Europeans really think about this matter.
Â Â  . Madam President, one can understand the desire to define the scope of EU interference in the provision of public services.
It helps if you are running a business or a public service to know what the rules are, but I am appalled that this should hinge on defining the distinction between services of economic general interest and services of non-economic general interest.
Surely, all services are economic in the proper sense that they have an economic value, otherwise they presumably would not be provided.
I fear that attempts at such a definition will merely cause more confusion, less efficiency and more scope for ambiguous judgments from the European Court of Justice.
At root, the problem is that national and local authorities must have sovereignty over the management of public services, because public services are paid for by national governments on behalf of their electors.
Yet here we are trying to make public services obey a common set of EU rules.
Has anyone spotted the inherent contradiction?
MrÂ Barroso has outlined an ambitious programme of work for the Commission.
I say to him: please just leave it alone.
Please let national governments do their own thing.
Â Â  MadamÂ President, MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, you have emphasised, MrÂ President, that every country of the Union has its own history and its own conception of public services.
The construction of Europe should indeed be undertaken with due deference to this diversity but should also be rooted in a set of common values centred on social justice, equality and solidarity.
We can formulate a framework for a European public service.
Such a service cannot be defined from the perspective of competition, for we know that the benefits derived by society from public services are measured in terms of education, health, security and cohesion among Member States and among their peoples.
As has been mentioned, we shall shortly adopt a directive opening up the market in services within the Community.
We are familiar with the issues relating to the market in services at the WTO negotiations.
In the Community, as at the global level, it is imperative that we should be able to draw a legal distinction between commercial and non-commercial services and to establish freedom to provide the former and rules to regulate the latter.
Is it right that health, education, social housing and even water supply should be subject only to the law of profitability?
Of course not!
There is but one valid imperative â that of the general public interest and social progress for everyone.
And the public authority, at whatever tier of government, is the sole guarantor of that general interest.
The people of our countries rightly fear that the European project is being eroded by liberalisation and globalisation.
We must meet their needs for quality, accessibility, social responsibility and respect for the environment.
What better guarantee can we offer to our concerned fellow citizens, Mr President of the Commission, than a European legal framework for public services?
Â Â  . Madam President, I should like to thank Mr Rapkay for the enormous amount of work he has done on this report.
Indeed I welcome the presence this morning of President Barroso on this important issue.
It is a signal of the importance that the Commission attaches to this issue.
There is a broad consensus in Parliament about the role of services of general interest, economic interest, and of their importance.
There are divisions largely on questions of strategy and, in some cases, tactics.
There is a commitment here â and also on the part of the Commission â to ensure that any legislation or moves in that area will be by codecision.
That is enormously important for the credibility of what we do in that area and for our legitimacy with our citizens in what we do in that area.
I favour a framework directive.
That was one of the decisions of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs in its opinion on the report.
However, two weeks ago Parliament said ânoâ to a framework directive.
I believe it would be a mistake to try to push that through again.
We need to find a pragmatic way of moving forward to ensure that we get clarity and an assertion of the principle you have outlined here today: that when it comes to a conflict between the right of the citizen to public services and the market, that is set down in legislation.
We should not leave that issue to a decision by the courts on a case-by-case basis; otherwise we would end up with all kinds of conflicting results.
It is in that context that I favour a framework directive.
Perhaps that can be found in another way.
We need to search for that.
I welcome your commitment to take action in the social services and health area.
That is also an urgent matter.
Â Â  . â Madam President, I want to put before the House the Committeeâs resolution rather than my own opinion, although the two overlap to a large degree.
The committee adopted, and by a large majority, a total of 18 points, the essence of which has been incorporated into the Rapkay report, and so we have been able to adopt this resolution by a large majority, having been able to adopt a joint strategy on the basis of what this House has resolved on previous occasions.
I am very glad indeed that the President of the Commission is able to be here with us, but I am very far from happy at the prospect of yet another new communication towards the end of the years, for, from the year 2000 onwards, we have covered a circuitous route from one communication to another, from interpretation to summit document, without the clarification of the legal uncertainties that we needed being forthcoming.
The Commission really must overcome the competition Commissionerâs antipathy â and yes, I know that will be quite a feat â and sort out once and for all a number of things that will otherwise have to be left to the European Court of Justice.
That does not mean that we favour a framework directive, and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy has said as much, for there is no legal basis for one, not even in the draft constitution.
While it is self-evident that we want to see codecision in as many areas as possible, it is not right that we should adopt resolutions that go beyond our remit.
We have laid down several principles that are in line with what the President of the Commission has said today, and, while the subsidiarity principle means that every level must take decisions for itself, they must also abide by the rules of competition, with subsidies being transparent and the Commission having a watching brief to look out for abuses.
Within those limits, we can, today, on the basis of the Rapkay report, adopt a good position with advice to the Commission as to how it should proceed.
Now, all that is needed is for the Commission to act.
Â Â  . â (Madam President, MrÂ Schulz has very good eyes, because he sees things in this resolution that are not there.
I would like to indicate that the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection agreed in large part with the White Paper which the Commission presented to Parliament.
In this regard, we also agreed with the point that there is no need for a framework directive at Community level.
At the same time, with respect to these questions, there are, in my view, three essential fundamental principles.
The first and most important principle is that of subsidiarity.
We have in Europe a great diversity of systems for providing public services.
This diversity cannot be reduced to uniformity.
As a consequence, if Europe does not want to take over responsibility for public service provision, then it cannot make these perspectives uniform. That is to say, these questions have to remain within the competence of local authorities.
The second principle is the question of a gradual approach.
The European Union and the European Commission are moving in the right direction in deciding in favour of gradual regulation, and this leads to the third point, the matter of a sectoral approach.
We have already been very successful in regulating various sectors in the field of telecommunications among others.
We should strive to follow this example and to monitor it on a continual basis.
I agree, and so did our committee, that greater legal certainty is, of course, necessary.
And as the representative of a new Member State, I would like to say as well that in view of the principle of equal access, the European Union does indeed have to guarantee a common basis with the help of the harmonisation and cohesion funds.
In the new Member States, the tools for enforcing competition and for consumer protection are in many cases very weak.
It is essential that these be strengthened, precisely in order that both equal access and competition be realised in these territories.
I consider the report on services of general interest to be a good report, and believe that MrÂ Rapkay and his colleagues have done outstanding work.
But I would like to ask everyone not to misunderstand it and not to see elements in this report which are not there.
That is to say, we cannot speak in this regard of a framework directive or of a communication on a framework directive.
It is also very important that the question of a general directive on services is closely related to this question.
Here, too, we need to see things clearly.
The directive on services has, on many points, set down the framework within which we can work in this regard.
Â Â  . â MrÂ Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Transport and Tourism on the White Paper on services of general interest, my position, and that of the committee, has been to advocate the complete exclusion of services of general interest (SGIs) from the scope of the directive on internal market services, in accordance with the idea that each Member State has the exclusive competence to define, fund, evaluate and monitor these services, as confirmed by Parliament.
This will be conducive to the functioning of the market, to solidarity with the citizens and to respect for the competence of the national, regional and local authorities.
Secondly, we believe that SGIs must be described and defined, and the distinction between services of general economic interest (SGEIs) and services of non-economic general interest (SNEGIs) clarified as regards their legal certainty.
Thirdly, a framework legislation for SGIs, SGEIs and SNEGIs, a general legal framework, as MrÂ Barroso mentioned earlier, or a framework directive, according to preference, must be adopted.
Minimum requirements must be set for carrying out these activities, along with general criteria for the Member States and the national, regional and local authorities to implement, organise, assess and monitor them.
The fact that this legislation will encompass SGEIs does not preclude the possibility of specific legislation on certain individual sectors such as transport.
Most of the ideas we put forward are contained in the Rapkay report, hence my support for the report, although I may lend my backing to some necessary amendments.
Lastly, Madam President, I should like to express my disappointment that there has been no reference to the outermost regions, given that SGIs, which do not currently, and may never, exist, are needed in those regions.
I hope that the Commission and its President focus not only on the report but also on the points that I have raised.
Â Â  . â Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, we all agree that such things as public local transport, refuse disposal, social services and the water supply are things that should be managed on a regional basis, and that is largely the line taken, in principle, by MrÂ Rapkayâs report, which I welcome, and which has taken on board much of what is in the Regional Development Committeeâs opinion.
While demanding a commitment to subsidiarity, we also call for greater legal certainty where services of general interest are in conflict with European competition law, namely with regard to the law on subsidies, public-private partnerships, and, indeed, the definition of terms.
A Frenchman, for example, has a different concept of what services of general interest are from a Pole, a Swede or a German, and that is why there must be no single European framework directive on them of the kind that the Socialists want.
We do not want the same standards enforced right across the EU.
It makes no sense to dictate to the regions of Greece or the Czech Republic what they are to understand by services of general or public interest.
It is unfortunate that the Left in this House have managed to get various references inserted into the text of the report that could be taken as pointing the way to that sort of framework directive, and I wonder just what they are driving at.
Do you want an overarching framework directive that will make the areas of legal uncertainty more complicated than they already are, or do you want an insidious backdoor attack on the substance of European competition law as a means of forcing your socialist ideas about public services on Europeâs regions?
Whichever of the two may be the case, we say a firm ânoâ to it.
Where there are legal uncertainties, they must be eradicated, issue by issue and sector by sector.
That, of course, means a lot more work, but I am sure in my own mind that only the sector-by-sector approach can do justice to the European ideal of subsidiarity in the single market in which we all share.
This is not an area where Europe should lay down criteria of cost or quality.
Defining services of general interest, funding them and organising them, must continue to be in the hands of the regions, for it is they that have political responsibility for them.
Â Â  â Madam President, what I wanted to ask was whether the Committee on Regional Development is firmly in the grip of the European Peopleâs Party, for what we heard from MrÂ Pieper was nothing more than the PPE line, and not the position taken by the Committee on Regional Development.
Â Â  I am sure that we, as this Parliament moves into the second half of its term, will again have to give some thought to the need for rapporteurs for lead committees, and also the draftsmen of opinions for others, to do that to which MrÂ Langen has just referred.
Irrespective of the group to which they belong, they reflect the mind and the voting behaviour of the committee.
I am convinced that all of them have done so today, and anyone who is in any doubt about that can re-read the reports.
I have to say that I, as an outsider unfamiliar with the subject-matter, did wonder when I heard some of the speeches, but this is something we will be able to return to during the life of the next Parliament â perhaps as part of a reform of this House.
MrsÂ Stauner will now have the opportunity to be the last to put her committeeâs point of view.
Â Â  . â Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, even though it has been enshrined in the European Communities Treaty ever since Maastricht, the subsidiarity principle leads a shadowy existence, yet subsidiarity must always apply except where power resides solely at the European level.
Such is indisputably not the case as regards the services we are discussing today, so any European regulation in this field would be a flagrant breach of the subsidiarity principle, and, moreover, of the principles â integral to the rule of law â of necessity and proportionality if there was any interference in the functioning structures that the Member States have developed over the years.
If, though, the EU has no powers in this area, it follows that there can be no Europe-wide definition of these services either, and that only those who enact national or regional laws can define what they are.
Quite apart from that, the White Paperâs attempted definitions of them â which I regard as artificial and cumbersome â reveal themselves as impractical and incomprehensible by the public.
No strategy â be it of Lisbon or of anywhere else â is capable of being a substitute for a legal basis, whether one is dealing with principles and targets such as competition, or with economic and social cooperation.
The only possible outcome of this debate, then, is a call to have nothing to do with any European regulation on services of general interest, quite simply because there is no European legal basis for one.
I ask you to endorse the position of the Committee on Legal Affairs, which makes for a Europe that is close to its citizens, transparent and understandable.
Â Â  Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, we know that we in this House invariably end up in politically sensitive waters if decisions are taken with the intention of correcting the market or have the effect of doing so.
Very often, the same degree of sensitivity will kick in and the ideological bias is never far away when we want to apply the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality in specific situations.
Despite this, MrÂ Rapkay has managed to compile a balanced report, for which I should like to offer him my sincere congratulations.
I am delighted with the knowledge that first of all, the importance of the availability of services of general interest is underlined and secondly, that the common position on the Services Directive has been confirmed, namely that it is up to the Member States to determine what services of general interest are.
Thirdly, I welcome the fact that the question as to legal certainty is taking up a central position.
I have no problems with what some people here refer to as the rapporteurâs ambiguous wording.
I would rather call it a wise, if not diplomatic, approach, but in any event one that can help us further in our quest for solutions.
A framework directive is not specifically what we want.
This report recognises the sectoral differences.
If this report meets with approval, we will demonstrate beyond any doubt that we set greater store by essence in terms of substance than by the discussion as to the form it should take.
That is what it should be about for us, after all.
Let us then stick closely to MrÂ Rapkay's report, since the Commission will then know where Parliament's broad majority lies and where there are still differences, and then we, pending what will emerge from the Commission communication, will be able to take further steps towards the balanced approach that the public can expect from us.
Â Â  MadamÂ President, MrÂ President of the Commission, I believe that the time has come for legal and political clarification of this issue of services of general interest.
On the political front, because the debate on public services overshadowed the rest of the European debate, it poisoned the debate on the Constitutional Treaty, and it was blighted by the initial proposal for a directive on services in the internal market, since that proposal included a vast range of social services and services of general economic interest within its scope.
The distrust generated by the risk posed to public services by the actions of the Commission or the interventions of the European Union has a long history.
It is warranted in many respects, one reason being the failure to strike a fair balance between the rules of the internal market and the preservation of the general public interest; another is the impact of a number of single-sector directives that have not delivered the promised or expected results.
I am thinking, for example, of energy-price trends and of certain fears that have been confirmed with regard to postal services.
Clarification is also required on the legal side.
You emphasised this point yourself a short time ago, MrÂ President of the Commission, when you listed the legislative initiatives that the Commission has taken recently to try to stabilise the interpretation of the law and the treaties with regard to public funding and the regulation of state aid, passenger transport, financing and compensation, etc.
I therefore believe it is wrong to set the need for sectoral initiatives against the need for a general framework in todayâs debate.
Single-sector initiatives are needed â you referred to some of these yourself â in areas such as health services or social services of general interest, and cross-cutting initiatives are needed too.
Why?
Because, as you said, one of the principles on which we must base our actions is respect for the right of each Member State and its local authorities to continue to define what they understand by services of general interest and by services of general economic interest.
The interpretation of these concepts certainly varies from one Member State to another.
The ways in which these services are organised and funded as well as the contours, the delineation, of public service are not the same in all our countries and sometimes even differ between regions within our countries or between local communities.
In the absence of legislation, it has fallen to the Court of Justice, and sometimes to the Commission, to interpret the Treaties.
The fact is that these interpretations have generated an inconsistent and fluctuating body of case law, which has created legal uncertainty for local authorities, service providers and users.
It has also kindled fears that the provision of services of general interest will be jeopardised by a kind of predominance of the forces of the internal market, competition and private operators.
That is why we have taken this rather unusual step for a group in the European Parliament of proposing, as a symbolic gesture but also as a political measure, an initiative for the drafting of a framework directive designed to safeguard services of general economic interest.
We wanted to demonstrate that, given the necessary political will, a basis could be found in the Treaties and a directive could be formulated to answer the questions that now confront us.
From this point of view, may I say the following to MrsÂ in'tÂ Veld: I believe this is precisely the legal framework we need if we are to protect subsidiarity, and that is what we have demonstrated with this draft framework directive.
I invite MrsÂ in'tÂ Veld to familiarise herself with this initiative, which is intended to define and protect public services and services of general interest and to guarantee their long-term future.
I believe it is up to the legislature to establish the rules at this juncture.
It is normal that the European Parliament, representing the people, and the national governments, representing the Member States, should be able to state openly, on the basis of a public debate, how ArticleÂ 86 of the EC Treaty is to be interpreted and to draw the demarcation line that safeguards the general public interest from the forces of the internal market and competition.
Public services, as you said, MrÂ President of the Commission, are at the heart of the European social model.
People are attached to them because they not only enhance their quality of life, enable them to enjoy their fundamental rights and contribute to economic and social cohesion but also make our continent and its territories more competitive.
It is therefore a legal as well as a political imperative to show today that the European Union is not hostile to public services, that it is not trying to stifle them, but that it seeks, on the contrary, to preserve, encourage and develop them.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, during the debate on the social model, I pointed out that our fellow citizens want a Europe responsive to their urgent and practical concerns.
The guarantee of the existence and quality of services of general interest is one of these concerns.
In Europe today, the legal status of these services is much too fragile.
It is not healthy that services that are crucial for the social cohesion of our societies should be entirely dependent on the case law of the European Court of Justice.
Judges, as we are all aware, never have this much power unless politicians fail to take responsibility.
It is therefore our duty to develop a legal framework at Community level, setting out the procedures and objectives for the organisation of services of general interest.
MrÂ Barroso, if not everyone is convinced, that does not prevent us from being more specific about things, quite the contrary.
I am among those who are asking the Commission to propose a framework directive on services of general interest as soon as possible.
Allow me to reply frankly to those who oppose this and defend the choice of a sectoral approach.
This is not an alternative.
It is a trap.
Our fellow citizens are not blind.
They understand full well that to favour this approach would in reality mean delaying the establishment of the legal certainty that they so earnestly desire for services of general interest and for social services of general interest in particular.
What is more, it is clear that a legal framework does not prevent us from taking account of the particular features of certain sectors, quite the contrary.
Clearly, defining a framework does not mean standardisation.
MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, let us not evade our responsibilities.
A legislative project awaits us and it will prove that the Union is the best guarantor of a high level of solidarity and social cohesion.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, may I too say how delighted I am to see you and thank you, MrÂ Barroso, for attending this debate.
For many years now we have been discussing transsectoral European legislation in the field of services of general economic interest.
The European Parliament pronounced itself in favour of such legislation in 2001 and 2004, and the European Commission â which at the time was the Prodi Commission â did not take the matter further, putting forward the legal argument of the lack of legal basis and the political argument of the lack of the political majority in the Council needed to make progress.
On this last point, the reference to ArticleÂ 322 of the draft Constitutional Treaty illustrates at the very least, unquestionably, that there was a political agreement within the European Council to move forward.
Today, we are faced with a proposal for a directive on the internal market in services which partly covers services of general economic interest, a directive which many experts predict will not prevent numerous appeals to the European Court of Justice and which we have reason to fear will make it harder to achieve the aim of greater legal certainty in the field of the internal market in services.
Also today, as other fellow Members have pointed out, we are faced with a European Parliament resolution which will be voted on tomorrow and which does not in fact go as far as the resolutions of 2001 and 2004.
For this reason we have incorporated a number of amendments aimed at clarifying things.
However, the real political development, I believe, is that in addition to the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, which has had legal experts draw up a proposal for a framework directive, the European Trade Union Confederation has also put together a proposed text.
A number of associations â I am thinking in particular of the European Liaison Committee on Services of General Interest, which has an in-depth knowledge of these issues â have also drafted proposals of a legal nature which amount to saying: yes, a proposal for a framework directive is not unthinkable, and, moreover, must be consistent with the four principles that you mentioned in your introductory speech.
For this reason, MrÂ Barroso, on the basis of ArticleÂ 192 of the current Treaty, we ask you clearly to move forward and not to content yourself with responding to us in a few months time with a new consultation paper or a new white paper.
I would like to finish on a more political point.
I believe that we must not underestimate the genuine or imagined concerns of a number of our citizens who feel there is a flagrant imbalance between, on the one hand, the implementation of competition law which, in its general provisions, is a horizontal law, and on the other hand, the protection of services of general interest at European level.
Also, as some Members have said, Mr President, the significance of a framework directive for the Council and the European Parliament is that it provides them with an opportunity to show the Commission and, ultimately, the European Court of Justice, what kind of general provisions they want for European services of general interest.
I believe that this is in fact what is at stake politically in this whole debate.
Though I wish the political majorities were different, they are what they are for the moment.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, crude and heedless deregulation has been the order of the day in Europe for a decade now, with fundamental services such as energy supply, great swathes of the transport sector, not to mention education, health, housing and hospitals being made subject to the rule of the markets and of profit, in part under the of deregulatory legislation from Brussels, in part under pressure from the ECJ, and in part on the initiative of neo-liberal governments, the claims being made that it will bring more jobs, with competition bringing lower prices for consumers and inducing private investors moving their money around more efficiently.
The record of deregulation over the past decade itself demonstrates how false these neo-liberal claims are; in the energy and postal sectors alone, hundreds of thousands of jobs have been wiped out, and those who still have a job generally find themselves working under worse conditions.
You can rejoice in that and call it increased efficiency, or you can call it what it is â coercion and exploitation.
Rarely have the consumers benefited from falling costs; in Germany, for example, electricity has never been as expensive as it is today.
That the report by the Social Democrat MrÂ Rapkay should transfigure this record into one of success and call for the deregulation of more sectors testifies ignorance of past experience and to an irresponsible attitude towards those who have to endure the consequences.
Those who call for services of general interest to be made subject to the rules of the internal market are seeking to turn health, education and mobility into saleable goods that only the affluent can afford, for capitalist markets, rather than meeting demand, respond only to those who not only have demands but also the ability to pay, that being the only way to turn a profit.
That may be the sort of Europe that the rich and big business dream of, but the Left is dreaming of other things, and we, together with Europeâs social movements, shall not cease from resisting this sort of unfettered capitalism.
Â Â  MrÂ President, there were no scholarly books in my childhood home.
My family were farmers and craftsmen.
Competent teachers in my state school and free book loans in a well-stocked public library opened up the world of books to me.
In this report, book loans, education, care, nursing, water, security, hospital treatment and welfare are referred to as âservices of general interestâ as opposed to the more specific âservices of general economic interestâ involved in going to the hairdresser or buying a house.
Teeth, glasses and personal care fall somewhere in between.
The Court of Justice, through numerous judgments, has created an internal market for many services.
At the very heart of representative government, however, is the idea of not merely voting with your pockets, like at the market, but also choosing, through oneâs votes, what facilities society is to enjoy.


Do we want private hospitals and expensive medical bills; do we want to pay for book loans; should the price of public transport be reduced; should grannies get their daily wash in their care homes; should our infants be taken care of by discount nursery schools, or should they be educated by trained teachers?
The June Movement supports the internal market for goods and services and we oppose national discrimination, but we also want to allow voters in each Member State to define the boundaries between the market and society and to determine the level of quality and service, as well as consumer rights.
We also want to safeguard the Danish âagreement modelâ, whereby wages and working conditions are agreed in accords and then respected, and our social model, whereby we pay high taxes in order to provide social civil rights to all.
This is a case where representative government should be able to control the market so that there are also services of general interest for those not born with silver spoons in their mouths.
We wish to continue to be able to sing with Grundtvig âAnd thus in wealth we have progressed far, when few have too much and fewer too littleâ.
Â Â  â Mr President, the Commissionâs White Paper on services of general interest is certainly necessary in order to create a common market.
In the future, these services and the way in which they are provided should be more precisely defined.
We should bear in mind that at the moment, the provision of these services is, to a large extent, based on solutions drawn up in individual states and national legislation.
We can only include these services in common European regulations once we improve the system of services in the European Union.
Further action should specify the legal status of services of general interest and of measures to protect consumer interests.
MrÂ Rapkayâs report, for which I would like to thank him, clearly describes the current legal situation and the scope for further action.
We must make use of this report.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, it is a wide-ranging area that we are discussing today.
Although it was of the municipal graveyard that MrÂ Schulz chose to remind us, municipal organisations can also reach the size of major corporations â such is the extent of this spectrum, and it is open to question whether such big structures are always right.
Why, though, are we actually discussing this?
The reason is that we are balancing the rules of the market, on the one hand, against subsidiarity on the other.
That can certainly be a thorny issue, and what comes out at the end is not always rigorous.
I am very much in favour of subsidiarity, of locally-made rules, but a standardised definition in a Europe that may well â to pre-empt today's decision â end up with twenty-seven Member States would be a mess of standardised pottage, and that I reject.
Europe, though, must always be asking itself what added value accrues from action at the European level, and in what way it benefits the public.
Why, then, are we putting such effort into discussing the idea of a framework directive, when the rapporteur himself says that his report is not calling for one in this area?
The impression I get from some speakers is that they are doing no more or less than attempting to use this debate as a means of creating competition-free zones that will have a derogation from the services directive.
Quite apart from the abolition of market rules, the risk is that we end up with a European standard-issue concept of what services of general interest are, and Europe is too heterogeneous for that to be our goal.
What the public, communities, and local politicians need, though, is legal certainty.
They want to know what is possible and what is not, and that is where there is great confusion.
Take, for example, Munich, the city where I was born.
There, at the moment, four major hospitals are being brought together in one company, and nobody knows what has to be submitted to the Commission and what does not.
This is where the Commission must work together with Parliament, for what is very disturbing, not least to my own group, is that the Commission still retains a degree of âlicenceâ, in the sense that it always takes decisions on the basis of what it thinks right and does not consult the voters or their representatives in the manner to which they are entitled.
What is crucial with regard to the latter point â and this is where these debates in this House are actually long overdue â is that the public must understand why what we do is for their benefit.
In this field in particular, that is not always clear to them, and what we do in this place is perceived in a quite different way.
This is an area where the communications strategy might accomplish something.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today we are discussing the White Paper on services of general interest, published by the European Commission more than two years ago.
It is regrettable that liberalisation of the services market has so far been truly inadequate.
The White Paper provides only a very abstract definition of services of general interest and services of general economic interest.
The concept of public services has not been defined at all, and therefore it is not used in the Paper, which instead refers to âpublic service obligationsâ covering air, railway, road transport and energy sectors, which are also designated services of general economic interest.
Thus it is difficult to understand what we are actually talking about, while the principal result expected from the White Paper was to draft a legal act regulating and enabling the enforcement of one of the major freedoms of the EU internal market, that of free movement of services.
The situation regarding services of general interest is very close to the Services directive, which originally was meant to cover economic and common interest services, which currently, with a number of exceptions, excludes transport and postal services, and exempts electricity, gas and water supply from the principle of origin.
Thus most of the services in the EU can hardly be considered compatible with the principles of the internal market, competitiveness, representation of consumer interests, and the free movement of services.
Market protectionism will not only lessen the competitiveness of the economy but currently is preventing and will continue to prevent providing consumers with services of appropriate quality at the right time.
This is evident when travelling through the countries of the European Union.
As to services of general interest, the prime task is to clearly define them; this is to avoid any âfree interpretationsâ in individual Member States in order to protect the markets.
It is necessary to draw up a legal act governing such services, duly considering the principle of subsidiarity and opening services markets to competition for the benefit of each country's own citizens and enhancement of EU competitiveness.
I do admit that regional local governance is an important factor in the provision of services; however, quite often this is used to disguise market protectionism, whereas services are basically âbig businessâ.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, services of general interest are at the heart of the European social model.
MrÂ Barroso may well have said that in his first sentence, but he went on, in the same breath, to praise the efficiency of the market â rather than solidarity, universal access or fundamental entitlements â as the primary motive for such services.
What the public expect of the European Union, though, is the certainty that the services they need in order to live will be provided as a guaranteed and fundamental right, and universally, that is to say without regard to their social status or where they happen to live.
We can gain peopleâs trust only if services of general interest are intrinsically protected against market interests and kept separate from them.
I have to tell MrÂ Barroso that, if he tries to combine public services with the efficiency of the market, he will end up dissolving the core of the European social model.
You, MrÂ Barroso, may well rejoice at the demands made in this House for a sector-by-sector approach that would give you all the power you need to deregulate basic services, but it is abundantly clear from the latest examples given in your communication that it redefines basic social services as economic activity, so what you are doing is reinterpreting the definitions given in European court rulings.
Your proposals on health services, in which patient mobility is to be treated as more important than basic care, have their own tale to tell; they show how illusory is the belief that the market can guarantee fundamental rights.
The only way to guarantee these services of general interest is by means of an explicit framework directive, one that does not impose the rules of European competition law on basic services, these being the sort of services that ought, self-evidently, to be able to receive state subsidies, which exist in order to guarantee basic amenities and ought not to give priority to the demands of the market.
Those services of general interest that are economic in nature can also meet basic needs, and universal access to them, too, must take precedence over the interests of the market.
It follows that any such framework directive must go hand in hand with the services directive, precisely in order to guarantee that protection.
That, as things stand at present, is the only way to find a solution, for, as a consequence of the services directive, services are already on the market, and so this is a fictitious debate staged by the Right, who believe that one can only look backwards and that the matter would be resolved either by adopting a sector-by-sector approach or by not having a Europe-wide definition at all.
Â Â  Mr President, we scented victory when services of general interest were excluded from the scope of the controversial Services Directive.
The public sector was set to remain safe from Bolkestein, but that may have been no more than a Pyrrhic victory; after all, it is only now that services of general interest are being defined.
When a directive on services of this kind is being hammered out, it is necessary to settle what belongs to the domain of the market and what does not, as also and above all, the question of who is best placed to decide on this.
We will fight tooth and nail for our interpretation of general interest and against liberalisation and market forces in such areas as education, health care and culture: we have experience of them and have had it with them!
When areas that, strictly speaking, do not belong to the market, but to society are being liberalised, Europe comes across to us as a greedy little pig which, given the chance, will grab every opportunity with both hands.
This is already apparent in the Commissionâs fresh attack on care.
In our view, this directive will, above all, become an instrument for citizens, pupils, patients and consumers to stand up to this greedy little pig of an ever-liberalising Union.
The directive must spell out the fact that it is the Member States and their citizens who determine what services of general interest are, for, if they do, it will bring politics closer to the public once more, where it should be.
Â Â  Mr President, in the nineteenth century, governments took over many tasks that originally did not fall within their remit, for example, education, access to health care and the regulation of working hours; that was necessary as a response to market failure, and indeed still is whenever the market fails.
The distinction between services of general interest and services of general economic interest is academic.
To draw that distinction is therefore intended to make services public and to restrict government interference.
To curb government interference is a commendable objective in areas where citizens can be expected to display self-sufficiency and responsibility.
Drawing that distinction should not, however, mean that public access is restricted.
I would therefore call for caution in making services of general economic interest open to the market.
Society is well served by a government that does justice to the weak and guarantees access to services that are essential to day-to-day life.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I think that we, in this debate, are indulging in too much shadow boxing and not showing enough respect to the law and the public.
Let us take our own laws seriously; according to the constitutional treaty, the European Union is united in diversity, and one expression of this diversity is to be found in the many forms that services of general interest take.
We are united in the internal market, so let us not cause diversity and the single market to be mutually contradictory.
Secondly, in that we do not see the market as an end in itself, we are in favour of the social market economy.
The market possesses sustainability and its own social responsibility; precisely where its boundaries lie is a matter for those with political responsibilities to decide.
Where the market cannot do all the things that the common good requires, or guarantee that they will be done, services of general interest must be allowed to play their part.
They do not operate in opposition to the market; many general interest organisations compete with one another and comply with market criteria.
Thirdly, we affirm our belief in subsidiarity.
Far from running counter to the European Union, subsidiarity is an essential element of the model for it.
The reason services of general interest are not included in the services directive is that the definition of them is delegated to others by subsidiarity, and now we are debating whether this issue is soluble only by saying âyesâ or ânoâ to a framework directive.
We are in favour of social security, security of supply and quality being guaranteed to the public at affordable prices, and of policymakers shouldering responsibility for relations between the market and the private sphere, between which there needs to be a new partnership, expressed in the form of services of general interest.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to pay tribute to the work of our rapporteur, MrÂ Rapkay, which has helped to revive this debate on services of general interest.
I support completely his proposals to create greater legal certainty for social services of general interest.
I also support those on the provision of high quality services throughout the EU at optimal cost, respecting social balance and guaranteeing lasting security of supply.
I am however much more sceptical when it comes to asking the Commission for clarification on applying rules regulating competition and the internal market to public services.
MrÂ Barroso, whom I would like to thank for attending the debate, has just confirmed for us the supposed benefit of this competition for consumers.
As the rapporteur has pointed out to you, since public services lack a clear legal framework, their funding and management are dependent on uncertain circumstances offered to us in turn by the Commission and the European Court of Justice, which change hats as they see fit and act interchangeably as judge, legislator and executive.
For at least 15 years now Parliament has been asking the Commission to legislate.
What have we achieved?
The Commission is proposing a choice between a simple communication to strengthen the legal certainty of these services and a multitude of sectoral directives.
Personally, I want a framework directive: a legal framework giving services of general interest a positive and not simply dispensatory status, and one that the market competition rules will then be bound to respect.
Key sectors such as education, health and water must not be liberalised, and mixed circumstances must be allowed for where social, economic and environmental concerns are interlinked.
Services of general interest reinforce citizens' feeling of belonging to Europe.
They are a key element of solidarity and play a part in pursuing social rights.
I do not want a Europe in which the European model is based only on fiscal and social competition between states.
With this framework directive, I want to take Europe beyond the mere market, towards a society in which all public services are guaranteed as key factors in social and territorial cohesion.
Â Â  Mr President, before I was elected to this Parliament I was the leader of a Scottish local authority which was, if I may say so, a very successful one in terms of both value for money and meeting local aspirations for public service provision in the County of Angus.
It was then, and remains today, the predominant interest of local government to protect its right to local self-government.
It is therefore vital that in any new EU initiative we put an end to uncertainty.
Let us not be satisfied with woolly wording in relation to vital public service.
Let us not interfere in any way with the principle of local self-government.
Let us distinguish clearly between private enterprise, which is subject to EU competition law, and public service: services of a local nature provided for the public good, which have little or no cross-border effect and should be provided free of EU competition rules.
The setting of standards in general interest services should also be subject to local decision.
Some local authorities are sceptical of the need for new EU legislation.
I say that if we are to have a framework directive, let us have one that gives cast-iron guarantees of the rights of local authorities to define, organise and finance public services in the way they see fit.
I recognise that significant economic benefits to business will arise from removing barriers to commercial service provision, but let us not further alienate public opinion by interfering with or undermining the provision of essential local public services.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, if there is one thing that points to the existence of a European social model, it is precisely services, which must be safeguarded since they represent elements of citizenship.
We have been asked to say whether there should be services of general interest befitting all Europeans and, if so, how.
In the wake of the Bolkestein Directive, there was some confusion regarding the difference between commercial services and general services.
Therefore, we must now clarify what comes under the heading of the market, on the one hand, and of rights, on the other.
To do this, in a series of amendments we have taken on board proposals submitted by the ETUC, which maintain that all services of general interest, including economic ones, that is, those for which Europeans pay directly or indirectly â so, nearly all of them â should come within the public, government sphere, and be characterised by their universality, accessibility, collectability and quality.
In other words, they should be services and not goods, that is, they should be Europe and not North America.
We call on you all to support these amendments, which uphold the trade unionsâ position.
We also ask you to support them in order to clarify what the aim of a possible framework directive is, that is, to understand what Europe thinks about its social model and what it is proposing to its Member States in relation to services of general interest, whether services of general economic interest or otherwise.
Â Â  â President Barroso, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report refers, quite rightly, to the principle of subsidiarity as the legal basis for issues relating to services of general interest.
It has been only vaguely defined.
We have moved from a substitution principle to a principle of delegation.
For this reason, services of general interest can only be defined at the expense of particular circumstances and national needs.
Once again, we have to lament the fact that the unmistakable warning sent to you by the French and Dutch people should be treated with such contempt.
I would remind you that services of general interest are only of concern to the European Union from the very disputable point of view of competition.
The freedom of Member States to define the duties they intend to entrust to public service, in accordance with the will of their people, is being seriously undermined in this instance.
No, it is not appropriate for countries that, historically, do not have a culture of public services to prevent those that do have such a culture from having public services when they have deemed them necessary.
If you respected the principle of subsidiarity in its true sense, you would admit that public services, essential to the life of our societies, should be defined, organised and managed as close to citizens as possible at national level.
We believe that only a strong public power is capable of ensuring a future that is viewed not in terms of the mere quarterly profitability of shares, but over decades in the fields of education, health, transport, energy and the environment.
The only rule we have need of is that of sovereignty, which means that each State should be free to decide on its public services and that public service obligations take precedence over Community competition law.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to get this debate back, as my colleague Mr Karas said, to the people who really matter in all of this: our citizens receiving public services.
We know that in many cases those public services are not good enough, not efficient enough and are delivered at much too high a cost.
Mr Barroso, whom we are delighted to see here this morning, made an important point in his principles for the promotion of good-quality public-service delivery.
He mentioned the crucial factor of how technology is now enabling those services to be transformed and new models of organisation and delivery to be sustained.
Those are the things we should be talking about. We should be thinking about the diversity that is engaging the best minds, the best technology, the best people and the best managers involved in delivering those services.
However, the debate we have had, principally from that side of the House, has mainly been concerned with organisational models and protectionism.
With the Services Directive in place, thanks to our efforts, more of those minds can be unleashed on delivery of services.
We have work to do on public procurement from recent hearings in our committee. We have work to do on competition law.
If those are included within MrÂ Barrosoâs idea of consolidation, that is fine.
However, we do not want a directive of the kind set out here, which is a naked political directive.
They gave the game away in their interventions.
Mrs Schroedter said that it would protect against liberalisation.
That is what it is all about, Mr Barroso!
Have nothing to do with it.
Tell us today that you will take it off your agenda.
I have asked in my committee, but with no reply, what problems for our citizens this directive is intended to solve.
When those on the Left give us a comprehensive analysis of those problems, we might consider it, but we have far more important things to do today than to talk about their political declaration.
Â Â  Mr President, as the coordinator of the PSE Members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs I asked to be the last speaker on the PSE Group side, precisely in order to remove some of the prejudices and misunderstandings about this debate.
So I hope I can eliminate some of those misunderstandings.
Firstly, I want to thank Mr Barroso for his speech and to say that we in the PSE Group fully understand his four principles and his view that it is necessary to create more legal certainty for the service providers, whether they are public or private or something in between, for the Member States and the decentralised public authorities, and for the citizens.
As Mr Harbour rightly said, that is the crucial element.
I think Mr Barroso has correctly interpreted the report that Mr Rapkay prepared on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and that we voted for by a large majority in the committee.
We have not expressed a preference for any particular form of legal instrument, but have made it clear that legislative initiatives are needed and that we should have a full political process of decision-making on this, in which Parliament and the Council can participate fully.
Codecision is the right way to deal with these political issues.
That is the message of the report.
The report does not say that there should be a horizontal instrument or sector-specific instruments only; it leaves the options open and says that both methods can be used in parallel.
It will be clear from the debates that preferences differ, but also that there are a lot of prejudices about the options and preferences we promote.
In my political group, I chaired a group of legal experts who drafted a text.
Unfortunately I have the impression that many did not read this text, because if Mr Harbour had read it he would see that it is not a political statement but a clear attempt to reconcile the rules of the market, of competition, the subsidiarity that we want to guarantee for local authorities, the quality aspects and the importance of public service and services of general interest and economic interest for the citizens of Europe.
This is not ideological; it is a concrete attempt to reconcile these.
The draft is open for debate and we hope you will participate in discussing it.
But it is up to the Commission to come up with real proposals and then we can set to work on the legislative methods and formulations.
For the vote on this report, again I state that we have agreed to disagree on the issue of which instruments would be preferable.
There are amendments now from both sides, from the ALDE Group and from the Verts/ALE Group, to try again to force a decision on the preference.
I do not think that is wise.
I agree fully with Mrs Thyssen that it is wiser to stick to the agreement that we had and to leave this issue open.
It is the Commission that has to decide and if one of those amendments is adopted the only result will be that whole report would fall. That would be a pity because, as everyone has said, Mr Rapkay and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs have produced a good report.
Â Â  â I should like to thank MrÂ Rapkay for his report.
I must say that, after reading a great deal of detail on the subject, and following the lengthy debate on this issue, I strongly back the idea of establishing a general directive on services of general economic interest (SGIs).
I welcome the creation of this directive, which will guarantee SGIs as one of the main pillars of the European social model.
The directive should also deliver legal certainty, through a legal basis established on general principles such as equality of access, high quality services, reasonable costs, universality and security.
A balance has to be struck between the market on the one hand and the public authorities responsible for public services on the other.
Furthermore, the report raises fresh questions.
Will we actually be able to ensure that the framework directive will have sufficient substance to uphold the aforementioned principles?
Will the directive actually protect services of general interest?
Â Â  Mr President, MrÂ President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I will start by thanking the rapporteur for his good cooperation in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which, I hope, will continue into tomorrow.
I also have cause to be grateful for the way in which the significance of this report as one that determines the future of municipal services â or, to put it another way, of services of general interest â has been highlighted. That is also made clear by the amount of time allotted to the debate.
Those of us who have spent many years in local and regional politics will be aware that, as far as the public are concerned, politics begins at their own front door, and so subsidiarity requires that the right of communities to manage their own affairs, and hence the powers of local authorities, should not, despite the complexity of European structures, be tampered with.
It follows from that that municipalities must play a major part in defining and organising services of general interest, and that, in essence, must involve, seeking by every avenue available to offer these services to the public at as reasonable a price as possible, and must, of course, also mean that public and private service providers must be brought in as partners together.
We should continue to urge all the interested parties to take the line that limited market activity within the remits of local authorities should not be required to be subject to all the European rules and regulations in order that local authorities should not be deterred from entering into public/private partnerships that are, in fact, beneficial to the public.
What is needed is the sort of legal certainty that encourages municipal authorities to be creative in performing their services, that does not overburden them with bureaucracy and makes long-term forward planning possible.
Creativity and the guaranteed right, founded upon legal certainty, for municipalities to govern themselves, can be crucial in facilitating locally-based contributions to Europeâs economic growth.
Â Â  Mr President, the text of the resolution manages to strike the right balance as regards the freedom that the Member States should retain in future in terms of, on the one hand, the organisation and definition of their public functions and, on the other, the observance of internal market rules.
Europeâs focus â and the text of the resolution does not leave us in any doubt in that respect â must be on legal clarification and a sectoral approach where ambiguity creates problems.
We demand legal certainty, provided it does not get in the way of competition and protectionism.
We also demand legal certainty to help local and regional authorities, but we should be acutely aware that those selfsame local authorities want to retain their freedom of choice and do not want additional rules imposed from above.
We must, above all, provide room for diversity, and refrain from freezing this diversity in a horizontal regulatory framework.
If Europe is to be ready for battle, it must retain its dynamism.
President Barroso, I very much appreciate your personal attendance in this debate.
We demand clarity from you, but you can expect the same from us.
The Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will therefore vote against the Socialistsâ amendment which requests framework legislation.
MrsÂ vanÂ denÂ Burg mentioned the prejudices and misconceptions in respect of the intentions of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament.
Your group chairman, MrÂ Schulz, however, is feeding those prejudices himself by saying that we must, at European level, guarantee social standards, quality standards and quality of services.
That I regard as taking matters too far, and I will therefore be voting against framework legislation, and, for that matter, a horizontal regulatory framework.
Â Â  â Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent report and to thank him for his considerable readiness to negotiate and discuss.
It is thanks to the rapporteurâs approach that this report is a well-balanced compromise between various political alternatives.
The report is a very important step towards defining the legal status of services of general interest.
It should be highlighted that, in terms of European Union legislation, a framework directive on services of general interest is unnecessary.
These services should be dealt with by focusing on specific sectors and not on a general basis.
We should allow Member States to define what they consider to be services of general interest, according to their regional characteristics.
However, this right must not be used by the Member States to infringe the terms of the Treaty, especially in terms of free competition, state aid or public procurement.
Thus, the Member States should be able to define services of general interest within their territories but they should not be able to abuse this right, as they frequently tend to do.
Services of general interest are often used as an argument for protecting the public interest from the principles of the internal market.
In my opinion, a framework directive will not provide a satisfactory solution either for the European economy or for the consumers, namely the citizens of Europe.
We should deal with the problem by using a sectoral approach.
Â Â  Globalisation is confronting us with greater market openness, greater competition and ever more rapid innovation, all of which call for greater flexibility and adaptability.
Public services, being part of the social model, therefore need to continually adapt to new developments in globalisation, to democratic changes and to advances in science.
The European Parliament approved the Services Directive on the first reading and defined its scope.
Services of general economic interest were included in the scope of the Services Directive.
The approved draft Directive does not apply to services in the public interest, healthcare services and transport services.
In the 25 Member States of the European Union, services in the public interest have evolved in ways that reflect distinct regional traditions.
For this reason I would like to emphasise that it is absolutely imperative to comply with the subsidiarity principle.
In accordance with this principle, each and every Member State decides for itself which services will be provided by public institutions and which sectors will be liberalised.
In Slovakia, local and regional authorities elected and controlled by the public have done a good job in providing services for the common good and they are capable of continuing to secure rights relating to codecision, consumer protection and public welfare.
The competent public authorities should have appropriate instruments made available to them so that they will be able both to foster competition and to ensure consumer protection.
It is important to strengthen the powers of Member States to monitor the efficient fulfilment of public policy goals such as affordable prices and high-quality norms.
With a view to these considerations, I am convinced that it is not necessary to give the European Union additional powers in the area of services provided for the benefit of the public.
My position is clear â there is no legal basis for a framework directive on services in the public interest.
In conclusion, I would like to thank the rapporteur, MrÂ Rappkay, for his work.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to start with warm thanks to the Members whose input was crucial to the process of working through this issue, namely MrÂ SzÃ¡jer from the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, MrÂ Rapkay as the Houseâs principal rapporteur, and our shadow rapporteur MrÂ HÃ¶kmark.
What you, Mr President of the Commission, said this morning struck me as a perfectly adequate response to the concerns to which the Socialist Group in this House is giving expression by bringing in its own draft for a framework directive.
While we take â and continue to take â the view that this framework directive is not needed, it has to be said that it does address three areas in which there is conflict between the grass-roots interests of communities on the one hand and the interests of an effective European internal market on the other.
Irrespective of how clear-cut Members of this House might want the demarcation lines of the internal market to be, it has to be said that it is, in certain areas â whether in the tendering for and award of contracts, or in the law on competition or subsidies for municipalities â not an unmitigatedly bad thing.
What is needed, though, is to establish greater legal certainty in these areas.
It remains to be seen whether the communication, the prospect of which you have held out, will be sufficient for this purpose, but I do in any case believe that a communication is a more adequate way of addressing the problem than a framework directive in terms of its effects.
The fact is â as MrÂ Radwan has already said â that we have to consider the market versus subsidiarity dilemma far more from the point of view of the citizen, and the European social model, too â although I always wonder how people can keep on invoking it without having anything to say about what it actually is â envisages citizens and consumers being offered the best possible value for services wherever they are in Europe; that is where MrÂ Hudghton is very definitely right when he speaks so highly of the Scottish local authorities that are able to offer their services at very reasonable prices in line with the market.
If they want to carry on doing that in future, they will need to be given the legal certainty that will enable them to do so, but that does not mean that this is an area from which the market should be excluded.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to make three points.
Firstly, I think services should be open to competition.
That is why we are here and why we have European integration.
It is clear that Member States cannot sustain their welfare systems without the help of the private sector.
This whole debate is about having specific public services of general interest.
It has happened in a country near my own, Finland, formerly the Soviet Union.
It is absurd to think that services of general interest can be provided only by the public sector.
I should therefore like to promote public-private partnerships.
We should draw some lessons from the debate we had on the Services Directive.
My second point, then, is: There is no basis for it.
I do not want the Commission to come up with anything, not even a consolidating document.
It falls within the competence of the Member States.
It adds no value whatsoever.
Face the facts: the Commissionâs study makes it clear that there are huge differences between what we consider to be a service of general interest in Finland, for instance, and what is considered to be a service of general interest in France.
This debate is a smokescreen for monopolies and for protectionism.
That to me is completely anti-European.
Finally, I wish to second what my Polish colleague MrsÂ Handzlik said.
What is the right solution?
It is clear that we must have a sector-specific approach.
We have to go sector by sector, focus on cooperation and have clear priorities: healthcare, postal services, water and gas services and so on, but without a directive.
Let us stay clear of it.
Â Â  MrÂ President, fellow Members, you usefully referred, MrÂ Barroso, to the four basic principles that need to guide our thinking about services of general interest.
Paradoxically, it might be thought that you have reopened the debate on the need either to have a framework directive on services of general economic interest or to choose sectoral initiatives in relation to social or health services.
The vote on the Services Directive altered the parameters in favour of the second solution since the real dividing line lies not between services of economic and non-economic general interest but â within services of general economic interest â between social and health services and other services.
This development was reinforced by the detailed and legally painstaking work done by the rapporteur, MrÂ Rapkay, and our colleague, MrÂ HÃ¶kmark, who constructed a legal bridge between the Services Directive and the sectoral instruments.
Indeed, a framework directive on services of general economic interest raises three difficulties.
Firstly, the Treaty on European Union offers no legal basis, as has been pointed out on many occasions.
Next, this directive would be incompatible with the scope of the Services Directive, as voted on at first reading on 29Â May.
Finally, it in no respect meets the need for legal certainty expressed by the players and, at the same time, it threatens the subsidiarity called for by Member States and local authorities.
Whatever the instrument selected and the ideological choices that will help determine the option we choose, these are not what matter in the end.
The work of legal clarification needs to be continued in the field of social and health services of general interest.
That, MrÂ Barroso, is the practical problem faced by the actors on the ground.
Â Â  Mr President, this is an extremely interesting debate.
As you know, the Commission published a White Paper on the issue, recommending that a framework directive be put in place to cover services of general interest.
However, I do not agree with that approach; I believe that we should support regulations governing specific economic sectors.
I would certainly agree with the idea in principle, but I believe that an overarching directive would cause enormous confusion in the debate, especially in the debate in Member States.
It could lead to hysteria if people do not understand exactly what it means.
That is why I believe we have to be far more specific and look at the directive sector by sector, at the existing providers of services.
What we are trying to do here is improve services for the citizens of Europe so they will understand exactly what has been proposed; so that consumers will not be frightened that a directive which comes from Europe could privatise or undermine existing services within their country.
It is very important to approach this with clarity so people can understand exactly what has been proposed by both the Commission and Parliament.
The EU has competence over matters such as telecommunications, transport and energy, but it does not have competence under the EU Treaties to legislate in a broad capacity on matters governing the operation of social services, health and education within the different Member States.
The debate boils down to the powers of the EU institutions versus the competence of Member States.
We must be very careful with regard to that issue.
It surprises me that some Members are against that, whereas they are very much in favour of tax harmonisation between Member States.
To my mind that seems to contradict what they are saying in this debate.
I do not believe in tax harmonisation.
I believe that Member States should control their own tax systems. That would encourage competition within the Union.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ Barroso, fellow Members, education, health, postal services, water and transport are at the heart of a societyâs life.
What is essential to the management of public services designed to benefit the public is a public legal system.
It is in Europe that countries like France have invented this cooperative method of administering the shared dimensions of what is owned by society as a whole.
This is precisely a time when this intelligent technique for making services generally, indeed universally, available could inspire audacious solutions to worldwide problems in relation to water, basic medicines, education and all the shared dimensions of what is owned by the world as a whole, yet the European Commission is reducing the scope of this tool for guiding human societies, if not actually destroying it.
This mess consists in the destruction of what had worked for a century, and behind it is the belief that the market is supreme, that knowledge is its prophet and that all services need to be privatised, as the World Trade Organisation wants to see happen. Such services include those in support of our own sittings â organised by ourselves in the European Parliament as a social squat in which 300 people work without social papers.
MrÂ Barroso, beyond the technical problems explained by our fellow Members, such as MrÂ DÃ©sir who spoke just now, the problem is a cultural problem and a problem of choice.
Either we manage human societies according to the law of the market, which is to say the law of the jungle, or we manage them according to the law of reason.
MrÂ Barroso, do you want to continue in this haphazard manner, forever lauding the market while courting the International Monetary Fund one moment and the WTO the next, or do you want to sit down quietly and deal in reasonable terms with problems amenable to reason?
Â Â  . I should like firstly to say to you, MrÂ President, fellow Members, that I have greatly valued this debate.
I have found it really very interesting and I believe that it will be extremely useful.
We have not wasted our time, and I have been able to construct a much more specific idea both of your feelings on the subject and of the consequent difficulties in taking the matter forward.
In point of fact, the debate has confirmed the ambiguities that remain and to which a number of you have referred.
The Rapkay report is obviously wise and intelligent and seeks to establish a balance.
It is also the case, however, that it does not fully engage with a number of issues, and this ought, moreover, to give you a better understanding of the difficulties that the Commission has experienced for years in defining the matter and supplying more precise definitions.
That is because this is a complex matter.
Let us acknowledge the fact.
Even considered in a specific spatio-temporal framework, the issue is a difficult one because it involves reconciling principles that sometimes appear contradictory.
That is the way it is when it comes to the principles of the internal market and of competition â principles that are essential to our Community, that are inscribed in the Treaties and that the Commission is â let us be clear - absolutely obliged to respect, as it is obliged to respect the principles of state intervention and of the general interest.
If, however, the issue is already difficult in itself, it proves to be still more complex when placed in the developing context of space and time.
As a number of you have emphasised, the fact is that time constantly moves on, what with structural changes to our markets, increased pressure from international competition and major technological change.
In territorial terms, too, the situation varies a lot from one Member State to another, and there may indeed be big differences between levels of intervention at national, regional and even local level.
The issue is therefore extremely complex, which is why it is so difficult, or even impossible, to come up with a standard response according to the âone size fits allâ principle.
Does that mean that nothing can be done at European level?
I do not agree.
On the contrary. How, though, are we to approach the matter?
Let us look first at what must not be done.
I believe that there are two extreme approaches that must be avoided at all costs.
The first consists in saying that services of general interest fall completely outside Europeâs remit.
They are none of its business.
That is not the case.
Services of general interest are, in fact, our business because they are at the heart of our social model, and we want to preserve them.
Europe therefore has something to say about the matter.
The other radical approach consists in saying go ahead and regulate matters, as it will enable us â and people have been quite candid about this â to resist what is stated in the Treaties, the idea being that the Treaties tend rather to focus on liberalisation whereas the time has now come to question that perspective by enacting regulations opposed to the rules of the single market and of competition.
That is something that we cannot accept.
The single market is our great strength and one of the great successes of European integration.
If, however, we avoid these two extreme positions â which is to say that of absolutely minimum European intervention and that of a very high degree of intervention to offset the effects of the market - what can we do?
Having followed this debate, I think that the principles that I stated at the beginning and to which, moreover, the Rapkay report refers provide us with the solution.
I would therefore put the following suggestion to you, ladies and gentlemen. Instead of focusing on an abstruse debate on the usefulness or otherwise of a framework directive about which, as the debate has shown, there is obviously no consensus, why not focus on the substance, as the majority of Parliament seems to want to do?
What is the agreement about?
It is about subsidiarity, the desirability of which we all accept.
I believe that the national and local levels should be respected where this subject is concerned.
Compatibility between the internal market and the public interest must be ensured in every case where an apparent contradiction is noted.
Moreover â and this is, in my view, perhaps the most important point â there is the issue of what are the essential features of public services.
We all want them to be of high quality, to have a good quality-price ratio and to be accessible to all.
The need to modernise public services can therefore be accepted as a matter of principle, but without forgetting these essential factors.
Finally, mention must be made of the need for increased legal certainty.
Having met the various groups and heard the speeches by MrÂ Rapkay, MrsÂ Thyssen and many others, I think I can say that, if we agree about these four points, we do have a basic consensus on this matter and prospects for compromise. I think it is possible to take this matter forward while sticking to those principles of ours that define our European model: those of the internal market, respect for the rules of competition and defence of the general interest.
The communication we shall present will be along those lines, and I believe that the debate and my presence in this House today will help us fine-tune our ideas.
We shall propose something that will demonstrate that we have made progress in our thinking and, I hope, in our decisions concerning such an important subject that is at the very heart of what matters to Europe and to our fellow citizens.
Â Â  Mr President, I believe we are all more or less in agreement with what MrÂ Barroso has just said.
He is promising us a communication.
We are waiting impatiently for it.
But can the President tell us whether he will be asking his services to propose legislative texts as well so that Parliament can at last debate them as co-legislator?
Â Â  . Mr President, what I can say at this stage, having listened to the various views expressed, is this.
As I said, we will by the end of the year be presenting a communication that will be an advance on previous thinking.
So far as legislative texts are concerned, it seems to me that the debate has made it clear that we are a long way from a consensus on a framework directive.
Having said that, there will of course be legislative initiatives for different sectors.
Having said that, too, I think we need to give some thought to what can be done on a more general level; I and my services will be doing so â after all, the Commission is not just a set of services, the College and the President have ideas too.
I cannot at this stage say what our proposal will be, but â and now I am anticipating without committing the Commission, because it is a question I have to put to the College myself â it seems to me from the debate that it would be possible to adopt an approach combining the principles we have mentioned here, taking into account the need that many of you have voiced to avoid splitting Parliament and Europe today on the appropriateness of regulation, especially where the principle of subsidiarity is involved.
I believe that is possible and I would like to conclude with a comment of a political nature.
I am speaking to you as the convinced Europeans you are.
If we want to make progress on this dossier, it is essential that we avoid the polarisation we had with the services directive.
Just as Parliament and the institutions managed to find a positive political balance on that directive, it seems to me that we need the same kind of approach for this question.
If we become split between two extreme positions over whether or not there should be overall regulation of the issue, I think we will be heading towards a confrontation that will not be in the overall interests of Europe as we understand it.
Let us therefore concentrate on the substance.
There is after all enough in the Rapkay report that we agree on.
Then we will find a solution on the decision-making instruments.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the recommendation for second reading of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on the Council common position for adopting a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a Community Programme for Employment and Social Solidarity â PROGRESS (06282/3/2006 â C6-0272/2006 â 2004/0158(COD)) (Rapporteur: Karin JÃ¶ns) (A6-0300/2006).
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a happy outcome is worth waiting for; we will, today, be adopting the European Unionâs biggest-ever action programme in the fields of employment and social policy.
As its name indicates, PROGRESS stands for progress and social solidarity, and that is why this House saw it as important that it should be rolled out, as planned, at the beginning of January 2007, and that is what we are, by this vote, going to be able to do, now that the Council has accommodated our wishes.
I therefore want to thank all those who have played a part in making PROGRESS what it now is, namely a really comprehensive and, above all, well-funded strategic instrument that really can put the fight against unemployment, poverty and social exclusion on a more sustainable footing.
I must, though, also reiterate my thanks to our budget specialists from all the groups, who, in the trialogue negotiations, had a hard-won fight to get PROGRESSâ funding increased by almost 20%, which amounts to doing the impossible.
It was, in the past, repeatedly lamented that the previous multiannual programmes â which addressed the labour market, social integration, anti-discrimination and equality of opportunity â would not be enough to actually push through our social agenda in the way it had been planned for, that is to say, to facilitate a real and rapid exchange of political approaches, concepts and measures among the Member States and to bring them together in developing further indicators and more effective measures.
It was agreed that what was more needed was an exchange that was organised differently and better structured, together with more rigorous cooperation, and it is precisely this approach that PROGRESS takes, and it does so by not merely bringing the existing programmes together, but also by improving the structures of cooperation and involving policy-makers at all levels.
This, for example, involves the promotion of networking and mutual learning not only at the European level, but also across borders, and at the national, regional, and local levels.
I am very glad that we eventually managed to persuade the Commission and the Council to continue fostering cross-border sharing of experiences, for where else are we going to get the European added value for which we are constantly crying out?
In order, though, to circulate more rapidly the results of studies and analyses, experience gained and best practice, there will also, in future, be a forum tasked with the evaluation and implementation of the social policy agenda, which will also be involved in the further development of strategies and the setting down of new priorities.
I also see it as vitally important that we succeeded in giving the social partners and non-governmental organisations a considerably bigger role than the Commission had originally envisaged, so that they are now involved in the constructive monitoring and further development of the strategies rather than being limited in their functioning to merely pursuing the European objectives.
We have also extended Parliamentâs influence, in that we are fully involved not only in implementation but also in evaluation, with, for the first time, the Commissionâs reports on implementation being sent not only to the programme committee but also to us.
Finally, I would like, in particular, to thank Commissioner Å pidla, without whose support we would not have managed to incorporate in all language versions the concept â which is in fact more than a mere concept â of gender mainstreaming, as satisfactorily as we have now done.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the June agreement on the financial perspective raised hopes for a rapid and successful conclusion to the negotiations on the Community Programme for Employment and Social Solidarity â Progress, which is the main political instrument for supporting the implementation of the ambitious objectives that the Union set itself in the Lisbon Strategy.
Reality has borne this out.
Today you are preparing to announce the decision on which this programme is based.
I should like to take this opportunity to thank, in particular, the members of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs for their outstanding work and for their efforts throughout the negotiation process.
I should especially like to thank most warmly MrsÂ JÃ¶ns, Parliamentâs rapporteur on these matters, along with all of the shadow rapporteurs, without whom it would not have been possible to reach such a positive conclusion.
This text uses concepts based on the agreement reached between the institutions. The questions that Parliament raised in 2005 when it assessed the proposal at first reading have been taken on board.
The distribution of the budget between policy areas relating to our programme meets your expectations.
We have responded to your desire for greater prominence to be given to the area of gender equality.
This has also been the case with social inclusion and social protection.
Parliament will be closely involved every year in voting on the sums needed to implement the actions arising from the programme.
This was a point on which Parliament and the Commission share the same opinion.
We both believe that this must be done in a completely transparent way.
I am pleased to note that the Council has finally adopted this approach, which also paved the way for the negotiations to reach a speedy conclusion.
Lastly, I should like to thank the Members of Parliament, whose efforts and determination have helped bring about this excellent outcome.
Â Â  Mr President, can you explain or give any good reason why the votes have been arbitrarily postponed to 11.40, when previously they were announced for 11.30?
There was no need to start this debate at the time it did start.
Yet again, the administration of this Parliament is putting the convenience of the Presidency before the interests of Members.
It is not good enough.
Â Â  The debate is continuing because of delays in the voting process.
Â Â  , . I do not wish to prolong this debate by much.
First and foremost, I would like to offer particular thanks to MrsÂ JÃ¶ns, who has done some outstanding work on the programme.
Her work has made it possible for us to quickly achieve a solution and for this solution, in contrast to what happened on the last occasion, to come into effect very quickly indeed. is an important programme, a combined programme for dealing with employment and social issues, promoting equality and combating discrimination.
We have backed this idea of a combined programme.
One of the solutions was for us here in the European Parliament to make efforts to have more money appropriated to the programme within the framework of the long-term budget, since this is a matter relating to the social Europe about which we so often speak.
The agreement to provide more money for the programme also facilitated agreement about the programme as a whole.
There was a certain degree of discord in relation to the issues of equality and social integration, but these issues have since been resolved.
These areas of the programme have received extra resources in order to provide greater equality, social integration and social protection.
This has not been done at the expense of other areas.
Resources have instead been taken from the reserve.
I believe that this will be a very good solution and I believe that will play a role in the construction of the social Europe of the future.
I would like to thank MrsÂ JÃ¶ns once more for her excellent work.
Â Â  The next item is the vote.
Â Â  . Mr President, I have a very brief textual clarification, which refers to paragraph 1.
The final clause reads: â... to prepare themâ â that is to say school students â âfor their roles as future citizens and as members of the European Unionâ.
I propose that we delete the word âfutureâ so that it will read as follows: â... to prepare them for their roles as citizens and as members of the European Unionâ.
Â Â  Madam President, the European Parliament is delighted to welcome you to its plenary sitting, and it is an honour for me to welcome the first woman to be elected President of an African country, as well as the delegation of Ministers and Members of Parliament accompanying you.
I must tell my fellow Members of the European Parliament that the Presidentâs delegation contains more parliamentarians than ministers.
I would like to remind this House that you were also the first woman to become Finance Minister in your country in 1979, 27 years ago now.
Unfortunately, your country suffered a coup dâÃ©tat in the following year. In 1980 there began a quarter of a century of violence in Liberia, a 14-year civil war, the systematic plundering of the country's resources and a mass violation of the human rights of its inhabitants.
The results of this horrendous and long war â as long as the old religious wars of Europe â could not have been more tragic: 250Â 000 victims in a country of three million people - almost 10% of the population.
A million people had to leave their homes â some of whom are now returning â and there was a mass rape of women â more than 25Â 000.
During that era, three quarters of the population were âlivingâ â if it can be called living â on less than one dollar per day, and up to 85% of the population were unemployed.
In other words, there was no economy in the sense that we understand it in the developed Western societies.
Madam President, under those circumstances it cannot be an easy task for any politician to take on the presidency of a country.
Our Parliament is delighted with the role that the Economic Community of Western African States (ECOWAS) played in the peace talks in 2002 that led to the presidential elections that you won last November.
The European Parliament sent observers to those elections, and the head of the delegation, MrÂ vanÂ denÂ Berg, made it clear in his report that, despite a few small incidents, the elections had taken place in accordance with the rules governing them.
We are therefore receiving you today as a symbol of the rule of law, of peace, of democracy, of women's rights and of the fight against corruption and impunity.
If you read the President of Liberiaâs biography, you will see how often she has resigned from her posts because she disagreed with the ways governments were tackling the problem of corruption in her country.
You will also remember that last April, here in plenary, I had the opportunity to express my satisfaction at the arrest and extradition of Charles Taylor, which the European Parliament had called for in various resolutions and which were finally carried out at the request of the President.
This represents progress in the fight against impunity for war criminals throughout the world.
It is therefore something that we welcome, and I wished to say this today while you are here.
After so much suffering, we want to offer you our support.
It is good that the guns have fallen silent.
As soon as the guns fall silent, however, the task begins of reconstructing the country â a task that is of less interest to the television cameras â and the danger is that it may be forgotten now that the battlefield has been abandoned.
This would not be the first time that, having found peace, a society has not found the road to reconciliation and the economy has not found the road to development.
In travelling along that road, Madam President, you will find that Europe will be there to help you in order to ensure that Liberia continues to be that symbol of liberty that it was at its birth.
Our hope and desire is that you can build a future of hope for all of the people of your country which will serve as a symbol for the whole of Africa.
You have the floor, Madam President.
Â Â  . Mr President, honourable Members, it is with a deep sense of gratitude that I and my delegation join you today on the occasion of your formal sitting.
On behalf of the Government and people of Liberia I extend warm greetings and felicitations to you, honourable Members, and through you, to your respective governments and peoples.
I am honoured by the opportunity to make a few remarks.
It has been barely eight months since the full responsibility of rebuilding post-conflict Liberia was passed over to us, following our victory during the democratically held 2005 elections.
We accepted the responsibility fully aware of the magnitude of the challenges that our country faces after 14 years of civil war and destruction.
The damage and negative consequences have been enormous, deepening the state of poverty throughout the country.
Today, GDP per capita at USD 163 (2005) represents a 90% decline as compared with the pre-1980s pre-war levels due to sanctions and cutbacks in activities in productive sectors such as agriculture, forestry and mining.
Exports declined similarly by over 95% for the same period.
Our huge external debt estimated at USD 3.7 billion represents 800% of GDP and 3000% of export earnings while domestic debt and non-salary arrears are estimated at USD 700 million.
Our budget, just passed recently, at USD 129 million, although increased by over 50% from the previous fiscal year still accounts for less than 30% compared with two decades ago.
When we took office there was no electricity and no water.
Schools and clinics had crumbled, roads were impassable.
Institutions of governance had completely collapsed and corruption was rampant.
HIV/Aids rates had soared.
Few children were in school and many were dying of curable diseases.
Today, well over three-quarters of our people live below the poverty line of USD 1 per day.
An overwhelming majority of those people, mainly the youth, are either unemployed or employed in the informal sector.
Yet, I am pleased to tell you, Liberians are resilient people. For even after everything they have endured, the people of Liberia have faith in new beginnings.
They are counting on me and our administration to create the conditions that will guarantee the realisation of their dreams.
Their dreams are not complicated.
They just want the simple things that most people take for granted: to live their lives in peace, get a good education and to be able to provide for their families.
Those things are not too much for Liberians to dream about.
But time is pressing.
As you all know, the risks of regression to war in post-conflict societies is high when the government and the international community are not able to make strong efforts at key moments and sustain them over time.
Liberia today is at one of those key moments.
Our efforts, joined by those of our partners over the next few months, the next year and beyond, will determine the future course of our nation.
If we wait too long to introduce the policy changes and reforms that are needed, or if our international partners wait too long to ramp up its support, then we may lose the best chance Liberia has had in a generation to end the conflict permanently and build the foundations for growth and prosperity.
We cannot afford to let that happen.
We must quickly consolidate the potential dividends of Liberiaâs hard-won peace and arrest the economic and financial haemorrhaging.
We must respond to the deep wounds of the civil war, and enhance national governance, while quickly introducing new measures of structural reform.
We must base our approach on the core principles of democracy, accountability, free enterprise, good governance, respect for human rights, and equitable distribution of our natural resources.
So with everything said and done, what must we do first?
Poverty reduction strategies are at the core of both averting a return to conflict and establishing the foundation for sustained development.
We are basing our strategy on four pillars of reconstruction and development.
The first pillar is enhancing security and consolidating peace in our country.
Without peace and security there can be no development or prosperity.
We must redouble our efforts to train our forces, not just in security matters but also in being accountable to the people.
Our security forces over the years have been quite corrupt and largely dysfunctional.
They have lacked the trust of the population and have been used to terrorise the population and to intervene in political processes without respect for due process or law.
We want to change that.
We must develop a clear national strategy that will take into account the gradual withdrawal of UN peace-keeping forces.
We have already started the process.
We have completed the deactivation of members of our armed forces and are well on the way in recruiting a new army comprising 2000 soldiers to be adequately trained and well equipped.
With the strong help of UN agencies and other partners, we have facilitated the return of 70 000 refugees and 50 000 internally displaced persons since the inauguration.
Our police force and other security units are being restructured and trained.
It is important that we find the means to resettle them in productive endeavours.
Second, we need to revitalise our economy.
We need to focus strongly on agriculture, both in food and cash crops with emphasis on the rehabilitation of our traditional rubber industry.
We also expect rapid growth in our forestry, mining and other natural resource-based industry, based upon policies that aim at creating an investment climate that will encourage investment in activities in which Liberia can compete internationally.
These activities will create jobs to tackle the 80% unemployment which we face, particularly among our youth.
Towards this end, we cancelled all non-compliant forestry concession agreements and are in the midst of establishing a new concessions framework for our natural resource products, to ensure the strong growth of these sectors.
We have taken an aggressive stance in collecting revenue owed to the government, and already revenues have jumped by over 20%.
We have reached agreement with the International Monetary Fund on a Staff Monitoring Programme, and by all accounts our performance to date has been strong.
We are concluding our Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy which articulates priority interventions over the period July 2006 through December 2007.
This builds upon our 150 day Action Plan under which 70% of our desired results were achieved.
The third element of our vision is improving democratic governance.
The over-concentration of power and a closed political system bred corruption, restricted access to the decision-making processes, limited the space for civil society participation in the processes of governance, and fuelled ethnic and class animosities and rivalries over time.
We are working through statutory and policy changes to revise these constraints on democracy and development.
We are determined to fight corruption, which has eaten away the fabric of our nationhood and society.
We are well along the way to developing a strong anti-corruption strategy and a supporting legal and regulatory framework.
Our weak judicial system is under reform and being strengthened.
We are working towards decentralising decision-making and allocating appropriate resources to county and municipal governments to support their own identified programmes and projects.
We are placing emphasis on empowering the people, especially the poor and vulnerable, to become participants in the development process.
The fourth and final pillar of our agenda is revitalising our social and physical infrastructure.
Education is central to renewal and reconciliation.
Our vision of education for all â young and old â demands that we enforce the policy of full universal primary education and introduce literacy programmes in communities throughout the country with our resilient market women as key targets.
We recognise that no nation can develop under conditions of a 70% illiteracy rate.
We must respond particularly to our war-affected youth, providing them with opportunities for school and skills training programmes.
We must also rehabilitate health facilities that have been partially or completely destroyed.
Only 10% of our population today has access to healthcare.
This must increase to at least 50% within the medium term.
We must confront the growing HIV/AIDS problem, and fight malaria, parasites, malnutrition and other diseases that kill so many of our children.
Our roads are in a terrible state.
Without a decent road network it will be nearly impossible to consolidate security, encourage new economic activity and strengthen local governance.
We must also improve other social infrastructure, such as water and sanitation facilities.
In what we consider one of our most important achievements, in July of this year we were able to turn on electricity and water to parts of our capital city, Monrovia, for the first time in 15 years.
We are proud that we were able to achieve in six months what previous governments had failed to do over so many years.
We should like to thank the European Union through the European Commission for all they have done to support us in these first beginnings.
But that accomplishment is just a beginning.
Our mission is to make the Liberian Government work again and be more responsive in delivering quality services to the Liberian people.
The associated challenges are so daunting and the needs and expectations of our people so massive that our Government cannot satisfactorily respond by itself.
There is a critical need for forging and building strong strategic partnerships.
To this end, let me use this opportunity to express our deep appreciation for the continued assistance we have received over the years from the European Community collectively as well as from individual Member States.
The Government and people of Liberia appreciate this concerted support and we are keen to harness it for the recovery, reconstruction and development of our country.
We take interest in the ongoing reforms within European Union development assistance to African nations, as well as the new European consensus on development towards poverty eradication.
It is our desire to work with our colleagues to conclude the ongoing Economic Partnership Agreement negotiations, bearing in mind the need to arrive at a consensus on bringing into an equitable balance the development imperatives usually derived from such partnership agreements.
Furthermore, the anticipated European Development Day celebration will no doubt enhance the content and results of your partnership with our countries.
We welcome this innovative initiative and look forward to its good results.
In summary, we are off to a good start. For that we are grateful to the Liberian people and to the international community, including the European Union and the European Commission, which are key partners in this regard.
It is just a start.
In the next few months, we will be engaged in serious planning for our Partnership Conference, which is to take place in the first quarter of next year, and in developing our medium-term poverty reduction and growth strategy.
We will continue our strong start in the budgetary process and adopt appropriate fiscal regulations with the GEMAP framework.
But it is critical that in the next few months Liberians begin to see steady, tangible progress.
I would like to ask all our partners to work closely with us in the next few weeks so that we can make sure that the many activities that need to be implemented during the upcoming dry season are ready to go on time.
We cannot afford to waste any time, and in many projects we need to speed the process of disbursement and implementation.
We specifically ask for your support for this objective through the European Commission.
I also want to make sure that we do not face gaps in critical support during the transition between our emergency programmes winding down and longer-term development programmes getting started.
In too many countries, this transition does not go smoothly and critical momentum can be lost.
Finally, I want to make sure that the efforts of Government and partners are fully synchronised and harmonised.
To best prepare for the Partners Conference, we need to make sure that partners are supporting the most important initiatives, that there is not undue overlap and duplication, and that together with both strong planning and rapid and effective implementation we can be assured that we will take advantage of this critical moment in Liberiaâs history to put the conflict to rest and speed the process of reconstruction and development.
We are glad that our nation has been blessed.
Liberia is not a poor country, but a country that has been poorly managed.
We are committed to change that; to pursue those goals that will move us from the crisis of the past to the opportunity of the present.
We are committed, as a people, to build a new Liberia from the ashes of an old turbulent past to a future of hope and promise.
We are committed to strategic partnerships based upon mutuality of respect and benefits.
We thank you all, collectively and bilaterally, for the support provided so far.
We thank you, President Borrell Fontelles, for the opportunity of being here and we look forward to working with each and every one of your countries in the coming months and into the future.
Thank you.
Â Â  Madam President, I would just like to thank you briefly for your words.
I am sure that your presence here in the European Parliament and the words that you have addressed to us will help to make the whole of Europe fully aware of your countryâs problems and to commit itself to development in Africa.
We are all aware of the extent to which Europe is now concerned about immigration from Africa and we all know that it is only by overcoming the problems that you have described that we will be able to establish the relationship of cooperation that you have talked about today.
Thank you very much, Madam President.
Â Â  We shall resume the vote.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to request a roll-call vote for the next two amendments, Amendment 3 (paragraph 7) and Amendment 4 (paragraph 25), because those amendments are totally against the spirit of my report.
Â Â  MrÂ President, as I see it, it is fundamentally wrong to demand roll-call votes immediately before we proceed to vote.
Although we have no fears when it comes to appending our names to this, I do see this as setting a precedent, and therefore believe that there are fundamental reasons why it is wrong.
Â Â  That concludes the vote.
Â Â  I voted in favour of the excellent report by MrÂ Mavromattis on the important subject of relations between the media and development.
Enshrined in ArticleÂ 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights adopted by the United Nations in 1948, freedom of expression and information is recognised as a fundamental right.
Freedom of the media is essential to the good governance of public or private bodies and contributes to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals of creating a safe, poverty-free world by 2015.
Freedom of the media is essential to access to knowledge and to transparency and it must be entirely independent.
It makes a great contribution to combating ignorance, that ancient scourge of humanity, and it prevents corruption.
Although I regret that the issue of the responsibility of authors, holders, users and distributors of information has not been better incorporated, I welcome this reportâs significant contribution to freedom, peace and democracy in the world.
Â Â  In his report, the rapporteur discusses the important role played by the media in a countryâs development.
A democracy requires freedom of expression and of the press.
Good access to the media for all groups in society is also required if a society is to function well.
There are, however, some elements in the report to which we are strongly opposed.
Clearly, we remain solidly behind our view that aid should not be managed at Community level.
It is a matter for the Member States.
Moreover, the EU should likewise not be carrying out information campaigns within the Member States.
On the whole, however, we believe that the content of the report is sound.
We have thus voted in favour of the report in todayâs vote.
Â Â  â I supported the Beazley report on support for initiatives to complement national school curricula providing appropriate support measures to include the European dimension.
It is clear that the inclusion of European history, shared cultural heritage and a grasp of European current affairs must go hand in hand with the development of other areas such as support for multilingualism.
I welcome the fact that MrÂ Beazley mentioned the education portal European School net and its activities.
I should also like to highlight the eTwinning project, which is charged with linking up educational institutions from different European countries in order to set up joint projects. Over 17Â 000 European schools have signed up to eTwinning.
This own-initiative report is a good way to help Member States incorporate European topics into their education systems.
Â Â  I voted in favour of the excellent report by MrÂ Beazley on initiatives to complement school curricula providing appropriate support measures to include the European Dimension.
In terms of European construction, everybody knows how crucial it is to instil a European culture amongst the citizens, particularly young people: it is essential to the success of the European project in terms of creating a humanist civilisation.
In addition to learning languages, the history and geography of the European Union should, together with the arts and citizenship, be disciplines whose European dimension should be brought to the fore.
I entirely agree with this reportâs suggestions, particularly on involving teachers with incorporating the European dimension into education.
I believe that there should be a similar process for universities and for lifelong learning.
Â Â  . Whereas, on the one hand, we accept that there are differences between and within the Member States as regards the inclusion of the European dimension in education, and that, given the crucial importance of languages, the COMENIUS and LINGUA programmes should be awarded more substantial Community funding, we disagree, on the other hand, that there is a single vision of so-called European history and values.
Each country has its particular characteristics and each people its own history, and yet even this can be viewed from different angles depending on one's perspective.
We feel that Europeâs richness comes from its diversity of its cultures and languages, and this is something that must be preserved.
Any standardisation must be avoided.
Accordingly, although the report highlights some positive points as regards language and other skills, following up previous reports and existing Community programmes, we are opposed to any attempt at standardisation to which it might lead.
Hence our abstention.
Â Â  The June List has previously pointed out in the European Parliament â and now does so again â that the Member States have sole responsibility for the organisation of teaching and the content of education systems.
The European Parliament has previously stated that, amongst other things, it wishes to get involved in language teaching and the adjustment of education systems to areas such as new technology and digitalisation.
Now it is the European dimension that is to find its way into curriculums.
How is the European dimension in the common history and cultural heritage of Europe to be defined, however?
And by whom?
We must act in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity.
It is for the Member States themselves to advocate democracy and tolerance in Europe when devising their school curriculums and addressing their citizens.
These matters must not be regulated at EU level.
We have therefore voted against this report.
Â Â  This own-initiative report does not seek to interfere with national competences regarding education.
Essentially, this report seeks to ask for clarification as to what is the 'European dimension'.
There are a number of programmes that exist for teacher exchanges and for students such as the ERASMUS/SOCRATES programme.
However, in the UK there are large numbers of students who are not aware of these opportunities and the UK is falling behind other countries in sending students abroad.
Since the Labour government made GCSE languages non-compulsory, the number of students studying French and German this year alone was 14% less than in the previous year.
Due to the language of the oral amendment which is ambiguous, British Conservatives were not able to accept this report in its entirety.
Â Â  . Our support for the Beazley report reflects our desire to see a strong emphasis on the teaching of languages to inculcate a culture of multilingualism within our education systems in Ireland.
We also believe that all citizens should have access to detailed and unbiased information about the European Union and how it affects their lives.
Sinn FÃ©in's support of the Beazley report (A6-0267/2006) 'The European Dimension of school teaching materials' should not be viewed as an endorsement of an increased role for the European Union in the education system of Member States.
Education is a responsibility for each Member State and should remain so.
Â Â  . The debate on the European dimension in schools could easily pass by unnoticed.
Yet this is a debate that raises some fundamental issues.
We must not forget that any decisions we take in the area of education will have a decisive impact on future generations, and on their lives and their worldview.
I therefore feel that MrÂ Beazleyâs comments on language skills are extremely apt, and would reiterate that the European Indicator of Language Competence must not give the wrong idea: to foster the widespread learning of just a few European languages would be counterproductive.
It is vital that we promote other European languages outside Europe.
This is a treasure trove of knowledge that the whole of Europe should be promoting.
In this regard, we should be following the example of certain countries such as Austria, Spain, Portugal and Slovenia.
The European dimension has a well-established place in the education systems of these countries, and people are encouraged to learn European languages.
The European dimension in schools must not be neglected, especially in view of Europe's place in the world, the new challenges of economic growth that we face and the objectives of policies on cooperation with the rest of the world.
Â Â  . I congratulate our rapporteur on his initiative.
Education is and must remain a Member State competence.
Indeed, we in Scotland control our own education system and have for centuries.
However, our rapporteur makes the very fair point that often our youngsters leave school ill-equipped to participate as citizens, and often know little about the EU or other governments which work for them.
The steps set out in this report make interesting homework for teachers across the EU.
Â Â  . While I support initiatives to enhance the study of foreign languages, to improve knowledge of the culture and history of the many European countries and to stimulate genuine debate about the nature of the EU, including its many fundamental flaws, I am strongly opposed to measures designed to inculcate support for the EU project of political integration and to construct some false identity of 'European' citizenship.
The report confuses these various aspects. I therefore abstained.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, it is no doubt true that clean air is a crucial issue for all of us, and we also have to bear in mind the certainty of the expense resulting from poor air quality in Europe being higher than the implementation costs incurred by business and industry, but the derogations and potential extensions contained in the compromise document are too complex and likely to present serious administrative problems, and it is for that reason that the delegation of the Austrian Peopleâs Party has largely rejected these compromises.
They also need to be considered in the light of âbetter regulationâ, something that they cannot be said to achieve.
It is for that reason that the whole package was largely worthy of rejection; we would prefer the Council position.
Â Â  â My vote with regard to the Krahmer and Corbey reports was in favour of higher levels for the quality of air and for stricter controls in this area.
The main motive for my decision is the way Maltese and Gozitan citizens are at present being treated by the countryâs authorities.
We are in a situation where not only are European standards not being respected, but people are not even being given the information they have a right to if they are to protect their health and the environment.
A concrete example of this was the fact that it was only after an intervention on my part that the authorities publicly admitted that European directives regarding emissions from the countryâs power-stations were being breached.
Moreover, we have reached the stage where the equipment which gauges pollution from the Marsa and Delimara power stations has not been functional for months after it was reportedly hit by lightning.
The Maltese daily yesterday revealed that we are still not taking adequate measures, given that the new apparatus has not been purchased yet.
This is not acceptable and it is incumbent on the responsible authorities and the European Commission to follow this breach more closely.
Â Â  I voted in favour of the report by MrÂ Krahmer on the draft legislative resolution, at first reading, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on ambient air quality and cleaner air for Europe.
This proposed directive is going to replace five different legal instruments and contribute to the âbetter lawmakingâ process, and that is a very positive step.
Combating atmospheric pollution is a duty we owe to future generations and, in view of recent developments in science and health issues, it is perfectly natural to revise and simplify the current texts.
We must welcome the efforts of transport manufacturers and firms that have applied rules that are sufficiently strict to meet the challenges facing us; not least the health of our fellow citizens.
We must ensure that the Member States transpose the rules and apply them rigorously.
Â Â  We support common minimum standards for air pollution.
The Directive has a solid enough legal basis in Articles 175 and 176, which state that the Member States may retain or adopt provisions with a view to ensuring more extensive protection.
However, ArticleÂ 176 also states that such protection must be notified to the Commission, and must not be in contravention of the treaties.
The limit values for air pollution may be in conflict with the internal market, for which reason we do not believe that a directive with Articles 175 and 176 as its legal basis is of itself a sufficient guarantee of the ability of the Member States to retain or adopt provisions with a view to attaining higher levels of protection.
We are nonetheless voting âyesâ, as we find common minimum standards desirable, and we shall therefore be putting forward proposals during the second reading in Parliament providing a legal basis in the directive to safeguard the right of the Member States to adopt more stringent provisions and to make it clear that they have this right.
Â Â  . â Clean air for the citizens, their health and their quality of life is a good intention.
Unfortunately, the report which we have just adopted is not up to the task.
This text falls short of World Health Organisation recommendations and lacks the necessary urgency.
PM2.5 are the finest particles and the ones most dangerous to the body; that is why the limit should not be more than 12Â micrograms.
Moreover, the implementation periods, extending as they do to 2015, do not reflect the seriousness of the problem and it is unacceptable that there should also be exemptions.
I also deplore the fact that this first reading was the direct result of compromise between the political groups, preventing Parliament from working properly and locking us into a position that falls far short of our political objectives.
Lastly, this report does not reflect the ambitions we have nevertheless clearly expressed in environmental matters, both in the international arena and to the European public.
Â Â  . The high level of air pollution in particular in urban regions and centres in the EU with high population density is, among other factors, responsible for countless respiratory diseases and for causing serious damage to ecosystems.
Most at risk are children, the elderly and people living in the most populous cities or close to busy roads.
The pollution limit values put forward in the Commissionâs first proposal were a step backward in relation to what was agreed in 1999, that is to say, in Directive 1999/30/EC.
In this regard, I particularly wish to highlight fine particulate matter limits (PM2.5), which are very high and which exceed those set by the World Health Organisation.
The proposals tabled by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left were unfortunately rejected in the debate in Parliament.
Accordingly, the document that has just been adopted is limited in scope, although it does contain some welcome proposals aimed at striking a degree of balance as regards combating pollution, albeit in watered-down form.
Hence our abstention.
Â Â  I abstained on the Krahmer report, the main parts of which are impossible for ordinary mortals to understand, including the legislature that is supposed to make the law.
If Parliament wants to commit itself to ambient air quality, it should be content to set the broad principles and the general framework, leaving it to the experts to set the limits.
Â Â  . Ambient air quality is a vital factor in the health and quality of life of Europeâs citizens.
This proposal is therefore of the highest importance.
As part of the drive to simplify environmental legislation, it brings five of the existing provisions on air quality under one single directive.
It also proposes more ambitious targets than the existing provisions.
We therefore endorse the introduction of new objectives for PM10 and, above all, the setting of target values for PM2.5, which is considered the most harmful particle matter to human health, but which is yet to be covered by European-level legislation.
We tabled a number of amendments introducing measures such as a five-yearly review of the Directive in order that the most up-to-date scientific findings can be taken on board, air quality guarantees, the exclusion of certain areas that we do not consider relevant because they have little public access or are already subject to proper checks, and, lastly, the simplification of roadside measuring criteria.
The Portuguese Social Democrat MEPs support the Krahmer report, with the above amendments.
Â Â  . The high number of respiratory diseases and of human lives lost due to a high level of air pollution demonstrates the urgent and pressing need for another Community legislative measure on health protection that will further limit emissions that are harmful to humans.
The abnormally high percentages of birth defects in some industrial regions of the European Union are of particular concern.
The case of the Sicilian petrochemicals plants is typical: of the 13Â 000 babies born between 1992 and 2002, almost 1Â 000 have heart, limb and digestive tract defects, while the mortality rate among males with stomach cancer is 57% higher than the Italian national average.
In some urban areas, too, such as in the city of Messina, which absorbs traffic day and night in the form of vehicles leaving Sicily bound for the European continent and vice versa, the situation has become unbearable.
The Union for Europe of the Nations Groupâs position in favour of the Krahmer report is a further incentive for the fight against air pollution in Europe to be stepped up in the years to come.
Â Â  . â Air pollution is a major public health concern.
For example, the fine particles given off by some human activities are thought to shorten European life expectancy by around nine months.
In Belgium alone, nearly 13Â 000 people die prematurely every year as a result of particles given off by diesel engines in particular.
All these respiratory diseases can be avoided and the legislators ought to send out a simple message: clean air for Europe necessarily means stringent pollution standards.
That is not the message the European Parliament has sent out today by adopting Holger Krahmerâs report on the CAFE directive.
I deplore the fact that in a matter of such importance to the public, the impact of pollution on human health, my fellow Members have lacked ambition, seeking in particular not to hit certain industries.
I still hope that the European Parliament will rectify the matter at second reading, be more receptive to the arguments of environmental health experts and avoid the pitfall of setting standards that are not as strict as those in force today.
With this vote, California has never seemed so far away.
Â Â  . It is positively scandalous that today sees Parliament considerably weakening existing air quality regulations.
For the first time, this House is even adopting a weaker position than the Council.
Despite this, there is sufficient scientific evidence to suggest that fine dust particles in air pollution account for some 3.6 million lost life years, which translates into 348Â 000 premature deaths.
By 2020, air pollution caused by ozone and fine dust will cost Europe EUR 189 to 609 billion annually!
This Houseâs position is considerably less ambitious than the recommendations issued by the World Health Organisation, and those levels proved attainable in large cities in industrialised countries.
What is worse, Parliament is offering Member States the opportunity of extending the number of calendar days during which the limit value for PM10 dust particles per calendar year can be exceeded from 35 days to 55, which is tantamount to burying your head in the sand.
The USA, by issuing an annual limit value of 15 Âµg/m3 for PM2.5 since 1997, has demonstrated that a stricter approach is feasible.
The limit must be attained by 2010 at the latest.
The State of California, incidentally, is taking matters even further, for a limit value of 12Â Âµg/m3 has been in force there since 2003.
The European Parliament stands by its promise to attain 20 Âµg/m3 by ...
2015!
If the Council does not offer enough in the way of counterweight against this weakening measure, the Commission will have no choice but to withdraw the proposal.
Â Â  . British Conservatives note with approval the Court of Auditors' observation that progress has been made with regard to the integrity of the EU accounts.
We are dismayed to note, however, that the auditors have indicated that there are continuing weaknesses in supervisory and control systems and we support the rapporteur's opinion that those weaknesses should be addressed as a matter of utmost priority.
With regard to the European Parliament's lease of the Strasbourg parliament buildings, we acknowledge and approve the fact that the report states that the parliament authority behaved correctly but that the City of Strasbourg had failed to act in good faith.
However, we believe that the continued occupancy of two seats by the European Parliament represents poor value for money to the European taxpayer and, therefore, we can not support any proposal to purchase the Strasbourg parliament buildings.
For these reasons the British Conservatives have abstained on the final vote on the Ferber report.
Â Â  I voted in favour of discharge, but I abstained on the resolution because the Committee on Budgetary Control insists on mixing issues that are real with those that are not.
Parliament cannot change a seat established by treaty simply by adopting a resolution.
The Committee on Budgetary Control has got it all wrong on the question of the rents paid and the purchase price of the buildings in Strasbourg.
In a market economy, it is impossible to speak of a fair rent because all rents and all purchase prices are negotiated between the owner and the lessee or the purchaser.
Even if the way Strasbourg behaved may be considered discourteous, there was no illegality or misappropriation.
That is precisely what some Members and some of the media have claimed, obviously without a shadow of evidence.
I wish to disassociate myself from these unsavoury individuals.
Â Â  The June List is of the opinion that discharge should not be granted to the President for the 2004 financial year.
There are two main reasons for this.
The first of these is that we believe the leadership of the European Parliament is just as responsible as the city of Strasbourg for the fact that, for years, too much rent has been paid for the premises in Strasbourg.
This has cost EU taxpayers large amounts of money, and Parliament should, in this case, take a strong line to ensure that the excess rent is repaid.
Since, as things stand, there is still a lack of information as regards the size of the excess payments (see paragraphÂ 19 dash five of the draft report), we also believe that we have still not got to the bottom of this matter.
The second reason is that we believe that the European Parliament as an institution should not be made responsible for the shortfall in the MEPsâ additional pension scheme.
The pension rights accruing to MEPs must be linked to the investment performance of their pension fund.
That is how it works for ordinary citizens throughout the EU, and MEPs ought not to be given a special luxury perk in this respect.
Â Â  . The vote on the report on the discharge of the budget for 2004 (European Parliament) was postponed in order to look into the circumstances surrounding the lease of the Strasbourg building.
Subsequently, the European Parliament has paid the City of Strasbourg up to EURÂ 60Â million in additional payments, and there is no possibility of compensation for the losses it has suffered.
In addition, a lack of honesty, transparency and decisiveness has been noted.
Despite these facts, we should make a decision on purchasing the Strasbourg building.
The FDP in the European Parliament is of the opinion that it is wrong for Parliament to purchase the building in Strasbourg, because it would be irresponsible for it to tie itself to Strasbourg for the long term.
We have therefore rejected the corresponding amendments.
The FDP supports the establishment of the European Technology Institute in Strasbourg, and advocates a single seat for Parliament in Brussels.
Â Â  . This report is about more than rubberstamping the bill pertaining to the 2004 financial year.
Without AmendmentÂ 9, it also gives this Houseâs Bureau licence to spend the reserve on the purchase of buildings in Strasbourg.
We have nothing against the calculation that shows that a purchase will prove more beneficial in the long run than extending the rental agreement.
We would vote in favour if that were the only issue involved.
More importantly, it makes a significant contribution to our being able to carry on the monthly part-sessions in Strasbourg in a sustainable manner.
These are now setting us back EUR 200Â 000Â 000 or more annually.
In September 1999, the Dutch Parliament unanimously spoke out against the European Parliament continuing to sit in two different cities.
As a result, the Dutch representatives across all EU bodies were urged to put an end to this practice at the earliest opportunity.
That reflects what is being said in the Dutch media and the opinion which the public has held on this matter for years.
Whilst the Netherlands considers the purchase of buildings in Strasbourg as one of this Houseâs key decisions, the issue, that is concealed in the purchase authorisation, is not addressed separately after this item on the agenda.
That is why we will be voting against.
Â Â  The chief virtue of the Ferber report is that it ends an argument that has gone on for only too long.
That is why I am voting in favour of discharge.
I am not happy about a number of things it says, however.
While it is settled that the City of Strasbourg has not committed any legal irregularity, the charge of discourtesy is too convenient an excuse for some Members who simply want to take advantage of the occasion to raise the question of the seat again.
Having followed the matter of the buildings in every detail, it is clear to me that it has been dominated by bad faith.
When the European Parliament, whose Members were inadequately informed about a complex legal arrangement, says it was not in the picture about the subletting of the buildings, that is quite simply untrue.
It was never the City of Strasbourgâs intention to âfleeceâ this Assembly.
Finally, the proposed purchase of the three buildings is good news for the European taxpayer.
I am sad to note that the Membersâ pension fund has been the subject of unjustified attacks on the principle of âslander as much as you like, there will always be something leftâ.
Â Â  We have today chosen to vote in favour of MrÂ Ferberâs report on the discharge for implementation of the European Union general budget for the financial year 2004.
It has not been possible to confirm that any unlawful activities have taken place in connection with the renting of two of the buildings used by the European Parliament in Strasbourg.
At the same time, it seems clear that the principle of âsound financial managementâ, as defined in the Financial Regulation, has not been fully respected.
To buy the current buildings is a good business deal in the long term, from a strictly financial point of view.
Despite this, we believe that, given the current situation, it would be desirable to delay such a decision, especially in the light of the fact that Parliamentâs twin seats are a much-debated topic.
One million EU citizens have signed the citizensâ initiative aimed at ending the travelling circus between Brussels and Strasbourg.
We wholeheartedly support the call for Parliament to have a single site, namely Brussels.
The report also deals with important issues such as MEPsâ allowances, secretarial allowances and the voluntary pension scheme.
We have chosen not to join the pension scheme.
In our opinion, it is unreasonable for European taxpayers to have to help fund a scheme completely regardless of whether it yields profits or not.
Â Â  We can only be delighted at the signing of the framework agreement that will allow Parliament to buy the WIC, SDM and IPE3 buildings outright for the sum of EUR 143Â 125Â million.
All the same, it will be hard for that agreement to dispel the suspicion and loss of confidence that have marred relations between Strasbourg and Parliament.
There are several lessons to be drawn.
First of all, there must be no property transactions involving several players, because that entails highly complex legal and financial arrangements which are contrary to the principles of transparency.
Likewise, Parliamentâs property policy, and that of all the European institutions, should be thoroughly reviewed and a European Buildings Authority created with clearly defined tasks and powers.
So far as the current debate about a single seat is concerned, it should be pointed out that the relevant reference is still ProtocolÂ 12 to the Treaty of Amsterdam and that Parliament therefore has no competence in the matter.
Finally, it seems to me essential that the use of the secretarial assistance allowance should be more transparent and in particular that a statute for our staff should be proposed quickly to regulate working conditions and tax and social security matters.
Social Europe starts with us.
Â Â  . The issue of where the seats of the institutions are located is not merely a geographical, logistical or economic issue.
When a particular city is chosen as the seat of a Community institution, there are always political factors involved, too, which is totally justified, although it does not follow that any political decision is valid, irrespective of its economic or logistical rationale.
In the case of the European Parliament, the choice of Strasbourg was based on historical factors, but nowadays, in terms of economics and practicality, it is no longer viable.
Although this is not the issue at hand, it is worth bearing it in mind.
One might have expected that the City of Strasbourg would pull out all the stops to help Parliament to settle in the city, even by bearing some of the costs, as the rules of hospitality in such circumstances often dictate.
However, what we find â or rather, suspect, given that the authorities in question are not helping to clarify matters completely â is that having Parliament in Strasbourg is just a piece of real estate business from which the authorities earn a profit they do not deserve.
The lack of good faith, decent hospitality and fairness that this reveals is something we should condemn outright and should be taken into account when decisions are taken as to where Parliament should be located.
Â Â  . I voted against the suggestion that the European Institute of Technology should be sited in Strasbourg, because I think this is a silly idea.
The EIT proposals are ongoing from the Commission, and worthy of serious consideration, they should not be used as an excuse for us to solve our own dilemma getting out of Strasbourg.
The Parliament should have one site, in Brussels, and the EIT idea should progress further.
The two are distinct issues and it is irresponsible to attempt to link them in this way.
Â Â  . The petition of one million signatures to have one seat for the European Parliament in Brussels must be welcomed.
As it is the only parliament in the world which has no say over where it sits, the Council of Ministers must, once and for all, put an end to this situation.
The people of Europe have spoken.
Their voice must be recognised.
The European Parliament must have one home and that should be in Brussels.
On a separate issue, I would like to put on the record my opposition to the second pension scheme.
As Amendment 5 was rejected, I cannot back the report and will have to vote against it.
Â Â  . Given that the report describes this Parliament as âthe democratic representative body in the EUâ, let everyone be clear about just how little it deserves that description.
We do not have debates in this institution, but tightly controlled and orchestrated speaking time, without the opportunity for reply.
We simply go through the motions in what is a pale shadow of a parliament.
There can be no better example of this than the one million-signature petition calling for an end to the utterly pointless and grotesquely expensive monthly pilgrimage to Strasbourg.
Ignoring this entreaty from the people we are supposed to represent, this Parliament is seriously considering purchasing these buildings and making this bizarre arrangement permanent.
It is all very well for this report to question the City of Strasbourgâs âgood faithâ, but the reality is that this city worked out the best deal it could get for itself.
This Parliament tamely signed it, without bothering to verify the terms or attempting to negotiate more favourable conditions.
In other words, they saw us coming!
Â Â  .
We voted in favour of the Ferber report today, even though it forms a basis for the purchase of the Parliament building in Strasbourg.Â However, our approval does not constitute a prior decision regarding the seat of the European Parliament.
Along with more than a million other Europeans, we have supported the OneSeat.eu initiative, and, together with the citizens, we will also continue to advocate relocating Parliament's activities from Strasbourg to Brussels.
Â Â  There is every reason to criticise some of the European Parliamentâs activities.
Nonetheless, it has not been possible to prove that any unlawful actions have taken place.
MEPsâ voluntary pension schemes are a form of supplementary pension insurance in addition to the basic MEPsâ pension.
Under this system, European taxpayers have to pay for two thirds of all contributions (currently EURÂ 2Â 088 per month per MEP who has chosen to join this scheme).
The remaining third has until now been paid from MEPsâ secretarial allowance, despite the fact that the Court of Auditors criticised this arrangement as long ago as 1999, stating that contributions should be made on an entirely private basis in order to prevent accusations of âpublic funds being used for private pension contributionsâ.
This remark may in itself be considered peculiar, since the system is based on two thirds of all contributions being made from the EU budget.
I believe that the whole system should be phased out as soon as possible.
Moreover, I have voted in favour of those amendments that will prevent Parliament from buying the parliament building in Strasbourg.
In the short term, purchase of the building would lead to financial savings, but, in such a case, the aim would have to be to fund the purchase by selling the parliament building in Brussels.
The most important thing is for the seat of the EU to be restricted to one site.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, study abroad and distance learning are becoming increasingly popular, not least thanks to millions of Euro worth of EU subsidies.
On the one hand, this is of great benefit to the students themselves, who gain the opportunity to develop their personal skills in addition to obtaining a specialist qualification, but, on the other hand, domestic universities have increasing numbers of foreign students.
However, I find it quite astounding that, in Austria for example, despite the low percentage of the population with degrees, they form such a high proportion of the unemployed.
In this connection, it would be worth considering whether we should provide greater support for practical internships abroad, and also extend opportunities for in-service training and distance learning.
That is why I voted in favour of the Prets report.
Â Â  â I backed the report on transnational mobility because of the bearing this activity has on the skills and competences acquired by students, and also because it is an important precondition for the successful implementation of these skills and competences in the workplace.
I welcome the fact that the report includes principles that, if properly implemented, will enhance the effectiveness of all kinds of organised mobility in the area of education.
Through the Europass, educational institutions and employers will obtain transparent information on the progress and quality of student work experience and specialist practice.
The report is a welcome contribution to further support for general and specialist education.
Â Â  . Given the significance of MrsÂ Prets' report concerning transnational mobility within the Community for education and training purposes, the British Conservative delegation of the EPP-ED Group will vote in favour of the report.
However, the delegation maintains its opposition to the wording 'political integration' referred to in Amendment 3 to Recital 1a (new), as this implies a constitutional settlement in the EU, which does not reflect the current position and which has not received the assent of the 25 Member States.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of the Prets report (A6-0255/2006) on the European Charter for Mobility because I am a strong advocate of adopting measures aimed at delivering a significant increase in mobility, which is an integral part of European citizenship.
The European Charter for Mobility should help to raise the overall quality levels of European mobility, develop recognition of periods dedicated to education or vocational training and the recognition of titles, qualifications and social security benefits, and establish mutual trust so as to improve and strengthen cooperation among the authorities, the organisations and all the stakeholders in mobility.
Â Â  The June List is strongly in favour of increased mobility in Europe, particularly within the education and training sector.
There are always questions to be asked, however, when officialdom gets hold of a good cause.
We are voting in favour of the compromise, but we object to AmendmentÂ 47.
This amendment makes the following addition: âThe Charter, in the respective languages of the recipients, should be furnished to all students and persons undergoing training by the authorities, organisations and other stakeholders involved in mobility in countries of origin and host countries, and should be treated as a basic reference framework.â
We believe that it is the responsibility of the individual Member States to perform the tasks they have undertaken to perform.
Â Â  . I wish to congratulate MrsÂ Prets on her timely report on the proposal for a recommendation of the European Parliament and of the Council on transnational mobility within the Community for education and training purposes: European Quality Charter for Mobility, to which I lend my full backing.
I particularly welcome the amendments aimed at encouraging the public authorities in Europe to implement measures to improve mobility in Europe and facilitate the mobility of researchers, students and teachers in the EU.
Mobility in education and vocational training will, above all, help people to feel a sense of belonging to Europe and thus to develop a European awareness.
Furthermore, it will provide a boost for European citizenship and for the creation of a society based on knowledge, innovation and entrepreneurship.
Â Â  . When Europe's citizens take to an EU project, it is a sign of the projectâs success.
This has clearly been the case with the programmes aimed at fostering mobility among students.
So many have joined up that people are already referring to the âErasmus generationâ, and numbers continue to grow year on year.
Indeed, it is this kind of success that makes one believe in the notion of European citizenship.
That being said, the EUâs political initiative was quickly overtaken by the success of Community programmes.
It is now necessary to make up for lost time and adopt a series of measures aimed at removing the last remaining (legal, administrative and financial) obstacles, thereby deriving the maximum benefit from mobility in education and training.
I welcome this report because it advocates the adoption of a European Quality Charter for Mobility, which places the accent not just on increasing mobility but on improving its quality, and, in so doing, developing human resources to the full.
There is no doubt that any improvement in mobility in education and training will help achieve a knowledge-based economy conducive to creating jobs and sustainable development, which are the cornerstones of the Lisbon Strategy.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I abstained on the TrÃŒpel report, because the acquisition of so-called key competences presupposes basic skills such as reading, writing, arithmetic and logical, critical thinking.
As the PISA study shows, though, we have problems in this area.
A high proportion of foreigners in school classes causes major problems in the acquisition of these basic skills.
If we do not soon lay down upper limits for the proportion of foreigners in classes, then those classes will not only continue to suffer from preconditioned conflicts between the various groups and cultures, but also find it increasingly difficult to acquire key competences.
Â Â  I voted in favour of the report by MrsÂ TrÃŒpel on the proposal for a recommendation, at first reading, of the European Parliament and of the Council on key competences for lifelong learning.
It is crucial to the European citizens that, through training, they may have a reasonable guarantee of employability in the knowledge-based society defined in the Lisbon Strategy.
I am pleased to note that the spirit of enterprise is one of the eight key competences that all Europeans should have available to them.
Everybody should be aware that, while qualifications are necessary, they are no longer sufficient and âentrepreneurshipâ must be instilled. That will be a considerable asset for those people who acquire it as a result of the Member Statesâ application of this recommendation.
Â Â  . Given the significance of Mrs TrÃŒpel's report concerning key competences for lifelong learning, the British Conservative delegation of the PPE-DE Group will vote in favour of the report.
However, notwithstanding its support overall for the report, with reference to Amendment 1 to Recital 4, the delegation does not agree that the setting of percentage targets for employment levels is an effective exercise in helping to achieve increased employment rates, but is aware that this amendment is merely a restatement of the European Council's position.
Â Â  . I wish to congratulate MrsÂ TrÃŒpel on her report on a proposal for a recommendation of the European Parliament and of the Council on key competences for lifelong learning, to which I lend my support.
I particularly welcome the reference to the need to increase investment in education and training.
I also feel it is very important, in this regard, to offer Europe's citizens the tools needed to adapt to the kind of labour market that is characteristic of a knowledge-based society.
Â Â  . Globalisation is increasingly confronting the EU with new challenges, which require that all European citizens constantly improve their knowledge and skills, as well as broader competences, both in their private lives and in their public and professional lives.
