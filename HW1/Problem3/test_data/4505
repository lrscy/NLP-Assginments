Â Â  â Mr President, my colleague Mrs Breyer likes to compare this loan facility we are speaking of to state support for one form of energy production which creates market distortions.
Sometimes it seems that the meaning of the word âloanâ was forgotten whilst the analysis was being conducted.
The other theme has been the market distortions that result from systems of financial support.
How much are renewable energy sources being subsidised?
Are we actually talking about loans, where every cent is paid back with interest?
There has been talk of the existence of other kinds of facilities.
The Euratom loan scheme has served us Western Europeans for very many years.
In recent years the benefits have been channelled mainly in the direction of the candidate countries.
It is true that in the 1970s and 1980s nuclear power plants were built in Western Europe with the help of these loans.
Loans for building new capacity, however, have not been used for a long time.
The best example of this is funding for a new unit to be constructed in a certain country in northern Europe.
Private investors were interested in building new nuclear power facilities so that a 1 600 megawatt unit would have had funding for the construction of a facility with 2 500 megawatt capacity.
This is indisputable proof, if ever there was any, that Euratom loans are not needed to finance new capacity.
There is nothing wrong with nuclear power plants in the candidate and other Eastern European countries receiving funding in this way to improve the safety of installations.
It is interesting to hear MrsÂ Breyer encourage the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance to adopt a campaign against nuclear safety.
I am in favour of the Euratom loan scheme continuing.
It is important for improving standards of safety in nuclear installations in third countries.
Â Â  â Mr President, just a few words on the support measures: to be sure, past decades have seen a lot of money poured into the promotion of nuclear energy, just, incidentally, as it is today into renewable energies.
I think that is right.
If you put that in terms of kilowatt-hours, in the case of nuclear power, the amount is down in the one-thousandths, whilst, with renewable energy, we are talking about tens of cents.
I am not saying that I am against it; I just want to make the proportions clear.
Tomorrow, the issue of the Euratom loans will probably boil down to the question of whether we should support nuclear power stations in the course of construction or those that are being used, on which subject the only thing I have to say is that we are indirectly supporting nuclear energy in Russia by buying more and more gas from the Russians.
Russia will be unable to supply much of this gas in future unless it cuts back on gas at home, which will be replaced by electricity from coal-fired power stations and from nuclear power stations that are being built.
Perhaps we should give some thought to that when we talk about a European energy strategy.
Our increased use of gas does, it is true, mean that we are improving our record on CO2-emissions, but elsewhere, more CO2 is being produced from coal-burning power stations, or nuclear power is being promoted.
That is something else we should bear in mind; it shows that our own energy strategy is not always consistent.
I believe that we should vote in favour of these Euratom loans, quite simply because of the improvement in safety.
It was for this reason that the Council of Ministers, after Chernobyl, increased the funding for Euratom loans.
I believe that the argument still holds water today.
Â Â  Mr President, there is no justification under Euratom for allowing the Commission to extend the Euratom loan by EUR 2 billion, as proposed in November 2002, bringing the loan up to EUR 6 billion altogether.
This loan has been increased about five times since it was set up in 1977 and is a thinly veiled attempt to promote the nuclear industry: whilst asking for the extension of the loan, it also changes the condition and type of project to be funded in light of the expansion of the EU.
This is akin to Enron's creative accounting.
Indeed, we could even call it fraudulent accounting practice.
You will get a similar, Enron-style scandal as a result of all this.
It is compounded by questions of transparency and whether the proposals are not already obsolete.
In addition, questions about the distortion of the market, particularly in regard to plant construction, have been raised.
I am not satisfied that these loans are for safety as opposed to plant construction purposes.
Indeed, I have evidence that construction activities are taking place.
Â Â  . â Mr President, in reply to MrsÂ Breyer, I can say that, with the Councilâs consent, the Commission would be prepared to merge the two proposals.
That would allow both ceilings and conditions to be combined.
In principle, there would not be a problem over this, provided Parliament agreed.
The Council would have to give its consent, of course.
What is at issue here is facilitating the decommissioning of a number of power stations and improving the safety of others.
Essentially, it all relates to the countries due to join the Union in four monthsâ time on 1Â May. It also concerns the candidate countries and potentially Russia too in certain cases.
I should like to assure MrsÂ Matikainen-KallstrÃ¶m that the EuropeanÂ Union is currently making a great effort regarding renewable energy.
It must be said that this effort has certainly intensified over the last four years. I am very proud of that, because I believe the Union has to promote renewable energy as much as possible.
This does not mean it is not also bound to ensure the maximum possible nuclear safety across the EuropeanÂ Union, as I stated just now.
I admit I am capable of making mistakes, as are all of those who are present or absent today. Nonetheless, I am certainly not prepared to lie or to disregard the responsibilities incumbent on us all.
To mention just one such responsibility, each and every one of us is responsible for ensuring not just the safety of supply, but also maximum safety for the citizens.
Further, we are all responsible for ensuring compliance with the commitments entered into under international agreements such as the KyotoÂ Agreement.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
(1)
Â Â  We now come to the resolution on urgent procedure:
The Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has already adopted a report on this subject.
Â Â  Mr President, thank you for giving me leave to express my support for urgent procedure in the case of this proposal for a decision.
The proposed instrument provides for the continuation of the system of dock dues, with an exemption mechanism for certain local products from our four French overseas departments of Guadeloupe, French Guiana, Martinique and RÃ©union, for a ten-year period beginning on 1Â JulyÂ 2004.
The proposal also extends the present regime for six months, from 1Â January to 30Â JuneÂ 2004, to fill the legal vacuum that has existed since 31 December of last year, the date on which the last statute expired.
I wish to commend the content of this proposal, which is the fruit of intensive consultation between the Commission, the French Government and the representatives of the four outermost French regions.
My only reticence relates to the lack of flexibility in the exemption mechanism in the case of new products or activities.
Be that as it may, this proposal will serve to maintain a vital source of revenue for our local authorities, especially those of the smallest communities.
It will thereby help to sustain the present effort to foster the economic development of these areas in pursuance of Article 299(2) of the Treaty.
I regret that our Parliament has been unable to devote sufficient time to the drafting of a precise report on the text of this proposal for an instrument that is crucial to the future of our outermost regions.
I would nevertheless encourage the House to vote in favour of urgent procedure in order to fill the present legal vacuum, which is liable to have a highly detrimental impact on our overseas departments. We can thus clear the way for the adoption of this new system for the next ten years, leaving the French authorities enough time to transpose the decision into national law by the first of July.
Â Â  Mrs Sudre, the purely legal issue here is about whether we can vote on the substance of this motion on Thursday.
We now come to the vote on the request for urgent procedure.(1)
Â Â  The next item is the report (A5-0484/2003) by Mr Herzog on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the Green Paper on services of general interest (COM(2003) 270 â 2003/2152(INI)).
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our vote on this report is eagerly awaited.
Throughout this working year, I have experienced at first hand the vehemence and the passion of the political debate on this subject.
Before Maastricht, local and national authorities made their choices, and those choices coexisted comfortably with the Common Market.
Since the advent of the single market, conflicts and concerns have been rife.
The fact is that a solution to these problems is still being quite literally prevented by the existence of taboos.
Some boast of a proud record of liberalisation.
In the opposite corner are those who regard public service and competition as incompatible.
Others â and I hope there will be many of us â believe that liberalisation has had both positive and negative effects, that a better balance needs to be struck between commercial and non-commercial principles in the substance of laws and regulations and that such a balance would enhance cohesion and efficiency.
An objective assessment of the real situation is needed, because the conviction that the market does everything better is becoming an article of dogma and is dividing Europe into two camps.
It seems crucial to me that the legislature should be committed to redressing the balance and reconciling these conflicting principles in accordance with the great tradition of European civilisation.
Many of my honourable colleagues accept the idea of a balance but consider that the power to strike such a balance rests exclusively with the local, regional and national public authorities.
I absolutely agree that the decision-making rights of decentralised administrative bodies should be defended and strengthened, but I am convinced that the market will steadily erode them unless the Union acts as a guarantor of these rights and takes its due share of responsibility.
And indeed our Community would not really serve any purpose unless it also provided complementary services in domains such as education, rail transport or information.
My colleagues have rejected this line of argument, but I stand by my view that subsidiarity and co-responsibility must go hand in hand.
Throughout history, Europeans â be they Christians or Humanists, Liberals or Socialists â have deemed it essential to ensure that services of general economic interest were so organised as to foster the development of the individual and enhance life in society.
Let us not fall short of those ideals.
Let us strive resolutely to bridge the gaps that divide our national communities with regard to the ethics of universal access to services of general interest.
As to the matter in hand, why a framework directive?
Not for the sake of legislating, because we do more than enough of that.
In this case it is necessary, however.
It is time that the legislature itself interpreted the treaties instead of letting the Commission exercise all sorts of power â legislative, executive and judicial powers as well as powers of self-assessment.
The Convention recognises our right to do so, having inserted a new article to that effect in the draft Constitutional Treaty, and the prevailing situation demands that we do so.
Firstly, a legal framework must give services of general interest the status of a positive right in law rather than simply condoning the protection of such services as a derogation from the norm; rules governing the market and competition would then be bound to respect the status of these services.
Secondly, there is a need to eliminate the profound uncertainty about the distinction between services of economic interest and those of non-economic interest.
Key areas such as education, health and water must not be liberalised, and there is a need to recognise the increasingly numerous hybrid situations in which social, economic and environmental factors are intertwined.
Accordingly, my proposals are designed to provide local authorities, non-profit businesses, semi-public companies and public-private partnerships with a general framework of more solid guarantees within which they can develop.
Thirdly, there is a need to clarify the principles relating to funding and organisation.
The Altmark judgment on state aid is a step forward, but it leaves serious question marks about the calculation of costs, while care must also be taken to avoid criminalising public operators.
Fourthly, we want a pluralist and independent evaluation method to be established.
To reject it would be an affront to democracy.
Let me add that a framework directive would certainly be consistent with the sectoral directives.
We therefore ask the Commission to respond quickly to the results of the consultation process it has launched and to the parliamentary vote by answering this question: what commitments is it prepared to make with regard to the legal framework, funding and evaluation?
Moreover, we refuse to accept the use of Article 86(3), which gives us no right of codecision, in its response to the Altmark judgment.
I should like to offer my very sincere thanks to the numerous associations, NGOs, trade unions, local-authority networks and businesses which were consulted and whose opinions enlightened and assisted me.
Like the elected politicians, they want to have the legitimate means to express themselves far more on the policies and rules of the Union.
Let me also thank my fellow members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, who have shown great commitment, and particularly those who have been seeking compromises.
Regrettably, a majority said no to a framework directive and no to a democratic evaluation.
By so doing, they not only rejected my proposals and our compromises; they quite simply turned their backs on the resolution adopted by this Parliament in 2001.
Tomorrow, the House can reaffirm its endorsement of that resolution.
Ladies and gentlemen, I firmly believe that many of you, whether on the Right or the Left, are pledged to defend and promote services of general interest.
For this reason, I strongly urge you not to retreat into party or national blocs but to make up your own mind on each amendment, on each article, motivated only by the general interest of the European people.
Â Â  Mr President, may I begin by thanking this House and especially Mr Herzog, your rapporteur, for the remarkable efforts you have devoted to this complex and delicate issue that the Commission raised in its Green Paper on services of general interest.
The Commission believes that public services are at the heart of the debate on the future of the European integration process.
Every country of the Union has public services which are rooted in unique traditions and situations, particularly those of a local nature.
We regard the services of general interest as a vital component of the European social model.
We believe that these services contribute to peopleâs quality of life and to the competitiveness of our industries and that they help to strengthen our social and territorial cohesion.
This is equally true with regard to the future Member States, because the efficient provision of services of general interest is one of the keys to their smooth integration.
In its Green Paper of last May, the Commission undertook its first full re-examination of Community policies on services of general interest.
This review was essential, particularly in the light of your own demand, stated in the Langen report of 2001, which had initiated a debate on the question whether a general legal framework should be created at the Community level for services of general interest.
At the present time we are in the process of finalising our analysis of the contributions received in the course of the public consultation.
We have now received almost 300 contributions, many of which are very substantial, and they obviously merit detailed study.
It would therefore be premature at this stage to draw precise conclusions from this work.
We do, however, intend to formulate political conclusions before the effective end of this legislative term, thereby responding, in fact, to a unanimous request from your Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
There is undoubtedly a need to decide on the type of instrument that the Commission will be able to propose as a means of ensuring that Europe enjoys high-quality public services.
One of the options that can be considered is a framework directive enshrining a number of common principles: equality of user access, universality, continuity, adaptability and evaluation.
I am aware that this has been the subject of lively debate here in Parliament.
Consideration can also be given to the adoption of a White Paper, pending the entry into force of the Constitutional Treaty, which contains what we regard as several steps forward on this point.
In the meantime, a White Paper could define the political framework for our future activity or else provide a road map for the pursuit of the sectoral approach.
To supplement these efforts, we are continuing our work on other matters relating to services of general interest, and particularly the application of the rules governing state aid, in the wake of the Altmark judgment.
Clear messages have emerged from the public consultation on this point.
We need greater legal certainty in the domain of state aid, particularly a mechanism for exemption from notification with adequate coverage, given the number of cases that could potentially be affected by the application of the Altmark ruling.
In conclusion, our aim is to lay foundations that will enable the Community to play a more proactive role with a view to guaranteeing the provision of high-quality services of general interest to the public and to businesses.
This approach will obviously have to take account of the subsidiarity principle, and our aim is to pave the way for the formulation of a coherent policy in favour of services of general interest within the Union, a policy that will provide the best possible elucidation of the relationships between the various tiers of government and of their respective responsibilities.
Your resolution will be an essential and indispensable contribution to the definition of this approach, which is why the Commission awaits the outcome of your vote with eager interest.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Herzog, for the admirable cooperation which we had during the preparation of this report, which was drafted with enhanced cooperation between the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Committee on Legal Affairs.
However, I should like to express my regret at the result of the vote in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which rejected the basic proposals of the Committee on Legal Affairs.
The approach which we adopted jointly with the rapporteur does not turn a blind eye to the problems raised by the current situation.
The vital question is not who owns services of general interest.
It is clear that current developments allow the private and public sectors to work together.
However, in order to avoid privatisation having a negative character, the basic rules governing the mission of services of general interest, including their basic operating and funding principles, need to be respected.
Among other things, it is important for care to be taken in all cases to satisfy the needs of the entire populace.
That is why the principles of universality, continuity, affordability and quality need to be guaranteed at Community level.
The difference between ours and a liberal perception is that privatisation is not an end in itself and that it must not under any circumstances mean full dependence of services of general interest on market rules, as any such dependence would reach the point of even precluding funding by local authorities of services of general interest which serve local society.
With certain services in particular, such as health, education and social services, the national authorities must have the right to lay down the rules which govern the provision of these services by private, profit-making agencies.
I therefore call on the House, especially those who believe in the European social model as part of the European productive system, to vote for the amendments relating to what I have just said.
Our resolution will be a balanced resolution if we accept the compatibility of the rule of competition with the mission of the social state.
Furthermore, the proposal to adopt a framework directive should be accepted, as it was in the previous resolution by Parliament.
If we want to ensure that the basic requirements of the working classes as a whole are satisfied, we must all work to safeguard the future of services of general interest.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I would like to start with the most warm thanks to Mr Herzog, who had a difficult task as rapporteur and, having an explicitly left-wing stance, did not always find it easy to put his position across.
He demonstrated a very great deal of willingness to cooperate.
I would like to say that at the outset, for, on the substantive and fundamental issues, he and I are poles apart.
What I am saying now I say on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, which, by a large majority, made a recommendation practically all of which the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs took on board, and whose first basic premise is that definition is a matter for the Member States.
Rather than there being any need for a European model, it is the Member States or the sub-levels acting on their behalf that are competent in these matters.
Secondly, the debate in which we are engaged is not about tampering with the efforts at liberalising certain sectors; on the contrary, we believe that this liberalisation in the internal market has, as a whole, albeit with some exceptions, been very successful and that it must not be jeopardised by European framework legislation.
Thirdly, we discussed the legal framework.
On 13 November 2001, we called for a framework directive on the basis of the article on the internal market.
There have to date been no indications whatever of this being possible, which is why most of our group have changed their position on this issue.
Commissioner Lamy, you have just given us a wonderful list of the options that are available â framework directive, White Paper, guidelines, exemption from notification and so on â but all that must be coherent.
We have been discussing the topic for over three years, and the Commission was previously unable to give us chapter and verse concerning the various legal options available to us.
Pleasing though what you have told us today has been to the ear, I do not believe that the Commission has finished its homework.
Not the least reason why we have been debating this for so long is we have hitherto had only lists of issues, but no solutions.
It is for that reason that our group takes the line that the Green Paper must as soon as possible be succeeded by a White Paper in which the Commission will at last come clean, elaborate on the legal issues involved in a framework directive, and clarify what the potential options are.
Having already spent two years waiting for this, we can do no other than encourage you, as soon as possible after the decision on Wednesday, not only to get started on it, but also to put some concrete proposals before us.
The last point I want to make is that water supply and individual regions are contentious issues.
There are of course some local services that must continue in future to be offered by the responsible authorities at the local level.
We are not interested in liberalising markets that are unsuited to liberalisation, but we are saying that each can decide whether something is to be done on an independent basis or whether it should be handed over to someone else.
If, though, it is to be handed over to a third party, it must be put out to tender, so that the contract is awarded in an honest and transparent manner.
That is the consensus to which we have come, and I hope that, having formed our opinions today, we will be able to adopt the whole Herzog report tomorrow.
Â Â  Mr President, let us simply remember that todayâs debate on the future of services of general interest is taking place at a particularly significant moment in the history of Europe, at a time when Europe is in the midst of a debate on its future, on its constitution, and when we are preparing to welcome a host of new citizens of the Union from the countries of the East.
I am reminding the House of this fact because I believe that a link exists between the difficulties we experienced, during the debate on the draft constitution, in reaching agreement on the recognition of a positive right to services of general interest and its enshrinement in European law and the considerable obstacles which we have encountered â and which our excellent rapporteur, Mr Herzog, certainly had to confront in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs â in trying to advance this principle.
Moreover, I believe it would be extremely prejudicial if this report were less ambitious than the compromise â insufficient though it was, it did constitute an improvement â which we obtained in the framework of the debate on the draft Constitution.
It would be difficult in these circumstances, ladies and gentlemen, to convince people that we are representing them properly, because I am not the only one who perceives a firm belief in the public mind that European integration will mean more services, better services, more protection, more safety â food safety, maritime safety, security in the widest sense â in this high-risk society.
Broad-based movements within our European societies today are also voicing clear demands for the effective exercise of citizensâ social rights â the right to education, culture, health care, environmental protection, clean water and clean air as well as rights of access to housing, transport, communication, information, energy supplies, etc.
In short, all of us â I hope â are convinced that these services are essential, but I have the impression that some Members of this Chamber are doggedly determined to reinstate scurrilous paragraphs which effectively detract from Mr Herzogâs excellent work.
For example, they emphasise the inestimable benefits of liberalisation, but they will not manage to convince us, for the market cannot provide all of these services in accordance with the principles of equal accessibility and universality â hence the absolute necessity of a recognised positive right to services of general interest.
This being the case, I hope that the amendments you vote to adopt tomorrow will rid us of a document which, in its present form, is extremely compromising for our European Parliament and will seriously undermine the dialogue in which we shall be engaging over the coming months with the people of every European country.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, unlike Mr Langen, I would like to say that my committee has painted a rather subtler picture than that presented in the regrettable contributions to this report from the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
I would like to take this opportunity to warmly thank Mr Herzog and say that, while it is unfortunate that too few of his good ideas have found their way into this draft, we may perhaps be able to make some corrections.
The Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy did indeed, with the support of votes from the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, opt for European framework legislation, and our committee takes the view that services of public interest are something special; they are a characteristic, a distinguishing mark of the European social model, and that is something that we wanted the report to make abundantly clear.
Let us, for example, consider the postal service.
We are not opposed to liberalisation measures, far from it; our committee, too, has prepared them in various sectors.
We know, however, how important it is for many people in Europe that there should be in their neighbourhood a post office â âofficeâ is perhaps the wrong word â a postal facility.
That also plays a part in the European publicâs satisfaction with public services.
Alternatively, let us consider local transport.
A majority in this House has rejected the Commissionâs proposals for liberalisation â which I would describe as pigheaded â and the Commission is now finding it extremely difficult to come up with new ones, our view having been that public passenger traffic cannot be seen in black and white in the same way as trans-European freight transport or air travel, and that there are special interests involved in it, including regional ones.
The Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism is therefore also of the opinion that local and regional authorities in particular must have greater freedom, the freedom to define.
The fact is that this also plays a part in democratic politics, as the public, if they are dissatisfied with the services, can respond accordingly by voting certain townsâ governments out of office and other parties into it.
It is especially in the provision of public services that this democratic element should not be overlooked, and so I hope that the Herzog report will enable even more to be done to strengthen social cohesion in Europe.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to thank Mr Herzog for his cooperation.
Although our different views on policy made working together difficult, we managed together to get the report underway.
How did we first get on to this topic?
The Commission alone possesses decision-making powers in respect of services of general interest â it has had in recent years an increasing tendency to take up these matters â and also as regards lawmaking in connection with competition law.
Particularly with the constitutional treaty in mind, we were of the opinion that this was an area in which Parliament should gain greater competence.
It was for that reason that we, too, originally favoured a framework directive.
When debating the framework directive, though, we certainly have to ask ourselves questions about its substance too.
Can we resolve the problems with competition law?
The Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats came to the conclusion that the framework directive was inherently unsuited to doing that.
The fact is that those who advocate it must ask themselves, over and over again, what a framework directive of this sort is meant to contain.
Underlying the debate on services of general interest is, on the one hand, European law on competition in the internal market, and, on the other, the way in which âservices of general interestâ are defined, by way of subsidiarity, in the Member States or even at the regional and local level.
Not under any circumstances do we want services of general interest defined at European level in the future, be it in a framework directive or in the constitutional treaty.
We are in favour of competence and responsibility at the local level, where competition can be introduced through tendering, in cooperation with the private sector.
The EU of the future, though, with its 25 Member States, will be too diverse for us to lay down at the European level what this expression means.
That is why we say ânoâ to a framework directive and âyesâ to local competence, particularly when it comes to the supply of water.
This is where the Commission should start by putting before us evidence for competition being a good thing in postal services, public local passenger transport and in other areas such as energy.
It is particularly with France in mind that much lost ground has to be made up, and you, Commissioner Lamy, should resolve these problems before tackling any new projects.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, not for the first time, but yet again, the debate on the Green Paper shows that services of general interest, the way in which they are provided and structured, are more than ever in the spotlight, not only in terms of political debate but also of the European publicâs concerns about universal access to services.
For us in this Group of the Party of European Socialists, they are an indispensable component of any model of European society â I will explicitly use the word âcomponentâ, as this is not about developing a European model for services of general interest; they are an essential and elemental component in a European social model with objectives common to all European societies.
They play a crucial part in improving the quality of life for all citizens and in overcoming economic stagnation, social exclusion and isolation.
This is where I want to attempt to clear up a misunderstanding.
This is not about our having the market and competition on the one hand and services of general interest on the other.
Services of general interest can perfectly well be provided by market instruments in a competitive context, but we have to take note of the fact that there are also situations in which the market does not provide such services efficiently, and that is when the democratic community has to be able to ensure that such services can be provided outside the marketâs machinery.
This interaction highlights our need for a bit more legal clarity.
That is why our group endorses the rapporteurâs thinking on this, and this is where I too want to extend warm thanks to Mr Herzog, who really has done everything possible to bring about compromise; even though he is the rapporteur, he has changed his position in essential areas, and I think it is rather a pity, in view of this achievement, this attempt at consensus, that there are elements in this House that have quite simply refused to give him credit for it.
We endorse the report because we need it if we are to have legal certainty and a common legal framework within which these issues can be dealt with, but, above all else, we want Parliament to have a part in it, and on that point I want to say something in response to Mr Langenâs statement that the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has, in the meantime, come to an agreement that they do not want a framework directive after all, on the grounds that Article 95 does not allow it.
I do not see that such is the case at all; you decided that you did not want one, and the reason why you did so was that a majority of you no longer saw it as politically acceptable.
For whatever reasons you did this, we can understand them, we can live with them, but please do not try to tell me that it cannot be done for lack of suitable legal basis.
That has never bothered us before, and quite right too; when we wanted to get something done politically, we found the legal basis for doing so, and, as the Commission is a veritable master at doing this sort of thing, now is the time for us to support it in finding one.
There is absolutely no doubt about the fact we want it, but Parliamentâs right of codecision must be safeguarded if we do.
Of course, a legal framework of this sort needs to contain some substance, and I urge that we should, in future, spend more time discussing substance than this or that legal basis.
That is what our debates should be about; there is a whole range of items that have to be embedded in a framework of this sort, and I want to list just six of them.
As I have already said, the framework directive must aim to give the stakeholders legal security when current Community law is applied to what they do.
There is, quite clearly, no disagreement about the fact that the actual definition, structure, organisation and funding of services of general interest lie within the remit of the Member States and their sub-divisions â that is, of course, the municipalities, where these have the relevant competence.
It follows that it is not worth working towards a uniform and all-embracing European definition, but there are a number of standards and a few criteria that of course amount to the same thing and that also have to be embedded in it.
Universality, for example, is one of them, as are also continuity, the quality of the service, efficiency, affordability and also the involvement of the users and the democratic supervision of the service providers.
Far more than was the case in the past, we have to concentrate on the actually essential point: when is an activity economic and when is it not?
That is the yardstick by which we determine whether or not the rules on competition or the internal market should apply, and I see this as the area in which we should pursue the debate.
So, the situation being as it is, we say âyesâ to a legal framework of this kind, and let us discuss its substance rather than any legal bases.
Â Â  MrÂ President, first of all, I should like to thank the rapporteur for his considerable efforts, even though he and I are definitely not in agreement.
I am, however, very pleased about the discussions to which this report has led, with their focus upon a list of important issues concerning services of general interest.
It has been a refreshing political discussion, reflecting the political differences in this House.
On behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, I should like to express support for the report, as adopted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
For the ELDR Group, it is important to emphasise that the liberalisation already implemented by a range of sectors has generally been a great success.
It has meant the creation of approximately one million new jobs and, in particular, better service for less money.
At the same time, the issue of whether or not Parliament should demand a framework directive has been of crucial importance to the ELDR Groupâs support for the present report.
I should like to emphasise that the ELDR Group does not support a framework directive.
The purpose of a horizontal directive would be to freeze a number of areas which, as we know by experience, develop the whole time.
There is absolutely no need for this at a time when we in Europe are already lagging behind with economic reforms.
On the contrary, we should support further liberalisation, but on equal conditions.
This must, however, take place via sectoral directives of the kind of which very successful use is already being made in a number of sectors.
In the ELDR Group, we are, as I say, convinced that it will be neither possible nor desirable in a framework directive to establish any usable definitions of services of such different kinds as are at issue in this House, at the same time bearing in mind the large regional and national differences that exist in the area of services of general interest.
We recognise, however, the doubt and uncertainty to which what is termed the Altmark judgment, concerning the funding of locally based services of general interest, has led.
We therefore wholeheartedly support the Commissionâs reflections concerning a legal initiative to clarify this issue.
Nor, as I say, do we think, however, that a framework directive would be of any help in this context.
If it were a question of a legal initiative, we should, however, greatly regret the fact that the existing Treaty does not give us in the European Parliament power of codecision concerning such an initiative.
To dispel any doubt, I should like to emphasise that our opposition to a framework directive does not in any way mean that we in the ELDR group want the duty to supply certain services of general interest to disappear.
On the contrary, we believe that such a duty could easily go hand in hand with liberalisation and, for example, environmental requirements, if only the political authority were to require this.
Responsibility for demanding quality lies, of course, with the political authority, which must also ensure that the demands are complied with.
I want us to obtain more value for money.
Â Â  Mr President, in spite of the power of work that Mr Herzog has put into this report, I have to say from the outset how far the report, as adopted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, has fallen short of our hopes and expectations for a vigorous European instrument on services of general interest.
My group cannot accept it.
The text has become an ode to liberalisation with one single aim in mind, namely to make competitive market forces the sole regulator of service provision.
Recital H, for example, emphasises that liberalisation in leading sectors in the internal market is a factor in technological progress and economic efficiency, while paragraph 13 welcomes the liberalisation that has taken place in the fields of telecommunications, postal services, transport and energy.
Even the moderate proposal calling on the Commission to perform without delay a precise and comparative evaluation of the real impact of the policy of liberalisation of services of general interest before embarking upon further liberalisation, a proposal contained in the Langen report which was approved by this very House, is not endorsed in this report.
On spurious pretexts, the report also discards the aim of a framework directive in which services of general interest and the obligations they entail for governments as well as for public and private operators could be defined more precisely.
Only basic education and social protection would remain in the public sector.
This is far removed from the sort of approach that is absolutely essential for the protection of peopleâs fundamental rights to energy and water supplies, transport, housing, communications and information.
The purpose of services of general interest should be to guarantee these rights in accordance with a number of principles, namely equal access for everyone, information, consultation, user and worker participation and financial viability.
It is impossible to achieve this ambition by relentlessly continuing to pursue the sole aim of liberalisation.
This text is unacceptable as it now stands.
The hopes and expectations aroused by the Green Paper were that public services would play a pivotal role in guaranteeing economic, social and environmental rights, that the true ambition of Europe was to satisfy the needs of the greatest number in a society characterised by solidarity.
It follows from these remarks that my group will support all the amendments that are designed to remove the constantly recurring references to liberalisation and those which strengthen a model of services of general interest that are worthy of the name.
My group reaffirms the need for an evaluation.
It emphasises that services of general interest are elementary public services.
It also expresses its desire to confirm unambiguously the right of local and regional authorities to choose freely the way they administer the services of general interest for which they are responsible.
These things, at the very least, must be guaranteed if the services of general interest are to be an engine of solidarity in Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, on behalf of the ecologistsâ group I should also like to pay tribute to the political and intellectual achievements of MrÂ Herzog in this assembly over many years and particularly to his work on this report.
As several speakers have already said, this report, compiled on the initiative of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, is essentially designed to clarify the terms of the debate and particularly to ensure that the opening of individual sectors of the economy to competition in the European Union is accompanied by greater legal certainty and is subject to funding guarantees and an evaluation requirement.
Let me say that the Greens will support the amendments that have been re-tabled in plenary in order to return to the spirit of MrÂ Herzogâs original proposal.
I should like to add two elements to the debate.
Firstly, I must remind the House that the Convention also debated this issue and concluded that there was a need for a legal basis other than the one currently provided by the treaties.
Accordingly, if the European Parliament, in tomorrowâs vote, were to come out against the position of the Convention, we should have an interesting conflict of political legitimacy between the two bodies.
Secondly, I would add that, in the course of this debate, we ecologists have observed that there is a curious underlying alliance between the advocates of maximum subsidiarity â a precept, incidentally, that is also supported by MrÂ Herzog and our group â and those who believe that there must be no barriers at all to engagement in free competition.
As a result of this alliance, there is basically no agreement within the European Parliament, just as there is no agreement in the Council, on the need to proceed towards framework legislation.
So I should simply like to ask the following question: when we have all delivered our speeches, who will be the winners in this debate?
It clearly will not be the advocates of subsidiarity but rather the defenders of the right to engage in unbridled competition.
The fact is that, month after month, we vote on sectoral directives, and we can see how difficult the Court of Justice finds it to justify the imposition of any obligation to provide services in the public interest.
The result is the reinforcement of a European model which is largely based on tax, wage and welfare competition between locations.
If we want to redress this imbalance to some extent, we really need greater legal certainty in order to guarantee the funding of services of general interest, however they may be defined by the Member States.
For this reason I call on each of you to reflect on this dubious alliance between those who aspire to define services of general interest in their own countries and regions and those who swear by completely free competition with no holds barred.
We agree with the former but urge them to dissolve their alliance with the latter.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I can still remember vividly the time, in our NovemberÂ 2002 session, when MrÂ Herzogâs report on state aid was adopted by one vote.
Nevertheless, the report adopted had been amended to such an extent that nothing remained of the original proposal.
It looks very much as though MrÂ Herzog has problems now, too, with the point of view of the majority in Parliament, which rightly opposes the introduction of a framework directive on services of general interest.
Even before the European Commission presented its Green Paper in MayÂ 2003, the rapporteur had presented a working document containing his views.
That was too quickly and too soon to answer the questions that the Commission presented to Parliament in its Green Paper.
It is regrettable that the Green Paper was not a visionary document, but the fact that the rapporteur already had a view on the Commission proposal before the proposal was made is downright premature.
The Green Paper rightly draws attention to the powers of national and regional authorities with regard to services of general interest.
It is my firm belief, therefore, that it is a matter for national and regional politicians to take decisions on services of general interest.
I do not see any need for granting the Commission new powers in this area, therefore.
I can endorse the proposal adopted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I too would like to praise MrÂ Herzog for the work that he carried out both enthusiastically and seriously.
I believe, however, that the text that came out of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs gives, in a way that is more in line with the current climate, an accurate picture of the situation and the prospects as regards services of general interest.
Services of general interest make up a substantial part of the European economy, which is increasingly becoming an economy of services; liberalisation and competition, also within this extremely important sector, are essential to the dynamic nature of the European economy and its capacity to grow and create jobs.
I believe that it would be a mistake to think that it is possible to set in stone the situation regarding the provision of services of general interest within the context of a framework directive or within new legislation.
It is not easy to define these sectors, which are sectors that are forever evolving: what today is a public service, may tomorrow be a sector in which providing products and services is completely assured by the market.
It would be a mistake to enshrine this and set it in stone.
I believe that, as is stated in ArticleÂ 19 of the report, the current provisions for the internal market and competition ensure, in itself, that in this and other sectors, public measures, where necessary, are adopted within the context of the rules already laid down by the Treaties, guaranteeing that the economy providing public services is competitive and dynamic.
Otherwise, there would be stagnation and the European economy would be in jeopardy.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I wish to begin by thanking the rapporteur, MrÂ Herzog, for an extremely comprehensive piece of work and for many fruitful discussions, even though we have not been completely in agreement.
I also wish to thank the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs who have contributed through many discussions and many sound amendments so that, in the end, we have obtained a result from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs that I think is very good.
I am not well disposed towards a general framework directive.
In my opinion, it would offer no advantages but, instead, be confusing.
It would be like an extra layer of legislation between the internal marketâs rules of competition and the sectoral directives, and it would also be an obstacle to product development.
The process of gradual deregulation of the EU markets has been the most important component for improving services of general economic interest during the last decade.
Another of the reasons for the deregulation has, of course, been the generally poor quality of the services before the market was opened.
I am anxious that we should not again find ourselves in a monopoly situation.
I should therefore like to call upon Parliament to go with what came out of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, stated in MrÂ Herzogâs report, and not to vote in favour of the amendments from the Left.
If we go with the position of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, we stimulate competition and product development and provide opportunities to offer consumers both cheaper and better alternatives.
Â Â  Mr President, I congratulate Mr Herzog on an excellent report.
I hope that tomorrow Parliament will rectify matters by overturning the rejection of the framework directive proposal by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
This is not the end of the debate: this is a debate on a Green Paper and is the beginning of what I think will be a fairly long debate.
Parliament is seeking, in this debate at least, to give some guidance to the Commission as to how it should proceed with regard to services of general interest, both economic and non-economic.
For me the issue of general-interest services â both economic and non-economic â is a line in the sand between those who favour a social market economy model and those who favour a neo-liberal market economy.
It is not acceptable that we should move by stealth to denying citizens their rights as citizens, which citizenship grants them in Europe, by making competition the only measure of service provision.
The OECD has estimated that in the 1990s governments in Europe transferred about EUR 300 billion of public-service property to private operators, in some cases with disastrous results in terms of both service provision and, indeed, loss of life.
As a Union and a Parliament we have to stand by access for all to high-quality, affordable services, and we must recognise that those services dictate the quality of life of our citizens.
We have made progress in Amsterdam, in the Charter of Fundamental Rights and in the new draft Constitution on re-establishing the rights of citizens to public services.
We must defend those rights.
It is not a question of defending an , but of looking to see how high-quality services to our citizens can be guaranteed across the board in what are new circumstances.
In particular, we must defend the advances we have made in the constitution on this matter.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the single market is undoubtedly the most important achievement of the European integration process at the economic level.
Europe has given us a single large trading area without barriers, with 375Â million consumers now, soon rising to 450Â million.
Over the last ten years, the market has been increasingly extended into other sectors, such as telecommunications, postal services, transport and energy.
The European market is a socially corrected free market, which means that the markets in these sectors have been opened up in a gradual, controlled â and successful â manner.
This has resulted in greater competition and modern service provision that is of better quality and lower-priced.
This liberalisation has by no means had any harmful effects, therefore, and the example must be an inspiration to other sectors.
The Commission Green Paper is certainly not before time, and deserves particular credit.
It is indeed necessary to examine whether we can apply the operation of the internal market and the opening-up of the borders to other services of general, and particularly economic, interest.
What other possibilities are there for breaking state monopolies whilst continuing to guarantee that all citizens obtain the best service at an affordable price?
I share the feelings of many others in thinking here of the water supply, waste management and even information sectors, for example.
The debate on this subject must be held not only here, however, but also with national or even regional authorities, which are now often responsible for managing these sectors.
We must use the results of this wide-ranging, interesting and indeed already productive debate to examine whether, and if so how, European legislation can be of benefit, especially to citizens.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ Herzog really has had a thankless task.
If there is one area in which opinion in this Assembly and general opinion throughout the EU is deeply divided, it is precisely this area.
The problem is that we have legislation for the internal market that is in actual fact an invitation to unrestrained and unlimited competition where both goods and services are concerned.
That is something we cannot live with.
It is said that it is mainly a question of services of economic interest.
Which services are not of economic interest?
Is not the education sector of economic interest?
Is not the health sector of economic interest?
Are not all the social services of great economic interest?
We are talking about welfare policy as a whole and about something that really is political dynamite.
If there is a desire for balanced development and for stopping this general attack on the welfare sectors, what is to be done?
Are we to pin our faith on a framework directive?
I am a little unsure.
In and for itself, a framework directive could place limits upon legislation governing the internal market.
It would of course be good for calming things down and reducing the intensity of antagonisms.
In the political climate of today and of the next few years, I am afraid, however, that such a framework directive would be heavily dominated by adherents of the market and by right wing forces.
In that case, such a directive would be a step in the wrong direction and might instead become a trap.
Is decentralisation a better alternative?
Is it better to focus upon protecting local and regional activities?
It would perhaps open up certain other possible ways of securing a type of protection and increased opportunities for conducting a local campaign to protect what we wish to preserve.
Above all, however, we need time for research and discussion as a counterweight to the giant battle we face over the next few years.
Â Â  Mr President, it is interesting to see that none of our British Conservative colleagues are here today to support their record on liberalisation in such areas as the railways.
A recent UK parliamentary report on water privatisation has shown that many poorer people, such as pensioners, have had such difficulty in meeting their bills that they have been cutting their water use to a bare minimum.
In some cases this has been described as verging on a public health crisis.
The drive for privatisation has also been part of a drive to reduce costs in the public sector and this has often resulted in wage squeezes that have hit the lowest paid.
The tab for that is still picked up by the public purse through effectively subsidising wages in that area.
Those people may be on a minimum wage, but it is not necessarily a liveable wage.
That is not to say that everything in the public sector has been perfect, but in our view a lot of the claims made for liberalisation in this report are highly questionable.
My Group does not believe that general-interest services can be treated in the same way as companies which produce, for example, plastic key rings.
It is not an area that should be subject to general competition policy and we have tabled amendments to that effect.
We believe that competition rules need to give way to general-interest services, and not the reverse.
We agree entirely with the Commission on the need for legal clarity.
That is an issue we have often raised in connection with GATS and is the subject of an amendment we have tabled and for which we hope to win support.
Â Â  Mr President, in the belief that they are curbing the excesses of Community competition law, certain Members are playing with fire.
The answer to these excesses is to change the law or at least to make explicit provision for an unqualified derogation for public services.
The aim must remain an equally high standard of service for everyone, not the quest for profitability which would throw open these public services to competition.
It is therefore dangerous to seek to establish a European definition of services of general interest.
First of all, a coherent definition would be impossible in view of the diversity of territorial structures and national practices, and then the political will to formulate such a definition is lacking, as is even a simple majority in favour of definition.
My group is in favour of deliberations that would culminate in the identification of the interests that are common to all European service users and of measures to guarantee the funding of the identified services.
This Green Paper and this report, which proclaims the success of the liberalisation measures that have been taken to date, are very far from satisfying this need.
The Conventionâs draft Constitution, which the European Council rejected in Brussels, would not have changed anything, because it also subordinated services of general interest to competition law.
A structure has been put in place, and its aim is clearly to dismantle the public services that exist in some of the Member States.
The important thing for my group is that we should be able to discuss these things democratically with our peoples, recognising their ultimate right to choose the model they believe should be developed in order to guarantee the social and territorial cohesion of their respective countries.
In conclusion, we shall not endorse this report, although we shall, of course, vote in favour here and there to support the less distasteful proposals.
In this way we shall answer the rapporteurâs call, but we would also ask him to reflect further on the purpose that would be served if the present report were adopted in its entirety.
Â Â  â Mr President, the rapporteur, Mr Herzog, is unhappy with the amended version of his report on services of general interest that was adopted in committee, and this is understandable to some extent, because, irrespective of political positions, the text of the report is not very coherent.
Numerous paragraphs are contradictory.
For example, while paragraphÂ 36 calls for the adoption of a framework directive establishing common European rules, paragraph 20 strongly condemns the selfsame approach.
For our part â and here we differ from the rapporteur â we believe that the framework directive, which was the idea of the last French Presidency, would only serve to divest the Member States of essential regulatory powers, as the services in question are closely linked to the unique character of each society.
Moreover, it would be too generalised, would be inapplicable to any individual case and would create endless difficulties.
These are very delicate problems and should be solved by each government at the closest possible level to the people in the framework of the national democratic system.
In this respect I am, moreover, only half surprised that the Left is nailing its colours to the mast of centralisation and enforced uniformity here.
For the same reason we are opposed to Article III-6 of the draft European constitution, whereby European law, in other words the legislative decisions of the majority in the Council and the majority in Parliament, would be able to define the principles and conditions applicable to services of general economic interest.
If this article were adopted, it would very soon have adverse repercussions on the freedom of choice of our national democracies and on subsidiarity.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the first thing we have to bear in mind is that this is not a legislative procedure, but we are discussing our position on the Commissionâs Green Paper.
Although we had asked for something else, the Commission has responded to the Langen report by presenting us with this Green Paper.
Secondly, I would like to thank all the rapporteurs, who have approached this from many different angles in the course of the discussion process, for preparing, in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, a very good resolution, and one that is likely to get majority support now that it is to be voted on by plenary.
Thirdly, the question arises of what services of general interest are.
We take the term to mean services for the public that are provided in the interests of all.
They are meant to provide services where the market alone cannot do so on a universal basis, at a reasonable price, or, in many instances, free of charge.
Services of general interest ensure security of supply.
Service providers may compete among themselves, but they do not have to.
Support from public funds is required.
What is crucial is not who provides the services but the fact that they are provided.
Services of general interest are an expression of the European social model and of the ecologically-responsible market economy.
What was crucial for me was the safeguarding of the subsidiarity principle; I can endorse the Social Democratsâ Amendment NoÂ 18.
I welcome the statement that the liberal professions perform services of general interest for the good of all, and I am glad that we have made it our concern that the definition of services of general interest and responsibility for them should be matters for the Member States rather than for Europe as a whole.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should naturally like to say a big âthank youâ to the rapporteur, Mr Herzog, for the quality of his work and for the opportunity he has given us to debate the issue of services of general interest today.
Even if it is not taking place within the framework of a legislative process, our debate today is fundamental, because it deals with the borderline between the world of the market, where competition has to prevail, and that other world where solidarity, equality and democracy â in short, social cohesion â must be paramount.
It is fundamental, because our European model, the envy of the world, and the most elementary civil rights, chiefly enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, are at stake.
Within the European population, among associations, trade unions and local authorities, there is grave concern, because the various experiences of liberalisation or privatisation â and I need only cite the British experience â have had rather adverse consequences.
This is why we propose that the report, which is totally unacceptable in its present form, should undergo substantial amendment.
First of all, we propose a thorough public, pluralist and open evaluation of the development of services of general interest, perhaps through an observatory of services of general interest.
In actual fact, we find it difficult to understand the opposition of the Right to this proposal if, as its adherents loudly and proudly proclaim, the effects of liberalisation have all been beneficial.
Because of the ambiguity of the criteria used to distinguish between economic and non-economic activities and to guarantee the subsidiarity that everyone is demanding, certain areas of activity â education, health care and social housing â will have to be explicitly excluded from the application of the competition rules.
By the same token, there is a need to protect the right of municipalities and other local authorities to choose democratically the way in which they manage certain services â water and refuse disposal, for example â in accordance with local needs.
Lastly, the Member States and their territorial subdivisions and local authorities are, of course, responsible for services of general interest, hence the need for a framework directive which could truly establish a set of common principles for services of general interest.
It is surely a matter of summoning up the will, at a given moment, to protect the citizenry of our countries. This is how one vision of Europe can be understood.
Â Â  Mr President, while I likewise salute the great energy expended by Mr Herzog and all his hard work, I wish to say very clearly that I really cannot vote tomorrow for this report as amended and adopted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
I oppose this report because it is the expression of an ultraliberal will.
It has been hijacked for use as a weapon in the campaign to demolish our social model, destroy jobs and abandon the policy of regional development.
Should the plenary Chamber endorse the position of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs tomorrow, we should have no choice â as several speakers have already said â but to reject this proposal and demand a proper framework directive and genuine European public services.
We still have time to set matters right.
That needs to be done for the sake of the overwhelming majority of European citizens.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I support all those who believe, as I do, that services of general interest are, first and foremost, committed to the common good.
We understand a European social model to mean that the public must be guaranteed these services, and that is why they are not primarily a political task for the Commission, but a matter for local and regional authorities.
The task of the Commission is to ensure that such services are facilitated and secured in local communities; it must defend services of general interest in the GATS negotiations, where it must ensure that local communities have room to manoeuvre, so that the public may be guaranteed these services in the interests of social justice, solidarity and territorial cohesion.
It is for the Commission to set up the framework in such a way that services of general interest are protected.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr Herzogâs report, caught as it was between the rapporteurâs ambitions and the wariness â in my view the excessive timidity â of the parliamentary committee, illustrates how difficult it is for us to sit down together and define a model for European society.
I believe we have to escape from this dilemma, but we must leave in an orderly manner by the front door.
First of all, it is necessary to affirm the fundamental legitimacy of services of general interest.
There is a set of public assets that must be organised more or less in the form of exemptions to the rules of the market, either because they need to be subsidised by the public authorities if everyone is to have guaranteed equal access to them or because the principle of equality is incompatible with excessive price fluctuations.
There is therefore a need to reaffirm the axiom that we are in a market economy, not a market society.
Secondly, a legal framework is necessary, otherwise we should all have to give up our common ambition.
This framework must begin by specifying where competence lies in accordance with the subsidiarity principle, in other words the level â European, national or local â at which services should be organised.
The legal framework must also specify the scope of services of general interest â how far their definition may legitimately be extended.
And, lastly, it must define the principles governing the way in which they are to be organised.
In particular, care must be taken to ensure that no service of general interest is abused or becomes a monopoly, generating a secure income for those who provide the service rather than its beneficiaries.
All these things have to be said.
Finally, the legal framework must be democratically structured.
We in this Parliament cannot abdicate our responsibilities.
We cannot be like the frogs who demanded a king.
This is a matter that concerns the public, the peoples of Europe.
Together with the Commission, we must establish a legal basis that enables us to set this issue within a democratic framework on the basis of a proposal from the Commission and with the Council and Parliament acting by codecision, otherwise we should be failing in our duty.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, this report cannot be detached from the European context.
What do the people of Europe remember about the EU in these past few months?
They remember the division over foreign policy, they remember the split over budgetary policy, they remember the deadlock on the draft constitution, and they remember the feeling of impotence as they watched the dollar soar in value.
If the social model were to be taken away from them, what would be left in the coming months?
The social model is their one source of pride in Europe at the present time, and services of general interest are part of that social model.
The market is a fine thing, but we are not about to replace the dictatorship of the proletariat with the dictatorship of the shareholders.
We are not about to enshrine the principle of an all-powerful market which is familiar to those who live in the land of the Rockies, nor are we about to return to an all-powerful state, which used to be a familiar concept to those in the land of the Urals.
MrÂ Herzogâs report and proposals strike the right balance.
We need to rediscover that harmony, that judicious compromise, especially for the sake of our fellow European citizens.
There are strong points that must be built upon: the provisions of the draft constitutional treaty, the progress promised by the framework directive and the implications of appropriate guaranteed funding of services of general interest.
There is a need to recapture the spirit that inspired MrÂ Herzogâs initial report before the committee began to chip away some of its substance. That spirit needs to be recaptured, particularly for the sake of our fellow citizens.
Â Â  Mr President, the purpose of the proposed arrangements is to make it easier to hand over public services of general interest to private interests.
In a period of economic crisis, the only thing that is certain is that big business will want to get its hands on the public wealth in order to maximise its profits.
Undertakings of general interest, apart from their important role in the development of the national economy, also play a strategically important role with regard to the security and independence of each country, especially in times of economic and other crises.
Privatising these undertakings and liberalising their markets will ultimately limit this development and will certainly enrich their shareholders instead of strengthening the national economy.
The statement that liberalisation is a factor of technological progress and economic efficiency is not true because, from experience with its practical application to date, it probably has the opposite effect.
Privatisation results in the destruction of productive forces, problematic performance, a fall in the quality of the services provided, terrible social inequalities, higher prices and fewer jobs.
Privatisation has an adverse impact on workers, not just as a result of the increase in the prices of the services provided but also, more importantly, as a result of the waves of redundancies and the resultant replacement of the work regime with flexible forms of work.
Any restrictions placed on the action of big business in the services of general interest sector and any good intentions to guarantee certain principles which will govern operations and the services provided, even if applied initially, will subsequently degenerate, and the only victims will be the citizens.
We are opposed to the selling off of public wealth for the benefit of big business.
We support the public character of undertakings of general interest, which need to be upgraded, providing good, cheap services to the workers, and to act as a lever in a publicly-owned economy.
Â Â  Mr President, on behalf of the Commission, I have listened attentively to all the speakers.
The diversity, to say the least, of the views they expressed did not surprise me, and I should not have intervened had I not perceived in Mr Langenâs contribution a somewhat critical attitude to the Commission on this issue, a suggestion that the Commission raised many questions but did not provide clear answers or, to be more precise, that it was slow in delivering clear legal responses.
This is therefore the point that I should like to take a few moments to clear up between us.
If the Commission had been able to propose a clear legal response to you today, this would mean that a solution had been found to the problem we have been debating.
In point of fact, the very purpose of the Green Paper we published last year was to open the broadest possible debate on a highly complex issue, and our feeling in the Commission is that a year is not an unduly long time for a debate with civil society, with you and with a number of representatives of economic and territorial interests.
The problem is indeed a difficult one, as our debate has shown.
In political terms, this issue palpably centres on a specific European policy mix for which we all want to suggest a slightly different recipe, depending on whether our political preference is for the market economy, which we recognise for its competitiveness and efficiency, or for collectivist virtues in the domain of social or territorial cohesion. These are all dimensions of solidarity, but each of us has his or her own idea of the proportions in which the ingredients should be mixed.
In political terms, then, the problem is relatively clear, and I do not really distinguish any great differences between the various ways in which you have described the contours you would give these services of general interest, or public services, if they had to be more precisely defined at the European level.
The difficulty plainly relates to the way in which they should be defined.
This remains an unresolved issue at the present juncture.
Would what we are doing just now, with our sectoral directives and our decisions taken on a somewhat basis on state aid, suffice as a legal framework?
This is surely the question that is being asked.
As you have pointed out, the Convention debated this point and concluded that it might be necessary to have a European law to provide the legal basis that is currently under discussion today in the context of the EC Treaty in its present form.
This is certainly the question we must clarify.
As I said in my introductory remarks, the Commission is examining various options.
To reassure MrÂ Langen, I repeat that, particularly in the light of the debate which will culminate in tomorrowâs vote on a resolution, the Commission will communicate its own positions before the end of this legislative term.
Whether we come out in favour of an instrument which involves the European Parliament in codecision or whether our conclusions favour a different approach, I must stress on behalf of the Commission that all our options are still open at this stage.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 11.30 a.m.
Â Â  . In this debate on the Herzog report on âthe Green Paper on services of general interestâ, which was watered down by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, we reiterate the need to adopt proposals that acknowledge the importance of high-quality public services, which guarantee all citizens the right of access to these services whilst respecting the specific characteristics of each country.
The consequences of the liberalisations are already evident in the sectors affected, not only in the shape of redundancies and greater job insecurity, on the railways, in energy, postal services and telecommunications, but also, in some cases, in more expensive tariffs and prices and in lower quality of services provided.
This situation is gradually affecting larger and larger spheres of activity, particularly in Portugal.
Despite acknowledging the role of public services, known as services of general interest, submitting them to the rules of competition devalues the social role of public services that are essential to the population, to combating poverty and exclusion, to guaranteeing human rights, to the regional development of afflicted areas, to environmental protection and to economic and social cohesion.
We insist that we should adopt proposals that promote the protection of public services and a democratic and pluralist evaluation of the impact of the market and competition, taking account of the need for high-quality public services and the damaging consequences of the liberalisations and privatisations that have already taken place in various areas.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A5-0471/2003) by Mrs Almeida Garrett on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs on the communication from the Commission: âThe operating framework for the European regulatory agenciesâ (COM(2002) 718 â 2003/2089(INI)).
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Parliament is today responding to the Commission communication on an operating framework for the European regulatory agencies, in which, as a follow-up to the White Paper on Governance, the Commission presented the general conditions for creating new agencies, the framework within which they are to carry out their activities and the Commissionâs own responsibilities as regards supervising those agencies.
I wish first of all, Commissioner, to congratulate you on this initiative and also on the broad criteria it contains.
Parliament is pleased to note that due account was taken of its positions, which had already been set out in the resolution on the White Paper, with responsibility for the creation of agencies being attributed to the explicit choice of the legislator, on a case-by-case basis, through an act based on the provision of the Treaty which constitutes the legal basis for the specific Community policy which is to be implemented.
One important point that we wish to emphasise is the Commissionâs acceptance that new agencies should be established sparingly and selectively.
The use of such agencies is justified only in highly specialised scientific or technical areas, with a precise demarcation of the tasks to be performed and within a framework of responsibility and autonomy which does not call into question the unity and integrity of the executive function or lessen the Commissionâs political accountability to Parliament and the Council.
As with everything in life, there is always a âbutâ.
The report I am presenting today regrets the fact that the Commission has limited the scope of its communication to the so-called regulatory agencies to be created in future, within the institutional framework of the EC Treaty.
It is regrettable that no reference is made to the existing agencies, when we all agree that there is a need to undertake in-depth assessment of the work of these agencies, to propose the reworking of some of their tasks and powers and, possibly, to update the structure and composition of their organs.
These are concerns, as you know, Commissioner, that Parliament has expressed to the Commission through the parliamentary committees most directly involved in scrutiny of the agenciesâ functioning and which today, once again, we emphasise.
We also deplore the fact that no discussion has taken place on the consequences that will ensue from the thoroughgoing changes proposed in the draft European Constitution, specifically the end to the pillar structure, the introduction of a hierarchy of legislation and the explicit provision made for judicial supervision of agenciesâ acts.
These must be properly understood in order to define the future legislative environment of the agencies more completely, coherently and boldly.
As regards the limited scope of the communication, Parliamentâs main concerns will always be to ensure the unity and integrity of the executive function at European level and the corresponding political responsibility of the Commission.
You will also understand, however, that Parliament will pay particular attention to rules that enable tasks to be carried out transparently and effectively, to appointments to posts and cost management at the future agencies.
We will, therefore, pay particular attention in the proposal for a future legislative framework to rules that impose on the agencies all the requirements for sound administration, for compliance with legislation on transparency, on access to documents, with the rules for protection against fraud and for protecting the Communityâs financial interests.
I wish to conclude by thanking the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control for their competent and judicious opinions and all my fellow Members who, by participating, served as co-authors of this report.
Commissioner, we look forward confidently to the initiative for a legal framework for the agencies, which the Commission will present at some time in the future.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, the Commission should like first of all to thank MrsÂ Almeida Garrett for her excellent work on the Commissionâs communication on the operating framework for the regulatory agencies.
Let us start with the facts: we currently have 16 agencies that were set up by the Treaties in successive waves to meet specific needs on a case-by-case basis.
What characterises these 16 agencies today is indeed their diversity, in terms of how they operate, the tasks assigned to them and what they are called.
As we stressed in 2001, we believe that creating new regulatory agencies helps to improve the implementation of Community rules.
The 2001 White Paper proposed that the Commission set out parameters, more precise criteria, for the creation, operation and supervision of these agencies.
Our communication, the one that you are debating today, therefore seeks primarily to launch a process of reflection with you, and moreover with the Council, within a common framework, on the creation, operation and supervision of any future regulatory agencies, which we define as being actively involved in exercising the executive function at Community level.
As your rapporteur has just mentioned, the work that they do is indeed at the very heart of the executive function.
To avoid any misunderstandings â and I will be coming back to this when I respond to the debate, with reference in particular to the point raised by the rapporteur â this initiative does not cover the âexecutiveâ agencies that help to manage Community programmes.
In a nutshell, what is the reasoning behind the Commissionâs proposal?
It is a balance between, on the one hand, strengthening the integrity and unity of the executive function â and we know that this is incumbent primarily on the Commission â and, on the other hand, providing the autonomy that these agencies must be able to enjoy if they are to plan their work for the longer term.
It is all about striking this delicate balance.
The purpose of the agencies is, on the one hand, to relieve the Commission of very technical tasks so that it can focus on essential policies.
Nevertheless â and you reminded us of this, MrsÂ Almeida Garrett â the Commission must retain the final political responsibility for implementing regulations, because this is our particular responsibility to you and because we need to provide people with clearly identifiable remits to come before this House.
It is then this difficult balance that we are trying to improve, clarify and formalise, given that more and more of the regulatory agencies are meeting a need for an increasing level of expertise in a number of fields, regardless of short-term considerations.
For this expertise to be constantly available and to ensure a certain amount of transparency, some degree of autonomy and, of course, supervision is also required.
It is this balance that we are seeking and we await your debate to find out whether the way in which we have expressed this balance also reflects the kind of compromise that you might be able to accept on these tensions, which are inevitable, but which we wish to manage in a positive way.
Â Â  .
Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking the Commission for the presentation of this Communication and Mrs Almeida Garrett for her report.
The Commission will note that there is substantial agreement between the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and the text presented by Mrs Almeida Garrett.
In the field of regulatory agencies, there is a danger of us falling into the North American vice of the proliferation of agencies, which act in a completely autonomous manner and without any real control on the part of the legislative powers.
Paragraphs 2 and 3 of the resolution contained in Mrs Garrettâs report are very significant.
Specifically, when we get into the strictly regulatory field, we are talking about a legislative power and not an executive power.
I would therefore call on the Commission, when drawing up a text with specific proposals, to prevent any reference which could imply the assumption of legislative powers by these agencies.
In other words, we should try to ensure that, for any type of legislative delegation, there is an interinstitutional agreement, with the Council and Parliament as the legislative power.
Secondly, we must prevent the proliferation of agencies, regulatory or non-regulatory, because it appears that, at the moment, they have become a kind of Christmas present, which are given each year to governments, so that they can say in their respective capitals that they have achieved something from an institutional point of view.
With regard to the legal basis and the tendency to invoke Article 308, the regulatory agencies would only make sense if there were specific European Union competence in that area, but not by creating special means for justifying that type of creation.
Finally, it is important that the regulatory agencies are subject to the same type of scrutiny as the Commission. Even more in fact, given their distance away.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the legislation on European agencies, our opinion on which is contained in the report by MrsÂ Almeida Garrett, is a subject that goes to the heart of the debate on the future of Europe, that is to say, the fight against European bureaucracy.
Now, of all times, when Europe finds itself in a crisis from which we have to extricate ourselves together, it is important that we ask ourselves how the various European institutions, including the existing and future agencies, can be embedded in the democratic structure of Europe: a democratic, transparent and efficient Europe.
I should just like to reiterate that 2004 is a decisive year for Europe.
It is a year in which it is vitally important to win back the confidence of the European electorate.
This electorate looks at us and sees the European system as unwieldy and bureaucratic.
Incidentally, the Heads of State or Government, who are fairly often found wanting, bear a large part of the responsibility for this.
Citizens, who mainly see quarrelling between Heads of State or Government over the distribution of power and money, are naturally increasingly unable to grasp what this European cooperation actually means.
It is not for nothing that we speak of a democratic deficit in the European Union that has to be filled.
Europe is too slow-moving, frequently inefficient and incomprehensible to its citizens, and is thus achieving too little.
This has to change, particularly with a view to the enlargement of the EU by ten new Member States on 1Â May.
That is why we must make Europe more efficient, more democratic.
We must root out sluggish bureaucracy.
In the first instance, this will of course be carried out by means of proposals in the European Constitution, which will hopefully become reality very soon.
However, it will also take place in the case of subjects such as todayâs â the creation of a framework for European agencies â which are not dealt with in the European Constitution.
The focus is on the performance of essential tasks that are financed with European funds.
I should like to mention a number of things that I believe to be essential within this framework.
Firstly, direct scrutiny by the European Commission and political accountability to the Council and Parliament must be guaranteed when the European agencies are set up, and it goes without saying that those agencies must have a management that, on pain of dismissal, presents all problems of a genuinely political nature directly to the politically accountable Commissioner.
I am sure we all remember the Eurostat case. Secondly, the confusing situation we find ourselves in at the moment, where we have no less than twelve different structures, must be replaced by a uniform structure that can be monitored and is comprehensible to all.
Thirdly, the seat of an agency must be subject to criteria such as efficiency and cost-benefit analyses.
That means no quarrelling over Parma ham and Swedish models.
This approach applies not only to new, but also to existing agencies.
Only then will we tackle bureaucracy seriously.
We give our full support to the report by MrsÂ Almeida Garrett.
Â Â  MrÂ President, at the Brussels Summit in December 2003, the Heads of State or Government agreed to domiciles for ten new agencies, including an agency for IT security.
In the Ãresund area, universities and business enterprises on both the Danish and Swedish sides formed a consortium and put forward proposals as to how good conditions could in practice be created for locating precisely this IT security agency in the area.
The Ãresund region has a sound infrastructure, good international transport connections, very extensive IT facilities and strong environments for IT research and development.
The universities would make facilities available so that the agencyâs workers could have close contact with the research environments, and there was a desire to create buildings able to fulfil the agencyâs demands.
In short, here was an offer, in terms of location, that could guarantee a rapid start to the agency in an area easily able to attract qualified labour.
I know there were other attractive environments in the offing in the Netherlands and Germany.
What emerged from the efforts concerned, however?
They were a waste of energy.
The EUâs Heads of State or Government agreed that this agency should be situated in a town in Greece.
I have nothing negative to say about Greece, but the decision-making process simply cannot be taken seriously.
It is neither transparent nor comprehensible to the public.
I am therefore very pleased with the report we are debating today, for it lays down a list of important and clear principles about the way in which decisions concerning agencies should be made in the future, about their operational frameworks and about how they should be placed in relation to the EUâs institutions, and I wish to congratulate MrsÂ Garrett on the good outcome.
The decision concerning a new agency must be transparent and based on analyses of advantages and disadvantages.
It must be the basis of a strong professionalism, and setting up an agency must not be a short cut to increasing administrative expenses.
It is important for the Commission to have ongoing responsibility and for Parliament to have the role of supervisory power and not be governed by the agencies.
The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Partyâs amendments are to emphasise this, and I very much hope that there will be broad support for these proposals.
Â Â  â Mr President, as permanent rapporteur for the agencies, I would like to make the following budget-related points in addition to the opinion on this project, on which the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has led.
My first point is that this regulatory agency should have its headquarters, for reasons of cost, close to the Commission.
The second is that the functions of the regulatory agencies should be limited to the creation of secondary legislation linked to the Commissionâs initiatives and should be subject to the approval of the budgetary authority.
Thirdly, I believe it to be important that the new regulatory agencies should exercise their autonomy subject to the direct control of the Commission and to the political control of the European Parliament.
Fourthly, it should also be laid down that all the provisions of the Financial Regulation and of the Staff Regulations shall apply to the regulatory agencies.
Fifthly and finally, the Commission should, before submitting any legislative proposal for the establishment of a regulatory agency, present an assessment of its budgetary consequences and of its profitability, as well as proposals for the redeployment and management of human resources.
Â Â  â Mr President, we agree with Mr Prodi, the President of the Commission, when he tells us that the EU is to have the most modern administration in the world.
If this goal is to be achieved, though, all the administrative units must be modernised; not just the Commissionâs main offices, but also the subordinate offices, the agencies, and I can also see that the establishment, organisation and control of these is flourishing unchecked.
There is too little transparency; often there is neither the necessary efficiency nor adequate control, and that is why the agencies of the future need to be put on a new footing.
In its report, Parliament now demands that an agency should be established by a law adopted by way of the codecision procedure.
The joint involvement of the Commission, Parliament and the Council in this decision must become the norm in future.
The legislative act of establishment must also stipulate where the agency is to be based.
I could spend all my speaking time on what went on between Helsinki and Parma with regard to the food agency.
That was a tragedy.
Nothing of the sort must be allowed to happen again, and the choice of headquarters must be made by reference to competence and cost-efficiency.
We have to cut back the number of types of agencies; having fifteen agencies divided up into twelve types makes for an impossible situation.
As these agencies are subject to the Commission, it is the Commission that should appoint their directors.
I will conclude by thanking Mrs Almeida Garrett for this report, and by expressing the hope that it will get through.
Â Â  Mr President, I congratulate MrsÂ Almeida Garrett, whose report has, in my opinion, done a good job in providing a clear and concise analysis of the entire set of issues concerning the agencies, amongst which I would very briefly highlight the following, because of their relevance:
- the urgent need for the Commission to clarify the appropriate legal instrument for defining the framework of general conditions governing the creation of these agencies, which would avoid the risks to which Mr Medina Ortega referred;
- the need for Parliament to be fully and permanently involved in appointing the members of the administrative board and in monitoring the activity of these agencies;
- the crucial need to monitor the legality of the actions undertaken by the regulatory agencies and by their administrative boards in line with the provisions of the draft Constitution drawn up by the European Convention.
We hope that the Commission will take account of the proposals made in Mrs Almeida Garrettâs report, drawn up on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, and once again I offer my congratulations to the rapporteur on the excellent work she has presented to us.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, I am going to try to respond very quickly to the various interventions made, which, broadly speaking, seemed to me to be along the same lines and to express similar views.
Firstly, on the scope of application of the text, your rapporteur indicated just now that she would perhaps have preferred the Commission to be a little more ambitious at this stage.
It is true that for the time being we are only proposing instruments for future regulatory agencies.
Why?
The reason for this is quite simply that we want to start with what is immediately feasible and it seems to us that if we had to work initially on streamlining the existing agencies with their very disparate characteristics, it would have been difficult, if not impossible, to adopt a truly uniform approach.
We therefore favour a uniform approach and wish to apply it first of all to future agencies.
As far as the legal instrument is concerned, I do not think that we disagree: a framework regulation is required, as you propose. This is a binding legal instrument for the application of common principles, which in this case is exactly what we are looking for.
The advantage of having such an instrument on the regulatory agencies is that it would exist in parallel to the framework regulation on the status of the executive agencies, which was adopted by the Council in December 2002.
Turning now to the substance â and I think that we are in full agreement on all of these points â I noted that several principles emerged from your discussion: efficiency, supervision and responsibility, all subject to an overriding principle of parsimony, which I thought your rapporteur expressed very well.
On the principle of efficiency, we agree, and in particular we need to apply our good resolutions on efficiency to the structure and composition of the agencies.
It is clear that if the administrative boards are excessively large and if the selection of the directors calls for permanent consultations then we will not achieve our aims.
We therefore need to be disciplined enough to keep these in check and I think that we will be able to work together on this point.
The second principle is supervision.
Many of you have said that whether it be from a legal, administrative or financial point of view, these agencies, which are, as it were, Commission outposts, need to be subject to greater supervision the further they are from the seat of the executive authority.
The third principle is the principle of responsibility.
You said this and we agree with you on this point: the Commission bears the political responsibility and its agencies, even the regulatory agencies, work under the Commissionâs political responsibility, which you must be able to call into question: it is, after all, your right and your duty to do so.
Finally, all of this, and I will conclude on this point, implies a principle of parsimony.
We have to admit that it is sometimes tempting to resolve this or that problem by creating an agency; together we need to be able to resist this temptation.
We need a good means for preventing proliferation and it would seem, having listened to your debate, that your intentions in this respect are perfectly in line with those of the Commission.
I conclude then that we are well provisioned with criteria and principles that will enable us to improve the current situation, which is, it is true, starting to bear a strong resemblance to a plate of spaghetti.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11.30 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the Commissionâs statement on the prospects for the Doha Round following the meeting of the WTO General Councilon 15 December 2003.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, you wanted us once again to review the progress of negotiations in the WTO on what is known as the Doha Development Agenda following the period of reflection, work and consultation that the Commission undertook after the collapse of the talks in CancÃºn.
It is clear that since we last debated this, just after CancÃºn on 24Â September, the situation has changed, both in the Union and in the WTO.
I will address three aspects of the post-CancÃºn process: our policy following the Commissionâs November communication and the General Affairs Council; the situation in the WTO since 15Â December and, finally, the prospects for 2004.
Let us first turn our attention to our own policy.
As you are aware, after CancÃºn, the Commission embarked on a phase of in-depth reflection and consultation of Parliament, the Member States, the social partners and civil society.
All of this led, in mid-November, to a communication on relaunching the negotiating process, which we still believe to be of the utmost importance for the European Union.
You received that communication.
It has been debated in your committee that deals with external trade issues and has been discussed bilaterally with a number of your political groups.
Let me sum up this policy as it stands today.
It is clear.
Above all, we remain firmly attached to multilateralism.
This remains the top priority of the Unionâs trade policy and we want negotiations to resume as soon as possible.
On the substance, we have adopted a more flexible position on the so-called Singapore issues, which will please a number of the groups in this Parliament.
We have also adopted a more flexible approach towards geographical indications and even the environment, so as to facilitate the negotiations.
On agriculture, we have reiterated our desire to inject momentum into these long, drawn-out negotiations, if only because since implementing our own reforms we have the means to make an active contribution to them.
At long last, the European Union is no longer on the defensive here.
I will now say a word on the state of play in the WTO, in particular since work resumed on 15Â December.
The good news is that although CancÃºn had revealed slight differences of opinion, indeed even some substantial ones, on the need to pursue these negotiations, now everyone in the WTO agrees that it is important to resume them.
We all agree that the world will probably be a worse place without a negotiated outcome than with one, which is an important political motivation.
That is the good news!
Nevertheless, will this mean that negotiations will proceed at a pace that will, in our view, make it possible for ambitious objectives to be achieved in 2004?
It is still too early to say.
Let me move on to the third point, the prospects for the negotiations in 2004.
The real challenge is not, I believe, to restart the discussions.
There is agreement on this point and the process is underway.
The real challenge is to make them proceed at a good pace and with the necessary energy and ambition.
We are going to spend a month or two on technical issues in Geneva.
It is absolutely essential that this technical phase leads as soon as possible to a political phase, which will enable the various ministers to reiterate their positions on the timetable and the content of the final negotiations.
The European Union has been working hard on this since mid-December.
We are pleased to have been joined since the end of last week by the Americans, because my American counterpart has stated that he wishes to see a definite relaunch of the work in Geneva and has indicated, as we had done in our turn, that there is room for flexibility on some points. This is, I believe, a welcome initiative.
It means that we can correct an increasingly widespread impression that, because 2004 is an election year in the United States, these negotiations would be, as it were, put on the backburner for the duration.
Fortunately, my American counterpart has disabused us of this pessimistic notion.
What are we going to be doing in the coming weeks?
Firstly, we are going to continue our dialogue with the developing countries, and in particular with countries in the G20 and G90.
I myself took the initiative by travelling to Latin America in mid-December and we are going to pursue the dialogue that was, I think, begun to good effect on that occasion. The same goes for the G90.
Next week I will be in Bangladesh, India and Indonesia to work on these various issues with countries that are clearly crucial negotiating partners.
As I said a moment ago, what is vital now is to see whether we can move forward quickly on agriculture, industrial tariffs, services and the Singapore issues that we consider to be priorities, that is trade facilitation and the transparency of public procurement.
My feeling is that everyone, at least the United States and Europe, has sufficient room for manoeuvre.
We now need to ensure that Brazil, South Africa, India, China and our Japanese friends invest as much energy in these negotiations as we are prepared to.
In any case, the message on which I would like to hear your views, the Commissionâs message, is that we hope that in 2004 we will be able to make up for a large part of what we were unable to achieve in 2003 in CancÃºn, and we think we can.
Â Â  Mr President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, I just want to make a few comments of an agricultural nature in relation to what my fellow-Commissioner Mr Lamy has already said.
You have heard about the steps that the Commission has taken to relaunch the negotiations, and I am sure you were disappointed to learn that the members of the WTO, as long ago as December, were unable to resume negotiations on the development agenda.
What went on in the run-up to the Geneva meeting on 15 December gave me the impression that this failure had to do, among other things, with the nature of the proceedings.
The WTO members did not negotiate directly with one another, but everything was done through the mediation of the chairman of the WTOâs General Council, and this way of going about things was certainly not particularly conducive to agreement.
I became all the more convinced of this when, shortly afterwards, in the margins of the FAO Conference in Rome, I met many ministers who also regretted the absence of any direct contact, which they said they would have expected.
I have come to the conclusion that, if there is to be agreement, there is in any case an absolute need for more dialogue and for more intensive efforts among the members of the WTO.
As Mr Lamy has already said, we will, for our part, be doing everything possible to ensure that 2004 is not a wasted year.
We will be playing a particularly active part in this.
As regards the subject matter of the negotiations, I have to say that we cannot accept any and every framework for negotiation modalities at any price.
We see it as a fundamental condition that such a framework should reflect the spirit and content of the Doha Declaration.
Among other things, one primary requirement is that there should be tighter restrictions on âamber boxâ measures than on âblue boxâ measures, which distort trade to a lesser extent.
Secondly, when considering export competition, all forms of export subsidy must be tackled in parallel.
You will be aware that we have gone on the offensive in the debate about export subsidies, by proposing that all forms of export subsidy for a range of products important to developing countries be allowed to expire.
We are still waiting for a response to this offer.
At the same time, we cannot but note the continuing lack of willingness to make comparable commitments in respect of other forms of export subsidy; as far as I am aware, for example, the Canadian Wheat Board was compensated for its latest losses by the Canadian Government.
Another example is Argentina, which uses differentiated export duties on soya beans and soya bean flour as a means of indirectly subsidising the building of its largest soya mill.
The USA continues to use supplies of food aid as a means of reducing its surpluses.
From the very outset, we have made it plain that all measures to deal with export competition must be dealt with simultaneously and that they must all exercise discipline to the same degree.
This is something on which we will continue to work.
Â Â  MrÂ President, first of all, my thanks to the two Commissioners for their efforts and for the points they have raised here.
The Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats greatly appreciates your commitment and your efforts, which must be aimed at making 2004 a greater success than 2003.
I share the Commissionerâs view that we need to give the Member States more information with regard to the offer made by the European Union in the field of agriculture.
It was already evident in CancÃºn that people did not believe it, and I think that it is useful and necessary to go further towards explaining that offer.
It strikes me that, whilst it is true that MrÂ Zoellick is making a great gesture, it is still unclear what exactly he is proposing.
We do of course welcome the increased flexibility on this point that is now being shown by the US Government, but the question that I should like to ask both Commissioners is as follows: does that also apply to cotton, for example?
I ask this because, as far as I know, the position of the United States regarding cotton is still fairly rigid.
Perhaps you could tell us a little more about this?
I am also wondering to what extent Japan is currently prepared to relax its policy with regard to rice, because, as you know, the subject of rice was another of the obstacles in CancÃºn.
Perhaps you would also like to give us some further details on this?
The Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats believes that the offer we have made in the field of agriculture, which even includes the possibility of reducing export subsidies to virtually zero, and now also an increased flexibility regarding geographical indications, is sufficient for us to go into the negotiations.
We also welcome the fact that the offer is being seen in a wider perspective and that we are not only looking at agriculture, but also at services and the Singapore issues.
Unfortunately, we shall also have to accept that there is an inherent degree of flexibility, but I think that the package now before us should offer sufficient scope to get the negotiations off the ground.
Something that is tending to fall by the wayside is the whole debate on a kind of reform of the WTO.
We all know that CancÃºn also revealed that the organisation cannot carry on functioning the way it is now doing.
I hope that this is also included in the package, therefore.
The question that CommissionerÂ Lamy asked us was whether we would give him free rein to enter into the negotiations with the package as he proposed it.
On behalf of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I can give him a straightforward answer: yes, we believe he can.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, you are familiar with the position of the Group of the Party of European Socialists.
Restarting the Doha Development Agenda promptly is in the interests of economic recovery in Europe.
Restarting it promptly is in the interests of all parts of the world.
We must fulfil our development promises: stop the agricultural subsidies that have shot up and instead use them for the environment, consumers, and agriculture that is beneficial to the developing world.
The European trade agenda must be brought closer to the citizen.
The Group of the Party of European Socialists wants to see a higher priority accorded to a citizensâ agenda.
This would read as follows: counterforce.
Citizens want protection against unfair competition at work: this is a tribute to your efforts against the US in the steel dispute and South Koreaâs unfair shipyard aid.
Citizens also want respect for nature and the environment, and consumer-friendly agriculture: no animal transports, quality over quantity and respect for nature.
They want social power.
They do not want any products that have been manufactured by exploiting women or using child labour.
They want support for fair trade products and for free trade unions.
Our additional GSP approach would enable extra support for countries that take education, health care and free trade unions seriously, but we would want a multilateral approach to this.
As far as we are concerned, that approach would require dropping the Singapore issues: removing them from the single undertaking.
Now is the right time to do that.
The truth is, however, that many developing countries think that we, like the US, do not genuinely want this.
In the field of agriculture, in particular, and with regard to the Singapore issues, the message has not got through clearly.
We hope that we shall be generous to the new alliance, that is to say, stop export subsidies for products sensitive to them, open up our markets, and give them help in marketing their products in their own region and on our market.
As you yourself say, we have to be clear about the G-21.
We need this new, emerging world power as a multilateral player, but the G-21 must also be aware that, if they make requirements of us, they themselves must also make their contribution.
They must guarantee their citizens the right to a free trade-union movement, and put an end to child labour and the exploitation of women.
Why should they not be the first to give that new alliance a chance, just as we did with Everything But Arms, and permit their countries to import goods?
That would make Lulaâs agenda credible.
Europeâs commitment to cheap AIDS drugs has finally borne fruit.
This point demonstrates that Europe is not focusing on short-term gain for itself, but on the bigger picture.
This approach to the global free market, with fair rules, will make us a great deal more credible.
I believe that prompt implementation of this approach in the Member States and the European Union is the right course to follow.
Â Â  MrÂ President, this morningâs session seems to be turning into a private chat among the Dutch contingent, so we shall just continue.
The Netherlands is pre-eminently a trading nation, after all.
Back in September, during the debate in this Parliament on the failure of the CancÃºn negotiating round, I made Commissioners Lamy and Fischler aware of the support of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party and myself for restarting promptly while the momentum was still there.
In this regard, multilateralism remains the best route to global free trade, and the conclusion of bilateral agreementsÂ is detrimental to smaller countries and developing countries.
Indeed, these countries benefit from general standards applying worldwide.
The Commission sees reform of the WTO as another priority, and I agree with CommissionerÂ Lamy on this point, because there is room for improvement in the way in which the organisation is currently functioning, which is no longer appropriate in 2004.
He must bear in mind, however, that it was the members that were to blame for the failure of the negotiations.
The most important thing, therefore, is to obtain constructive support among WTOÂ members for the continuation of the Doha Development Round.
That will not be easy, however, in view of the US presidential elections this year, because the campaigns will probably be full of protectionist rhetoric.
An enhanced role for the Secretariat in Geneva and for the Director-General would be a step in the right direction, in my opinion.
The Director-General must be given the right of initiative in order to generate more support and increased commitment on the part of the Member States to putting the negotiations back on track; and also in order to hold the members to the agreements they have made.
This enhanced mandate for the Director-General would then have to be set against democratic control by a parliamentary assembly.
In CancÃºn, we gave this another firm push by means of a parliamentary conference.
That must continue, because this democratic control really cannot be left in the hands of the NGOs.
Firstly, they lack democratic legitimacy and, secondly, CancÃºn showed once more that these organisations are not exactly striving for the success of the negotiating round.
The subject matter of the present agenda should stay the same, in my view, and the Singapore issues and market access play a key role in this.
It is precisely developing countries that stand to benefit from a favourable investment climate, reduction in import levies and transparent legislation.
The southern countries would profit from trade facilitation; indeed, 80% of all import levies are paid by the developing countries combined.
The European Union must also provide other members with better information, however, as my colleague MrÂ vanÂ Velzen has already said.
Finally, the ELDR Group gives Commissioners Lamy and Fischler a clear field for promoting their strategy and the proposed package in this sphere, and for continuing on this path.
Â Â  Once a pepper trader, always a pepper trader, Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel!
Â Â  Mr President, I am grateful that we are now having this debate that we requested, although I am sorry that other political groups did not allow a motion for a resolution to be tabled on the negotiations at the World Trade Organization.
The failure to reach an agreement at the WTO Ministerial Meeting in CancÃºn confirms the need to halt and reverse current trade liberalisation policies.
We need to implement policies that promote fair and equitable trading systems, geared towards the sustainable development of each countryâs true potential, without imposing relationships of dominance and dependence and also geared towards improving the living conditions of the various peoples of the world as a matter of urgency and towards reinforcing their rights and social .
The Commissionâs current mandate, however, obstructs this need.
The great acts of social mobilisation that have taken place throughout the world, specifically at the European Social Forum, against the WTO and its various proposals, specifically the agreement on services, which jeopardises high-quality public services, prove the need for us to review the Commissionâs mandate.
We cannot allow the European Union to continue to align itself with the United States of America on fundamental areas of negotiation, specifically farming, the liberalisation of services, what are known as the ânew Singapore issuesâ, investment, competition, and public procurement.
Account must also be taken of areas that are important to the textiles and clothing industries, especially those in the countries of southern Europe such as Portugal, in order to safeguard employment and development in huge areas to which these industries are crucial.
Consequently, we reiterate the need to review the current mandate in order to avoid the disastrous social and environmental effects of the trading systems that the WTO has put in place.
We want to see fair and equitable trading, geared towards development, public health, respect for the environment and towards cultural diversity.
We must grasp the opportunity provided by the failure to reach an agreement at Seattle, CancÃºn or recently in Geneva, to review the proposals presented by the Commission and to give consideration to this much-needed balance.
Hence my question about the European Commissionâs willingness to review its current mandate and to undertake negotiations in a new framework, respecting the principles that I have just referred to.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I have already had the opportunity in a committee meeting to express my disappointment to Commissioner Lamy with the Commissionâs new proposals and, ultimately, with the Councilâs position confirming these.
Given his robust remarks the day after the talks collapsed in CancÃºn, I was actually expecting the Commission to be thinking more along the lines of proposing a thorough overhaul of the international trading system rather than adopting a new tactical position.
In fact, it is not strategic change that we are discussing today but rather a tactical repositioning.
As regards the Singapore issues in particular, Commissioner Lamy is reporting greater flexibility on the part of the Commission, the kind of flexibility that emerged right at the end of the CancÃºn process, too late in the day in my opinion.
But is flexibility still the issue today?
All the same, I must remind you that the Doha Declaration required a unanimous and explicit agreement on the negotiating arrangements for these issues.
In fact we know that, as things currently stand, there is no chance of such an agreement.
The G90 countries, which are the poorest, have restated their opposition to opening negotiations on the Singapore issues.
I think it is clear that these countries have nothing to gain for their development from such negotiations: their priorities lie elsewhere, which is understandable.
Both technically and in terms of human resources, these countries are ill-equipped to play an effective role in such negotiations, which would only place greater strain on a timetable that everyone recognises is already very tight.
I think that by abandoning the Singapore issues for the time being, or at least putting them on the backburner, the European Union would send out a powerful and meaningful signal to the G90, showing them that we are sensitive to their concerns.
This attitude might even be a smart strategic move because it would put the European Union in a more positive position on agriculture: we would have more room for manoeuvre.
As for the rest, on agriculture, the World Trade Organisation is not, in my opinion, an appropriate forum in which to deal with everyoneâs rights and obligations.
I think it is essential and urgent to relaunch a process of dialogue within a body like the FAO, where we can have a calm discussion on food safety and the protection and development of rural areas.
In particular, I think that an urgent file like the cotton one, which was tabled in CancÃºn, should be given top priority by the European Union, and I would be grateful if the Commissioners could take this into account.
Â Â  Mr President, we welcome the recent announcement by the Americans that they are starting to think multilaterally once again.
After the collapse of the talks in CancÃºn, there were some worrying signs that the United States was going to abandon the multilateral rules and force a series of bilateral deals around the globe.
In the context of the WTO talks, I am concerned primarily about agriculture.
I find worrying the noises the Americans are now making in this respect and I believe they are trying to move the goalposts regarding farming.
European farmers have signed up to a reform deal that involves tremendous upheaval in the sector, but at least they know where they are heading.
It is totally unacceptable to suggest reopening the Luxembourg Accord of last year.
Our farmers need policy stability in order to plan for the future of their businesses and the livelihood of their families.
There can be no question of our going back, under pressure from the Americans, on any of the commitments we have entered into with our farmers.
I call on the Commission to state clearly that it will not tolerate such pressure and that it will rigorously defend the existing agreement.
Finally, I would also remind the Commission that there exists no mandate to negotiate away the current export refund regime.
The Americans must not be allowed to call for an end to export refunds while they continue to operate a host of schemes which have exactly the same effect as far as American farmers are concerned.
Â Â  MrÂ President, as I have remarked previously in this House, Christian charity obliges us to adopt a more constructive approach to the development agenda.
In that light, I have a number of comments on the present strategy.
My first relates to agriculture.
The EU agreed a framework with the United States ahead of CancÃºn.
The US Trade Representative, MrÂ Zoellick, recently declared himself in favour of resuming the negotiations in the current trade round.
I presume that the Commissioner is holding consultations with him with a view to arriving at a framework outlining clear commitments.
A second element in the Doha Development Agenda is the manufacture and import of unpatented medicinal products for developing countries that are undergoing a serious health crisis.
The complex import procedure for cheap medicinal products needs to be simplified.
The United States is a strategic player in this, so a more workable solution must be agreed with them.
I cannot find the necessary clarification on this point in the Commission document.
Finally, this trade round is a development round.
The negotiations must not focus on the Singapore issues, but instead all the more on the development issues.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner Lamy, Commissioner Fischler, I appreciate and support the Commission strategy geared towards multilateralism.
Much more than the United States, Europe needs multilateral bases in order to develop international trade.
There is one point, MrÂ President, Commissioners, on which I completely disagree.
Commissioner Lamy said that as far as agriculture is concerned, negotiations are being reopened and the European Union is no longer always on the defensive.
I believe that, at political level, this is not entirely true.
Of course, the United States also have agricultural problems, in terms of protectionism, as does Japan; but Europe remains a cornerstone of the world system of protectionism and State handouts for farmers and rich countries.
The so-called reform has not made sufficient progress in this regard.
One only has to look at the budgets of the European Union: we are continuing to spend 40% of the Union budget on subsidising and protecting rich farmers, who represent a declining sector in the European economy.
Is it possible that some people do not understand that we are discussing the future of Europeâs international trade?
Do we have to discuss this with Commissioner LamyÂ âÂ and that would be the last straw!Â âÂ and with Commissioner Fischler?
Personally, I have nothing against Commissioner Fischler, but we have the Commission or the Council representative for agricultureÂ âÂ and not for technology, or for industry.
How is that possible?
To conclude, MrÂ President, agriculture remains the obstacle in key negotiations on Europeâs world trade, and agricultural protectionism is harming Europe before developing countries.
Â Â  â Mr President, the reiterated support given today to both Commissionersâ negotiating positions by our group, that of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, indicates that we too are in favour of everyone moving, when there are negotiations on agriculture, to ensure that such negotiations are actually held, and that the other participants in them should follow us in not merely announcing reforms but also implementing them.
That is my first point.
My second is that our present support for the mandate given to the Commission and the Council also means that we in this European Parliament have to be consistent.
It is not acceptable that, in this House, we are supporting the Commission by a large majority, at the same time as, in the ACP-EU Joint Assembly, the same group and the same rapporteur prepare reports that are diametrically opposed to what we have said to the WTO.
I would refer to the negotiations on the regional partnership agreements, in which the same principles must apply, including such things as the Singapore issues.
What we see as of the utmost importance are the reciprocal opening-up of markets and, of course, preferential treatment for our ACP friends as well.
We cannot, though, send out two conflicting messages, and we in the Group of the European Peopleâs Party, perhaps along with other Members forming a majority in this House, will see to it that we remain coherent.
My third point is that we in this House have to try, if we are to become active on the parliamentary front, to play a significant and leading role, which â difficult though this may be â will mean the constant involvement of our partners in the US Congress.
After all, they are our principal trading partners, and we do not want to be dragged along in the wake of the Indians and the Chinese.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I should like to say first of all, in response to the comment made just now by MrsÂ Plooij, drawing attention to the large number of Dutch Members present, that it is not only because my first name is of Dutch origin â which it is â that I am taking part in this debate today, but because I believe that all of us are very concerned, as elected representatives of the European Union, about the relaunch of the multilateral trade negotiations.
I believe, Commissioners, that the most striking aspect of the communication of 26Â November that you tabled in the Council was indeed the U-turn on the Singapore issues.
I am glad to have been one of those Members of this House to whom Commissioner Lamy referred who told you to what extent negotiations on the Singapore issues were pointlessly weighing down the whole enterprise.
Like MrÂ Lannoye, I do not believe that the WTO is the right forum to deal with several of these issues.
I should simply like to tell you what a shame it would be, today, to do too little too late.
You had first-hand experience of this at the end of the CancÃºn Conference: on the last day, you wanted to indicate that you were prepared to withdraw some of these subjects, but by then the confidence had evaporated and this initiative was not enough to get the discussion back on track.
In fact, today you are agreeing to exclude several of the Singapore issues â investment and competition â from the single undertaking, from the overall agreement, while nevertheless keeping them on the negotiating table for the multilateral agreements that you want to negotiate: in doing so, you will foster mistrust and hostility.
I think that, on the contrary, every effort needs to be made to restore confidence between the European Union and the developing countries.
This provides a hint of the problem that we have when reading your communication.
The feeling is that you are trying to learn the lessons from the failure of CancÃºn, but at the same time you give the impression of only going halfway and of doing so backwards.
It is as if you wanted everything to change provided that everything remains as it is, to use Lampedusaâs words.
For example, you ask to keep your negotiating mandate, which dates back to before Seattle, requesting that modifications be kept to a minimum.
You want to maintain your positions on agriculture.
You want to keep the European Unionâs initial objectives on the liberalisation of developing countriesâ markets and on the liberalisation of services, with, on the latter, a very significant ambiguity on public services, as we have been reminded.
You actually say that they should not be affected, but at the same time you state that you want to liberalise environmental services, which are amongst the most important public services.
Obviously I am thinking of water.
You even make a very questionable assertion.
You say, and I quote, that in your view, âthe WTO is not a structurally unfair system that needs to be rebalanced.â
I think that by making such a statement you are turning your back on the spirit of Doha, which was precisely to recognise in relation to our partners in the developing countries that since the end of the Uruguay Round the trade system had not kept its promises, that it had not worked fairly and benefited the development of all and that it needed to be rebalanced.
In this sense, the Commission communication is marked by positions that threaten to delay resumption of the dialogue.
I am thinking, for example, of the very severe criticism of the system of preferences or the system of special and differential treatment.
The year 2004 must not be a forgotten year.
I am glad that you have taken up your pilgrimâs staff to revive the dialogue with the countries of the G20 and G90.
It is an attitude that is in stark contrast to the speech you made in CancÃºn, which was perceived as very contemptuous by some of these countries.
We need to set a new agenda; we need to rebuild confidence around the Doha Agenda â but an improved Doha Agenda â and around a thorough reform of the WTO, of the way it works, its rules and dogmas, so that this organisation really is at the service of development for everyone.
We therefore need to rebalance this international trading system and not continue to make liberalisation and free trade our sole priority, as these can only be unfair when the various players are so very different.
Â Â  MrÂ President, it is common knowledge that the most recent ministerial conference, in CancÃºn, sadly ended in failure.
It is good, therefore, that the European Commission now wants to take renewed action to get the current negotiations started again.
The proposed development round must not fail; it must be brought to a successful conclusion.
After all, a great deal is at stake.
There is the potential risk of the World Trade Organization and the multilateral trading system becoming completely undermined.
Bilateral and regional trade agreements are not a viable alternative in an increasingly globalised world, and in a system that has contributed to stable and sustained economic growth for almost 55Â years now.
Therefore, it is high time that the welcome discussions on the subject matter were complemented with improvements in WTO working methods.
Negotiating and taking decisions by consensus in a forum with 148Â members requires procedures that are up-to-date, simple and efficient, but at present that is precisely what the WTOâs procedures are not.
It remains my deep-rooted conviction that the WTO is more necessary than ever, because, particularly as far as the European Union is concerned, further liberalisation of world trade and the removal of barriers to trade are the key to increased economic growth and employment.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, the WTO conference in CancÃºn having been a failure, the December meeting of the WTOâs council in Geneva was a non-event, thus, once again, demonstrating that the WTO is in crisis and that the trade policies it practises are no longer sustainable.
Further evidence of this is provided by the growing resistance to WTO trade policy on the part of the international social movement.
The Commission plays a decisive part in the WTOâs current trade policy.
Its tactical approach shows that what really matters to it is not development policy and global fair trade, but only free trade.
You asked whether my group would give you a mandate to do the things you have described.
To that I can only say that we will not.
What would we want to give you a mandate for?
For a start, it is high time that we comply with the demands of many developing countries and proceed with an evaluation of what the WTOâs policies have achieved to date.
Secondly, agricultural export subsidies, which are ruining millions of farmers in the countries of the South, must be done away with once and for all.
Instead of burying developing countries with European agricultural produce at prices that amount to dumping the stuff, the European Union must help these countries to develop sound internal markets and regional economic activity.
Thirdly, the GATS negotiations, which will lead to massive rounds of liberalisation in areas of general-interest service provision that have so far been spared them, must be halted.
This is another instance in which, instead of signalling the beginning of new rounds of liberalisation, the Commission would do better to give more attention to the evaluation of what has been achieved so far.
I will give you a prediction: there will be little on the assets side of the balance sheet where quality, security of provision or price stability are concerned.
Fourthly, there is no need to make changes to what we call the Singapore issues; they simply need to be swept away.
Rather than endlessly extending the WTOâs competences and adding new topics for negotiation to the agenda, the outstanding tasks on the development agenda have to be dealt with.
The WTOâs work must, in particular, get back to focusing on such horizontal tasks as sustainable development and public health.
Fifthly, we need to subject to scrutiny the WTOâs structures and the way it works.
We call for it to become democratic, with transparency in all negotiations, for all its member states to be treated as equals, and for the procedure for settling disputes to be revised.
In particular, we call for the WTO to be a party to the international treaties of the UN and the ILO.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I note that the collapse â and what a dramatic one it was â of the talks in CancÃºn, which should have acted as a kind of electric shock, particularly on the Europeans, has not in fact generated any real basic reflection on the actual nature of the process of liberalising world trade that is underway.
No really novel proposal has been made since then to improve it substantially.
Given the importance of the agricultural issue, it would have been good to consider in particular the relevance of integrating it in a process which, in its current form, does not allow its specificities to be taken into account, despite the fact that it is a sector that determines food sovereignty and constitutes the basis for development.
Given the importance that the European countries have attached to these two parameters, one might have thought that they were the right ones to ask this key question.
This is not the case, as we see.
We deplore this omission because it places a severe strain on the very future of the process.
Â Â  Having reached the time for the votes, we will suspend the debate and continue with it this afternoon.
â Ladies and gentlemen, before beginning the vote, I give the floor to MrÂ ZappalÃ  for a proposal on an issue that we did not resolve at the beginning of yesterdayâs sitting, that is when to vote on his report: on Thursday here in Strasbourg, or during the part-session in Brussels, taking into consideration, however, the fact that, according to our agenda, the debate on this issue is in any event planned for Thursday morning.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, weÂ âÂ and therefore I personally as rapporteurÂ âÂ agree with the request from the Group of the Party of European Socialists to keep, if possible, the debate on Thursday morning at 10Â a.m. and to postpone the voteÂ âÂ which was conclusive at first readingÂ âÂ until the next session, that is to the part-session at the end of the month in Brussels.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, I will be very brief.
This convention is the first global instrument on combating criminal networks to contain universal definitions of fundamental notions of criminal law in the field of the fight against organised crime.
The international community now has a comprehensive instrument with which to fight in a concerted way against the rise in organised crime.
I therefore call on those Member States of the European Union that have not yet ratified this convention to do so quickly.
Â Â  . â Mr President, the Council of the European Union has stated three times in its summit meetings that in the future agriculture will also be able to be practised in those regions that have special problems.
Earning oneâs living from agriculture has considerable importance for those regions, as there is a desire to keep the countryside alive and habitable.
It also has its own cultural and environmental value.
I think it important that any reform in rural policy should take account of the criteria which apply to northern agricultural areas.
In my report I propose that the Commission should lay down clear definitions and criteria, based on climate, the length of the growing season, low population density and outlying position, so as to ensure that the permanent handicaps of northern agricultural regions can be taken into account.
My basic premise is that the range of measures under the common agricultural policy must be developed in a way that takes the special conditions prevailing in northern agricultural areas into greater consideration.
One idea is to regionalise the CAP and make it more flexible, so that it can identify more effectively than at present the preconditions required to enable farms operating in different areas to compete on an equal footing in the single market.
Â Â  â Mr President, I regret having reacted too slowly.
I wish to remove my name from the Breyer report in view of the decision by the majority in this House to support nuclear power stations in the course of construction within and outside the EU, which is diametrically opposed to my own position.
I would therefore ask you to have it recorded in the Minutes that I wish to resign as rapporteur for this report.
Â Â  MrÂ Breyer, a rapporteur usually makes this explanation before the final vote, but I can see that we have perhaps proceeded too quickly in the vote.
Your explanation will, however, be recorded in the Minutes.
Â Â  . Despite the obvious diversity inherent in the nature of plants in the area under our consideration, which fundamentally warrants its own Community Institute, for a long time plant varieties have not only been goods to study and consume, and human creative activity has clearly played a role in their development.
Given the multiplicity of industrial property rights at stake in this issue and the specific characteristics inherent therein, I voted in favour because I accept the need, highlighted by the Council and the Commission, to bring the Community system for protecting plant varieties into line with the directive on the legal protection of biotechnological inventions.
The value of legal certainty and of the protection of creators and inventors, the interweaving of these situations and their importance today suggest that the coherence of usersâ rights systems and of cross licences for plant varieties that incorporate patent-protected inventions should be guaranteed.
This harmonisation will in particular guarantee that the holder of a biotechnological patent can use a plant variety that contains his or her invention, when the holder of the plant variety right refuses to grant a contractual licence and when the invention represents significant technical progress of considerable economic interest.
Â Â  . Illegal, unregulated and unreported (IUU fishing) a highly destructive practice, a mode of fishing that damages the conservation and sustainable management of fish stocks.
Tuna fishing is one of the types of fishing worst affected by these illegal practices.
It should be added that Community fleets are among the largest exploiters of these stocks.
In this context, the EU has played a leading role in combating this type of fishing, specifically by fighting against flags of convenience.
These measures are, however, clearly proving to be inadequate.
In Portugal, especially on the coast of the Algarve, we are extremely familiar with IUU fishing, but I will not repeat accusations that I have already made in this House.
I do support this report, however, which in my opinion will both help to preserve fish stocks and to bring some calm to Community waters.
I support this report because it urges Member States to make efforts to prevent their nationals from taking part in illegal fishing activities.
I congratulate Mrs McKenna on this report which, when implemented, could effectively solve problems with which we are all familiar, even though we are finding it hard to combat them.
Â Â  . The issue before us concerns the apt proposal to update a Community regulation that brings together the control measures agreed by the various Regional Fisheries Organizations (RFOs).
Since the regulationâs adoption, the RFOs have adopted new measures, which must be transposed into Community law.
In particular, the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT, an RFO that has played a leading role in combating illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing, now proposes a package of measures with which to confront this destructive practice, concentrating on fishing undertaken by vessels flying flags of convenience.
Another situation that needs to be remedied is the poor quality of the data submitted by the flag countries which, apart from being one of the most fundamental obligations of the flag country, makes any assessment of stocks less reliable.
Since Community vessels constitute one of the main fleets fishing for these stocks, the EU must adopt a responsible stance and lead by example.
I join the rapporteur in welcoming the efforts made by ICCAT to address these problems in its field of regulation, accepting a stance that will inspire other RFOs and other international developments in this field.
I supported this report and voted in favour of it.
Â Â  . I support this excellent report by Mr Pirker, which proposes a reshaping of the 1997 Joint Action, with a view to combating new synthetic drugs more rapidly and effectively.
We face the problem of a steady increase in the manufacture and trade in synthetic drugs and rigorous and effective forms of control must be put in place as a matter of urgency.
This proposal seeks both to update this Joint Action and, at the same time, to ensure greater transparency and to extend the Joint Actionâs scope as regards exchanging information, risk assessment and the control of new synthetic drugs.
This has been an extremely effective instrument for ensuring a rapid exchange of information and the scope is now extended to all new synthetic drugs and narcotic drugs, including those likely to be defined as medicinal products.
We should also welcome the fact that the structures are to be simplified, as the rapporteur proposes, so as to ensure that information exchanges and risk assessments are carried out as simply and effectively as possible.
We hope that the Joint Action does not confine itself to operating simply as a rapid-response mechanism but also serves, in future, to provide long-term monitoring of synthetic substances through a constant exchange of information between the Member States, Europol and the EMCDDA.
Â Â  .
This largely technical report seeks to update and extend the scope of the Joint Action and to improve the exchange of information, risk assessment and control of synthetic drugs and narcotic drugs on the basis of current procedures such as the âearly-warning systemâ, the mechanism for assessing the social risks to health, amongst other things â by a scientific committee â and the procedure of monitoring by Member States.
It is hoped that, in future, we will not simply implement the rapid response mechanism but new synthetic drugs will also be monitored, in the long term, by means of an ongoing procedure for exchanging information.
I share my groupâs view of the rapporteurâs intention in highlighting the aim of simplifying the structure of information exchanges, proposing a set of amendments that seeks to make the entire process more effective.
Consequently, this report broadly warrants our support.
Â Â  . The Commission proposal seeks to update, enhance and extend the Joint Action of June 1997, on exchanging information, risk assessment and the control of new synthetic drugs through Europol and the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA).
Coordinating on three aspects â a early-warning system, risk assessment by a scientific committee, EU action to subject notified substances to control measures in the Member States â the Joint Action has proved its effectiveness, fully justifying its existence and the clarification procedures, and I, like the rapporteur, welcome extending its scope to new drugs and the introduction of deadlines for each stage of the procedure.
Given that it won a broad majority in the specialist Parliamentary committee, this proposal, with the amendments tabled to it by the rapporteur, responds to the desires of those who have not renounced the war on drugs, or opted for the path of least resistance, which removes any accountability.
I voted in favour because I believe that this is an area of key importance to the future of Member State communities, particularly amongst young people, which fully justifies closely coordinated actions that will enable a rapid reaction and effective monitoring of the nature, origin, trafficking and consumption of new narcotic drugs and new synthetic drugs.
Â Â  . I welcome the European Communityâs conclusion of the International Convention against organised crime, in other words, the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime and the protocols thereto against trafficking in persons and the smuggling of migrants.
This extremely important convention is the first legally binding United Nations instrument in this field and constitutes the first global instrument designed to combat criminal networks, laying down universal definitions of certain fundamental criminal law concepts relating to the fight against organised crime.
The widest possible cooperation is required, based on common procedures and minimum harmonisation of legal standards.
This is the only way we will be able to fight transnational crime more effectively and prevent criminal networks from exploiting the differences and loopholes that exist in the legislation of the Member States.
This Convention must enable signatory states to cooperate more effectively in fighting organised crime by harmonising definitions of individual offences in the different national legal systems.
There will be four types of serious offence: involvement in an organised criminal network, money laundering, obstruction of justice and corruption.
Â Â  . Given the extremely poor living conditions of millions and millions of migrants and victims of trafficking in human beings throughout the world and in Europe, who are forced to endure situations of unacceptable exploitation and humiliation, without any rights, I welcome the Councilâs conclusion of the agreement on the UN Convention against organised transnational crime and the protocols thereto against the trafficking of persons and the smuggling of migrants.
This is an instrument of international law that will contribute to closer cooperation between countries in the fight against organised crime, in particular by harmonising the definition of offences (involvement in an organised criminal network, money laundering, obstruction of justice and corruption), through measures including mutual legal assistance and joint investigations.
The protocols, for their part, are designed to enable measures to be developed to combat trafficking in human beings in particular women and children thereby protecting such people against slavery, sexual exploitation and illegal employment.
These measures include providing victims with assistance and support.
These are measures that need to be implemented urgently and effectively, and absolutely must be complemented by other policies to combat the deep-rooted societal causes of todayâs organised economic crime, from financial crime to the exploitation of men, women and children.
Â Â  .
Conservative MEPs support cooperation on issues of transnational organised crime on an intergovernmental basis within the framework of the UN.
However, we cannot support the growing trend for harmonisation of criminal law at a European level as this is unnecessary and impractical.
Because of this, we will abstain on this report.
Â Â  . The United Nations Convention is intended to enable signatory countries to cooperate effectively in fighting organised crime, by harmonising the definition of crimes in the various national legal systems, so that an act constituting an offence in one signatory State is also considered to be an offence in the other signatory countries.
In this context, this will be the first global instrument for combating criminal networks, which will provide universal definitions of certain fundamental concepts of criminal law in the fight against organised crime.
This will also be the first legally binding United Nations instrument in this field.
As regards the two Protocols, these set out rigorous measures designed to combat trafficking in human beings in particular women and children thereby protecting such persons from slavery, sexual exploitation and illegal employment.
It should be noted in this context that measures are included to provide both legal and material assistance to victims of trafficking.
ArticleÂ 6 consequently obliges signatory States not only to ensure that information is provided on the judicial and administrative procedures in force, but also to adopt measures designed to ensure the physical and psychological recovery of the victims of trafficking.
Given the importance of the issues at stake, and the genuinely pioneering nature of this Convention, my vote could only be favourable.
Â Â  . I support this initiative and stress the urgent need to adopt a set of regulations on protecting the environment through criminal law.
Various environmental disasters have occurred, such as the recent sinking of the , off the coast of Galicia.
The necessary measures must be adopted on pollution by ships, in order to prevent this type of disaster from reoccurring.
I agree with the rapporteurâs statement that the proposal for a directive on protecting the environment through criminal law must be adopted as swiftly as possible, because it provides for the harmonisation of criminal and other deterrent sanctions applicable to acts of pollution which infringe Community law.
This Framework Decision is intended to strengthen this criminal law framework with measures designed to harmonise Member Statesâ legislative and regulatory provisions on the crime of ship-source pollution, to provide jurisdictional competence (by preventing conflicts of competence) and to promote cooperation between Member States (by establishing contact points for exchanging information).
We must end the variation in current levels of sanctions, which ultimately creates distortions in terms of the potential consequences, in particular the financial consequences, of an incident of pollution for the place in which it occurs, because this pollution might affect several Member States of the Union.
Â Â  . Conservative MEPs believe that ship-source pollution is a problem which must be tackled.
We agree with some of the measures proposed in the report, including the establishment of joint investigation teams.
However, we cannot support the growing trend for harmonisation of criminal law within the EU and cannot therefore support this report.
Â Â  .In light of both the oil tanker disaster and of the proposal adopted by this House, at the initiative of the signatory, to create a Community programme aimed exclusively at developing mechanisms to protect the EUâs external borders, in particular its maritime borders, I have followed this debate with great interest.
Any measures taken in the name of maritime safety are to be welcomed and correspond to a correctly identified general need.
It is appropriate to focus not only on accidents but also on the main sources of maritime pollution, which are the systematic contraventions of legislation in this field.
This also displays political awareness of the environmental problems affecting us.
I therefore voted in favour of the reports on maritime safety, with the exception of the Pex report, as I do not agree with the rapporteurâs proposal to create a European Coastguard.
The EU has an obligation to promote maritime safety and must not, under any circumstances, be relieved of this obligation.
The creation of a European Coastguard would be a step too far, however.
We would be better advised to encourage closer cooperation between Member States, which would in turn foster greater interoperability and compatibility of the resources available at intra-European level and would avoid wasteful duplication and overlapping.
Â Â  With regard to Amendment No 22, we believe it is extremely important to take measures against environmental offences at sea.
We welcome increased European cooperation between the national coastguards when it comes to common operations, planning and the development of competences.
We do not therefore believe that there is any need to develop a new, parallel organisation at European level.
We look forward to the work of the European Maritime Safety Agency.
Â Â  . â I voted in favour of the Pex report, which is a major step forward in the fight to improve maritime safety.
Do I need to remind you that every year more than 6 million tonnes of polluting waste is deliberately discharged into the sea?
It is vital that we fight with determination against the hooligans of the sea who use the oceans as a rubbish dump!
Polluters should be severely punished and all of the parties involved in the transport of goods should be made aware of their responsibilities.
Prevention is better than cure.
The fight against these unscrupulous people therefore needs to be more effective and better reflect reality.
The number of people caught in the act is actually minimal compared with the real number of deliberate acts of pollution.
In addition, there is often a long procedure before judgment is passed on them and heavy penalties are imposed â which is not always the case â to deter them from reoffending.
As a first step, I support cooperation between the maritime police forces of the various coastal States.
Subsequently, a joint European coastguard service could be set up, provided that it is subject to strict controls on its efficiency.
Â Â  . This report forms part of the package of proposals on maritime safety, put together following the disaster of the oil tanker.
It should be noted that maritime pollution by oil tankers does not occur only as the result of accidents; it is also caused by illegal discharges.
For this reason, the proposal seeks to incorporate into Community law the existing international rules governing discharges â such as the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) â and to provide guidance concerning the nature of the penalties to be imposed.
We must recall, however, that this battle will not be won through further legislation alone; this legislation must be effectively implemented and monitored, which requires the appropriate means.
I reject the proposal to create a European coast guard (Amendment NoÂ 6), not only because of the issues of sovereignty that it raises, but also because it is not the best solution for ensuring compliance with laws and monitoring and nor does it respond to the fundamental issue of resources.
This proposal consequently contains broader ideas than simply combating pollution.
What is needed is effective cooperation and exchanges of information between the various national coast guards and to ensure that each Member State provides the appropriate funding of resources for monitoring and combating maritime pollution â and here the Community budget could make a significant contribution.
Â Â  . Conservative MEPs broadly welcome the proposals to put in place legislation under which those responsible for unlawful oil or chemical discharges from ships can be prosecuted.
The UK already has criminal sanctions in place for unlawful discharges as specified in the MARPOL Convention and, as such, matters relating to criminal law should fall within the competence of the Member State and not the Community.
We do not believe, however, that the introduction of a European Coastguard is either practical or necessary, since it is inconsistent with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.
For this reason we were unable to support amendments calling for the creation of a European Coastguard.
Â Â  .In light of both the oil tanker disaster and of the proposal approved by this House, at the initiative of the signatory, to create a Community programme aimed exclusively at developing mechanisms to protect the EUâs external borders, in particular its maritime borders, I have followed this debate with great interest.
Any measures taken in the name of maritime safety are to be welcomed and correspond to a correctly identified general need.
It is appropriate to focus not only on accidents but also on the main sources of maritime pollution, which are the systematic contraventions of legislation in this field.
This also displays political awareness of the environmental problems affecting us.
I therefore voted in favour of the reports on maritime safety, with the exception of the Pex report, as I do not agree with the rapporteurâs proposal to create a European Coastguard.
The EU has an obligation to promote maritime safety and must not, under any circumstances, be relieved of this obligation.
The creation of a European Coastguard would be a step too far, however.
We would be better advised to encourage closer cooperation between Member States, which would in turn foster greater interoperability and compatibility of the resources available at intra-European level and would avoid wasteful duplication and overlapping.
Â Â  . Mindful of the consequences of the ecological disaster caused by the stricken oil tanker in November 2002 I believe that the appalling damage caused by illegal discharges of oil or other noxious liquid substances, endanger communities and the environment and must consequently be subject to criminal sanctions.
The âpolluter paysâ principle must apply in this matter, following the approval last December of a recommendation for a Directive that sets out tougher EU rules on environmental liability.
From a strictly legal perspective, however, I believe that this situation is far from simple, given that the proposed Directive is based on Article 80 relating to transport, although it also a matter of defining a crime.
It is, therefore, legitimate to question the appropriateness of the procedure.
I also have certain reservations concerning the creation of a European Coastguard, since this is the prerogative of the Member-States, without prejudice to very close intergovernmental cooperation or to Community responsibility regarding equipment and modern and effective measures.
Although I am unreservedly in favour of the final aims, I had no choice but to abstain because I feel that this matter merits further consideration, in order to find a technical solution to this serious problem.
Â Â  Each year, thousands of deliberate discharges take place through waste and cargo residues, including chemicals and oil, being dumped in the sea.
The need for common legislation within this environmental area is therefore indisputable.
It has not, however, been demonstrated, and still less proved, that the most suitable and effective method of coping with these breaches of the law is to set up a further European agency or common EU coastguard.
