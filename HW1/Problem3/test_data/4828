Finally, I should like to note that our Commissioner Busquin displayed a great deal of forward thinking when he established the Sixth Framework Programme in this manner and guided it in the direction of a European Research Area.
He particularly played a pioneering role in Barcelona when he persuaded the Member States to make joint efforts in order to get industry, the national governments and the European Union ultimately to commit to 3% of GNP for research.
This is when actual jobs are created in Europe, this is when dedication for a competitive Europe is evident, and I would thank the Commissioner for this forward thinking.
You should see this programme in that light too.
It is essential that all groups give their full support to this programme tomorrow so that it can be implemented at the earliest opportunity.
Mr President, a basic political problem has overshadowed all our debates over recent months: how to resolve the structural weaknesses in all areas of research in Europe.
I think that, together, we can find suitable solutions which will ensure that the European Union can safeguard the future and respond to its citizens' expectations, given that today's European economies and societies are going for knowledge-based development.
As far as the specific programme for structuring the European Research Area is concerned, the Commission proposal did in fact contain all the ingredients we needed to identify sensitive points and I am grateful for the cooperation we enjoyed in committee and, vitally, from the Committee on Industry.
As luck would have it, the Barcelona Council approved the Commission proposal on increasing overall expenditure on research during the course of our work.
This was encouraging and came just at the right time.
These are a few of the basic points I should like to comment on: inter- and multidisciplinarity, which is, I think, crucial if we are to break traditional moulds and move on to more daring, innovative plans, to move into new research areas, rather than mere collaboration between various research areas.
I think that, if we move in this direction, we shall release creative powers which will allow us Europeans to beat other forces in this field in the forthcoming race for international competitiveness.
The second point is collaboration between and the mobility of researchers.
Attracting new researchers and overcoming obstacles is something which concerns not just the countries of Europe but candidate and third countries as well.
I think that the Marie Curie fellowships will help here, which is why we are calling for the Commission to monitor mobility, so that the European Parliament has reliable statistics over coming years.
Europe has much to gain from researchers from third countries.
Not only must we avoid underestimating the importance of fellowships to them; I think we must also make some kind of commitment.
And if I reiterate this issue, Commissioner, it is because I think that you agree on its importance.
The third point is the European Higher Education Area.
Research and higher education have mutual benefits and are interconnected vessels.
There is, of course, a degree of competition, the question of teaching rights.
But I think that the Bologna procedure and the common initiative we are waiting for from Commissioners Busquin, Liikanen and Reding will be of immense interest here.
Society and science: the fears and expectations of European citizens from research and science are greater now than ever.
Not only do we need more systematic public dialogue, but this public dialogue needs to be structured so that it has a real impact on our society, provides food for thought and educates.
Dialogue implies a two-way relationship and should allow European research to understand the needs of our citizens and to respond to social demands, which is why we insisted that social sciences and human sciences take priority.
However, I believe that a great deal of work still needs to be done in the society and science area, mainly strategic, structural planning.
Finally, I should like to believe that, politically, we have done what we could, cautiously and by common assent, and have resolved some of the problems before us.
From now on, as far as implementation is concerned, the Commission now has the baton, although the research community will play the leading role in applying the programme and we trust that it will not gainsay our political choices.
Mr President, the specific programme for research and training on nuclear energy provides EUR 940 million for activities in three priority areas - controlled thermonuclear fusion, management of radioactive waste and radiation protection - as well as other activities in the field of nuclear technology and safety.
The bulk of the funds - EUR 750 million - is proposed to be used for nuclear fusion research, with a maximum of EUR 200 million provided for ITER, the Next Step tokamak device.
Subject to a positive outcome of the international negotiations, a specific decision is expected in the period 2003-2004, so that construction of ITER could effectively start during the period 2005-2006.
This will be a major step towards sustained production of energy from nuclear fusion, which is expected to become an efficient source of energy within a few decades.
In view of the limited deposits of fossil fuel, the importance of this development cannot be underestimated.
Consequently, the associated research fully deserves the proposed funding.
Given the fact that the final decision on ITER has not been taken yet, the flexibility in partitioning funds between ITER and other fusion activities is an important element of the proposal.
Other activities within the field of controlled nuclear fusion include the Associations' programme in physics and technology and the exploitation of JET facilities.
The Associations' programme includes, among others, studies of magnetic confinement schemes other than the tokamak, in particular the continuation of the construction of the Wendelstein 7-X "stellarator", research on fusion materials and keeping in touch with civil research activities on inertial confinement and possible alternative concepts.
The Joint European Taurus (JET) in Culham, England, has been a highly successful machine and its facilities will continue to be exploited, but will have to be phased out at an appropriate time to enable the corresponding resources to be redirected to ITER.
Regardless of the future of nuclear fusion reactors, the problem of radioactive waste - in particular long-lived waste - will be with us for several thousands of years.
Consequently, it is only by an increase of the research efforts that we may hope to decrease the dangers emanating from them.
The specific programme provides for EUR 90 million to be used for research on geological disposal and the development of concepts to produce less waste.
Radiation protection takes up to EUR 50 million.
Finally, the chapter of "other activities" covers the evaluation of innovative concepts and the development of improved and safer nuclear energy processes, education and training in radiation protection, improvement of the safety of existing installations, for a total of EUR 50 million.
The Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy welcomes the Commission's proposal and expresses its support for fusion research in general and ITER in particular.
A European site for ITER will confirm the worldwide leadership of the European Union in fusion technology, acquired through, among other things, the JET facilities, which should not be abandoned before exhausting its capabilities.
A number of amendments proposed by our committee refer to nuclear waste and nuclear safety.
Ways of dealing with waste should be not only acceptable to society, but also intrinsically safe.
At this point, I should like to point out that there is a mistake in the French translation of Amendment No 4, where the original English text "both safe and acceptable" has been transmuted into "both healthy and acceptable".
Could the President ensure that this is corrected?
The research on interim disposal, waste characterisation and waste packaging, should be funded, together with research on geological disposal.
Research on innovative concepts and techniques that produce less waste should include the high-temperature reactor, light-water reactors, gas-cooled reactors, fast reactor technologies and co-generation.
Overall, the adoption of the report by the Committee on Industry will mark an important step towards more efficient and safer nuclear energy.
Mr President, Commissioner Busquin, ladies and gentlemen, my report deals with the direct actions for the European Atomic Energy Community that are implemented and realised in the Joint Research Centre and in its installations at Ispra, Petten, Geel, Mol and Karlsruhe.
This specific programme has several focal points, the policy objectives of which I would like to discuss in detail now.
I will start, though, by saying a bit about education and training.
Both advocates of atomic energy and its critics will surely agree that it is very important that an adequate number of young and superbly-qualified workers in the field of nuclear research in Europe should make an active contribution, by their research over the coming decades, to ensuring nuclear safety in the operational nuclear power stations and also, if need be, controlling the fuel cycle where this is a source of risk.
The same applies to the safe storage of nuclear waste over the next few decades, and to its being able to be decontaminated as soon as possible.
That is why it is important to maintain the Joint Research Centre's high standards and build on its research capacity by training young scientists on courses and scientific practical placements which can, inter alia, be carried on in networks of international, national and regional facilities at the various levels.
More needs to be said about the general principles, but I do not want to go over the details again, as we had an in-depth discussion of them in the Sixth Framework Programme.
However, there are two principles to which I want to give particular attention. The first principle is adherence to general ethical guidelines, which are also binding on EU researchers, and especially Euratom's.
The public acceptability of research in the Member States plays an important part in this.
You will be aware, Commissioner, of the misgivings that remain as regards some areas of scientific research, biotechnology for example.
Secondly, adherence to the principle that women researchers should have equal opportunities.
This relates both to their training and also to the award of important research contracts, whether these are to be carried out by researchers acting on their own or in a team.
Now for the Joint Research Centre's specific objectives.
I see research's principal contribution as being to the safety of the atomic power stations and of their fuel cycle.
Europe's citizens can demand that the safety of atomic power stations meets the highest standards even in an enlarged European Union.
The stringent western European rules, which the Member States have framed in exacting terms, but which have not to date been harmonised, must be recapitulated as part of the acquis communautaire and must also apply to the atomic power stations in the central and eastern European candidate countries.
The Joint Research Centre's expertise and the results of its research and that of the national authorities in the European Union should be drawn on in establishing a European code of nuclear safety, which should be ratified before enlargement takes place, enabling it to be put before the candidate countries as being valid in law.
The candidate countries would have to accept this code as part of the acquis communautaire before their accession and would then have to put it into practice.
The Commission, especially Vice-President De Palacio, gave these ideas from the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy a favourable reception and supported them.
I also assume that you yourself will welcome these suggestions.
It is, then, our desire that a Commission proposal on this topic be submitted as early as this summer.
To take an example, the continued operation of the as yet unmodified atomic power station at Ignalina in Lithuania is not acceptable.
Another possibility would of course be for it to be decommissioned before Lithuania joins the European Union.
Taken as a whole, the European Union and the Joint Research Centre have a great deal of research capacity to hand in the field of nuclear safety.
Maintaining that capacity for decades is a safety requirement for the public, who have to be able to live in safety, protected from the radioactivity from nuclear waste.
The second is the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and, of course, of fissile materials.
The safeguards in the Euratom Treaty do indeed provide for this control, but it must also be extended, by means of the whole range of expertise within the Joint Research Centre, to the non-proliferation of fissile materials, which can of course also be used in terrorist attacks.
Thefts like those which have recently occurred in Germany are a warning signal in this respect.
This of course applies equally to the tracking down of stolen nuclear material and its safe storage.
I will conclude by highlighting the cooperation between the Joint Research Centre and the medical sector's national and regional research centres, for example the cancer research carried on by the Institute for Transuranium Elements jointly with the German Cancer Research Centre.
Mr President, I am going to be presenting the non-nuclear section of the report on the Joint Research Centre (JRC), which represents two thirds of its budget.
In the Sixth Framework Programme, the Joint Research Centre will be refocusing its activities so as to strengthen its organisational role and participate usefully in the European Research Area.
Its work programme has three distinguishing characteristics: concentration, openness and networking, and consumer-orientation.
To this end, the Joint Research Centre has restructured its non-nuclear activities around two main areas, supported by specialist skills: food, chemical products and health, and sustainable environment and development.
These areas will be supplemented by horizontal activities: technology foresight, reference materials and measurements, and public security and anti-fraud.
The total budget allocated to the JRC's activities stands at EUR 760 million.
Its decision to adopt this new strategy and restructure its services was inspired by a report published last year by a high-level working party chaired by Ãtienne Davignon.
These changes are intended to make the Joint Research Centre better adapted to the needs of political decision-makers and privileged users: the Council, Commission Directorates-General and Parliament.
The JRC will also be active in giving impetus to the European Research Area and the Sixth Framework Programme.
It will work on setting up a Community system to harmonise measurements and will participate in European and global networks.
The JRC will be a high-profile player throughout the implementation of the Sixth Framework Programme, in terms of participating in both networks of excellence and integrated projects.
It will be able to make an active contribution to developing the new European citizenship by providing a common knowledge base of scientific and technological references and by facilitating dialogue between scientists and decision-makers.
It will also be expected to help with the 'operational' implementation of the new tools, including the stairways of excellence - as far as it is competent to do so, of course - and with integrating research into local development.
In certain thematic areas, proposals from the Joint Research Centre would appear to be essential for specifying the public contracts that may be awarded, for example in the sustainable development sector.
This sector encompasses all of the issues relating to ecosystems.
For example, the JRC has spent more than a year and a half working on establishing the criteria for ecosites and will help to set up a European network.
This also applies to food safety, where the JRC will help to establish a reference and standardisation system, and to the protection of individual privacy in information and communication technologies.
The Joint Research Centre's role as an advisor on European policy needs to be enhanced.
It is improving networking and cooperation with public and private institutions in the Member States.
It is also finalising a human resources and mobility plan, which involves in particular training young scientists and arranging exchanges with national research institutions.
The point is not that it should become a research centre competing with other centres to research the scientific questions at issue in several Member States, but that it should ensure linkage between these centres when it comes to implementing the results and achieving the objectives of European directives. In the same way, the Commission must be able to turn to it for the most rapid response possible.
It therefore needs to have teams that are capable of adjusting readily to requests made and reacting immediately.
To do so, they must have knowledge of their fields permanently at their fingertips, keep up to date with upstream research, and even carry out additional research in areas that have not been covered by the national institutes.
The JRC has an important part to play in the process of opening the programme up to the accession countries, to the countries of the Mediterranean region and to those involved in international cooperation under the MEDA and TACIS programmes.
Let us not forget either the role of mediator that the Joint Research Centre has been called to play in the risk-management sector, on issues such as risk exposure, impact assessment, damages, and nuclear safety and waste problems, creating synergy in particular with the initiatives launched under the EUR-OPA Major Risks programme.
The Centre should further develop its work on implementing practical projects on saving energy, in particular in the construction sector, and on renewable energies.
It must not confine itself to research on photovoltaic energy, but must also promote demonstration projects in other areas, such as wind energy.
It might also monitor the assessment of the introduction of fuel cells.
Given the growing popularity of organic food products and traditional, locally-grown produce, the JRC will develop methods to ensure their authenticity and quality.
It will also study ways of optimising their impact on the environment and local development.
Finally, to make it possible for us to provide better guidance and if necessary to refocus particular studies in accordance with political developments on science, I think that it would be desirable for a monitoring committee to be set up that is in contact with Parliament, so that we would be kept abreast of its activities on a more regular basis, which would allow us to build on the fruitful exchanges we have had so far.
In conclusion, the Joint Research Centre's main objectives will therefore be to remain close to its users - the European Parliament and the Commission - to develop its role as a recognised centre of excellence on issues of safety, health and the environment, and to develop its activities as a promoter of research networks.
The Joint Research Centre can therefore be expected to make a success of its commitment to reform and to justify its unique position within the European Commission. I should like to thank Commissioner Busquin and his services for having done all they could to help us to prepare this report and its conclusions which we are presenting to you today.
Mr President, I shall refer to five reports - and two minutes times five makes ten!
I readily concede, though, that atomic power and nuclear energy do not affect agriculture to that great a degree if we disregard the wind, which has just been mentioned.
I will therefore try to keep my comments brief.
It is on the basis of principle that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development regrets that there is no specifically agricultural core area in the Sixth Framework Programme, but that projects are divided up between the chapters on food safety, protection of the environment and development.
What makes that all the more regrettable is that we claim to have a multifunctional approach to agricultural policy, with a concern to highlight the interaction between the technical, economic, environmental, social and cultural dimensions.
It would be appropriate for it to have a research package to itself as, in terms of extent and practical implementation, agriculture is, along with atomic energy and pharmaceuticals, one of the major areas in which the results of research are put to use.
Moreover, research in the area of agriculture and new technologies always essentially has to do with issues of genetic engineering, biotechnology being a much broader area in that it includes the production of both butter and beer.
Let it not be thought that research is only just beginning - it was indispensable to past generations' means to live and enjoy life, and indeed to those of our own generation, and that far more so than new technology would have us believe.
If we are to talk about food safety in connection with new technologies, then it certainly offers an opportunity to explore the possibilities of the secure supply of safe food and to make a contribution to this.
It must be clear to us as well, though, that new technologies can endanger food safety.
When there are problems in the food sector, we often find that they have to do with these new technologies. for example, research into the use of seeds is not, or at least not primarily, concerned with the development of resistance; rather, attempts are made to use gene manipulation to bring about the creation of resistance, mainly even to build up resistance to plant protection in the synthetic sector.
There is, though, not only the chemical sector, but also the organic sector.
If only this were about getting research to investigate natural substances with a view to finding potential ways of protecting plants.
If only this were about improving resistance in seed by means of research into the natural process of seed development, and not so much about mapping out core areas in the new field of genetic engineering.
On the other hand, we have the problem that the use of the new genetic engineering leads to contamination, which researchers for the firms that operate in this area had initially ruled out.
The crossover of genetically modified rape onto a related weed was formerly considered impossible, yet now it has happened.
Now, we also find transference from applications in conventional sectors into the organic sector, where it is banned and ruled out by current European Union legislation, and contamination of the latter by the former.
Organic businesses are not allowed to work with genetically modified organisms, so more research seems to be needed into how research into genetic engineering can be prevented from contaminating other areas.
Little has been done other than to put forward theories.
As you can see, agriculture generates a whole lot of issues.
Speaking as I do on the committee's behalf, I make it clear that we are very definitely not opposed to new technological developments.
We are only against the risks inherent in the application of something that research has produced.
I have listed a number of points.
What matters is that the risk in the application is not passed on to the farmers and, in the course of food production, on to the consumers. As we have prescribed in the atomic energy sector, there must, rather, also be damage limitation and assessment of the damage and risks involved in practical applications and of what harm biotransfer can do to other sectors, so that we are not always only learning from our own mistakes but benefiting from research that can give us advance warning of potential risks.
Thank you, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf.
You have indeed said what had to be said well within the time allocated.
Mr President, Mrs Zorba's report is very sensible and the PPE-DE Group will support it and almost all the amendments by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy.
These add to the Commission's impressive project of developing a valid European research area.
The only amendments we will oppose are No 6, - which excludes European funding for research aimed at military purposes.
We do not look for research specifically aimed at military ends, but research might have military as well as civilian applications, for example research into new materials.
By including this prohibition clause, there could be unnecessary impediments to genuinely beneficial research projects.
We also prefer the committee's Amendment No 24, regarding the budget, to Mrs Zorba's Amendment No 26, which specifies an amount for the Marie Curie International Fellowships.
It is surely better to leave the EUR 1.630 billion for human resources unspecified, so that there is more flexibility.
We certainly have nothing against the Marie Curie fellowships.
Our group has tabled a clarifying Amendment No 25 which specifies that participation will be permitted by those who hold doctoral degrees where those degrees were obtained in three, rather than four, years.
I trust that Mrs Zorba will accept that this is a sensible clarification.
I would like to concentrate on the specific programme for science and society, which is essential for re-establishing the necessary level of trust and mutual understanding between the scientific community and civil society at large.
This is vital if Europe's research effort is to be supported widely and with continuity and thereby realise its full potential.
We have seen a lamentable breakdown in this relationship, perhaps as a result of faulty assertions by scientists and politicians in previous crises.
Perhaps it is even more attributable to a lack of willingness by science and industry to communicate clearly and systematically.
Our hope is that this programme will promote much improved communication and that the public will be much better informed about the objectives, the results, the applications, the achievements, the recognition of the ethical and environmental constraints and the practical usefulness of scientific endeavour.
We hope, above all, that more young people will be attracted to science as a career.
We badly need them for all our futures.
We wish Mr Busquin, his team and this programme well.
Mr President, I should like to congratulate the five rapporteurs and the Commission, who have steadfastly showed their willingness to listen to the European Parliament, both in the Caudron report and since.
I will speak briefly about each of the reports.
First of all, I welcome Mr van Velzen's emphasis on life sciences other than genomics and his advocacy of translational research, which means rapid transposition into clinical applications.
This is something which will appeal to the public.
I also welcome our amendment, which adds nanosciences to nanotechnology.
The recent excellent STOA report on nanotechnologies makes it clear that we are still at the stage of nanoscience.
That must be emphasised.
As far as aeronautics is concerned, I am glad that there will be some attention to the health of passengers.
I support our amendment on space science.
Indeed I would like more attention to the big science projects in the European research area outside the framework programme.
Of course I support Parliament's new emphasis on health and safety at work.
I support Mrs Zorba's conclusions.
Like her, I was delighted with the increase in funding for science and society.
However, I agree with her that some funding should come from the priority thematic areas for the science and society implications.
Multidisciplinary research, yes; a European higher education area, with the synergies that implies for the European research area.
We should be training people in research management and ethics.
Mr PiÃ©trasanta has made an excellent analysis of the new tasks of the JRC as a technical reference body and a support mechanism for decision-making.
I greatly welcome his emphasis on the need for monitoring and the need for the European Parliament to be involved in such monitoring - not just in the JRC.
As far as Mr Alyssandrakis' report is concerned, I would welcome a breakthrough in fusion research, not least because it is far less dangerous than nuclear fission and we need to have an alternative to that form of energy.
I am fairly sceptical about whether or not ITER will proceed within this framework programme, but we will see.
Every citizen wants action on radioactive waste.
The Royal Society in the UK emphasised that recently.
It has not been solved yet.
I am a great advocate of transmutation and partitioning and welcome any support that can be given to those technologies.
I am not, however, a supporter of spending EU money on research into new reactors.
This is something that should be funded by the nuclear industry itself.
We are not in the business of giving industrial aid to that particular sector.
That is not what the public is calling for.
As far as Mr Schwaiger is concerned, he is absolutely right to say that we must have, before long, some sort of aquis communautaire in the sector of nuclear safety.
So congratulations to everyone for their good work and cooperation and good luck to all our scientists.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to thank all the rapporteurs, the Spanish Presidency and, naturally, the Commission for the pleasant and efficient cooperation, as a result of which we have completed the total package of the Sixth Framework Programme this week after all.
This will receive the unqualified support of the Liberal Group.
Europe must become more innovative.
Research results must be translated into new products.
The Sixth Framework Programme offers the opportunities to do this, especially by deploying new instruments so that, for example, multi-disciplinary teams within integrated projects can work together.
Innovations mainly take place on the cutting edge of disciplines, and it is important in this respect to clarify how the integrated projects will be implemented and how the loose ends will be tied up from an administrative point of view.
For clarity is still completely lacking in this field.
The Commission therefore has an important task to fulfil. An area of attention in this respect is the late payments by the Commission, which can thus cause huge problems for projects and innovation.
I am delighted with the budget for information and communication technology of EUR 3 600.
After all, ICT, being a horizontal technology, makes a huge contribution to innovation within all other disciplines.
My proposal to increase the budget for the participation of small and medium-size companies to 15% has been adopted by the Commission and the Council, and this underlines the importance of small companies in terms of dynamism in our economy and employment.
This participation, however, should, according to the Liberal Group, feature within thematic programmes.
This would guarantee cooperation between large and small companies, for small companies lack the know-how and the manpower to go it alone.
It is not acceptable for the best part of the limited research budget that is available to be used for flanking policy by the Commission, since that is not a European task.
With regard to the Joint Research Centre, I should like to comment on its tasks in relation to nuclear safety, currently a very controversial topic in the Union.
For what transpires?
The acceding Member States boast a large number of nuclear power plants which do not meet our safety standards.
Eight nuclear power plants have now been closed.
It is, in fact, very odd that we in Europe have high safety standards for our water intended for swimming in, as Mrs De Palacio pointed out recently, but that there is still no joint approach in the field of nuclear safety.
Binding rules across the EU are essential.
As we cannot distinguish between the current and acceding Member States, it is necessary to amend the Euratom Treaty so that the JRC can complete the tasks imposed on it via this specific programme in a clear, transparent and effective manner.
Mr President, I should like to thank all the rapporteurs for their hard work.
I will confine myself to the nuclear question.
The Euratom Atomic Energy Community was founded in 1957 and is now well past its sell-by date.
It is a closed institution and is regulated solely by the Council.
Codecision with Parliament is excluded.
We really need to change this.
Its separation from other EU norms is also highlighted by Euratom having its own framework for its research programme.
This nuclear technology is the only area to have its own ringfenced budget.
Moreover safety requirements, as Mr Schwaiger has pointed out, are not at all coordinated. This is more than regrettable.
The nuclear fusion budget remains the largest single area - EUR 750 million - of energy research and proposes funds allocated to the development of the next generation of fusion research.
Most experts anticipate that if fusion is ever to achieve commercialisation it will not be for at least another 50 years.
Therefore the fusion budget is a financial black hole in pursuit of an ever-receding holy grail of fusion energy.
Despite around half a century of commercial operation of nuclear reactors, the solution to the long-term management of nuclear waste remains unsolved.
The framework programme for additional funds to research geological disposal of radioactive waste means that EU-funded research for what is effectively a commercial waste problem represents yet another subsidy to the nuclear industry.
This is unacceptable.
Mr President, in the proposal for a Council decision on the Euratom programme of research in the field of nuclear energy, submitted to us by the Commission, I note that the Union's needs appear to have been identified correctly in the short and long term, but that a medium-term vision seems to be completely lacking.
As far as the short term is concerned, the budget should be increased, but the research topics selected are, in any case, relevant.
In fact they are by their very nature essential.
They consist, firstly, of managing ultimate residues and spent fuels: advanced reprocessing and transmutation into products that are less and less radioactive and have shorter and shorter lives.
This is the top priority and it is absolutely essential that we provide the resources necessary to ensure that we deactivate this final waste.
Secondly, they concern the safety of nuclear installations and radiation protection.
Even though European nuclear installations have already demonstrated their high safety standards and are the subject of very rigorous control and environmental protection measures, work on this must continue.
In the long term, by which I mean after 2050, when any oilfields that are easily accessible will be exhausted, it is nuclear fusion that will take over and it is important that Europe is not left behind by its American and Japanese partners in perfecting this technology.
However, the medium-term proposals, the central link between the two, are, paradoxically, completely inadequate, in terms of the funds devoted to research into the new generation of fission reactors that will have to replace those currently in service.
In ten years' time, on average, the reactors that now provide us with heat and light will have reached the end of their lives.
They will therefore have to be replaced by reactors incorporating new designs: high-temperature reactors, new pressurised water reactors and new fast neutron reactors. The latter - I would stress this point - are currently the focus of publicly funded research in the United States, while the previous French Government recklessly abandoned the technology.
This is a field in which Europe is recognised as having genuine expertise - it is a world leader - and our objective has to be to maintain our technological advantage.
We therefore need to invest the necessary research effort.
Our American and Japanese partners have embarked on independent policies and the Union and its Member States, Mr President, must not be left behind.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in essence, all our objectives can be summed up in health well into old age, as well as, at the end of the day, the utilisation of the gigantic research potential of small and medium-sized enterprises.
We know that the JRC focuses its efforts on nutrition, chemical products and health, as well as, in particular, the environment and sustainable development, technology foresight, reference materials and measurements, but also public safety and the combating of fraud.
I would particularly like to thank Mr Schwaiger for pushing so hard for a code of safety standards for atomic power stations, because it is the prevention and containment of accidents that has recently become especially important, and Parliament is agreed that atomic power stations and atomic materials need a specialised approach in order to guarantee their safety in future.
It should also be said that, of the EUR 11 billion allocated to specific priorities, at least 15% must of course be used for research projects for small and medium-sized enterprises, with a special allocation of EUR 430 million for horizontal research projects.
Then there is the 'stairway to excellence', where particular account has to be taken of SMEs, just as European SMEs and European industry will in future work more closely with universities and colleges, institutes of higher education and research organisations.
Finally, there is a need for small and medium-sized enterprises also to be allowed to cooperate with small research groups, newly established and distant research sites and with organisations in the candidate countries.
I believe that it is of vital importance to involve small and medium-sized enterprises, especially in the networks of excellence and in the integrated projects.
We must surely be aware that the 18 million small and medium-sized enterprises in Europe account for two-thirds of the workforce and, in the final analysis, for 80% of tax revenue, a fact which, I believe, entitles them to work closely with others in research and thus help to shape Europe's future.
For us, at the end of the day, good research policy, skilfully applied, makes for the best social policy, for it is always the case that first you have to create the necessary economic conditions, and then you can be generous when distributing the gains.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Busquin, as rapporteur on the sixth RDFP, I should first like to say how pleased I am to see the deadlines for the adoption of the specific programmes being respected.
This will allow the broad guidelines on European research, which we adopted in last May's part-session, to be implemented in the best possible conditions.
Admittedly, the adoption of the rules for participation has been postponed to July.
The tight deadlines - so we have been told - left no alternative.
In any case, the RDFP package - the specific programmes and the rules for participation - will be adopted before the summer recess, which will allow them to be implemented properly on 1 January 2003.
We will therefore be respecting the undertaking that I gave to you back in February 2001, and I am particularly pleased about this.
Turning now to the specific programmes, which are the subject of tonight's debate, I should also like warmly to congratulate the rapporteurs, Mr van Velzen, Mrs Zorba, Mr Alyssandrakis, Mr PiÃ©trasanta and Mr Schwaiger.
Personally, at this stage in the work, I followed progress more particularly on Mr van Velzen's report on the specific programme on the first and third aspects of the RDFP.
Once again, I can testify to the quality of Mr van Velzen's work, all the more so when he had to rework his report several times: he firstly had to take into account the outcome of the votes at the second reading of the RDFP and then had to transfer several of the amendments adopted en bloc at the same vote into the specific programme.
The end result is a report which is absolutely consistent with the results of the votes on the sixth RDFP, and this in three respects, the first being the seven priorities.
There is no point my reminding you of the list, but I will mention in particular the first of these priorities to say that in the specific programme we have better clarified the status of health and the fight against major diseases, separate from research on the genome.
Secondly, the report is consistent in terms of budget.
Parliament very much welcomes the increase in certain budget lines and the inclusion of footnotes giving guidance on allocation within some budget lines, as we requested.
Thirdly, and finally, it is consistent in terms of the transition between the new and old instruments, which had been a source of concern to Parliament and several Member States.
Finally, the report specifies the research areas adopted at an appropriate level of detail.
For example, mine clearance, research into the solar system, doping practices, safety in the workplace and biological agents used by terrorists.
We managed to steer clear of a further debate on the ethical issue.
Some were nevertheless tempted, but common sense won through and the interests of the majority prevailed: I should like to thank all colleagues for this.
I will conclude by praising the excellent spirit of cooperation between the various political groups, the Commission representatives and Commissioner Busquin, the Council and the Spanish Presidency.
Thanks to this we will have adopted, by the appointed time, an excellent work programme that the European scientific community will now be able to implement from 1 January 2003.
Mr President, this is a historic framework programme. For the first time the preparatory work is on schedule - even ahead of schedule - and agreement has already been reached in the first round.
Thanks go to everyone who has been involved.
This time I am particularly interested in Mr Alyssandrakis's report as I myself was the rapporteur of a similar report in the fifth framework programme.
Fusion is the energy solution of the future, and when it becomes established we can forget discussions about the energy deficit, the overly large share of imported energy in Europe, and greenhouse emissions.
The enormous potential associated with fusion means we must make it possible: the more resources we invest, the faster we shall achieve results.
For this reason, the ceiling of EUR 200 million the Commission has set for the ITER programme is misguided.
Hopefully more of us next time will look further into the future and have the courage to set aside more resources for fusion research.
It is in Europe's interests to hold onto ITER.
ITER, if a Member State is to be chosen as its location, will bring a massive increase in know-how to Europe, as well as hardcore technical skills and new technology.
There already exist workable methods for the temporary storage of high-active fuels so there is no need to use the framework programme to finance this sort of research.
For this reason Amendment Nos 7 and 8 should be deleted.
There is a ready-made model for bedrock disposal already in Finland, although new alternatives can always be examined.
Nuclear power research and the issue of safety associated with its proper use are largely one and the same thing.
The Commission has recently indicated a desire to create common, pan-European minimum safety standards. This carries with it its own risks.
Whenever there is harmonisation there is a danger that we will go with the weakest link.
On the other hand we have very good experience of cooperation between authorities.
This way the bad learn from the better, and there is no need for compromises, which the weakest cannot achieve, and which at the same time would lower standards of safety in the most advanced Member States.
Regulators already practise excellent, impartial cooperation.
For this reason I support Amendment No 17.
Any development of harmonised regulatory approaches falls outside the scope of the framework programme.
The responsibility for following western safety regulations rests with the Member States, and responsibility for monitoring rests with that most viable of organisations, the Western European Nuclear Regulatory Association.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, structuring a united and mutually supportive European Research Area is part of building European citizenship and this is the subject of the structured dialogue between science and society that is proposed in this programme.
A dream that I simply want to tack on to this specific programme?
Perhaps.
But above and beyond the dream, in a tangible and precise way, we Members of the European Parliament are thus affirming the existence of Europe with all the strength of the creative intelligence that it holds in reserve, whether in its industry, in its universities or in its researchers, and thanks in particular to their mobility.
It would be inconceivable for us to maintain the obstacle course that researchers have to negotiate on a day-to-day basis so as to gain the space to be able to devote themselves to their actual work, faced with rules and regulations, the minefield that is social security and the administrative mazes for obtaining visas and resolving career problems.
That is why we have a very clear affirmation in these programmes that a vital prerequisite for their successful implementation is mobility: mobility that crosses natural, cultural and economic boundaries, that champions gender equality and that will enable the exchange of research practices.
Perhaps the DG responsible will have to launch a mobility support service very soon: today it is just a freephone number, tomorrow it will be a crossroads towards a Europe on the move.
We should add that upstream it is necessary to develop interdisciplinary doctoral courses that will open up a new concept of the mental, technical and scientific plain on which research is conducted, a concept which meets the expectations and needs of the public.
For the universities it is a strategic challenge to encourage both teaching and research staff to open their minds to this possibility.
Promoting new skills and new attitudes that we need to adopt to place ourselves in the vanguard of research while taking into account the European dimension; taking stock of this potential, of these reservoirs of grey matter, networking them, creating the prolific alchemy of the European Research Area; is this a dream?
No.
Because, building the European Research Area is to rely on the strength and potential of our researchers, on the reservoirs of talent in our universities and schools, on mobility, which opens the way for the exchange of knowledge and expertise, and thus create a powerful catalyst that will make it possible for Europe to exist, to embody the very substance of the European Research Area of this millennium, with the people of Europe, for the people of the world.
Thank you to those who gave us this vision.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to the rapporteurs for the excellent work they have done, and I support these reports.
I give particularly strong support to the reports by Mr van Velzen and Mrs Zorba, which I believe improve on the Commission proposal and take us in the right direction.
I attach great importance to what Mr van Velzen had to say about cancer research, on which European assistance for research must continue to focus.
We fought hard for that when the Framework Programme was going through Parliament, and so we need to underline it again today.
As regards sustainable development, research needs to be used to deal with environmental problems.
I have tabled a number of amendments on this, which have met with the committee's support, for example one on research into sustainable biofuels.
I disagree with what Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf said, and believe that biotechnology can play a thoroughly positive role, in which it would also benefit the environment.
I would just like to say, with reference to the ethical aspect of research, that I urge the Commission to support Amendments Nos 17 to 20.
These were part of the package in the Caudron report, and could give a positive indication that we support those technical solutions that offer alternatives to what has very frequently been a matter of dispute here in Parliament.
So this would be a positive and constructive approach.
We have refrained from resubmitting the celebrated NisticÃ² amendment on cloning and stem cell research, about which we have argued so much.
The main reason for this is that serious problems with specific parts of this amendment arose in Council.
I still do not understand why the Council was not able to come closer to this amendment.
Parliament wanted to go further than the Common Position had done.
I now hear, though, that a statement by five Member States has moved the Council to start discussing ethics, which cannot but be satisfactory from our point of view, and I call on the Commission to take a constructive approach and smooth the path to an agreement in Council.
Parliament will certainly not raise any objections if something is introduced in the ethics field approximating more closely to our amendment than the Commission's declaration and the Common Position did.
Mr President, the specific programmes for implementing the Sixth Framework Programme deal with each thematic priority in detail, clarifying their content and certainly making them more effective.
They will make substantial changes contributing to the success of the whole programme in that they are based on the focusing of financial aid on a restricted, specific number of priority themes throughout Europe.
This will give researchers a closer system of cooperation and will increase their mobility, for the aim is to create an attractive working environment for them in Europe too.
As regards the employment rules, the Sixth Framework Programme, on which work began over a year ago and to which the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has contributed, has preserved the very themes highlighted by our committee as well among the priorities, particularly employment, health and safety at the work place and the integration of the socially excluded and disadvantaged such as people with disabilities.
Indeed, we must not forget that the whole point of research is to serve the people: it is not an end in itself.
In addition, particular stress has been placed on support and research for small and medium-sized businesses, precisely because of their function of an economic catalyst in Europe.
Moreover, the restructuring of the Common Research Centre has made it more efficient and the confirmation of the budget is an important step towards the creation of a European Research Area.
Lastly, I am pleased to welcome the inclusion of an amendment tabled last June on employment in Europe.
Our request that research should be extended to the development of operating systems and hardware in Europe has been included in the specific programme aimed at integrating and strengthening the European Research Area.
That will certainly help to boost employment and put the brakes on our current growing dependence on the United States and Japan in what is considered to be a crucial sector for the new economy.
Mr President, from the point of view of the Budget, it is certainly to be welcomed, and in equal degree indispensable, that the Community Research Framework Programme is to be given more concrete form.
The sum of EUR 17.5 billion approved by the Council was, in any case, up for debate, which means that it was available for distribution.
However, I had to resign from the position of spokeswoman for the Committee on Budgets which had been entrusted to me; this was not out of any refusal to do the job, but rather because the committee had resolved not to take up a position this evening, as we are dealing here with new methods of integration and coordination, which are not to be assessed ex ante.
I would nonetheless like to make use of this time, as practical experience has brought to my attention something I regard as crucial. I refer, Mr Busquin, to the Commission's negotiation of contracts with small and medium-sized enterprises with regard to proposals eligible for support under the Framework Programme.
How is it that projects with what I regard as excellent content are doomed to failure because the applicants cannot stand up to the Commission's assessment procedure?
An assessment procedure, which, in my view short-sightedly, insists on profit margins and liquidity, utterly disregarding the firms' capacity for innovation and willingness to make investments.
An assessment procedure that faces SMEs in particular with safeguards that constitute high obstacles, and, in the final analysis, an assessment procedure that is humiliating and has a demotivating effect on firms working in an essentially innovative way and with less emphasis on profit, which should therefore actually be favoured partners in the Framework Programme.
Cofinancing requires that we ensure that private traders do not misuse Community funds or misdirect investment of them.
That much is clear, but such an audit needs decision-making parameters that are more accurate and more responsive to individual cases, or else innovation and initiative will be systematically ruled out rather than supported, and we will end up, as we did with the European Structural Fund, with an accumulation of funds and wasted resources.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I turn first to you, Mr President, to express my regret that you have not been able to take the floor, because in your capacity as Vice-President, you have always strongly supported the idea of the European Research Area, but I imagine that you will continue to do so.
I should firstly like to thank Mr Caudron once again for having ensured that the Sixth Framework Programme was put to the vote during the May part-session, which has made it possible - as you rightly said - to keep to a timetable that is in the interests of the entire scientific community, as well as European industry, and to adopt this framework programme, the specific programmes and the rules for participation within the allotted time.
Once again I should like - on behalf of the scientific community, essentially - to thank Parliament and all those who have made it possible for us to achieve something that you have rightly described as very positive, that is to adopt these rules in due time, so that we can prepare for 1 January 2003 in the best possible conditions.
Today, however, it is the specific programmes that are at issue, and thus another important stage in the process, and here I should like to thank very warmly the rapporteurs for the five specific programmes, Mr van Velzen, Mrs Zorba, Mr Alyssandrakis, Mr PiÃ©trasanta and Mr Schwaiger, for the quality of their work.
I should also like to thank the other members of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, who may not have been rapporteurs but have taken part in this work and made useful contributions.
I should also, for the benefit of Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, who issued an opinion on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture but who has now left the Chamber, like to make it clear that there was never any question of defining research on a sector-by-sector basis.
We did not champion a particular sector - we focused on research - but we are not by any means indifferent to agriculture and it is evident in many areas. Very special attention is paid to it in an area that he did not mention, in the context of support to Community policies, where agriculture will play a very important role.
Moreover, the multifunctionality of agriculture is included in its own right, as are aspects of sustainable rural development and support for biodiversity, which shows clearly that we are not concerned about genomics alone, but also about biodiversity, as a natural process, which may be of interest in many respects.
One very positive point is that the specific programmes have turned out to be absolutely consistent with the framework programme, which, as you know, has been finally approved by the Council and has now been officially in force since 3 June.
In any case, the framework programme is only a basis.
I note that the rapporteurs have done some very high-quality work and that even now the Commission can definitely accept a very large proportion of the amendments in their present form, in terms of both their principle and content.
I should like, furthermore, to echo Mr van Velzen's praise of the initiative that has been taken - which qualifies as historic - to table en bloc the amendments adopted en bloc at the May part-session, which, if adopted, will be incorporated into the text as described in the statements issued by the Commission and the Council when the framework programme was adopted.
We have therefore complied fully with the agreement that we concluded and I think that this is an interesting and new element from an institutional and methodological point of view.
As Mr Caudron rightly stressed, clearly when we work in a spirit of mutual trust in this field we are able to make progress more rapidly, and I too wished to underline this myself once more.
Some of the amendments are useful clarifications and provide more detailed descriptions of the scientific content of the framework programme; of course, they must be taken into consideration.
Sometimes, however, I have to say that the proposals go into too much detail and, although we can accept them in principle, in some cases it would be more appropriate to include these suggestions in the work programmes.
I now turn to the individual reports.
Mr van Velzen's report, which is very wide-ranging and covers the first and third aspects of the European Research Area, that is integrating and strengthening the European Research Area, is clearly very comprehensive and we can confirm even now that all of his amendments are to a very large extent acceptable.
We can accept all of the amendments concerning the process of implementing the framework programme, as Mr Caudron also stressed: the transition from the fifth to the Sixth Framework Programme, the budgetary proposals, of course, which have been included, and the need for a flexible transition, where we have accepted your proposed form of wording. I believe that here Parliament is making an important contribution to a Commission position which - we have to admit - was rather too isolationist; Parliament has shown wisdom and understanding on this issue of the transition from one framework programme to another.
We will of course also have to ensure that the programme is implemented in an integrated way, and we will be sending Parliament some information in this regard, in particular on drawing up the work programmes.
I hope that we will be able to continue to work together in the implementation phase, that we will be able to keep you informed on a regular basis about the various aspects and that you will obviously let us have your views and thoughts on any problems that may arise.
We all agree that it will be necessary to evaluate the contribution made by the framework programme to establishing the European Research Area, and I would remind you that there will be an evaluation of the new instruments after two years.
All of this is work that we can do together.
As far as the priority of genomics and biotechnology for health is concerned, the Commission will of course take on board all of the amendments relating to research into cancer, of whatever form: genetic, clinical and others.
In particular, as you also mentioned, translational research is a very important aspect, as are, of course, strategies for prevention.
In the same way, we will not forget diabetes and the new opportunities opening up here, as Mr van Velzen has just stressed.
I should like to say to Mr Liese, who tabled an amendment in plenary, that in my view, where palliative care is concerned, it is quite clear that this point can be taken into account in what we call the coordination of European policies, and in the support for research into diseases, which must in any case be approached holistically.
There will not therefore be any problem with incorporating this idea that you expounded in plenary.
On the other hand, I can assure you that the Commission will not be able to accept any of the amendments on life sciences that have just been tabled in plenary if they compromise the balance that we all worked together to achieve between genomics and non-genomics research in the Sixth Framework Programme.
As far as the other thematic priorities are concerned, overall the Commission can accept all of the amendments, apart, however, from those which go into too much detail on the specific programmes, such as on food safety and quality.
These are details and issues that do not fall within the scope of the specific programmes as described in the Sixth Framework Programme.
Turning now to an amendment that has just been tabled in the plenary, by Mr van Velzen I think, on space and satellites, we need to engage in a process of reflection and carry out research, but this must also be done in collaboration with the European Space Agency, which is moreover responsible for implementing space policy.
Although I have sympathy for the substance of your proposal, we will have to adjust the wording to find a way to make collaboration possible.
Generally speaking, I can safely say that the entire contents of Mr van Velzen's report are an accurate reflection of the wishes that we have all expressed, even though some points are obviously too detailed for us to take on board as they stand, but we are certainly on the same wavelength, a fact that I can only welcome.
The same obviously goes for Mrs Zorba's amendments.
They are all acceptable and have even introduced an extra dimension into the reflection process by establishing a link with the notion of multidisciplinarity and by putting greater emphasis on researcher mobility. I also agree, Mrs Zorba, with the comments just made by your neighbour, Mrs Zrihen, on the notion of Europe, because Europe's wealth lies mainly in its human resources - in its researchers - and we must capitalise on them by strengthening the link between the research process and the so-called Bologna process, so that we can establish a Europe of knowledge.
This was, moreover, stated at the Barcelona Summit. Europe's greatest challenge will be to maintain high-quality human resources, and I will be coming back to this when I address science and society and attracting young people into careers in research.
There is also, as you said, support for the creation of the European Higher Education Area.
I think that this idea of science and education has a bearing on our debate on the rules for participation, which is obviously important, but we also think that we need to ensure complementarity with contrasting and similar actions within the thematic priorities.
Turning now to Mr Purvis, who addressed a drafting problem in the text of an amendment tabled in plenary, which seeks to clarify the eligibility criteria for experienced researchers, I should like to say that we intended our text to mean four years of experience or a doctorate.
The original wording is therefore unsatisfactory.
We are now proposing a much simpler text, which reads, four years of experience or a doctorate, and is therefore along the same lines as the amendment that you are tabling in plenary. This is the crucial point, and I think that you were right to stress the fact that where we wrote 'including', this was not perhaps sufficiently clear and that it was therefore better to replace 'including' with 'or', which is much simpler.
There you have a very precise answer to an amendment that is going to be put to the vote in plenary.
On the other hand, Mrs Zorba, we find it difficult to accept the amendment setting a fixed budget for international fellowships, because I think that fixing amounts in advance introduces a degree of inflexibility that is not entirely appropriate. We can assure you, however, that we will monitor the individual fellowships in the spirit of your amendment, because obviously they are one of the entry points into the framework programme.
But we do not agree that we should start classifying all mobility actions in an excessively rigid way, because this would end up being damaging.
However, where your amendments on science and society are concerned, we fully agree with those which call for greater involvement of the general public and the stakeholders - such as patients' organisations and environmental associations - in the science and society debate, and those which underline the important role played by teachers and the media in developing a better understanding of science.
Nevertheless, we do not think that it would be appropriate to mention issues relating to science and society explicitly in the thematic priorities, because this is an area that cuts across the thematic priorities and covers science and society as a whole.
We would therefore be downgrading it if we were to include it solely in the thematic priorities.
Having said that, these are details compared with the general thinking behind your proposal.
Next, and this is an important point, I note that Parliament has ensured that greater priority is given to 'science and society'.
We have to recognise that this is actually the first time that this subject has been addressed explicitly in a framework programme, and you have increased its budget, which is a good decision in my view.
Turning now to Mr Alyssandrakis's report and the additional comments made by Mrs Matikainen, I believe, Mr Alyssandrakis, that all of your amendments serve to clarify the Commission proposal.
The Commission is willing to accept all of them, subject to some minor drafting changes, although this will not affect the general thinking behind them.
This applies, for example, to all of the amendments concerning radiation protection, which is of course a major issue.
On nuclear fusion, we can take on board the majority of the amendments that advocate funding for the activities concerned, but we have to make it very clear that the ITER project is a new initiative.
I believe that you and Mrs Matikainen are saying more or less the same thing, but the ITER project really does have to be seen as a next step and it is therefore essential that it also be included in the specific programme because it is one of the projects on which the future of nuclear fusion depends.
This does not mean that basic research and research in general should not be pursued in areas other than implementing ITER, as you rightly stressed, for example on JET and other types of tokamak, such as the stellarator.
But our objective has to be to make ITER our next step.
Moreover, substantial progress has been made in international negotiations on ITER in recent weeks: today we have a proposal for at least three sites, two, maybe three, in Europe - Mr Vidal-Quadras will understand what I am getting at because Spain is doing marvellous work in this field - and one site in Japan.
Negotiations are progressing well here and that is significant.
The Commission fully recognises the importance of the management of radioactive waste.
However, the amendments tabled tend to introduce deadlines that are too restrictive for the purposes of research.
They cannot therefore be accepted in full, because we have to keep research into the management of radioactive waste fairly open-ended: there may not be just one solution, but several.
I turn now to Mr PiÃ©trasanta's report. We should like to thank you, Mr PiÃ©trasanta, and through you the entire Parliament.
We wish to thank you, as Mrs McNally mentioned, for taking such a keen interest in the Joint Research Centre and for ensuring that it is supported in the framework programme.
It is very important for Parliament to realise that in the Joint Research Centre the European Union has an instrument at its disposal that can help to make certain political objectives a reality.
It will be useful in helping us to establish the European Research Area by creating common bases of knowledge and measurements and also, as you stressed Mr PiÃ©trasanta, by fostering links with national centres.
This is an interesting point and you did well to highlight it.
While we are on the subject, I should like to inform you that the Commission intends to make a statement for the Council Minutes indicating that it welcomes Parliament's intention to set up an ad-hoc group of Members, a kind of monitoring committee, to act as an interface with the Joint Research Centre.
I think this idea was already in the Avignon report, but you were right to take it up again.
From an institutional point of view, we will see that we make a statement to the Council and have it noted in the Minutes.
This is a good idea and it enjoys parliamentary support.
We consider the amendments to be acceptable, including those that emphasise the priority that must be given to environmental issues, in particular the protection of ecosystems and food safety.
You will be aware that the Joint Research Centre is considered to have some of the best expertise in Europe on traceability, for example of GMOs.
It will therefore be an important tool in the run-up, in particular, to enlargement, when the Centre is opened up to new members: I will return to this point when I address Mr Schwaiger's report.
Mr Schwaiger, I should like to say how timely your amendments are; this comes as no surprise given that you are very familiar with the issues and that you insisted on visiting the JRC.
We do not have any problems with them; quite the opposite.
We think that your report puts forward additional arguments in favour of integrating the Joint Research Centre into European networks, and in particular networks of excellence, and we agree with the principles that you mentioned, both on ethics and openness.
I should like to make it clear, however, that the same goes for research into both efforts to harmonise nuclear safety criteria and the nuclear fuel cycle, which is vital.
Here, recent events show that the nuclear fuel cycle needs to be subjected to ever more stringent controls, and the agreement on disarmament that has just been concluded by Russia and the United States assumes that Europe will also play a part in this discussion.
I met officials from the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna who asked us to pool some of our expertise with theirs, precisely so as to gain a better understanding of these dissemination issues.
Your comment, Mr Schwaiger, could not therefore have been more pertinent and is highly topical.
This therefore needs to be taken into account when considering the general issue of dispersion and non-dissemination, and Europe needs to make its contribution to the joint effort.
Mrs De Palacio and I also support the technical aspects of your proposal.
As you emphasised, the safety of some nuclear power stations, including those in Lithuania, gives huge cause for concern and the JRC has a degree of expertise and a training capability here that could be exploited.
There you have it: I think that I have now dealt with all of the reports and I should like, by way of a conclusion, to respond to some of the interventions made in the debate.
I have already said to Mr Purvis that on the issue of the Marie Curie fellowships we will correct the text along the lines that you suggested.
I would stress that you were right to say how important 'science and society' is for young people.
How can we encourage young people to study science, a point also made by Mrs McNally?
This is where we need the actions to converge.
As you know, we have drafted a 'science and society' action plan.
We will have to consider how to implement it and we can do so together.
Mr Liese mentioned biofuels: his proposal is highly relevant and we can support his amendment.
Besides, it is along the same lines as Mrs De Palacio's directive on the same issue.
As I have already said, we can support the ideas on palliative care that you mentioned in the debate.
Mr Souchet has left I think, but his question on nuclear energy is clearly a general one.
In conclusion, I should like to address some more general issues related to the economy.
Today, in adopting the framework programme and the specific programmes, I think that we have shown how essential research and innovation are to achieving the Lisbon objective of becoming the most dynamic economy in the world.
With this in mind, I think that the July part-session, as Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl and the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy proposed yesterday, will obviously be very significant, because it is then that we will be in a position to make the Sixth Framework Programme a reality as part of the European Research Area.
In this respect, I can tell you that the response to the calls for expressions of interest - a new initiative that we have just launched for the first time and that we issued to the scientific community and industry - has been startlingly successful, and has even been rather difficult to manage because we have received more than 15 000 expressions of interest.
This shows that the European research community and the European Research Area are gathering momentum.
The problem is that we risk being the victim of our own success and running into management difficulties.
But 15 000 expressions of interest is quite something!
Success on this scale reflects the efforts we have all made - that you have made - to provide information and raise awareness.
I think that this work has been very worthwhile because it points to the emergence of an awareness of and willingness to foster research and innovation in Europe.
You are right about this and I should like to respond to a number of the points made about research and innovation, by Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, who stressed the issue of the link between research and innovation, and by Mr RÃŒbig, who mentioned the problem of small and medium-sized enterprises.
It is clear that we need to move into the implementation phase, and that we have to achieve our target of 15%, which is not always easy because doing so relies on providing information and raising awareness.
In the implementation phase we will have to pay particular attention to the practical measures we can take to reach this objective.
For an SME the difficulty lies in the costs and in saying this I am responding to Mrs Langenhagen's comment: I think that you are right to highlight this issue of guarantees for small and medium-sized enterprises.
When it comes to implementation, we are trying to ensure that the guarantees no longer constitute an additional source of fear or present additional difficulties for small and medium-sized enterprises.
So much then for the issue of implementation, based on the rules for participation, of what we will call the admissible costs.
This is what we have in mind at the moment, but the debate is ongoing because, as you know better than anybody, we are talking about public money and we cannot commit it any old how.
The debate is underway though, and I hope to have the opportunity to discuss it with the Committee on Budgets and, of course, the Court of Auditors.
In this way our proposal will be able to cater for this difficulty, while ensuring that we do not run any unacceptable risks.
Mr Mantovani, you also mentioned SMEs.
This is an objective that we all share and I think it is important for us to launch an information campaign and reflect on the modalities.
If you wish, I would be quite happy to have a meeting with you about this issue, to listen to your proposals and consider how we might best implement the SME strand; in any case they will benefit from over EUR 2 billion under the next framework programme, which is a very significant sum.
We must also ensure, as you said, Mr RÃŒbig, that our work complements that of the European Investment Bank, which is prepared to deploy additional resources in this area.
In conclusion, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that we are going to try to create some momentum, given that in Barcelona we agreed on the objective of 3% of GDP.
I should like to thank Mr van Velzen for having underlined once more that the future of Europe is at stake here, that we need to boost research and innovation in Europe, and that we need to do this together; this is what Parliament wanted.
I remember that when the idea of the European Research Area was first floated, you insisted on the objective of 3% of GDP.
We are going to achieve this, thanks to you, thanks to the scientific community, and thanks to the desire to make research and innovation a priority at European level.
I should like to thank you in any case for your work and I hope that we will all have played our part in moving things forward.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
.
(PT) The purpose of this report is to revise Article 6 of Parliament's Rules of Procedure concerning: (a) the concept of the 'appropriate authority' of a Member State to request that immunity be waived; (b) the appropriate procedure for verifying the competence of the authority submitting the application for the lifting of immunity of a Member facing prosecution; (c) the procedure Parliament should follow when examining a request for the waiver of a Member's immunity; and (d) the procedure to be adopted when Parliament needs to assert the parliamentary immunity of a Member. I fully supported the initiative, especially the part - which I consider to be most relevant - which closed an obvious gap in the Rules of Procedure, which has been clearly illustrated in the cases underlying the MacCormick report, which was debated and voted on at the same time.
These were cases in which it was not the Member State authorities requesting the waiver of immunity but instead a Member requesting that his status be guaranteed in the event of prosecution in any given Member State. As in the specific case of the Italian system, the onus is on the Member himself or herself and not the authorities to submit the request for immunity.
.
(PT) The drafting of this report was prompted by the cases brought by the Italian courts against individuals who are Members of the European Parliament.
In the course of these proceedings, certain provisions concerning immunity were not complied with, because it was not the Italian authorities that asked the European Parliament to consider waiving immunity, but the Members concerned themselves.
The difficulty was then knowing whether or not the European Parliament could take the view that it had, in fact, been consulted on the matter, given that Rule 6 of its Rules of Procedure requires any request to be addressed to the President of the European Parliament by the competent authorities of a Member State.
It must be clarified that, in the proceedings in question, it was the Members themselves who submitted these requests to Parliament, in line with the Italian practice according to which, when the issue of waiving the immunity of a Member facing prosecution is raised, it is the responsibility of that individual to submit the request to the Assembly of which he or she is a Member.
It is in this context that the rapporteur suggested a specific procedure that is not intended to replace the request for a waiver of immunity submitted by the competent national authority as laid down in Rule 6 of the Rules of Procedure, but instead to prevent national authorities, in the formal absence of such a request, being able not to take account of the protection afforded to the Members of the European Parliament.
The procedure suggested by the rapporteur deserves our total support, because it is the best way of dealing with the loopholes in the texts currently in force.
Only a comprehensive reform such as the one suggested in the Duff report, which was studied and voted on the same day, will provide a complete and structured response to this type of problem.
.
(PT) The vote took place at a time when the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy had delivered the following opinion on the aspects that remained the most sensitive in political terms: firstly, an immediate ban on the sale of new cosmetic products tested on animals where other validated methods of testing exist; secondly, a total ban, in five years' time, on the sale of all new cosmetic products tested on animals; thirdly, a ban on testing on animals by the end of 2004.
It is well known that if plenary pursued this approach, we would face the prospect of a major disagreement with the Council which, in turn, will give up not only on the idea of banning experiments on animals but also on the idea of banning sales.
In other words, we would face the prospect of a heated and lively conciliation process.
This is my position exactly, because I am disappointed with the degree of conformism that I discerned in the prevailing Council positions and because I am convinced that it is absolutely crucial to push forward with the positions held by the industry in this field, in order to achieve a balanced weighting of the values involved.
Preparation of European Council (Seville, 21/22 June 2002), including situation between India and Pakistan
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the preparation of the European Council in Seville on 21 and 22 June 2002, including the situation between India and Pakistan.
Mr President, I shall comment very briefly on the issue raised by Mr Van Orden.
This Parliament is well aware that the Council has attended to the issue of Zimbabwe on various occasions and that this matter was addressed at the Barcelona European Council.
I have been following the matter very closely and I can tell you that a General Affairs Council will be held next Monday.
Let us hope that we can deal with the matter at Minister of Foreign Affairs level and should it prove necessary or appropriate, it could then be raised at the Seville European Council.
With regard to the Seville European Council, Mr President, from 21 to 22 June the second and last European Council of the Spanish Presidency of the European Union will take place in Seville.
Five basic issues will be addressed at this Council: the process of economic reforms, as a follow-up to the Barcelona European Council; the current state of negotiations on enlargement, a process on which we have made substantial progress; issues of Justice and Home Affairs, in particular immigration policy; the debate on the future of Europe, with a report from the President of the Convention, Mr Giscard d'Estaing; and the issues of greatest concern in the context of the CFSP (Common Foreign and Security Policy).
I shall now briefly discuss the issues I have mentioned.
I shall start with the economic issues - the follow-up to the Spring European Council.
This follow-up will be one of the fundamental elements of this forthcoming European Council, since the Spring European Council laid down a programme and a follow-up for certain issues and established a set of tasks to be revised in Seville.
Barcelona represented the continuation of the process inaugurated at the Lisbon European Council, which focused on a programme of economic reforms in the aim of making the European Union the most dynamic and competitive region in the world in the context of the new economy of the information society.
In Seville, therefore, and as a follow-up to Barcelona, the following issues will be examined: firstly, Ecofin - which is due to meet on 20 June, before the European Council - will present a final report on the adoption of the broad economic policy guidelines.
The Presidency intends to present a report on the current state of work on the tax package, which includes a range of initiatives on savings tax, energy tax and cooperation with tax authorities.
The issue of 'corporate governance' (the governance of businesses) will also be addressed.
For this reason, the report by the high level working group on company law must discuss three issues: the role of non-executive directors and of boards of directors, company directors' pay and the board of directors' responsibility for preparing information about the company's finances.
Other issues left pending from the Barcelona European Council and which will be addressed by the Seville Council are: the simplification and improvement of regulations - known as 'better regulation'; economic services of general interest - the Commission will also present the report that has been requested of it; energy supply - on which it will present another report; telecommunications, education, research; the outermost regions and sustainable development.
The second major issue that I announced was that of negotiations on enlargement.
Unless you ask me to provide further information, Mr President, I would prefer not to dwell on the issue of enlargement, since today a substantive debate is going to be held on the matter.
Therefore, as enlargement will be the subject of a specifically scheduled statement this very evening, I think we could keep the debate short and leave this issue for later.
Issues of Justice and Home Affairs have been one of the main priorities of the Spanish Presidency of the Union.
In Seville we will be pressing ahead on these issues in four main areas: firstly, a review of Community asylum and immigration policy will be undertaken - basically a review of the Tampere commitments - as well as an assessment of the situation and a clear programme to fulfil the commitments that we adopted in 1999 during the Finnish Presidency, as a consequence of the communitarisation of Justice and Home Affairs issues, formalised in the Treaty of Amsterdam.
Secondly, the Heads of State and Government will be discussing a global plan to combat illegal immigration.
Then there will be a discussion of a programme and a policy on protecting the Union's external borders.
Lastly, a debate will be held on integrating migration policy into the Union's external actions.
With regard to the first issue I mentioned, the European Council, in line with the conclusions of the Tampere Council and of following Councils, is going to urge the Council to approve, within the deadlines laid down in the Treaty of Amsterdam, the necessary legislative instruments to adopt a common asylum and immigration policy.
This policy must respect the balance between a set of principles, such as the protection of refugees, the Union and the Member States' ability to receive asylum seekers and the integration of legal immigrants.
Secondly, the negotiations currently underway on adopting a common policy in the field of asylum and legal immigration will be given a boost if at the same time the Union develops a common policy to combat illegal immigration, which produces effective results in the short and medium term.
For these reasons, on 28 February of this year, the Council approved its plan to combat illegal immigration.
This will also be addressed by the European Council.
In addition to vigilance and closer monitoring of the borders and of border crossing points, one of the plan's aims is to prevent the illegal crossing of the external borders of the Member States of the Union, whilst at the same time ensuring that asylum seekers can exercise their right to ask for international protection.
In this context, the communication that the Commission presented recently, entitled "Towards integrated management of the external borders of the Member States of the European Union" takes on particular importance.
Lastly, on the basis of the agreement reached at the Laeken Summit, in Seville the European Council will demonstrate its desire to integrate immigration policy much more deeply into the Union's external actions.
The guiding principle of external action in the field of immigration and asylum with the countries of origin and of transit must be a global, integrated and balanced approach, which uses all the Community and Member States' instruments in a coordinated way to establish a relationship of cooperation with a view to ensuring the joint management of migratory flows, and to address the underlying causes of these flows and of poverty, in order to incorporate this dimension into development aid policy.
Something else that will be raised is the development of an external strategy for areas in the immediate vicinity of borders to cooperate in the management and control of migratory flows.
The other major package of issues, to which I referred at the beginning, is everything that concerns institutional affairs, the debate on the future of Europe and the reform of the Council.
There are essentially two matters of an institutional nature, on which we shall focus: the debate on the future of Europe and the reform of the Council of Ministers.
With regard to the first issue, the Convention on the future of Europe held its inaugural sitting on 28 February, as you will remember, because this took place in the seat of the European Parliament, and before Seville, the Convention will already have held five plenary sessions.
Furthermore, I think we can draw some preliminary conclusions from the debates that have taken place to date.
On the one hand, the majority of the members of the Convention have shown themselves to be in favour of going more deeply into the process of European integration in a realistic way, in particular with regard to the distribution of competences.
On the other hand, and in relation to the works of the Convention, the Presidium has agreed to set up six working groups, which are to present their conclusions between September and November.
In Seville, in line with the provisions of the Laeken declaration, the President of the Convention, Mr Giscard d'Estaing, will present an oral report on the progress achieved in the Convention's works.
With regard to the reform of the Council, and in accordance with the conclusions of the Barcelona European Council, the Presidency will present a report in Seville on improving its functioning and on reforms to make it more effective on the basis of the report submitted by the Secretary General of the Council, in the aim of ensuring greater transparency in the legislative process and in which practical measures for its adoption will be put forward.
I should like, of course, to clarify something that to me seems obvious, but which bears repeating, and that is that these Council reforms only refer to internal reforms, to internal organisation, and that in no case does the Council intend to address issues that require a reform of primary law, because this, of course, is a matter for the Intergovernmental Conference and for the European Convention preparing the Intergovernmental Conference.
The Council will, therefore, be considering a set of practical reforms that will make the work of the European Council more rapid and more dynamic and which, furthermore, as you would expect, move towards the system employed by the Councils that support the European Council.
I hope that the European Council can now begin to attempt to simplify its administrative tasks so as to prepare the Union for a scenario in which, following enlargement, we will have 25 Member States.
Lastly, the European Council, as you would expect and as is the norm, will have to deal with the field of external relations focussing essentially on the following issues: firstly, the situation in the Middle East.
On this matter the European Union will maintain its efforts to achieve a negotiated solution to the conflict, by condemning the use of violence and by promoting conciliation as an instrument of joint action geared towards making progress in the economic, political and security spheres.
In particular, with regard to the crisis of the Church of the Nativity, the Council has been pleased at the resolution of this crisis in line with the memorandum of understanding signed by both sides.
The Palestinians affected by the agreement have been transferred to various Member States of the Union - Spain, Belgium, Ireland, Italy and Portugal - to be accepted, for humanitarian reasons, in line with the common position reached by the Council on 21 May.
The adoption of this common position underlines the commitment of the European Union to achieving a lasting peace in the Middle East.
I therefore believe that, in the context of these recent actions, the European Council will study the situation and will try once again to give impetus to the latest initiatives to be put forward by the High Representative, Mr Solana, for a Peace Conference to take place as soon as possible.
At the same time, the Council will study developments in issues of security and defence policy, in particular, in relation to the fight against terrorism and the follow-up to the Laeken mandate.
I also believe that the European Council will be forced to deal with the conflict between India and Pakistan to which I shall now specifically refer.
Despite having historically been strictly bilateral, this conflict today contains a new dimension, which transcends the sub-regional consequences to become a potential factor for destabilisation for the entire Asian Continent and for the whole world.
Given the possibility of a fourth India-Pakistan conflagration, which could spiral out of control towards nuclear escalation, the international community must react unambiguously.
At the end of last year, following the tragic attacks by terrorists on elected representatives in Srinagar and New Delhi, the Presidency held talks with both governments to urge both sides to prevent a military escalation, to reopen political dialogue and to find political formulas to resolve the problem of Kashmir.
After the encouraging speech given by President Musharraf on 12 January, New Delhi reacted with a sense of historical opportunity to this conciliatory gesture by Pakistan and agreed to stop military mobilisation.
Nevertheless, further devastating attacks - in Kaluchak and in Srinagar - border skirmishes and the re-emergence of the dialectic of confrontation, with the recent missile tests by Pakistan that matched those by India in January, have brought both armies to the brink of war.
We only have to remember the tone of the disappointing speech by the President of Pakistan on 27 May and the cold rigidity of India's response to the calls for containment made at the highest political levels.
Here we must recall the visits to New Delhi and Islamabad by the Secretary of State, Mr Powell, by Commissioner Patten, by the Foreign Secretary, Mr Straw, the calls by Presidents Chirac and Putin and, lastly, the tour currently being undertaken by the United States' Defence Secretary, Mr Rumsfeld.
The Union has to date wished to maintain a position that is as even-handed as possible in this conflict, insisting on the need for both sides to make efforts to reconcile their positions.
This was the idea that inspired the Presidency declaration on this matter, issued on 21 May.
Despite the undeniable efforts by the Pakistanis against the hideouts of Al-Qaida cells, the international community must not tolerate any link between the operation of the nuclear umbrella and political cross-border claims.
For this reason, Pakistan's commitment against organised terror must be total and unconditional and not selective in its efforts or in the deadlines it sets.
I should like, specifically, to remind you that, at the General Affairs Council held last Monday, the ministers agreed to convey a new message, this time not in the form of a Council declaration, but in the form of a press communiquÃ©, with the President of the General Affairs Council, Mr PiquÃ©, informing the media, in order to encourage both sides at a time when we are already seeing signs of relaxation, such as the fact that India has already opened its air space to civilian Pakistani flights and the fact that currently there seems to be a more relaxed atmosphere, in which the alert has been withdrawn along the militarised lines.
Nor must we forget the European victims of the attacks that were carried out in April and May in Islamabad.
Let us remember the bomb set off in the Protestant church of a diplomatic neighbourhood and, in Karachi, the suicide attack on a bus containing French military advisers and technical specialists, as tragic proof that innocent EU citizens have not been excluded from terrorist madness in the region.
In these circumstances, the Presidency considers that the strategy of diplomatic monitoring of both sides must be maintained, albeit whilst now calling, with greater firmness, if necessary, for new gestures of conciliation by both sides which will satisfy the legitimate demands - especially by India - for terrorism to be firmly dealt with.
New Delhi and Islamabad must realise that the international community does not - and will not - understand if either of the two countries resorts to military force.
Since 17 May, more than 60 people have died at the India-Pakistan border; a million soldiers from the two sides are watching each other from the line of control, awaiting orders to start a conflict which, if it happens, - whatever its final outcome may be - will mean desolation and death for the population of both countries.
Consequently, as I have already said, the European Union will continue to help ensure that both sides understand the need to keep the paths of dialogue open, in order to prevent a military scenario arising, the consequences of which would have a tragic affect on the entire continent of Asia.
I would say that next week, in Seville, the message of the Heads of State and Government will be along these lines, in the hope that the already nascent actions to decrease the tension that are taking place will increase with every passing day and that we will be able, at the end of next week, to see a situation that is calmer than the one we saw a few days ago.
Mr President, I should like to conclude this statement by expressing my hope and my belief that the Seville European Council will be a good ending to the term of the Spanish Presidency, during which none of us have spared any effort to push forwards our common idea of Europe and to make the motto that we proposed at the beginning of our Presidency - 'more Europe' - a reality.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr de Miguel for his comments, with which I entirely agree.
I would also like to thank him for his digression into foreign policy with particular reference to the extremely disturbing situation of India and Pakistan, which warrants very close attention on our part.
To end this digression into foreign policy, on which, I repeat, I am in complete agreement with Mr de Miguel, I would like to call upon you to pay attention to potential conflicts too, to growing tensions such as the situation following the elections on the island of Madagascar, which is becoming increasingly perilous and which warrants our close attention precisely because we have greater influence and greater capacity for action before conflict breaks out.
Turning to today's subject, I will just go briefly through the matters which will be debated at the Seville European Conference.
I have to say that my task has been made much easier by the first-rate work of the current Council Presidency.
I am extremely grateful to the Spanish Presidency, for we have worked both well and hard.
This is a critical time for the future of the institutions: the Convention is working on a new political and institutional framework for the Union and enlargement is approaching.
At Seville we shall report on the candidate countries' progress in implementing the acquis.
They have come a long way and we are continuing to work with them under the special programme for them.
Our final opinion on each candidate country will be issued before the October European Council in Brussels.
The roadmap we drew up has been adhered to and everything is in place for the final decision.
There are real grounds for optimism and I continue to hope that the EU will have up to ten new members in 2004.
There are many issues to be discussed at Seville, but today, before you, the Members of the European Parliament, I want to concentrate on two in particular: how the EU is run and immigration.
The Convention is up and running, the debate is lively and there are plenty of ideas and proposals.
That was to be expected, given that we are adopting an innovative approach rather than working through the usual diplomatic channels.
President Giscard d'Estaing will be reporting on the first stage of the Convention's work at Seville and we shall pay careful attention to what he has to say.
At Seville, however - and this is the main point of my speech - we will not just be talking about how to govern the Union in future: we will be discussing - and deciding - how we can improve the running of the Union now.
We cannot sit still and wait for the reform of the Treaties: we must take advantage right now of all the possibilities the existing Treaties offer to improve our running of the Union and our organisational model.
The Convention is working on policies for the future but we must also use the - albeit limited - instruments we have to hand to tackle today's problems.
This is what links the proposals on Council reform made by Mr Solana in his report and the proposals of the Commission on better regulation.
Mr Corbett's proposals on the reform of Parliament that you are discussing in this part-session are also similar in this regard.
These proposals involve all the institutions in different ways, and all the institutions will therefore have to work together to achieve the objective.
Let us start with what is known as 'better regulation'.
This was the idea behind the White Paper on European Governance: to exploit all the opportunities available in the present legal framework in order to improve the legislative and decision-making process.
The enormous participation in the debate on the White Paper and your own contributions - especially the report by Mrs Kaufmann - show that this was the right strategy.
The system must therefore be leaner, more transparent and more efficient.
We must show that we are able to satisfy the demand for greater accountability and for more proportionality in the exercise of the powers conferred on the Council, Parliament and the Commission by the Treaties.
Moreover, we must gear our action to a new goal: the goal of giving more substance to the concept of citizenship and making our fellow citizens' relationship with the Union more transparent, more direct and more tangible.
Last week I presented our project to the Conference of Presidents of the European Parliament, but I would like to go over certain crucial points again now.
Firstly, we are proposing to improve and simplify European legislation by reviewing the whole cycle of the legislative process, beginning with the exercise of the right of initiative.
There are three prongs to this project: laying down clear rules on consultation, assessing the impact of decisions and improving legislative technique.
Our drafting of legislative proposals must be based on wider consultation of all parties concerned and more exhaustive analysis of the economic, social and environmental impact, in accordance with the decisions of the Gothenburg European Council, and this must be done without introducing unnecessary red tape.
Good Community regulation also means acting in full accordance with the original spirit of the Treaties. This means, in particular, making use of framework directives, which are one of the most effective instruments for increasing compliance with the principles of proportionality and subsidiarity.
It is also time to review the implementation of our policies, because implementation is the stage that affects the citizens most directly.
Transparency and democratic accountability demand that each of the institutions refocus its efforts on its core tasks.
In this way, we can start right now to see how the Community method can be revamped in practical terms.
I must stress once again that all this does not just apply to the Commission.
All the institutions must be involved if we really want to get useful results: the institutions have no option but to work together.
Lastly, the institutions themselves must return to their core tasks.
Each must therefore take on clear responsibilities so that we can complete an interinstitutional agreement by the end of the year.
With the Solana report, the Council has also launched a new debate on similar issues and tabled practical proposals for internal organisational reform which do not involve amending the Treaties.
The Commission wholeheartedly supports the Council's reform efforts.
I can only welcome the fact that the Council is looking to draw a distinction in its internal organisation between the procedures applicable to its legislative function and those applicable to its purely administrative functions.
I also support the points contained in the proposal on continuity of work, the need to improve internal coordination and the possibility of reducing the number of Council configurations.
These are all recommendations which simplify their and our work.
These efforts will help us to tackle the problems that the forthcoming enlargement will bring for the working of our institutions.
In my view, an objective of such importance can only be addressed through a coordinated approach involving the Commission, Parliament and the Council.
We must act together, calmly but resolutely, to move beyond 'better regulation' to achieve 'better organisation' of all the institutions.
The Commission is ready to play its part in this joint endeavour.
Better organisation means more speed, more coordination and less red tape.
It means giving up long-established but outdated positions in the interests of working faster and better than before, despite the increased complexity of the system.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as I said at the beginning of my speech, the most burning issue to be dealt with by the European Council is immigration.
It is worth repeating that there is no question of proposing solutions that are incompatible with the fundamental values of our Union. Instead, we must promote a model of integration that can combine freedom with our citizens' legitimate demands for security.
I have already expressed my support for the Presidency's decision to put the issue of immigration high on the Seville agenda.
In the eyes of most of our citizens, immigration is becoming increasingly linked with requirements for their protection in the area of freedom, security and justice that we are trying to build together.
There are a variety of reasons for this and they have been somewhat accentuated by the events of September 11 too.
We must address these issues without demonising them.
Our discussions now under way on legal immigration and the right of asylum could break down if we do not take on board our fellow citizens' concerns about illegal immigration.
At Tampere, we agreed on a number of objectives that are still valid today.
We even have before us suitable proposals for achieving those objectives such as those set out in the Commission communication on illegal immigration, which formed the basis for the Council's Action Plan.
Others concern the management of our external borders and readmission policies.
The political signals we have received recently are quite clear.
We cannot put the issue of security on the back burner, and we cannot let people think that a return to nationalistic solutions can provide a valid answer to transnational phenomena that overwhelm the capacity and scope for action of individual States and can therefore be tackled and managed only at EU level.
The problem is not just combating illegal trafficking: we must also lay the foundations for the full integration of lawful immigrants into our societies and regulate the flow of the immigrants we need.
Even enlargement is presented as a threat by some because of the issue of immigration.
But why - I ask myself, ladies and gentlemen - would the citizens of the candidate countries leave their countries and turn their lives upside down just when membership of the European Union is offering them brighter prospects of prosperity?
Was the same thing not said when Spain and Portugal joined and was the same thing not said about Italy when the European Community was first created?
We have to act quickly on various fronts.
Most importantly, we must tighten controls on the Union's external borders in accordance with the recent proposals put forward by the Commission and the Italian Government.
I trust that the European Council will decide to bring together border police representatives to work out what measures and instruments are needed in the immediate term to launch these initiatives.
External border controls must also be linked to our good-neighbour policy. This seeks to develop special relations and mutual trust between the Union and all countries on its borders, especially following enlargement, with a view, not least, to undertaking joint measures to combat illegal immigration.
In the Euro-Mediterranean context, we have already launched initiatives together with Morocco to devise an overall approach to the issue of immigration.
In addition, we must step up the adoption and implementation of measures on asylum, not least in order to give practical substance to the concept of European citizenship and certain principles enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.
All this, ladies and gentlemen, will not suffice unless it goes hand in hand with a proper cooperation and development policy and the systematic use of all the instruments available to us: a policy to tackle the causes of migration, bilateral agreements and readmission agreements.
We will soon be putting forward practical proposals on these points.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will ask the Seville Council to take appropriate decisions on these points quickly, with the common sense and responsibility that we demonstrated at Brussels and Ghent last autumn.
The two topics I have concentrated on today are of crucial importance for us at this time.
Making our institutions more democratic, transparent and accountable is a response to our fellow citizens' demand for a more effective Europe that is more in touch with their everyday concerns.
The issue of immigration highlights the very reason for European integration: to build a Europe that is prosperous, just and secure.
I thank the President of the Commission.
In particular, I would like to underline Parliament's deep appreciation for the President's commitment to the necessity for proper interinstitutional dialogue and for all of the institutions to recognise that we have a role and a shared responsibility.
I say to the Council, on behalf of Parliament, that we have a strong expectation that Seville will deliver a platform for an interinstitutional dialogue of substance in order to produce a common accord on better regulation and on better law-making - an objective we all share and agree on - and each in our own way, each institution is indispensable to a successful reform.
Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office, the Spanish Presidency has done a good job so far, but the Seville Summit will be the deciding factor in our final judgment of it.
Mr President-in-Office, may I make a point of reiterating what the President of the European Parliament and the President of the Commission just said, that is, that our group expects a high-ranking political working party of all three institutions to be set up in Seville to advise us and reach conclusions as to how we can improve our legislation so that, as the President of the Commission said, we can reach an institutional agreement by the end of this year.
Prime Minister and President-in-Office JosÃ© MarÃ­a Aznar has promised this to Parliament and I really do implore you to pass a resolution for us in Seville setting up this sort of political working party.
If you do, our final judgment of the Spanish Presidency will be even more positive than it has been so far.
As far as the reform of the Council is concerned, I quite understand your reticence, Mr President-in-Office, and I assume it is because you do not as yet have a brief to discuss it.
I am sure I am right in assuming that the Spanish Presidency will do everything in its power to ensure that the Council as a legislative body is distinguished from the Council as an executive body and that, where it acts as legislator, it does so transparently.
This is what we expect from Seville.
You said that the president of the convention, ValÃ©ry Giscard d'Estaing, would be submitting a report.
I would be delighted if all the governments of the Member States of the European Union were to follow suit, if their representatives to the convention also reported back to their cabinets and governments in the Member States of the European Union, in order to ensure there is direct feedback, just as we do at parliamentary level.
I should like on behalf of our group to make it perfectly clear that the debates in the Council today and at the summit in Seville must be predicated on strengthening the European Community, because we need strong European institutions and must not slip back into intergovernmentalism.
I say this in the light of my visit to the United States over the last two days.
Unless we act as a European Union, and we are hardly even perceived as a European Union in America; unless we strengthen the European Union, then we shall lose more and more clout internationally, which is why our objective must be to strengthen the European Community.
We acknowledge the Spanish Presidency's determined approach to the fight against terrorism.
Our perception in Europe is different from the perception in the United States.
The United States feels it is at war, because it is the first time it has been attacked on home territory.
We have to understand that and we must do everything we can in Europe to help destroy terrorist networks.
But we also have to say that terrorism and the fight against terrorism cannot be used as an excuse to violate human rights, be it in Africa, Chechnya or anywhere else.
And we must make a clear distinction between terrorists, on the one hand, and the Arab and Islamic world on the other.
That is why it is so important that the European Union continue in its endeavours to help broker peace in the Middle East.
That we say to the Israelis, you have the right to live within secure borders and anyone who attacks those secure borders must be prepared to meet decisive resistance.
But we must also say to the Palestinians that they have their dignity and the right to live within secure borders in a Palestinian state.
We welcome your efforts in the fight against terrorism, we welcome your efforts to set up a common European border police to protect the external borders of the European Union and we hope that Seville will bring results.
We recognise that Spain's efforts on the Sixth Research Framework Programme have been a huge success and we also hope - and this will be discussed more thoroughly this afternoon - to confirm the timetable for the enlargement of the European Union.
I can only reiterate what President Prodi said: that we, the European Parliament, the European Council, the European Commission, the European institutions, are encouraging the countries of central Europe to conclude negotiations on the basis of the acquis communautaire, so that we can achieve results within the planned time frame and the countries of central Europe which sign accession agreements, together with Malta and - hopefully - Cyprus, can take part in the next European elections.
We, the European Parliament, we, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, see ourselves as the champion of the nations seeking to join the European Union and my only request, from the bottom of my heart, is that we all help to keep to this timetable.
(Applause)
Mr President, as made clear in the speeches both by the Presidency and by those party spokespeople who have spoken, Seville will be the last summit of the Spanish Presidency and, although this is not the time to draw up the final balance sheet, this is the time to take a brief look at how it has performed its duties and to see whether we are likely to pass or even to get a good mark.
It could be said that these five months have been characterised by an excessive fuss about most of the issues set as priorities for the Presidency's term in office.
There has been a great deal of fuss about enlargement, about immigration, about Mediterranean policy, about fisheries policy and the reform of agricultural policy, about external policy, about transatlantic relations, etc. It cannot be denied, Mr President, that we have talked about everything: sustainable development, the spirit of Lisbon, the institutionalisation of the Union, the outermost regions... but if we look at the progress that has been made on any of the issues I have just mentioned - we will reach the conclusion that a major imbalance has been created between what is said and what is done.
As they say, Mr President, there has been much ado about nothing.
I know that on some issues - perhaps on many of them - the Presidency has alibis, but the fact is that we are approaching the end of the Presidency with a more complicated agenda than when we started and with more confusion.
On the issue of immigration and asylum, for example, for more than a month, we have been repeating, ad nauseam, the conclusions of the Tampere Council; commitments that the Council has been unable to fulfil due to a lack of political will.
Nothing new is being said.
Everything has already been said and agreed upon but there has been such a fanfare of trumpets that you would think we had come up with something new for the Seville Summit.
With regard to employment policy, all I can fairly say is that Barcelona threw the spirit of Lisbon off course.
No account was taken of the fact that Lisbon's strategic objective was not only to create a more prosperous and competitive economic area; the other objectives were full employment and greater social cohesion, and this is where a step backwards has been taken.
What can we say about the major challenge laid down by the Swedish Presidency: sustainable development?
This is a representative example of what has not been achieved.
The resolution of the Barcelona Summit mentioned sustainability 103 times.
Are there any higher offers?
The Valencia Summit was a success in that it took place.
I know that the climate in the Middle East was not the most favourable, but we were not even able to press ahead with one of the few tangible priorities of the Spanish Presidency, the Euro-Mediterranean Bank.

With regard to transatlantic relations, it has already been said - Mr Poettering said this himself - that we have never had so many ongoing disputes with the USA, such as, for example, the trade and industry issues, the failure to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, the divergent positions on the Middle East, the belligerent position of the USA towards the International Criminal Court, which makes them feel that they can threaten us with intervening if a member of the American military is put on trial in the Netherlands.
It looks as if the States no longer respect us on the world stage.
I shall conclude, Mr President, with a comment on the institutional reforms: the world has become a very complicated place, globalisation requires increasingly strong global institutions and policies that are increasingly close to the citizens, but the Spanish Presidency - and it genuinely pains me to say this - has been characterised by contradictory and misguided responses to these challenges and in this area: more renationalisation, less European government; and this will not help us to solve any of the problems facing Europe.
Cutting back on the powers of our common institutions is a defensive reaction that can only lead to failure.
This is, Mr President, the most sordid form of nationalism, and 'More Europe' means less nationalism, both of the old style and of the new.
To conclude, it could be said that, to date, we are quite dissatisfied, but that we would like nothing more than to change our minds and, in the days remaining, in the final stretch, for you to surprise us and for more light to appear and for some shadows to vanish.
As I said to President Aznar on 16 January in this very Parliament, I should like nothing more than to be able to congratulate you when it is all over.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, first of all, I should share a saying with you.
Pessimists are usually right, but progress is made thanks to optimists.
I think this is the attitude we should adopt with regard to the forthcoming Council in Seville. There are a number of crucial points on the agenda for that summit.
Topics on which clear and tangible progress must actually be made are the immigration issue, enlargement and the Council reforms.
As enlargement will be debated this afternoon, I shall only make a brief reference to it now.
In the past six months, a number of government leaders, including Prime Ministers Aznar and Blair, have come up with proposals on immigration.
Remarkably, they have not done so before now.
Where were they in the past three years following the agreements of Tampere?
Indeed, since then, the Council has made little real progress following the highly verbose phraseology of space and freedom, security and justice.
If the Council is so keen to keep this responsibility all to itself - after all, we as MEPs are only being heard out of politeness - it should also render account of its own role and responsibility.
In fact, I should at this stage share with you an embarrassing example of the Council's tardiness: the package of measures which this House adopted at the proposal of Mr Graham Watson around Christmas in order to find an effective European answer to the terrorist threats.
The Ministers for Justice and Home Affairs have still not taken an effective decision on this matter.
The immigration proposals, as these reach us via the media, very much smack of a cosy PR exercise between Great Britain and Spain.
In all honesty, who expects a great deal of good to come from Her Majesty's ship 'Ark Royal' sailing up and down the Mediterranean?
Surely this will not be the ark that immigrants are waiting to board?
No, we would be much better off looking into realistic, effective and, at the same time, forceful measures in order to achieve a common asylum and immigration policy.
I would refer to the ideas of the Belgian Prime Minister, Mr Verhofstadt, on this matter.
A number of his points have already been raised at Laeken, but unfortunately, they were apparently surplus to requirements at the time.
We must set up a true common asylum and immigration policy.
Crucial in this is, first of all, that immigration policy is linked to an integration policy and anti-discrimination policy.
These are not self-contained issues.
When a policy of this kind is set up, a great deal of attention should go to fundamental rights and freedoms.
Central is therefore also parliamentary control and co-legislation.
In addition, the Commission's right of initiative and a majority decision-making process in the Council should not be absent; that much is obvious.
In the policy itself, the focus should be on the fight against human trafficking and illegal immigration.
The President of the Commission mentioned it a moment ago: plans are already drawn up for illegal immigration.
What is needed, is implementation rather than clever new ideas.
This can only be done properly if the external borders are closely monitored, whereby one common European border police force must be able to assist, where necessary.
In the light of this, I should, in fact, share with you my serious concerns regarding control of the future eastern borders.
As far as I am concerned, no compromises should be made in that respect.
Mr President, you will have noticed that I do not always have a high opinion of the functioning of the Council.
I am therefore delighted to see that various proposals will be submitted in Seville which relate to the Council's reform.
For the Liberal Group, it is of huge importance that the Council should, crucially, be democratic, open and subject to supervision.
This is why I call for the Community method across the board and for Council meetings, in which the Council acts as co-legislator, to be open to the public.
In fact, this openness should start with enlargement, so that everyone can see what the Council's common position is on the matter.
As things stand at the moment, we are receiving such unsatisfactory - and some would claim coloured - information from the Council and also from the Commission, in fact, that one would almost consider hiring independent experts in order to find out what the true state of affairs in the candidate countries is or how the negotiations are really going.
You will really have to give us, along with the European citizen, better information, so that we can continue to trust in the role of the Commission and the Council.
On a final note, I should like to say that I am not so fond of pessimists, but the saying is there for a reason.
They are sometimes right.
We could say, nothing will come of Seville, but we will not.
I should like to say to the Spanish Presidency: show your bright, optimistic side.
Do what you are good at: grab the bull by the horns and you will have us on your side.
Pave the way for real progress, for that is what people want and what is desperately needed.
Mr President, firstly, I wish to pick up on a couple of points in the joint resolution, which my group will not be supporting, points which seem to be missing from the speeches we have heard this morning: for example, the welcome given to the International Criminal Court while regretting the position of the United States in seeking to protect its own citizens from it.
As we have heard today, justice should be universal and not dependent on nationality.
The European Parliament has also taken the view in the resolution that the Union should be taking a strong, leading role at the Johannesburg Summit, as it did on the Kyoto Protocol.
However, to do that it needs a commitment to sustainability in all aspects of its work, and that includes integration of social and environmental factors into its economic and trade policies.
We have to remember that without a healthy environment we have no sound foundation for our economies.
So we trust that will be remembered, as promised by Commission President Prodi, in the better governance arrangements and we are looking forward to the policy proofing and the impact on the social and environmental dimensions he mentioned today.
To be credible at that sustainability summit, we also need to demonstrate that we understand the importance of development and its link to certain aspects of immigration policy.
I was pleased to hear the Spanish minister referring to issues about deep poverty.
That is in marked contrast to what we have been hearing from the Spanish Prime Minister over the last few weeks.
The European Union wants a mobile, flexible workforce.
It is a priority in our employment policy, so why do we insist on making legal immigration for all skilled sectors virtually impossible?
What we have been hearing over the last few weeks and today sounds to us simply like moving the walls of fortress Europe and looking for stronger building materials, including using the idea of economic clout - such as development aid - in our attempts to have other countries police their borders more effectively to stop people leaving.
The countries of eastern and central Europe are joining the Union to escape that sort of policy.
We are also concerned at some of the proposed reforms to the Council's inner workings - the Development Council, for example, is to be absorbed into a wider grouping.
But we welcome the reassurance we have heard today that the reforms will not touch matters for the IGC and the Convention, because it is essential that the Council does not become the legislature and executive and break the current balance between the institutions.
We welcome the commitment to greater transparency and trust that this will not just be for the Council but for the public as well.
Mr President, although I greatly admire Mr de Miguel, I am sorry that he is replacing Mr Aznar here today.
I am sorry because it is Mr Aznar who has undoubtedly been the architect of the first variable-geometry Presidency of the European Union.
I have looked through my notes and read the initial speeches of the Presidency and I have been surprised at the tenuous link between his statement of priorities and the activities of the European Union in this six-month term.
I do not know whether this is a subtle strategy to achieve the unstated objective of reaching a common position on legal and illegal immigration or whether it is an objective devised to cover up other gaps and camouflage itself in the wave of xenophobia sweeping Europe.
The Seville conclusions should not focus solely on policing and crime-reduction, but should include the beneficial effects of immigration.
I hope that immigration policies that respect human rights and fundamental freedoms, and that ensure equal treatment for immigrants, will be promoted in Seville.
Another problem is that the inclusion of immigration has disguised the disappearance of important issues such as enlargement.
In January Mr Aznar applied the motto 'More Europe' to enlargement.
It is now impossible to hide a certain amount of disappointment that has been felt, at least to date.
The miserly proposal by the Commission has been rejected by most countries.
Furthermore, the block by four States in the General Affairs Council last Monday highlights the extent of the problem.
A large number of Member States want a bigger market but not more Europe.
The reasons for this are budgetary and the objective is to dismantle the limited common policies.
Yes, Mr de Miguel, 'More Europe', a bigger Europe, but not a hollow, empty Europe.
Similarly, in January, Mr Aznar literally demonstrated his intention to create an area of greater economic prosperity to safeguard the European social model, but the Barcelona Council and the policies his government intends to apply in Spain show evidence to the contrary.
Sadly, the fears we had prior to the Barcelona Council can now be confirmed.
The Presidency has led a vision of Europe that avoids including the idea of public service in European integration, which, in its own interests, confuses privatisation and deregulation processes with liberalisation measures, that advocates labour policies which, in practice, establish regressive distribution of the social product, threaten stability in employment and contribute to pockets of exclusion and underemployment and sanction the zero deficit at the cost of perpetuating social deficit.
Between Barcelona and Seville, the Spanish Government has been informed that a general strike has been called.
There is no alternative, as its labour reform, which eliminates protection against unemployment and reduces redundancy pay, is another sign of what the Spanish Presidency means by making the labour market more flexible.
This is a model which, far from promoting social participation and cooperation for the greater good, places further pressure on the least protected sectors, blames the victims of the model itself and increases the possibilities of social exclusion and marginalisation.
In the face of economic uncertainty in the labour market, the economic policies of the Member States need to be discussed and coordinated in order to boost the economy, make the margins for budgetary action more flexible and to promote cohesion and the European social model.
The European Union may be an essential marker for world economic growth, but in order to achieve this, and for an upturn to become reality, the economic policy must change course.
The euro, the internal market, common policies and an increased Community budget must contribute to establishing an effective European economic government that is capable of encouraging economic growth and sustainable development, improving income distribution and achieving full employment.
We cannot go around singing the praises of 'More Europe' whilst we are seeing a deterioration in social policies or fewer European policies.
Mr de Miguel, we do need more Europe, but, most of all, we also need a better Europe.
Mr President, firstly I would like to express my sincere thanks and appreciation to the Spanish Presidency for its very professional and successful approach to its many responsibilities and obligations.
I note with satisfaction that we did not have any embarrassing incidents during the Presidency, as we have had in other recent presidencies.
Under the Spanish Presidency, negotiations for future European enlargement are continuing at a strong pace.
The European Union is currently dealing with difficult areas such as agricultural affairs, regional policy and budgetary matters.
We all know the moral arguments for enlargement of the Union.
Developing democratic and civil societies, respecting the rule of law and promoting human rights are central goals of the Union.
The European Union is a political model that has helped to bring peace to our continent.
This process will be furthered, not diminished, by the enlargement of the Union.
But we must all reflect on the key practical procedure being used to streamline the enlargement of the Union.
In December 2000 European Union leaders agreed a set of Treaty reforms in Nice which they considered would be the best procedure for bringing about enlargement.
Already 13 out of the 15 countries in the European Union have ratified the provisions of the Treaty of Nice.
If the Treaty of Nice is not ratified by all 15 Member States, enlargement will undoubtedly be delayed.
If the Treaty of Nice is rejected by one Member State it is not valid law, because the proposed Treaty changes do not command the unanimous support of all the Member States.
Delaying enlargement would have a very negative effect on the development of the Union.
Prior to the birth of the EEC in 1957, Europe was bedevilled by hatred and division.
The European Union has now ensured that the tools of war have been put aside in favour of the development of new policies.
The European Union is not simply about mutual economic progress.
Thanks to the European Union, Europe's past has been put aside in the interests of peace and prosperity for all the peoples of Europe.
That is not to say that the Irish people do not have clear concerns which they want addressed before any further referendum on the Treaty of Nice.
The majority want assurances that Ireland's traditional military neutrality will be fully protected and respected by all Member States of the European Union.
It is very important that a declaration is agreed by all European Union leaders, spelling out in unequivocal terms that Ireland's military neutrality will be respected now and in the future.
Irish troops have always served in peace-keeping and humanitarian operations under the auspices of the United Nations.
The provisions of the Treaty of Nice do not change that.
The situation is not altered by Ireland's participation in the European Rapid Reaction Force, but it is still very important and politically necessary for a declaration to be made in Seville expressing the support of EU governments for this special foreign policy issue, which means so much to so many people in Ireland.
Finally, the European Union is the natural home of the Irish, both geographically and politically.
We recognise that standing alone is of little benefit when international cooperation is increasing.
The European Union must ensure that the interests of each individual citizen are protected at all times.
Mr President, I am able to support the separation of foreign and security policy from other EU cooperation and the restriction regarding the constitution of the Council, but I must disassociate myself from all the attempts to give the larger countries a greater share of presidencies and posts.
All countries must be equal in the EU - before, during and after the Seville Summit.
The proposed reform concerning transparency does not seriously open the Council of Ministers' work up to the public, let alone to the elected representatives in the European Parliament and the national parliaments.
What is wanted is an open debate on Commission proposals when these are first tabled, and it is true that transparency will embrace all proposals.
It is not, however, until the end of the process that voting will be opened up and, because only a small number of proposals are voted on in practice, this part of the exercise is purely cosmetic.
We shall learn no more than we do at present when the Council publishes approximately 50 records of the votes per year.
The problem is that 70% of decisions are finalised by the Council's working parties and 15% at meetings of COREPER ambassadors. Only 15% of the proposals are put before the Council, and we do not have figures for what percentage ministers in actual fact see.
The requirement in this area must be that all elected representatives, at least, have full right of access to documents as part of the legislative process.
The Commission has promised us that we can be shown Members' contributions to the Council's working parties.
I am pleased that, yesterday at the Conference of Presidents, the Spanish Foreign Minister, Mr Piquet, promised us full access to the Council's working parties during the codecision process, and so that is a good beginning.
Why not decide that every EU proposal is to be put before the national parliaments and go through the same process as national bills.
A purely national bill can always be altered, whereas an EU bill can never be altered.
That is precisely why an EU bill should not be debated any less thoroughly than those bills which permit the rapid adjustment of errors or unintended consequences.
It could be assumed that the right of veto under the Luxembourg Accords should continue to apply, perhaps in the variant proposed by Georges Berthoin, Monnet's right-hand man, whereby the prime minister is obliged to defend a veto at the next summit.
It might also be required that a national parliament's decision to use the veto be made openly.
It must not be made easy to block a proposal, but use of the veto must be an option if the EU is to consist of cooperation between parliamentary democracies in free countries.
That is our wish in a Europe of democracies and diversities.
Mr President, I would like to focus on the first theme introduced by President Prodi of better regulation and better organisation.
While, in private enterprises, better organisation might be seen as a decisive factor for the life or future of the company, I feel that the priority for a democratic institution should not be to have leaner, more transparent, more effective procedures but simply to have more democratic procedures.
I am not saying we do not need lean, transparent, effective procedures too but that there is a problem of priorities.
I feel that expressions such as 'improve and simplify legislation', 'give practical substance to the concept of citizenship', 'improving legislative technique' and 'working faster and better' are liable to be meaningless and even to serve as fig leaves covering up the lack of democracy in the European Union's legislative and decision-making process.
I feel that Parliament must demand one thing and one thing alone: that the Council of Ministers cease to be the only legislative body of so-called democratic institutions in the world to meet in secret.
This is the crucial thing!
Not just Parliament but the European citizen too is in the dark about the Council's legislative process.
If this is conceded, it will be a step forwards; if it is not, none of the rest - not even more effectiveness or better organisation - will make any difference to the European Union's decision-making process.
Another issue I would like to focus on is the foreign and internal policy aspects of the anti-terrorism alliance.
Here, too, I believe that the European institutions have been disregarding the guiding principles of democracy and the rule of law for too long in the name of combating terrorism.
We all agree on the need for a balance between these two requirements, but I feel that a sufficient balance has not yet been found.
I will mention one place, Chechnya, by way of example.
As regards Chechnya, the European Union and the Member States have shown themselves to be incapable of consistency.
I could mention other things such as measures for combating terrorism, measures which have been introduced: what has been done has been done in a disturbingly unbalanced way, in the name of security but very often with disregard for human rights, civil liberties and democracy.
The final issue is that of immigration.
I appreciate the efforts which are being made, but I feel that there is a problem of priorities in respect of this issue too.
We cannot expect to continue to block imports of goods, farm produce and basic manufactured goods from the poorer developing countries throughout the world and, at the same time, cherish the fond hope that we are managing the issue of legal and illegal immigration properly.
We are still in a situation where the customs tariffs imposed on imports from the poorer countries in the world are greater than the aid we give those countries.
In this situation, immigration is in danger of exploding uncontrollably, and so even security and control measures which may, in themselves, be appropriate are actually in danger of sparking off even greater illegal activity and of placing us in a position where we are even less able to control the phenomenon.
Mr President, I believe that in these debates in preparation for the summits, it is important that we remain realistic and take account of two things: first, that the Presidency-in-Office - which in my opinion has been unjustly attacked because destruction is far easier than construction and criticism is far easier than contributing something positive - has neither a philosopher's stone nor a magic potion to solve all the problems of the European Union to the satisfaction of this Parliament: the other 14 Member States are also involved and all have a contribution to make.
Certainly, some of these criticisms reminded me of what Oscar Wilde used to say about bad literary critics: they never enjoy any success, despite having been to all the opening nights.
Secondly, it is important to bear in mind that summits give rise to a number of expectations that are not always fulfilled.
I therefore think it should be pointed out that what is most important about a summit - and this is what we are hoping for from Seville - is that it can generate enough political momentum for the project of European union to progress.
In this respect, the lines of thought announced by President Prodi on behalf of the European Commission seem to me to be particularly suitable.
Leaving aside the subject of the Barcelona mandate and the issue of accession - which will be the subject of a later debate this afternoon, and which will clearly show where the real difficulties of accession lie, as they are neither in the Presidency-in-Office nor in the Commission - I would like to express my satisfaction at the reference made by the President-in-Office of the Council to the fact that Seville will not interfere with the work of the Convention.
I believe it would be desirable to discuss some of the matters relating to the reform of the Council in detail.
Perhaps the representative of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council could talk to us about these different functions or mandates of the Foreign Affairs Council and the European Affairs Council and how they plan to proceed more effectively, without dedicating themselves to negotiating every last detail of previous debates, and giving political momentum to the subject on the table.
Mr President, I would like to end by referring briefly to immigration, which is a very serious, urgent topic that is particularly relevant at a time when various Member States are adopting individual policies, some of which are contradictory.
I therefore believe that we must clearly support the objectives expressed here by the Commission and by the Presidency-in-Office of the Council, emphasising two aspects: first, that this issue should not be used for the purposes of engaging in manipulative rhetoric, and secondly that we must find real solutions to real problems and try to strip this debate of ideological waffle.
It is important that we strike a balance between the European Union's tradition of welcome and hospitality - bearing in mind our values, as expressed in the fitting phrase 'immigrants might not have papers, but they shall have dignity? - and its actual possibilities, which are not unlimited.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Mr President of the Commission, both we in this House and the people of Europe are waiting for the Council in Seville to send out clear, sensible messages on asylum, immigration and the integration of immigrants in Europe.
Europe must continue, for ethical reasons, to stand by the principles of a humanitarian asylum policy.
We must continue to make our citizens understand that we need immigrants.
But we still have to prove to them that we can manage and control immigration and this - as the Spanish Presidency quite rightly maintains - means involving our neighbours, especially the countries from which illegal immigrants come and the countries they pass through.
Most importantly, however, we must all join forces in fighting the people who rake in huge profits from trafficking in human beings.
Mrs Rosa DÃ­ez GonzÃ¡lez spoke of the Spanish Presidency's drum roll.
This comment probably applies to us all, given the drum rolls we play all over the place.
But if we take a close look at what the European Union as a whole has done to combat trafficking in human beings, then I for one see very little.
Some Members of the House recently visited Bucharest with their national counterparts and went to an anti-cross-border crime centre.
This centre is supported by a few Member States, it is supported by the Americans, but it does not receive any European funding.
Worse still, we are only now just slowly beginning to make contact with Europol or rather Europol is only now just slowly beginning to take any real action here.
I think what the citizens of Europe expect is a positive immigration policy that also cracks down on the increase in human trafficking and other criminal activities.
We also, however, have to give the people who come to our countries the opportunity to integrate into our society.
By carving out a living for themselves - and many are involved in setting up new companies - they increase prosperity for all of us.
This is not just a game of heads or tails, with either the immigrants winning or the locals winning, we all stand to gain from a reasonable, targeted immigration and integration policy if we would only just get on with it and put everything Commissioner Vitorino and the Council have proposed into practice.
As has already been said, however, we also expect Seville to send out some sort of message about the reform of the Council.
As Mr Poettering said, things have gone a bit quiet on this front and there are rumours that no one really wants to do anything about it.
However, as the members of the Council themselves know, the Council is in urgent need of reform, especially in its legislative capacity, mainly to make it more efficient and transparent.
You only have to compare the openness and accessibility of this House with the situation in the Council.
A few concessions at least to transparency and openness would not go amiss and would both serve the Council's interests and enhance acceptance of the European legislative process as a whole in the eyes of the European public.
Finally, I should just like to point out that this House and my group are prepared to push ahead with further reform of the European legislative process.
In the meantime, as the President of the Commission mentioned, the Commission has tabled a number of proposals in this direction.
I should like to thank you and your colleagues, Mr President of the Commission, for adopting many - not all but a great many - of the thoughts and ideas which have emanated from this Chamber.
But now, as my colleague has already said - we need to set up an interinstitutional working party and come to an agreement here.
And in order to do so, we need the Council on board.
Mr President-in-Office, I fail to understand, many of us in this House fail to understand how it is that Prime Minister Aznar made a clear promise, that you made a clear promise in this House and the diplomatic and official representatives of the Spanish Presidency have done nothing about it; they have in fact blocked this working party right down the line.
I have to say that, as a Member of Parliament, I wonder what counts.
Are the promise and the statement made by the President-in-Office and by you what counts or is official blocking during the course of implementation what counts?
Surely the political decision-makers should have the last, clear word.
Mr President, little new action on immigration and asylum will emerge from Seville.
The Tampere agenda had three elements: control, harmonisation and integration.
The Council has eagerly legislated on the first with half a dozen laws and a thirty-page action plan on illegal immigration, but it has lagged on harmonisation for a common asylum system and integration of minorities and migrants.
That is where leaders need to give ministers a big kick but instead all they will really do is ratchet up the rhetoric of repression and hostility of fortress Europe.
The most despicable and stupid proposal is the denial of development aid to countries which fail to stem migration, thereby making them even poorer and generating a new exodus of desperate people.
The reality is that far from promoting the greater security Europe needs, the illiberal Blair-Aznar-Berlusconi trio risks creating greater threats for European citizens by their hysterical, populist and macho responses to current challenges.
By their abusive hysteria about illegal immigrants and asylum seekers they demonise foreigners and generate more race tensions and suspicions.
By their big brother extension of powers for police and security services to monitor people's email, Internet and telephone records they menace individual privacy.
By banning organisations like the Kurdish PKK and Batasuna they remove political outlets for dissent as an alternative to terrorism.
Accession countries are encouraged to seek EU membership as a beacon of democracy, liberty and tolerance but the Blair-Aznar-Berlusconi trio are making a mockery of that.
Mr President, I would like to welcome Mr Prodi and thank him for his words. I thoroughly regret the fact that the Spanish Prime Minister is not present at this, the final plenary sitting of Parliament under the Spanish Presidency.
Next, I would like to say that the six priorities cited by the Spanish Presidency at the beginning of this semester have, in effect, been reduced to two: achieving a fortress Europe and militarising democratic life; and making Europe a police state.
In fact, Prime Minister Aznar currently wants to become the chief of police and would also like to achieve a Europe of States which stands in opposition to the Commission and Parliament.
Among the proposals he has made for the reform of the Council, I am not sure what I should highlight most: his arrogance or his impertinence.
Under the Spanish Presidency, all our problems are worse than six months ago.
And Mr Aznar sees himself as permanent President of the European Union.
The Irish referendum is neither planned nor completed; nor is enlargement, which is, furthermore, in an even more confused state; nor is the common agricultural policy, nor the common fisheries policy, where he failed to understand the real tension that exists between the northern and southern countries; immigration and asylum are confused with criminality and nothing has been done on the structural funds, on the European budget, on full employment, etc.
In fact, there is nothing left of Tampere, Lisbon or Gothenburg.
We should ask ourselves what is left of the spirit of these summits.
In fact, what is left is a caricature in which JosÃ© MarÃ­a Aznar, the Spanish Prime Minister, plays the leading role.
Europe is a powder keg waiting to be lit.
This remarkable analysis was made recently by a Dutch columnist.
According to him, people have been dissatisfied with the European Union for years.
The successes of populist parties across Europe demonstrate that the spark can all of a sudden ignite.
I share this concern, although I hope it is unfounded.
Effectively functioning European institutions are therefore of the utmost importance.
Organisational problems should not be the cause of stagnating decision-making or consultation.
This applies not in the least to the Council.
As an encounter of national ministers and prime ministers, this institution is, after all, closest to the people.
At the same time, this institution seems to be suffering most from organisational defects following enlargement.
What can be done about this?
A number of practical proposals have been made here and elsewhere, including, for example, splitting up the General Affairs Council into a Coordinating Council and a CFSP Council.
Similarly, the restriction of the permitted number of participants in a national Council delegation is a reasonable option.
However, more far-reaching proposals, such as abandoning the rolling presidency system, are also doing the rounds.
These proposals are only acceptable if the balance between the countries is not lost and also if the national administrations remain closely enough involved with Europe.
Indeed, States that are equivalent and involved form the keystone of the European Union.
Whoever denies this might well be the one to light the fuse to the powder keg.
Mr President, when the European Council convenes at Seville, two years and a few months, or four presidential terms, will have passed since the Lisbon Summit and its ambitious decisions to make the Union the world's most competitive economic area by the year 2010.
It would be wrong and disparaging to say that nothing has been done.
Bringing modern IT skills within the scope of lifelong learning, which is Commissioner Liikanen's department, has, for example, already made progress in many countries.
However, in these two years, one of which has been overshadowed by the recession in the United States of America, we have only lagged behind the United States.
GNP there has grown faster and unemployment is less than 6%, while it is more like in excess of 10% in the Union.
Not nearly enough has happened, therefore.
Without going over all the sectors one by one, privatisation, the genuine opening up of markets, and the removal of barriers to restructuring in industry and services have still not come about.
The job market remains structurally rigid, keeping the unemployed at bay and protecting those with jobs.
The reasons for this inactivity are to be found in the Union's nation states which the Commission has not managed to enjoin or tempt to embrace economic reforms.
Short-term real, but also often imagined, interests have come before the common interest.
There are always elections going on in some country, and reforms become paralysed for the space of a year.
The inflexible nature of the labour market, the maintenance of industrial structures in a way that hinders competition, and the non-existent policy the countries of the Union have on immigration and asylum have led to the sort of dissatisfaction that is now breaking out and which has broken out in recent elections in the form of protests by both the young and the old in Europe unable to find work.
In connection with this too is the feeling many foreigners legally resident in many countries in the Union have that they are being discriminated against.
I no longer intend to blame the socialist governments that have been edged aside. I am also addressing my plea and warning to the centre-right governments that have come to power via the Commission and the Council.
Unless you have the courage to make reforms you can forget the grand words of Lisbon and the future picture of a Europe as the world's most competitive area! Sometimes I really miss Margaret Thatcher, the fruits of whose policies Tony Blair still enjoys.
Economical, clean energy is one basic requirement for the economic growth of sustainable development.
It is a pleasure for me to praise the political decision-makers in my own country, Finland, for their courage in keeping nuclear energy clearly alongside other forms of development in electrical energy.
The decision was that of a small country but was just the sort of courageous start that was needed, although the cacophony that opposes this and wants to put the brakes on progress is loud.
The country to hold the Presidency, Spain, is to be congratulated now on giving the shaping of a common asylum and immigration policy a key position at Seville.
It is necessary, because a Europe whose population is ageing should not be turning away immigrants but integrating them in a controlled way as new Europeans.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to remind you that this - as you are doubtless aware - is the European Parliament.
I am telling you this because in this Parliament we are familiar with the Tampere agenda; we know what was decided there.
I would like to remind you of this because it does not exactly coincide with what you have told us.
The Tampere agenda comprised four sections with regard to the common management of immigration; one was family reunification.
The Council has already eliminated one proposal.
Another is on the parliamentary agenda but not on the Council's.
A policy for the management of migration flows, a policy for establishing legal immigration channels, clear, transparent, not drowning in a sea of bureaucracy from 15 different legal systems.
A Commission proposal is being considered in Parliament, and it is not on the Council agenda.
An integration policy that translates into a Commission proposal to create a statute for long-term immigrants.
This is not on the Council agenda.
We are in total chaos.
The Social Affairs Council has approved the free movement of immigrant workers, which is prevented by immigration laws in 15 Member States.
This is not on the Seville agenda.
With regard to the external agenda: in Tampere, we spoke of co-development, the joint management of migration flows, and you told me that in Seville there is a tiny part referring to the threat to third countries.
Co-management is not on the Seville agenda.
The fight against illegal immigration, with which my group and I are entirely in agreement, appears in a somewhat esoteric form.
You say that the Commission plan for the joint control of external borders is of particular importance.
We do not understand that here, and nor does the public.
Are you going to debate this?
Why would this be the first thing on the Council agenda?
Not only this, but the national governments, over the past two years and eight months, have implemented differing national policies in this area.
You talk of reviewing the Tampere commitments.
Save yourself the trouble - it will not take long, since no progress has been made with regard to immigration in two years and eight months.
As the Council, you are responsible by omission for not having governed Community policy, and that, Mr President, is extremely serious.
You are replacing consensus on solutions with making joint gestures that are incapable of resolving problems.
You are replacing the adoption of legislation and policies to manage migration flows with writing notes and press releases that contribute to creating a problematic climate.
Do not be surprised that the citizens view the European Union as a problem and not as the solution it should be.
Mr President, I shall very briefly put three observations to the President-in-Office of the Council, the President of the Commission, and my fellow Members, the first of which concerns immigration.
I think the evidence should lead us to believe that we should establish in Seville a policy that has been asked for since Tampere, that is truly effective at European level, that has a European dimension and that also establishes and intensifies a real political dimension to the European Union. This is a subject which, through the intergovernmental method, has sadly been postponed for too long.
The second observation I would like to make is that account should also be taken of the external dimension that causes immigration, and that the cooperation mechanisms must therefore be strengthened far more than they have been to date.
I believe that one topic should be resolved in Seville: the evident distancing of the positions expressed by the Commission over the past few months from the Commission proposals and their reception by the Council.
I think that, specifically, Mr de Miguel has commented on the importance attached to the Convention; it would be good to wait for the results of the Convention before making a series of proposals which seem to rather distort the context in which the Intergovernmental Conference would subsequently have to state its position.
Lastly, allow me to note that in Laeken the seats of many agencies of the European Union were not decided on.
I would like to know whether this area will be covered in Seville.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Mr President of the Commission, a brief word on the Kashmir conflict.
This conflict over one of the most beautiful mountain regions in the world now needs to be addressed on a long-term basis.
The need for a solution has never been greater or more promising that it is now; but this dialogue between India and Pakistan will only get started if everyone on the sidelines, the EU, the USA, Russia and the UN, treats both countries on the same footing.
The explosive force of the Kashmir conflict, which is rooted in historic events - already three wars in the region, terrorism, propaganda, rampant nationalism and Al Qaeda - could be disastrous, but it could also be restrained with the help of moderate forces in the area and a policy from outside which respects both sides.
I warn you - and this is very important today, especially following the war in Afghanistan - not to take sides.
Mr President, we live at a vital juncture of European and international affairs.
My delegation strongly supports the enlargement process although as part of the institutional reform process designed to bring about our declared goal of a wider, looser Europe and an unwinding of the CAP and CFP.
We also believe that the central eastern European countries, having thrown off the mantle of Soviet-dominated communism from which we in the West were unable to protect them, and for which we can help to atone by welcoming them back into the family of European nations, do not simply wish to see the construction of another Brussels-led superstate.
We also welcome the rapprochement between NATO and Russia which now shares a common agenda with the EU in the fight against global terrorism and the goal of becoming a functioning market economy as a member of WTO and at peace with its EU neighbours.
We strongly support a responsible attitude towards our environment.
However, we do have a number of problems with the resolution, ranging from our opposition to the Treaty of Nice as a prerequisite of enlargement to rejection of a common asylum and immigration policy, which we believe is a prerogative of the Member States, although we strongly favour bilateral cooperation designed to safeguard the integrity of our borders.
We remain deeply sceptical that joint Euro-border guards would work in practice and oppose the principle of the European security and defence policy both as a duplication and as a means of de-coupling Europe from our US partners in NATO.
We also believe there is a danger that the International Criminal Court will be used to make political mischief by parties hostile to our American allies.
However, we welcome calls for restraint and de-escalation between India and Pakistan over disputed Kashmir and note encouraging signs that President Musharraf has finally heeded calls to reign in Islamic terrorists which his regime has until very recently supported, terrorists who have recently committed atrocities against Jamu and Kashmiri civilians and even the Indian parliament.
He should arrest and hand over those committing such acts to India for trial and justice.
Nevertheless we all wish the summiteers in Seville every success in the challenges that lie ahead.
Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, I intend to confine my comments to the conflict between India and Pakistan.
Mr President-in-Office, you rightly noted in your speech that this conflict threatens to destabilise and endanger the whole region.
Concern about this immense danger has brought all of us responsible for foreign policy in nearly all the groups to a common position, as expressed in the resolution on Seville.
We call in this resolution for both countries to make every possible effort to deescalate the situation and join in constructive dialogue in a bid to resolve the conflict as quickly as possible.
Both sides clearly have a responsibility to defuse the conflict, which is why I welcome the measures taken over the past few days by India, which has decided to lift the ban on Pakistani aeroplanes using Indian airspace, appoint a high commissioner for Islamabad and order its warships back to port.
We also expect President Musharaf to continue and step up his efforts to stop the infiltration of terrorists via the line of control in Kashmir.
If he honours the promises made in his speech on 12 January this year, then a huge step will have been made towards resolving the conflict.
I was in Kashmir a few weeks ago and went to an Indian post 3 400 metres up on the line of control, so I know what I am talking about.
The war against terrorism can in fact only be effectively waged on the Pakistani side.
Pakistan is responsible not just for catching terrorists before they reach the border, but also for meting out appropriate punishment and taking them out of circulation.
One last point which plays a very important part in the whole dispute is the need to strengthen democracy.
India is a democracy and we hope that Pakistan will be too if free elections are held in the autumn and put a democratic government in power.
Mr President, Mr de Miguel, now that we are more or less a family, and in the interminable minute I have to speak for, I am not going to talk to you about immigration.
Now it seems that everything you said to our generation about how good immigrants were does not apply to today's immigrants.
On the subject of issuing orders, I would ask you, who order so much by decree, please to ask the President, Mr Aznar, to bring here, to where things are decided, all that power-wielding that surrounds his actions in government in Spain, so that the proposal adopted by the College of Commissioners for the reform of the common fisheries policy does not go ahead, since it is a proposal which will send the shattered Spanish fishing fleet to the bottom of the sea.
Prevent your party colleague, Mr Fischler, that friend of the farmers and fishermen of the south, from getting his own way.
Do not invite him to Madrid - there are no fishermen, fishing ports or ice factories there. Invite him to Barbate, to Isla Cristina, where there are fishermen.
Show him the results of his disastrous negotiation with Morocco and let him imagine what will happen to these European citizens if his proposal goes ahead.
If you do not do so, the firmness you demonstrate there will be of little use when decisions are made here.
Make a firm commitment against this fisheries proposal during the Seville Council and in that way, in my view, you will have salvaged the Spanish Presidency.
