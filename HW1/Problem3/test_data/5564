Until then, open up all meetings where laws are adopted.
Put every document on the Internet.
Allow the national parliaments to vote on the annual legislation programme.
Allow the Commissioners to appear in the European Committees of their national parliaments and thus to be in touch with their national democracies.
Promise that you will never again give Belgium's support to a law that has not first achieved a majority in either the Belgian Parliament or the European Parliament.
Â Â  Mr President, the European Union today faces a fundamental choice: whether or not to take on an additional set of tasks, expand its authority, and ultimately collapse under the weight of too much business.
In my opinion the rejected draft Constitutional Treaty offers this very prospect.
Our limitations have recently made themselves painfully clear when dealing with conflicts of interest between Member States in the context of the northern gas pipeline project.
The European Union was powerless not for lack of a constitution, but for lack of political will.
There is, however, an alternative: let us concentrate on the specific matters that are already on the table, such as improving the operation of the common market and the euro zone and improving cooperation between countries on security and on internal affairs, and ultimately on cohesion policy.
The shorter the list, the easier the public will find it to understand our aims.
MrÂ Poettering, please refrain from blackmailing us with the choice between an energy policy with the Constitutional Treaty or none at all.
Let us start discussions on what really does bind us, let us write these aims down and then implement them.
This would provide a good basis for an amended treaty.
Yet let us not do it by hastily and arrogantly incorporating each policy into procedures and institution.
Let us do it without including tasks that are impossible to implement at Community level.
Let us first find the basis and substance for a common policy, or in other words what actually binds us, because no procedures on earth are capable of creating a common position where no such substance exists.
Â Â  An outstanding performance, MrÂ Verhovstadt.
If IÂ were aÂ judge in aÂ figure-skating competition, IÂ would give very good marks for artistic performance, but less on the technical aspect.
You wondered and even asked a question as to why the citizens of Europe do not trust the European Union.
IÂ can give you the example of Slovakia and the new Member States: we had to meet very strict criteria for full membership.
We have been full members for two years now, and you can see whether the ideals of the European Union have been fulfilled.
Restrictions on free movement, transitional periods limit employment opportunities; the Services Directive has not been adopted, inadequate and incomplete access to health services, etcetera. Is it possible for one of the founding Member States, France, not to support the Constitutional Treaty, with Strasbourg being the seat of the European Parliament and the former French president, ValÃ©ry Giscard dÂŽEstaing, chairing the Convention to draw up the constitutional treaty?
All of these are questions in which our citizens see aÂ disparity between words and deeds.
Have you thought about the real situation as regards meeting the targets of the Lisbon Strategy?
Mr. Prime Minister, IÂ ask you, wake up!
We are already half-way through the period, and we should have had results by now.
It is too late in the day to speak about what should have been done.
At least say in your closing speech what needs to be done now, what needs to be done tomorrow, and what needs to be done in aÂ monthâs time.
Â Â  Mr President, I, in turn, should like to express my delight at this debate, which I hope will be the first of many, because I think that in debates with heads of government, Parliament can also do its bit to get things going.
I rejoice at MrÂ Verhofstadtâs coming here to set the ball rolling, for he is indeed one of the people who made an active contribution during the period of reflection.
I broadly support his twin-track approach, which amounts to continuing the ratification process while at the same time taking initiatives rather than resting on our laurels.
I do not see eye to eye with him, though, when he claims that we can meanwhile indulge in unbridled enlargement.
While I am not opposed to enlargement, I do fear that further enlargement without deepening the European Union will lead to something we do not want, namely a free-trade zone.
What I do think is that we should try even harder to explain to our citizens that the right response to what scares them at present, namely the changes and globalisation, is not to withdraw into some sort of economic patriotism or nationalism, but that only a European response is a real response to globalisation; and that this also means that Europe must adjust to the new concept of globalisation and the information society, and we will only succeed if we join forces within Europe.
Indeed, only as one Europe can we be a real global actor that defends our interests and values in this global world of tomorrow.
Our citizens are, at present not yet aware of this; they still believe that they will manage by closing themselves off from the outside world.
We must tell them that globalisation is irreversible, that it will happen without Europe if we do not take a tough line.
We can play a very strong role in globalisation, provided Europe is strong.
Â Â  Mr President, MrÂ Verhofstadt, I should like, while thanking MrÂ Verhofstadt for his excellent and determined speech, to look again at two aspects.
The first aspect is the time factor.
MrÂ Verhofstadt emphasised the problem of the Lisbon process.
We have no time to lose.
Five years for the Community patent is stupid.
Furthermore, I should like to say that the Heads of State or Government have a very great responsibility regarding the financial perspective with, for example, the research programme which has less money, in real terms, in 2007, 2008 and 2009 than in 2006.
There is surely a basic contradiction there between talk and reality.
I think that the method too â open coordination â has been shown to be inadequate.
The instruments of Community policy, therefore, are not supported in the budget.
Consequently, it is not possible to make a policy that is grounded in real circumstances.
The second aspect on which I should like to elaborate, very briefly, of course, is the social aspect.
We have spoken of the rejection of the Constitution.
It is true, and you quite rightly made reference to it, that the social aspect was there 50 years ago: there was hope of social improvement after the war.
Nowadays, people do not have that feeling.
Therefore, one priority would be, in the same way that the Europe of monetary unity was created from the European currency snake, to create a European social snake that would make it possible to realise tangible achievements in this field too.
Â Â  Mr President, the Prime Minster said that we should try for the four-fifths of Member States before the European Council would be able to â or should â discuss the crisis.
But the European Council could, and in my view should, discuss the crisis today.
In June, the summit should set itself a rendezvous with a clear decision towards the end of 2007, to establish a fresh intergovernmental conference with the purpose of modifying and improving the Treaty.
It should seek to ring-fence the first and second parts.
In part three, it should focus on strengthening the economic governance of the Union, advancing the Lisbon Agenda and strengthening the autonomy of the eurozone.
Secondly, it should seek to reform the European social model.
Thirdly, it should aim to upgrade the combating of climate change to establish a good context for the reform of the common agricultural policy and the construction of a common energy policy.
Fourthly, it should speak of the process and threshold of adhesion and flesh out the policy on neighbourhood, which we have in draft form.
Finally, it should complete the revision of the financial system of the EU, to produce a fair, transparent and buoyant budget that will permit us to match financial resources to our policy objectives.
Â Â  Mr President, MrÂ Verhofstadt, I feel I must applaud your resoluteness.
I just have time to comment on one point only: your two-track strategy.
First of all, and I think MrsÂ Frassoni has already said this: âyesâ to the continuation of the ratification process.
Having said that, the two tracks should intersect and intertwine.
I mean that the provisions governing the institutions must be consistent with your political priorities.
Thus, you will not get very far with the Eurogroup process if the decisions are not taken by a qualified majority in fiscal matters, at least on certain issues.
You will not get very far either in matters of foreign policy and defence unless you have a budget that has been granted independent financing.
In this respect, I shall make it clear that I have no problem with the European Army if its purpose is the prevention of conflicts.
Therefore, MrÂ Verhofstadt, we must prepare ourselves to renegotiate the Constitutional Treaty on two or three specific points.
I would draw your attention to the fact that the current provisions in the Treaty, concerning the flexibility clause and enhanced cooperation, are inadequate and that, consequently, from this point of view, especially if we wish to continue with enlargement, countries that wish to forge ahead should be allowed to do so.
You say it in your book; you have not said it enough, in my opinion, in your speech but I am sure that you think it and, therefore, I support you in this.
Â Â  Mr President, this debate reminds me a little of a famous sketch by the British TV comedians Monty Python.
In the sketch, a man returns to a pet shop in order to complain about a dead parrot.
Despite the fact that the parrot is clearly dead, the salesman in the shop refuses to accept this and instead produces a series of bizarre excuses.
The parrot can be compared with the EU Constitution, and the salesman with the political elite of the EU.
It is time to realise that the parrot really is dead.
Only then can the debate about the future of Europe be meaningful again.
In actual fact, the voters of France and the Netherlands sent us a loud and clear message.
They want more democracy and less control from the centre.
They want less free market forces and more social responsibility.
This, and not the Constitution, is the key to better cooperation in Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, it is the nation state that is the bearer of democracy in Europe.
Democracy as a political system requires a demos, a people whose citizens recognise a strong sense of community with each other and who are therefore prepared to take an extensive degree of responsibility for one another.
A demos has common cultural traditions and a common history.
A demos has a common political arena in which debate can take place and where conflicts can be analysed and resolved by democratic means.
A demos has a national identity which shapes the very soil from which democracy can grow and in which it can stand tall and survive trials and tribulations.
MrÂ Verhofstadt is a typical representative of the euro-elite who believe that it is possible to replace national identities with a rapidly assembled European identity in which a flag, national anthem and national day can be quickly launched, pretty much like the new currency.
By attempting to push through a political union that lacks legitimacy in the eyes of Europeans, the EU establishment risks creating grass-roots opposition to the whole integration project.
MrÂ Verhofstadt scornfully calls the freedom for us Europeans to trade with one another, settle where we want, study where we want and invest where we want âjust a freeÂ trade zoneâ.
Freedom, however, is not âjustâ anything.
Rather, âFreedom is the best thing that can be sought the whole world overâ, to quote an old Swedish folk song from the Middle Ages.
I would like to remind you that if, with the aid of a constitution, we attempt to force on the Member States a policy that will always lack the support of the people, we will be heading for the collapse of the European Union.
Â Â  Mr President, nobody needs reminding of how important the planned accession of Bulgaria and Romania into our ranks will be to the development of the European Union.
We must be mindful of the fact that this is a momentous occasion, particularly in geopolitical and cultural terms.
Both the candidate countries are on the Balkan Peninsula, which has historically been known as Europeâs soft underbelly.
The accession of Bulgaria will also mean the EU entering the field of eastern culture.
The Communityâs expansion in that direction should therefore be prudent and responsible.
That is why I would like to warn against the recently-expressed reservations about the reforms in Romania and Bulgaria, which in my view are over the top.
This is the only way in which ill-considered accusations against these countries regarding widespread corruption can be interpreted.
Those who express such accusations should bear in mind that in Bulgaria and Romania, more than in any other European countries, corruption is a legacy of the Communist past.
The post-Soviet structures, which remained untouched for many years, became a source of bribery and other criminal activity.
We should also bear in mind that Europe itself is partly responsible for this state of affairs, by not giving sufficient support to de-Communisation and vetting movements.
The European Union has come into being thanks to the integration of nations.
However, this is only possible through a mutual understanding of their legacies and problems, because that is the only way in which a partnership can be built.
Â Â  Mr President, if ever I doubted the validity of my Euroscepticism, today I discovered that 45 turgid minutes of Eurofanaticism from the Prime Minister of Belgium was the perfect antidote.
The speech demonstrated that the political elitesâ claim to be listening to the people of Europe is as phoney as the latest suggestion of a cosmetic stunt of dropping the title âConstitutionâ.
France and Holland emphatically rejected the Constitution, so we slapped a gagging order on the countries which it was feared might also say âNoâ.
Though it was called a period of reflection, its effect was to stop votes in sceptical countries.
However, where ratification was assured, it was pushed through, and every time there was such a meaningless exercise, Europhiles were on hand to jump up and make the crass assertion âYou see!
The Constitution is not dead!â.
It is easy to win the game when you lock up the opposition in the changing room.
The last eurobarometer poll showed the European project has never been less loved.
With citizens seeking less Europe, this House and our guest today arrogantly demand more Europe, more EU competences, more majority voting, more centralisation, more and more and more!
Why do you not listen?
Stop digging!
Heed the clamour for more state rights, not centralisation; more local control, not âBrusselisationâ.
Face up to it: the goal of ever-closer, stultifying political union is simply unobtainable!
Â Â  Mr President, Prime Minister, sadly I have to decline the generous request for solidarity on the Constitution, but I am glad that we can now have a serious debate on the future of Europe.
Europe needs a debate and European leaders need to hear and understand what people are saying to them, especially following the meeting of Foreign Ministers at the weekend.
Apparently no one at that meeting pronounced the Constitution dead.
However, the Dutch Foreign Minister has said on a number of occasions that following the ânoâ vote in his countryâs referendum last year, that is in fact the position.
Who is right?
We need to know.
The Ministers agreed to let the discussion run for at least another year.
I think that is a mistake.
No one seriously believes that the Constitution can credibly be presented again to the peoples of France and the Netherlands, who have already spoken.
That would only serve to fuel the sense among our peoples that the EU remains oblivious to their concerns and priorities.
The whole point of the Laeken declaration in 2001 was that the EU needed to find ways of getting closer to its citizens and making the institutions more transparent and accountable.
The Constitution sadly failed those basic tests.
However, I am glad that the Foreign Ministers agreed that there would be no Constitutional cherry-picking while the debate goes on.
Of course the future of the EU is a very important subject: the kind of Europe we want to live in is important for our countries and peoples.
I have a very positive vision of a Europe of nation states working ever more closely together.
I want to see the EU move on to a new agenda: a reforming agenda that tackles effectively the sense of alienation between the institutions of Brussels; a reforming agenda that works for fundamental economic reform through liberalisation and more open markets, and puts growth at the forefront of its priorities.
I also want to see greater and more effective intergovernmental cooperation in tackling environmental challenges and fighting the scourge of terrorism.
The great error of Europeâs leaders is to assume that none of the great challenges facing us can be met without a Constitution.
I think that they can.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, I want to wholeheartedly endorse the positive contribution made by MrÂ Verhofstadt, who, in considering both the short and long-term future of the Union, is swimming against the current.
It is a praiseworthy initiative, in my view.
Reality is hard.
Cut-throat competition at Member-State level is taking the place of organising fair competition at corporate level.
The Commission is rudderless and hardly ever tables fresh legislation.
In its recent communication of last week, it pays hardly any attention to socio-economic aspects, despite the fact that people want jobs and social security.
It is highly likely that the Council will extend the period of reflection, and to it and to the Commission, I would like to say that the period of reflection is too long.
You can continue to reflect and what is more, I doubt whether everyone is thinking as hard as they make out to be, as I have not seen much in the way of results.
I should like to urge you to reflect on the words of Romano Prodi.
Would it not be easier to get out of the institutional crisis if we were to concentrate on the fundamental issue in hand, namely the rules of this House?
Would it not be an idea to ask our electorate to speak out about this in European elections?
Whilst the United States of Europe is a long-term vision, peopleâs socio-economic concerns require prompt answers today.
Â Â  Mr President, MrÂ Verhofstadt, I should like to thank the President for organising this debate and congratulate MrÂ Verhofstadt on the views he has expressed.
Some of us are acquainted with his very pro-active approach, but at times like these â amidst growing euro-scepticism and pessimism â a positive take such as his is more than welcome.
I am indebted to him for this.
I am also grateful that this debate has happened at all, because it looks to me that both the Prime Ministerâs speech and the speeches of a number of our fellow Members, including group chairmen, managed to lay bare the main areas of concern that we face.
I would first of all like to mention the schizophrenia among Heads of Government, Heads of State and ministers who meet to take joint decisions on average once a month, in the case of ministers, and four times a year in the case of Heads of State or Government, without whose permission nothing can be done in Europe.
After their meetings, they go home and act as if they have nothing to do with this whole European business, as a result of which, of course, there is, inevitably, huge distrust on the part of the public.
As you said yourself, Prime Minister, if something has gone right, then they, and they alone, take the credit; if something went wrong, then Brussels is obviously to blame.
This is what I would call schizophrenia.
Many Members also mentioned masochism.
So many Heads of Government, Heads of State or Members of this House are enormously eloquent in underlining the EUâs shortcomings, but never mention what it does right.
In the final analysis, MrÂ Verhofstadt, I think you have shown the way forward in saying that we should look for âand/andâ, rather than âeither/orâ solutions.
I think that that is the way we can leave the crisis behind.
Thank you for your attention.
Â Â  MrÂ Verhofstadt, thank you for taking such a pro-active line.
I agree with you that the period of reflection is likely to prove fruitless.
We need more.
We should continue the referendums, even though there is the real risk that at the end of the ride, we will not make the four-fifths majority.
I welcome the idea of using specific projects as means of continuing to put Europe on the map.
In fact, this Parliament has taken the lead in that respect by making Europe more social, rejecting the Port Directive and amending the Bolkestein Directive.
I am, moreover, surprised that the day before yesterday, the Belgian Government abstained during the Council vote on this Bolkestein Directive.
Take Europe further by means of specific projects?
We are all for it, Prime Minister, but we need funds, and we have settled on financial perspectives that are very tight, absolutely below par and that amount, in fact, to an abdication.
That, Prime Minister, is where the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council all went wrong.
We acted like , and that is something for which we will pay the price in time to come.
Â Â  â Mr President, if we really want to debate the future of Europe, we need to ask ourselves who we want to participate in this debate.
If a debate is held of the citizens, the workers and their bodies, then there is no need for us to wonder why any constitution will be undemocratic.
The European Union also needs to accept that the neoliberalisation doctrine is of no benefit to the citizens, that a foreign policy linked to ÎÎÎ€Î rather than to the principles of the UN is not a just policy.
Similarly, if the dialogue starts with the aim of demonstrating that everything is working fine, then the peoples will speak again as they did in the referenda.
Finally, we need to avoid insistences that there should be a European Constitution by 2009, as the Austrian Minister of Foreign Affairs has also said.
No strategy can dress up something that remains the same.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, MrÂ Verhofstadt, Europe is a great ideal: it is both our history and our future.
Europe is our culture, our values and our Western civilisation, which believes in freedom, tolerance, the importance of the individual, and peace, and which therefore cannot relinquish its Christian roots.
That is why we must not think of the Union merely as a bureaucracy divorced from the people and an institution concerned only with laying down rules about countless petty issues.
In order to involve peopleâs minds â that is the problem â we need a Europe that offers solutions to peopleâs most important demands, as provided for in the text of the Constitutional Treaty signed in Rome.
To overcome the current crisis, the Union needs a treaty that brings Europe closer to its people.
We therefore place great trust in the German Presidency to achieve a goal towards which we are all striving.
Europe needs to become stronger within a context of vital transatlantic relations.
It needs political unity in order to address a number of major challenges: first, the fight against terrorism, in order to build peace in the Middle East and the Balkans; second, growth and development by means of the Lisbon process, but without breaking certain rules to which science, too, must be subject, and the liberalisation of the services market as quickly as possible; third, the economic and commercial confrontation with China and India, two major emerging countries that are, however, preparing to form an alliance with each other; the fourth challenge is the energy question, not forgetting the nuclear option; the fifth is immigration and the African emergency; and the sixth is expansion of our borders, starting with the accession of Romania and Bulgaria and then that of Croatia, without closing the door on other candidate countries.
We shall only overcome these challenges if we succeed in transforming todayâs Europe, which is too tied up in bureaucracy, into a Europe of the people, of policies and of values.
Â Â  Mr President, MrÂ DeÂ Gaulle said one should, and I quote, âgo to the complex Orient with simple ideasâ.
I suggest that you apply this formula to the Constitution.
I am French and I start from a premise that is probably obvious: The French will not vote again on the same text.
Let us start from there.
Let us go even to the end of the ratifications.
Personally, I want that, it is a right for nations and it is a duty for leaders.
It will probably result in a few more rejections but we shall take it to the end.
That means that, whatever happens, some new thing will be needed â I say âthingâ to avoid words that cause annoyance.
We go, therefore, to the end with as many ratification procedures as there are countries, that is to say not 25 but 27 with the Romanians and the Bulgarians, whom we are always forgetting because their accession is as good as ratified, as it is included in the Treaty.
We go round all the countries, therefore, but that could begin all over again endlessly.
Here, then, I agree with your idea: we have to scrap unanimity.
We have to break down the barriers and to do that we have to rewrite Declaration 30 differently.
In this way, if, when the time comes, for example, 22 out of 27 countries say âyesâ and 5 say ânoâ, the 5 who say ânoâ either accept the majority rule or they stand down.
Otherwise, we shall go round and round in circles, and from postponement to postponement and from reflection to reflection.
Whatever happens, it will not be the same text and another ratification process will be needed, otherwise I wager we shall find ourselves here in the same situation year after year.
Â Â  â I should like to begin by congratulating you, Prime Minister, on your speech, which struck a rare note of both vision and realism.
You touched on a number of points, and, though it would be useful, it would be impossible to discuss all of them.
I shall speak about one, the Lisbon Strategy, which is the issue that over the past five years has left us most open to ridicule.
The Lisbon Strategy is a delightful set of intentions, yet commits the cardinal sin of not being a Community strategy, as you correctly pointed out.
That is a cardinal sin, but we have then gone on to commit the truly deadly sin of not rectifying it; in other words, we have failed to give the Commission the responsibility and the resources to make proposals on areas such as the internal market and the single currency.
We still confuse intentions with workable, measurable objectives, and objectives with the activities needed to achieve those objectives.
I know that you understand this kind of language, Prime Minister.
If we continue with the rhetoric of the Lisbon Strategy, rather than practical measures, we might have good governance, good institutions and good ideas. We will not have jobs or satisfaction for our citizens.
Â Â  â Mr President, the Chairman of my group, MrÂ Schulz, said that he would like to see more Heads of Government like MrÂ Verhofstadt.
I should like to continue with this theme and say that I should like, in particular, to see a Commission President with so much commitment to standing up for Europeâs future.
I shall continue from where the previous speaker left off.
In criticising the defective economic and social policy, he highlighted, among other things, the Lisbon Process and this open method of coordination.
I believe that this method is a particularly good example of the principle of subsidiarity being misunderstood, as the Member States formally insist on their powers in these areas but are, in fact, unaware, or only partially aware, of what these specifically amount to.
The consequence of all this is that the damage is taken to have been caused by the European Union, and the Member States are not seen as being responsible.
We know that our shortcomings in terms of economic and social policy are not, unfortunately, all going to be solved by means of this Constitutional Treaty.
These shortcomings were also the basis of our failure in the Convention, as we achieved almost nothing, or not very much, in this area.
My question is now as follows: what solutions, other than the opportunities in the eurozone that have been pointed out, do you envisage whereby, in spite of holding on to this Constitutional Treaty, we can secure what is contained in the Treaty with a view nonetheless to making further progress in this area?
Â Â  â Mr President, I greatly welcome the debate we are holding today, because we must be clear that over the past year we in Parliament have squandered the period of reflection that was originally announced.
I also get the impression that Parliament has become entrenched in its previous positions, with supporters remaining supporters, and opponents remaining opponents.
We have not sought any real ways out of the constitutional crisis facing Europe.
In the meantime, expert bodies have put forward at least a dozen different solutions to the constitutional crisis.
I would like to mention one of them in detail, because I would like all Members present to take note of it.
It is the variant of the âsmall constitutionâ, or in other words the implementation of those provisions of the present document that are most constitutional in character, by which I mean the provisions of Sections One and Two, in a constitution.
Those provisions that are more executive in nature would then be implemented by way of reforms of primary legislation and through the use of secondary legislative instruments.
Given the fiasco of the referenda in France and the Netherlands, it appears that we should do all we can to defend the Constitutional Treaty.
This is justified by the answers to the following three questions.
Firstly, do we really want a more far-reaching European Union, or in other words do we want more Europe?
The answer to this question, at least in my political circles, is yes, we do want more Europe, because only deeper integration makes a stronger, more effective and more democratic EU possible.
The second question is whether we want a constitution.
Yes, we do want a constitution, because the constitution provides us with the chance of a stronger, more effective and more democratic EU.
Finally, the third question is whether we want this particular Constitutional Treaty.
Yes we do, but not at all costs.
We have to accept political reality and be as flexible as possible and only put in place solutions that are attainable in the given situation.
Â Â  Mr President, MrÂ Verhofstadt, it is clear that we are building the future Europe for its citizens, and that they have to answer the question of what kind of Europe they want and within which borders.
We were supposed to come up with the answers during the period of reflection, but this period has not been a success.
There have been no national debates and no support from the European institutions, in particular the Council, which after the ânoâ votes in France and the Netherlands adopted a wait-and-see attitude.
Europe has fallen into lethargy, and for that reason I would like to ask you, MrÂ Verhofstadt, at the June session of the Council, to ask the leaders of those countries which have postponed the ratification process what they intend to do now and what their plans are.
Please do not accept the answer that it is an internal affair, because it is not.
Ratification of an international treaty is an obligation for the countries that have signed it.
It is also a test of their credibility and of their capacity to cooperate in international relations.
Finally I would like to point out that in my country, Poland, where the ratification process was postponed, the latest public opinion surveys show that almost 80% of the Polish population supports Europe, and that people want a larger Europe, a Europe built on the principles of equality and a Europe that is not only prosperous, but that is just and democratic and that displays solidarity.
Â Â  Mr President, this debate has been a clash of two pessimisms.
On the one hand, there is the pessimism of the most enthusiastic Europeans, who sometimes speak as if the European Union were in terminal crisis; as if very little has been achieved over the last 50 years; as if it is just a free-trade area and that we still need to build a political Europe, as if what we have is somehow not political.
On the other hand, there are the fears and the pessimisms of the anti-Europeans, who seem to think that we have already built not just a federal system, but a centralised superstate with everything being decided not just in this Parliament, but by the Commission.
Neither fear is an accurate representation of reality.
The reality is that the Union has a solid set of achievements to its credit, but with shortcomings.
The Constitution was intended to address these shortcomings with sets of reforms that, although not very radical, would be useful.
Surely it is right that we take the time to complete the period of reflection and try first to save the Constitution â or most of it â before calling for a two-speed Europe and going down that road.
Tempting as it is to build Europe without France, it would surely be better to try to bring France on board first.
Â Â  â MrÂ Verhofstadt, I believe that today you have written the next chapter of your book , which I, like many others, read with great attention and pleasure.
Because your book lacked a section about âwhat to doâ following its analysis of what we need, and today you have said it very clearly: to continue with the process of ratifying the European Constitution.
Why continue with the process of ratifying the European Constitution?
So that we have more countries that have ratified it, of course, but also in order to make the period of reflection real.
For what purpose?
In order to explain to the citizens what it will cost us not to have the Constitution or, to put it in positive terms, the added value that the European Constitution will provide.
The time will come when we find a solution in order to unblock this constitutional crisis.
It will be after the French and Dutch elections.
I would say to you that, since the Constitution was drawn up amongst governments and parliaments within a Convention, this crisis must be resolved amongst governments and parliaments.
I believe that that was one of the great conclusions of the Parliamentary Forum of 8 and 9 May, which had a very positive result.
We must be orthodox in terms of the content of the Constitution, but heterodox in terms of the ultimate solution.
I believe that, in this regard, we in this House agree with you.
Â Â  Mr President, I have two points and one question.
My first point is that the Prime Minister is one of the best defenders of Europe.
I was in Nice as a civil servant when he defended a stronger Europe, easier decision-making and qualified majority voting.
He was able to hold the meeting hostage to the last minute and he is one of the few who actually defends a truly federal Europe today.
There are not too many âfederalistsâ out there: there are many closet federalists, but not many real federalists any more.
I really commend him and congratulate him on that.
I am glad that some prime ministers are still European.
My second point concerns the controversy about the name of the Constitution.
I heard the debate with the Foreign Ministers and I disagree with those who wish to change the name.
The name of a âConstitutional Treatyâ describes what it is perfectly: it has constitutional elements and it is an international treaty.
That treatyâs name was conceived in Joschka Fischerâs speech in May 2000 â six years ago.
What responsible parent, six years after christening a child, would go ahead and change its name?
It would lose its identity.
So let us not try to hide things.
Problems do not go away with the change of a name.
Finally, the Prime Minister suggested that there should be a core group around the euro countries.
Could he be more specific?
Â Â  Mr President, I am happy that Estonia has been mentioned several times this afternoon, because the Estonian Parliament recently ratified the Constitutional Treaty and hopefully re-launched the process of ratification to reach the number 20.
I must admit that, compared with when I was a member of the European Convention, I am much more convinced of closer cooperation between members of the European Union.
It is very clear that a Europe of 500 million cannot rely on and cannot work on the basis of the Nice Treaty.
I am absolutely in favour of Prime Minister Verhofstadtâs idea that we need courageous leadership, because without determination and clear convictions we cannot convince our voters to support this project.
Therefore we need to stop speaking half-truths; we need to stop saying one thing in the European Council and then another thing at home; we need to stop thinking in practical terms about forthcoming elections.
Our voters know when we are speaking half-truths and if we are not showing clear conviction.
Finally, we must not isolate ourselves.
We need transatlantic cooperation â the next item on the agenda this afternoon â to strengthen the project, and I will fully support that idea.
Â Â  . Mr President, straight away I must thank all those who have taken part in this debate.
I shall begin with the question of Declaration 30 because this Declaration has quite a strange history.
The principle of four fifths of Member States was already present in the original proposals that were presented by the Prodi Commission.
It appeared there, however, in order to state that if four fifths of the Member States ratified the treaty, then we would go ahead, which was naturally unacceptable to certain members of the European Council.
Subsequently, we, the Convention and then the Intergovernmental Conference, wanted to retain this concept of four fifths.
How was the matter to be presented?
We could not say that if four fifths of the Member States ratified the Treaty, we would go ahead with it, because that would amount after all to abolishing the unanimity rule, which indeed will need to happen one day.
The Americans did it in 1787 on the occasion of the Philadelphia Convention.
It was a seizure of power by 9 out of the 13 States that existed at the time.
What had to be done, therefore, in order to retain the four-fifths concept?
In the end the following wording was decided on: âthe matter will be referred to the European Councilâ. This is what is stated in the Declaration annexed to the Treaty, while in reality the concept of four fifths has a very different origin since, in the beginning, there was no question of organising a debate within the European Council.
The motive behind this concept, a motive which stems from the Convention and the proposals of the Prodi Commission, and ultimately was not taken up in the final text, neither by the Convention nor by the Intergovernmental Conference, was to find a solution to a particular situation.
Who did they have in mind, then, in relation to this concept?
Certainly not the French, but rather that part of the Union that is on the side of MrÂ Kirkhope and others, a part anyway that is on the other side of the Channel.
That is what they had in mind.
They said: if everyone says âyesâ and the British say ânoâ, we shall still see each other within the European Council so that we can carry on.
That was the motive behind the four fifths.
Lo and behold, it is the wretched French who vote ânoâ, and present us with the problem of the application of the four fifths.
In substance, I am in agreement: the ideal would be to have a system where unanimity disappeared and was replaced by something else, a European referendum or a four-fifths majority, for example.
To achieve that, however, we should have to have referendums, popular consultations, and in the countries who voted ânoâ as well.
That is the reason why I am talking about a second track.
You can do anything: continue with ratification, fine, I am asking for that; make use of the four fifths principle, fine; extend the period of reflection, fine; organise an Intergovernmental Conference as MrÂ Duff is asking, fine, but all that still means years and years of work.
This work, between you and me, is going to be very interesting but it would really be a serious error not to do something else straightaway.
We are going, therefore, to consider the four fifths, Declaration 30 and an Intergovernmental Conference; and we shall perhaps make this or that change to the draft Constitution, otherwise it will never be acceptable in the two countries that said ânoâ.
All these things are obvious and constitute, indeed, the first track to be followed.
It would be a gross error, however, not to open up straight away a second track that does not require amending the Treaty.
Now, all the things I spoke about in my introduction, all the proposals that I made require no amendment to the Treaty.
Another big advantage is that France and the Netherlands are already part of the Euro zone.
There is no need for us to initiate a great debate to find out whether or not they wish to participate.
The second aspect that I wish to emphasise regarding cooperation within the Euro zone is that it is an open cooperation, it is not a closed club, it is a reality that exists and which will grow with the entry of Slovenia by 1Â January 2007 at the latest.
I do not know whether the Ecofin Council has completed its scrutiny of the other countries, on the basis of the opinion of the Commission and the European Central Bank, but these countries will join nonetheless, maybe not in 2007, but then it will be 1Â January 2008.
It is therefore certain that this group will continue to grow.
Why not move forward with it in real terms?
Because if the citizens said ânoâ at the time of the referendum in France, it is because there is no socio-economic convergence and because there is no way to respond to their expectations at the social level.
Consequently, we have to follow the two tracks and, if it is true that it would be a mistake to abandon ratification of the Constitution, it would be another grave mistake to straight away take the other track, that of the socio-economic governance that everyone wants.
That is perhaps the most important conclusion that one can draw from the referendum in France and indeed also in the Netherlands.
As someone, I think it was my predecessor, Jean-LucÂ Dehaene, said: I am not advocating enlargement now and not doing all the rest, I am advocating doing both at the same time.
For it to be possible to do both at the same time, however, one must have the courage, again this year, or, at the latest, next year, to initiate socio-economic governance in the European Union.
Otherwise, once again, for year after year, we shall be fighting, talking away endlessly about the Constitution, and consequently losing even more the support of the citizens of the European Union.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Prime Minister.
This has certainly been an interesting debate.
We thank you very much for dedicating all of your time and your intellect to the debate on the future of Europe.
Â Â  â The dominant forces in Parliament continue their foolsâ crusade, promoting ad nauseam the inappropriately named European Constitution, which would strengthen federalism, neoliberalism and militarism in the EU.
These forces and the interests that they represent â indeed, it is no coincidence that the chairman of the European employersâ association UNICE came to Parliament to reaffirm to some MEPs his support for the so-called Constitution â continue to peddle the line, against all the evidence, that the problem is one of form rather than content.
That is to say, it is not a political problem of EU policy but a problem of communication and perception.
In so doing, they are blinding themselves to reality.
The resolution that they have put forward for the vote at the next plenary session of Parliament is indicative of their true objectives.
In a display of contempt for the will expressed by the French and Dutch people, as well as other people who have not been allowed to express the same opinion, the dominant forces in Parliament have imposed a constitutional agreement and their own support for the European Constitution, by rejecting amendments and pressing ahead with ratifications in the countries that rejected the Treaty â with the use of Community funding â by the time of the next elections to Parliament in June 2009.
In a word, unacceptable.
Â Â  The European Union has a clear idea of the future of its operation until the number of its Member States reaches 27.
This is expected to be achieved on 1Â January 2007.
It has now become imperative that we find answers to the questions regarding a unified Europe, the existing unified will for development, and the Constitution.
Where to now, Europe?
Are we going to achieve the vision of a federal European State, as advocated by Jacques Delors, or that of a looser alliance of states?
The questions and their answers, yet to be found, cannot prevent the will of the deciding majority to be taken into account in the decision-making process of the European Union.
We cannot allow progress to be hindered by any one state!
However, this can only be achieved by the renewal of the institutional and decision-making system of the European Union, because the Union cannot be enlarged any further if it does not change the way it functions.
Without high-standard legislation, a more efficient decision-making mechanism and a stronger role of Parliament, the European Union may not only lose its efficiency, but its ability to function, as well.
The fact that the European Union has become stuck within its current legal framework reinforces the very reason why the citizens of two countries voted against the Constitution.
The European Union is not just an economic project, but also a supranational institutional system that also serves solidarity and the protection of social values.
There are many who miss the fact that this is not emphasised to a greater extent.
We must make it clear to them that the implementation of this partly depends on the fate of the Constitution and on the efficiency of the European Union.
Therefore, European Union legislation must be brought closer to people.
We must present a unified and positive front to citizens, because the achievement of our goals requires a unified political will, and not only words!
Â Â  The next item is the statement by the Council and the Commission on the situation of the prisoners in GuantÃ¡namo.
Â Â  .â Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Councilâs position is, and remains, unambiguous. All the international humanitarian standards and standards relating to human rights must be observed wherever in the world the fight against terrorism is conducted.
There must be no areas in which the laws do not apply.
On that we are agreed.
In the Council, our common understanding is that GuantÃ¡namo remains a cause for serious concern.
We declare our support for combating terrorism effectively, deploying all the legal means available to us.
Terrorism is a threat to our order of values, built on the rule of law.
We must, however, also be sure that, in fighting terrorism, we do not damage or call into question our procedures and institutions based on the rule of law.
No one should occupy a space in which the law does not apply, and standards relating to human rights and humanitarian law must be observed in the fight against terrorism too.
We in the EU have on many occasions discussed the subject of GuantÃ¡namo with the US administration.
This dialogue with the United States is being continued.
The legal advisers of the USAâs state department and of the EUâs equivalent services are discussing better ways of protecting human rights in the fight against terrorism, as the common search to improve the protection of human rights is important.
We must also analyse whether there are any such things as perfect legal bases and whether â and, if so, in which area â there is a need to take action.
For a country such as the United States, which declares its support for freedom, the rule of law and proper court proceedings, GuantÃ¡namo is an anomaly.
In our view, the US Government should therefore take measures to close down the camp as quickly as possible.
I should also like to add that the latest reports, according to which a considerable number of GuantÃ¡namo prisoners were less than 18 years old â children within the meaning of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child â when they were taken prisoner are naturally cause for particular concern and need to be carefully examined.
Back under the British Presidency, the Council approached the United States and asked it to grant representatives of what are known as UN special procedures - including the Special Rapporteur on Torture, Manfred Nowak â unrestricted access to GuantÃ¡namo.
Unfortunately, it was not possible for the UN representatives to visit GuantÃ¡namo under the normal conditions for special procedures.
That is to say, they received no assurance of being able to speak with prisoners unsupervised.
This same line was also taken by the United States when Members of the European Parliament visited GuantÃ¡namo on 22Â May.
We continue to insist, as I say, on access for the UNâs Special Rapporteur on Torture.
However, the Council is also particularly concerned to defend or, as the case may be, further to strengthen the cohesion of the Euro-Atlantic Community in the context of combating terrorism.
The Euro-Atlantic Community is one of the most successful partnerships the world has ever known.
This community of values must also prove its worth specifically in the face of the challenge from international terrorism.
That is why it was the concern both of the Austrian Presidency and of the Council to initiate the dialogue between experts in international law, to present the debate in objective terms and to strive for common positions corresponding to our system of values. We must be aware that, following the criminal terrorist attacks of September 2001, the United States saw itself forced, under extraordinary conditions, to react to the new challenges of global terrorism.
Some of the measures taken were criticised by Europeans or regarded as being completely incompatible with our common system of values.
Since then, the Americans have been seen to think again, and they have made a number of improvements to their original stance. In our view, the constructive dialogue with the United States, designed as it is to achieve certain goals, should help fix the future fight against terrorism more securely within the framework of the rule of law.
Â Â  . Madam President, I followed with great interest the visit of the Parliamentâs delegation, headed by Mr Brok, to GuantÃ¡namo, and the motion for a resolution that is on the table today.
The global fight against terrorism on an unprecedented scale has created new challenges for the protection of human rights.
The European Commission constantly underlines that states must ensure full respect for human rights during the fight against terrorism, and this is at stake here.
A number of Member States have voiced concern to the US Government about GuantÃ¡namo Bay.
The Commission itself does not have any competence to intervene on behalf of the detainees held at there.
However, we follow very closely all developments and we have noted President Bushâs recent statement that he would like to bring GuantÃ¡namo to an end.
Hopefully the US Administration will go this way.
The Commission underlines that all anti-terrorist measures must be consistent with both international humanitarian law and international human rights law.
It is our firm belief that the Geneva Conventions apply to all persons captured on the field of battle.
The Commission also takes the view that the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the UN Convention against Torture apply to GuantÃ¡namo Bay.
In this connection, we welcome the United Statesâ intention to adopt a new Army Field Manual for intelligence interrogation, which will hopefully ensure that interrogation techniques fully comply with the international prohibition on torture or cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment.
Moreover, in our view, every person who has been detained must enjoy a status under international law and is entitled not to be detained arbitrarily.
A person must, in addition, receive due process and a fair trial.
The Commission would also stress that no one should be subject to incommunicado detention and that the International Committee of the Red Cross must always be allowed access to detained persons wherever they may be.
Finally, we have repeatedly made clear to the United States our opposition to the use of the death penalty in all cases.
The European Union has also made clear its support for the request of various United Nations Special Rapporteurs to visit GuantÃ¡namo Bay and to be able to interview detainees in private.
The European Union has also raised this issue repeatedly with the United States and will continue to do so.
It is vital that the international community seeks to reassert full adherence to international law, including human rights and humanitarian standards, in relation to the alleged Taliban and al-Qaâida members in GuantÃ¡namo and elsewhere.
It is only by ensuring respect for those values by all parties that real progress can be achieved.
Â Â  . Madam President, I am glad that we have an opportunity for debate with the Council and Commission on the GuantÃ¡namo Bay detention centre.
GuantÃ¡namo has become, in publicity terms, an open sore for many people in relation to all that is negative about the so-called war on terrorism.
Fighting terrorism and minimising the threat of terrorism is necessary but not easy and mistakes have been and continue to be made.
Worryingly, the aspect of the struggle to combat terrorism that we are losing is the battle to win public support â the hearts and minds of large populations in the Arab world in particular.
As a result, many moderate-thinking Muslims see certain efforts being made to combat terrorism as adding to the problem and fuelling fundamentalist thinking, rather than providing an effective solution.
GuantÃ¡namo is in this category.
I have called for and have signed a joint urgency motion, passed by all groups in February 2005, calling for the closure of the GuantÃ¡namo Bay detention centre.
That was a short, clear and balanced motion, basically stating three strong messages: firstly, it called for the closure of the detention centre and for fair trials for detainees consistent with international law and standards; secondly, it condemned the use of torture and ill-treatment and the need for conformity with international law in all detention centres; and thirdly, it stressed that contemporary terrorism continues to pose a threat to basic human rights and to our populations.

A delegation of MEPs from various groups recently visited the GuantÃ¡namo Bay detention centre.
In relation to our joint motion for a resolution, I believe that those MEPs that have just returned from GuantÃ¡namo should be given an opportunity to contribute to that motion and improve its accuracy, effectiveness and credibility.
For that reason, I hope that other Groups will support my proposal tomorrow on behalf of the PPE-DE Group to postpone the vote on a resolution until the next Strasbourg session in June.
A few weeks will give us an opportunity to produce a motion calling for and justifying the closure of GuantÃ¡namo Bay, in a form that can be supported by all of the main groups, with increased credibility in the build up to the EU-US Summit in late June.
Â Â  . Madam President, this is not the first time that we have given our opinion on GuantÃ¡namo; let us hope that it is the last time we have to do so.
My group agrees with the appeals contained in the conclusions of the report by the United Nations Committee against Torture, published on 19 May.
We call upon the US Government to stop detaining people in secret centres, either on their own territory or on territories under their jurisdiction or under their control.
We call upon the US Government to recognise that detaining people under these conditions constitutes an act of torture or abuse in itself, which is prohibited under the conventions we have signed.
Finally, we once again call upon the Bush Government to close the GuantÃ¡namo detention centre and to give the people held there a fair trial or release them immediately, ensuring that they are not sent to any country where they may be subject to torture, as has apparently happened in some cases.
It is now the Council and the Commissionâs turn.
Commissioner, the European Union must comply with its guidelines on combating torture and the death penalty.
You have the duty to raise this issue with the United States and to ask them to close the GuantÃ¡namo prison.
The trans-Atlantic summit to be held in Vienna will offer an opportunity to put pressure on the US authorities.
We Socialists want GuantÃ¡namo to be on the Vienna agenda.
Furthermore, Europe must make its position very clear: in Europe people cannot be detained without charge, nor can people be illegally moved nor torture externalised.
We will play no part in it.
This Parliament will play no part in it.
Â Â  . Madam President, I welcome the Council and Commission statements.
However, the Council must now put real pressure on the American Government at the EU-US Summit next month to close down GuantÃ¡namo Bay once and for all.
It must either release prisoners if there is no evidence against them, or try them under international law.
Anything else will be a travesty of justice.
How many more reports do we have to read about gross violations of human rights?
The latest one from the Committee Against Torture makes the point again: that torture techniques, which should be abhorrent to any decent person, are still being used.
We heard these allegations from my constituent Moazzam Begg, who was released last year, and we have heard them in successive reports.
We also, as you quite rightly said, need to have answers about whether dozens of children have been incarcerated there, as has been alleged recently.
The Council must be tough and not let the American Government off the hook.
As far as Mr Coveney is concerned, I would say, on behalf of my group, that we would not like to see a postponement of this resolution.
Â Â  . Madam President, although the Council is against Guantanamo, it has also noticed some improvement.
The Commission may have sound principles, to which I subscribe, but it really believes that we can take President Bush at his word when he says that the United States intends to close down Guantanamo Bay.
Something you both seem to overlook is that a fresh development is underway, namely the need for new prisons to be built, including in Guantanamo Bay, which MrÂ Brok visited â and he may expand on this himself â but that strikes me as a development to which we must respond.
What do you intend to do about it?
Will you only enter into fresh dialogue with the United States or will you start making demands for once, at a time when the United States wants something from us, such as passenger data, for example?
Will you make real demands?
We can also offer the United States a helping hand, for example, on behalf of the people who are now incarcerated and who will not be brought before a court.
Indeed, even the American authorities have admitted that some of those behind bars are innocent.
What will we do about this now?
Although the European Union is, of course, not responsible for Guantanamo, it could offer those people a solution, out of human compassion.
I should like to quote you the example of the Uighurs, some of whom were detained and about whom even MrÂ Bush admitted that they were innocent, but they could not stay in the US, nor could they return to China where they would face torture.
What should happen to those people?
The EU failed to offer a helping hand on that occasion. They are now in Albania and will probably still be extradited to China.
This begs the question whether this exercise has been all that helpful for them.
What are you prepared to do for a large group of people who are still held in Guantanamo Bay and who, apparently, cannot be brought before a court because there is no proof that they are guilty.
Could the European Union not offer those people a helping hand, and possibly offer them asylum?
Finally, it is very easy to focus on Guantanamo Bay, which is a well-organised location with a limited number of prisoners, but people lacking any rights is, of course, also a common phenomenon in the rest of the world, because prisoners are increasingly being transported, also to other parts of Europe â as someone mentioned a moment ago â and I hope that the governments are prepared to consider what their own part, albeit passive, has been in this.

Â Â  MadamÂ President, this Parliament has called for the closure of the GuantÃ¡namo detention centre on several occasions and we continue to call for it today.
Human rights are being violated there, torture is the order of the day, and we have even discovered recently that 60 children have been unlawfully held in GuantÃ¡namo.
GuantÃ¡namo is a place outside the law, where terrorists or suspected terrorists are detained and thus kept out of reach of normal judicial process.
GuantÃ¡namo is a symbol of the victory of barbarity over the rule of law, but I have to tell MrsÂ Plassnik that GuantÃ¡namo is unfortunately not an anomaly: it is just the tip of the iceberg, because in recent times the idea has been to fight terrorism by using the same barbarous methods that terrorism uses, and that is leading to our defeat.
If we think of how the war is feeding international terrorism, we will have a clear idea of what is happening at the moment.
Terrorist attacks are the most obvious sign of the shift from the rule of law to the rules of the jungle.
We must therefore reassert democratic rules; we must reassert the primacy of politics and uphold the rule of law.
It has been decided instead to fight on the enemyâs home ground and to compete in denying human rights, in using military might to control the civilian population, in negating the cardinal principles of democracy, and in giving priority to security above all else.
The pictures from GuantÃ¡namo and Abu Ghraib prison are emblematic of the victory and culture of terrorism over the rule of law; they are a clear sign of the defeat of those who often declare that they want to fight terrorism, not least because those pictures shown on television around the world are the staff of life for extremist fundamentalism, as are the secret prisons or the kidnappings carried out by CIA secret agents on European soil.
We must not be accomplices or casual observers of such barbarity.
I shall conclude by saying that the idea of using any means possible to defeat terrorism is a mistake.
There is only one way to defeat terrorism: by safeguarding the rule of law.
Â Â  . Madam President, the US experienced its first serious terrorist attack on 9/11.
Its response was entitled âA war on terrorismâ â a highly dubious military proposition.
For decades, Britain experienced sustained terrorist attacks launched from the Irish mainland.
Those terrorists were substantially funded by US citizens.
The US Government was instrumental in forcing the British Government to capitulate in the face of that terrorist campaign.
Now the US is at risk, a different double standard applies: the US Government believes that it has the right to disregard the Geneva Convention and all civilised standards and to kidnap, detain, abuse and torture terrorist suspects.
Some of those suspects are British citizens.
They may be completely innocent or they may be guilty.
Who knows?
No evidence is produced, no trials take place.
If they are real terrorists, then let them face justice and not languish in a detention camp that the Americans do not even dare to put within their own country.
Â Â  â Madam President, MrsÂ Plassnik, MrsÂ Ferrero-Waldner, firstly, we should like to say that terrorism is contemptuous of human beings and that the United States has been hit appallingly by terrorism.
That is a factor that must form the background to any criticism we make.
We must appreciate that this is terrorism directed against our values and our legal system and that it raises concerns about the danger in which it places us.
On the other hand, resistance to terrorism should not be to the detriment of our own values, for then terrorism will have won.
For this reason, there has been a broad international debate, which has also led to changes.
Following my visit, I am convinced that the situation and the images familiar to us from 2001 and 2002 no longer exist.
Nor do I believe that direct physical torture is taking place, as presumably it had been doing, although I obviously have no proof of this.
Moreover, the fact that great efforts are taking place within the United States, together with a debate designed to put an end to torture and the like is shown by, for example, the initiatives taken by Senator McCain.
What we have here, then, is not typical behaviour towards America on the part of Europe but a debate being conducted in all our societies.
On the other hand â and, on this matter, I agree completely with the Commissioner and MrsÂ Plassnik â human rights and international humanitarian law must be observed.
Although our system of values does in fact entail the risk of a prisoner reoffending after he has been released, we should be giving up our freedom if we were to abandon that same system of values. is one of the basic principles of our civilisation.
True enough: in the situation in which we now find ourselves, the risk is far smaller if prisoners who might otherwise join the ever growing ranks of new suicide bombers and so inspire further mobilisation are instead kept in prison.
On the basis purely of an assessment of the risks involved, releasing people is probably not the right road to go down.
As matters stand, however, people are kept in prison even if they are acquitted.
If a prisoner is deemed to have been 80%, but still not 100%, debriefed, he is kept in jail.
If a new concrete prison is built, this time devoid of windows, we have, to say the least, a problem.
Although what we have here is not a war in the classical sense of the word, we must try, via the International Court of Justice and other international arrangements, to get to grips with this issue.
I believe that too much is being expected of the Member States in this area.
Â Â  Madam President, speaking as the constituency MEP for a dozen former and existing GuantÃ¡namo Bay residents, I welcome that at last we are hearing a squeak of protest about GuantÃ¡namo Bay from EU Foreign Ministers.
One press report of last weekendâs agreement to make a request to the US to close GuantÃ¡namo said: âMinisters agreed that Europe can no longer ignore the extensive international criticism of the campâ.
It is not exactly ahead of the curve to take four and a half years to make only an informal request.
As I understand it, we still have no formal declaration, no common position, and no joint action.
However, we are grateful that Foreign Ministers have finally caught up with world opinion.
I welcome the public statement here today by the President-in-Office calling for the camp to close.
What we have heard today should have been heard over the last four years.
The best way that EU Member States could launch the constructive goal-orientated dialogue with the US â which Mrs Plassnik called for and I agree we need â would be to help this Parliament establish the truth about the extraordinary rendition programme and European complicity in it.
I hope that in your response, President-in-Office, you will say that you will help us establish that truth.
The goal that we should seek jointly with the Americans is a return to full respect for international law, not a dilution of it.
Â Â  Madam President, when we discussed and adopted the urgent resolution on GuantÃ¡namo a few months ago, it marked a turning point in the debate and we condemned a practice which until then had been completely denied or simply ignored by the powers that be in Europe.
The fight against terrorism â this has been said, I agree with it and I believe that the majority of us take the same view â cannot be an excuse to permit torture, kidnap and, even less, murder, which are taking place not just in GuantÃ¡namo, but in many other parts of the world.
We must therefore continue to put pressure on the United States in every way we can in order to persuade them, on the one hand, to close GuantÃ¡namo, but also, on the other, to ensure that the almost 500 people in detention have the legal guarantees that they require.
We must therefore point out once again â as MrÂ ValencianoÂ MartÃ­nez-Orozco has also said â that prisoners must not be released in the knowledge that they are going to be sent to countries where they may be tortured.
In many cases they cannot even return to their countries of residence because their residence permits have been withdrawn.
I therefore believe that we must remind the Council that these measures must be taken seriously and that a proactive approach must be taken in order to guarantee that these people â I insist â not just have a fair trial, but also the human and judicial guarantees they deserve.
Â Â  â Europeâs main mission is to comply with and promote international law and the humanitarian principles that underpin it.
This is yet another reason why the European project must succeed.
The fight against terrorism must not undermine the system of personal guarantees that form the moral foundations of democracy and the rule of law.
The biggest danger for democracy is the loss of the moral high ground and this is a further serious capitulation in the face of terrorism.
Security guarantees must therefore uphold the fundamental values of human rights and must form part of the debate on these values.
A securitarian policy gradually destroys the enlightened architecture of democratic policies and its potential to allow human dignity to flourish.
Furthermore, the fight against terrorism is not only pursued through the mechanisms of criminal law.
On a more fundamental level, it is pursued through the creation of a more balanced world order and the ambitious programme of a form of global justice.
Consequently, Europe is the United Statesâ best partner if we are to achieve an order that will ensure that the principles of international law and the core values of civilisation are properly upheld.
Against a backdrop such as this, what is needed is relentless commitment to dialogue.
EU Member States must also take part in the Council of Europeâs process of reflection with a view to amending the Geneva Conventions.
Terror suspects are not accorded legal status under those conventions, which is wrong.
GuantÃ¡namo does not define the limits of law and politics, yet to define the limits of law and politics is a basic requirement of the principles of justice.
This is the biggest victory of democracy over terrorism.
To quote Simone de Beauvoir, âwe must not allow our executioners to give us bad habitsâ.
Â Â  â MadamÂ President, MrsÂ Plassnik, MrsÂ Ferrero-Waldner, GuantÃ¡namo has become a symbol of the removal of human rights and of procedures under the rule of law.
It is easy for us Europeans to criticise the situation.
We should not, however, just be drawing attention to states of affairs incompatible with human rights and the rule of law.
Rather, we should be asking ourselves where our responsibility lies and in what ways we can help bring about a solution.
Even people found by the Americans to be innocent are unable to return to their home countries.
The United States, too, correctly rules out sending these people back to countries in which they would be in fear of torture or persecution.
We must together answer the question of what should instead happen to these people.
The fate of the people in GuantÃ¡namo concerns us all and should not leave us indifferent.
Finally â and this is something that also ought to be emphasised today â European governments too have been involved in the extradition, and partly even in the interrogation, of detainees at GuantÃ¡namo Bay.
That applies, for example, in the case of Murat Kurnaz.
If we are seriously calling for GuantÃ¡namo Bay to be closed once and for all, we should transform our words into deeds.
Â Â  . Madam President, we in the Council shall continue, attentively and with a sense of our responsibilities, to pursue and deal with the subject of GuantÃ¡namo.
That is because this subject is at the interface of a number of the European Unionâs political priorities: on the one hand, the issue of the universal validity of human rights and of international humanitarian law, as well as the fight against the scourge of terrorism on the basis of the principles of the rule of law; on the other hand, however, good transatlantic relations, which are also affected by this subject.
It goes without saying that these relations should be completely open and that controversial subjects should be addressed with certain goals in view.
We shall undoubtedly continue with the policy we have pursued during the Austrian Presidency and also before that.
I mentioned some of the key points in the introduction.
We shall also address these subjects at the forthcoming summit on 22Â June.
Finally, I should like again to point out that, in all the investigations concerning suspected illegal flights and secret prisons, we in the Presidency have acted to ensure that cooperation with the investigative bodies has been as extensive as it possibly could be.
We hope that it will be possible to conclude these investigations as soon as possible.
Â Â  . Madam President, President-in-Office, we all share a deep concern about the question of human rights, because human rights are a universal principle and have universal applications.
I broadly agree with all the key elements mentioned here in the debate.
On the one hand, acts of terrorism constitute a clear violation of basic fundamental rights; on the other hand, all anti-terrorist measures must comply with international legal standards of humanitarian and human rights law.
Every person detained must be able to receive due process and a fair trial and there also has to be a strict ban on torture and ill-treatment in all circumstances.
Therefore, we all feel that GuantÃ¡namo should be closed as soon as possible.
It is also a matter of the credibility of the European Union in the Arab world.
However, it must be said that we do not apply double standards.
The European Union has a common position: last week, all 25 Member States clearly spoke out, and we have already raised the subject of GuantÃ¡namo with the US Administration on many occasions.
As Mrs Plassnik said, dialogue will be continued on the basis of this common position.
The matter will certainly be raised with our American partner at the forthcoming US-EU Summit, as well as the wider issue of the need to respect our common values in the fight against terror.
It is in our common interest to find a rapid and common solution.
Â Â  To wind up the debate, seven motions for resolutions(1) have been tabled under Rule 103(2)/Rule 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 11 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on
â the report [2005/2056(INI)] (A6-0173/2006) by MrÂ Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on improving EU-US relations in the framework of a Transatlantic Partnership Agreement and
â the report [2005/2082(INI)] (A6-0131/2006) by MrsÂ Mann, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, on EU-US Transatlantic economic relations
Â Â  . â Madam President, MrsÂ Plassnik, Commissioners, I believe â partly for the reasons that we have previously discussed â that the transatlantic relationship is extraordinarily important.
It is an issue concerned with the operation of NATO which, now as previously, is indispensable to Europeâs collective security.
In the big issues concerning business and trade, there are conflicts but also agreements.
This transatlantic community is also a community of values in spite of all the discussions we have regarding individual matters.
That being said, matters are coming slightly unstuck.
I found it remarkable that, a fortnight ago, when, at my request, the Russian Foreign Minister, MrÂ Lawrow, visited the Committee on Foreign Affairs, he proposed that the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement with Russia be extended next year and deeper institutional links be established between the Russian and EU institutions.
The European Union has agreements with just about everyone in the world, just as the United States of America does.
Only, there are no agreements between the United States and the European Union.
This will have consequences at some point.
When I consider the preparations for the summit in terms of this absence of agreements â preparations helped along by the sterling efforts of the Council and the Commission â I can see there again being discussions about many individual matters, on which there may or may not be agreement, but there being, however, no bigger picture or framework for the discussions to take place in: a framework, moreover, in which we might also be able to include the American Congress, for anyone familiar with American policy in the fields of trade, economics and foreign policy knows that speaking with the administration is only half the battle.
For this reason, we should find contractual solutions that will enable us to convert the Transatlantic Declaration into a Transatlantic Partnership Agreement.
Such an agreement would provide a framework â and our fellow Member, MrsÂ Mann, will later present this in much more detail in terms of economic policy â that will make it possible, even in the case of tensions and conflicts of interest, to reach agreements more quickly.
For the reasons I have just mentioned, I consider this to be incredibly important.
The fact is that, as the public are also aware, NATO can no longer cope with everything on its own.
The aim is that, by 2015, it should be possible for a transatlantic market to arise that can also deal with all associated problems to do with social policy and with the need to secure the multilateral dimension.
Let me not be misunderstood: a bilateral relationship should not destroy the multilateral approach of, for example, the WTO.
What this arrangement could, however, do is draw us into a âcommunity of actionsâ to promote global and regional cooperation on the basis of common values.
Underlying the arrangement would be a common basis of values and our joint interest in the arrangement.
The Iran issue is the kind of issue I have in mind: one in relation to which we can only achieve something if we act together in order peacefully to prevent people from producing atomic bombs.
We must also arrive at peaceful solutions in the Near and Middle East, where there is a cluster of common interests and values.
This is something we can do only within the framework of this dialogue, which goes above and beyond the NATO dialogue.
The currently still very sluggish Transatlantic Legislatorsâ Dialogue could be converted into a Transatlantic Assembly.
These things may at present be pipe-dreams and fantasies, but I consider it necessary to proceed in this way in order to turn them into a reality.
In order to bring such an arrangement into operation, the European Parliament should, as a first step, set up an early warning system in Washington, with a reciprocal arrangement also put in place, in order in this way to have our sights set on legislation at an early stage.
The European Parliamentâs rapporteurs should be able to speak with their opposite numbers in the American Congress in order to make progress with these matters.
In that way, consensus might be achieved at the preparatory phase, and there would subsequently be no anger of the kind now given rise to by, for example, court judgments on past actions.
I believe that we should bring our critical stance to bear.
On many issues, including the International Court of Justice, climate change and Iraq, the United States has adopted attitudes for which we need to criticise the present US Government.
Such criticism â directed towards a particular administration in individual cases and concerning specific matters â should not, however, cause the transatlantic gulf to become wider.
For this reason, the Council, the Commission and the US administration should at last find the strength to go beyond the catch-as-catch-can approach and provide a broader and deeper basis for this alliance.
Â Â  . â Madam President, greetings to all my fellow Members and, of course, to the Commission and the Council.
As so often, I have the great pleasure of preparing the accompanying report on behalf of the Committee on International Trade and, in this, I am concentrating more on foreign trade and economic themes.
As in the past, I also share the views of my fellow Member, MrÂ Brok.
Like many of our fellow Members, we have worked together for many years, and we have also always received the considerable support of this House, for which I should expressly like to thank you.
If we look at business and trade relations, then my report essentially contains one key idea.
The Commission does, of course, share the view that we should proceed on the basis of how things really are.
We already have a transatlantic market.
It exists.
It is just that we are often scarcely aware of it.
We always talk about all the things we have to do, and we always focus completely on the trade barriers that exist.
It is these trade barriers too with which the press concerns itself on a daily basis, but what frequently we no longer see at all are the positive things we have achieved.
What this report says, therefore, is: let us for once just be aware of the way things really are.
How much trade really goes on between the European Union and the United States?
What investments take place?
Another thing: what is the volume of trade done by enterprises established in both Europe and the United States?
As can be seen, the figure is huge.
I do not want to bore you now with it, but it is astronomical.
The number of jobs that depend on such trade is really extremely high.
The figure for those that we know about on each side of the Atlantic â and there are very many more, because there is a lot of data we have not obtained â in itself amounts to EURÂ 7Â million.
Here is an example that I come up with again and again: that of our famous flagship, Airbus, on the European side and of Boeing on the American side.
We are always so proud, with Europeans and Americans each believing the one to be a purely European business and the other a purely American one.
Yet that is not the case.
The two companies are 40% dependent on each other.
This provides you with a good example.
Go to MTU.
I have had the great pleasure of looking at the operation in my own constituency.
When, for example, repairs are being carried out â with the work benches, as it were, running parallel â you can see Airbus and Boeing planes each in their turn, now one and now the other.
That is only one example, however.
Building on an awareness of how things really are and proceeding on the basis of the New Transatlantic Agenda of 1995 and of the economic agenda that we have had since 1998, which has been upheld at all the summits, in all the decisions of the European Parliament and in the Commissionâs work programme and which was upheld and confirmed in the legislative dialogue that took place a couple of weeks ago in Vienna between our fellow Members and the Americans, we should therefore take a further step â not an earth-shattering step, but just a small one â and say: let us at long last remove the barriers that are causing problems.

This is not, as many people outside believe, about removing barriers to create a free-trade zone â ATTAC has been stirring things up a bit in this case â but about removing technical barriers, as we have been doing for many years.
In that way, we stick to our standards and to our precautionary principle, and we continue to maintain the rules of the internal market.
The EUâs and the Member Statesâ sovereignty is not encroached upon.
Nor is this a naÃ¯ve proposal because we know that there will, of course, be further trade disputes.
That is only natural and to be expected.
What we have here are the two largest trade blocks.
Obviously, there is a clash of interests.
That is also the way it should be.
The fact is, we have disputes in the EU too, but they do not send us into a panic every time they happen.
Disputes are normal.
Some of them we can solve within the framework of the world trade round. Many of them we cannot solve.
The Hamon dispute is one that we have not been able to solve for many years, and we are paying for the fact.
There are also problems on the American side.
For example, the Americans have difficulty recognising non-pasteurised milk, which they see as a health problem.
So what about their precautionary principle?
All right, that is just the way things are.
Let us live with the situation.
There are, however, many other barriers that we should remove.
In this report, I am asking that we do just that.
There is a point about which I still need, in a moment, to say something.
I should expressly like to thank my colleagues in the Committee, all the rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs, the Commission which, as always, has worked excellently with me and all my colleagues, and, also of course, the Council, the NGOs, the think tanks, the trade unions, the companies and those otherwise involved, as well as my own group.
Some parts of my own group â I am referring to the group of the Greens â have some problems with the term âbarrier-freeâ, because it always sounds as if it refers to a free-trade area.
Hence, my proposal for tomorrow concerning split voting.
I would propose that we simply remove such concepts and the figures referred to in connection with them.
I hope that I shall obtain the Houseâs support in this connection.
We can then all breathe a sigh of relief, and we shall have a sound basis on which to proceed.
I hope that we shall then also obtain the Houseâs full support.
Madam President, I know that you are nervous.
Nonetheless, just two more points I have to mention.
In the case of bioethanol, I should like to introduce a verbal addition.
I forgot to include bioethanol and biodiesel.
Therefore, I shall say tomorrow: and diesel.
On this subject, too, I hope that I shall obtain your support.
And that, in theory, is everything.
Thank you.
Â Â  . â Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union probably has no other partner in the world with which it has such close and intensive relations as the United States of America.
It goes without saying, then, that it is a matter of central importance for every Presidency that a strong and well-functioning network of relations should be in place.
In retrospect, 2005 saw the relationship characterised, on the whole, by positive developments.
We have achieved considerable progress on a number of issues, and we are â as is often the case prior to policies are determined â engaging in dialogue in order to reach a convergence of opinions.
Consider for instance the area of promotion of democracy, where we can take positive credit for our close cooperation during the presidential elections in Belarus.
In the run-up to the elections we declared ourselves, over and over again, in favour of a free and fair electoral process.
We called for the protection of the opposition and adopted parallel strategies in support of democratic forces.
After the elections, which were neither free nor fair, we also agreed to impose travel restrictions and targeted financial sanctions on government members and other leading individuals.
In the area of promotion of democracy, much the same holds true for Ukraine, where we are working together closely with the USA to consolidate democratic and market-economy structures.
Another example of a very close and successful ongoing cooperation is the Western Balkans.
In this case we are agreed on the necessary European or rather European-Atlantic perspective for the states of the Western Balkans.
We are, in the Contact Group, working towards a common position for the final status talks on Kosovo.
We affirm our commitment to a continuing international presence, and we are convinced that close cooperation on the basis of equal rights between the EU and NATO in the area of security policy is indispensable.
A further example is the Middle East Peace Process, where we are continually working very closely together to coordinate our position within the framework of the Quartet and on the basis of the Road Map â now a topic of particular significance, given the elections and new governments in Israel and among the Palestinians as well.
Perhaps you will allow me here to make a short comment on Iran.
Tomorrow a meeting of foreign ministers takes place in Vienna, in which the EU three, Javier Solana, China, Russia and the USA will be taking part.
The intention is that, at this meeting, an offer to Iran should be finalised, one that should make it possible for Iran to use atomic energy exclusively for peaceful purposes.
At the same time there must be absolute certainty that Iran is using or rather developing nuclear energy for no other purpose.
Today we heard with interest that my American counterpart Condoleezza Rice has spoken of the possibility, and I quote, âof newer and more positive relations between the USA and Iranâ.
We regard this as an important signal and hope that active American participation will bring us success in building a new cooperative relationship with Iran.
This is where direct dialogue between Washington and Tehran is certainly of central significance.
Stability and security, peace and prosperity are also the highest common goals of transatlantic cooperation with regard to Iraq, Afghanistan, Haiti, Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo.
In the area of justice and internal affairs, it has been possible, during the Austrian Presidency, to involve the USA in the implementation of foreign policy strategy.
A number of important challenges raise overlapping political questions in their various aspects, and they still deserve particular attention, for instance international humanitarian law, anti-terrorism and cooperation in crisis management.
It should not go unmentioned that there are topics on which we have clear differences of opinion, and in this broad dialogue it does not go without being discussed.
GuantÃ¡namo â about which we have just had a debate â is one of these issues.
Nevertheless it is important in this context to mention that the dialogue of experts on international law, which was begun under our Presidency, serves the purpose of arriving together at positions which are in accordance with our common fundamental values.
Other controversial themes which we keep on putting on the agenda of formal summits between the EU and the USA are the Visa Waiver Programme and the International Criminal Court.
We share the same opinion on many multilateral questions and we work hand in hand, but the International Criminal Court is one of the points about which there are differences of opinion.
We also take a critical view of the USAâs attempts to conclude agreements with third countries relating to ArticleÂ 98 of the Rome Statute, since this runs counter to the International Criminal Courtâs aim to have a universally valid jurisdiction.
However, let me also mention a positive aspect in this context, that being the fact that the USA has permitted the prosecution of war crimes in Sudan.
One important component to which reference was made earlier is economic relations.
Given the vast degree of economic interconnection and mutual interdependence, the successful further development of our economic relations must be a matter of priority.
We are each othersâ most important trading partners.
Two thirds of direct investment in the European Union comes from the USA, and reciprocal investments at present amount to EURÂ 1Â 500Â billion.
Mutual trade amounts to approximately EURÂ 1Â billion per day.
In view of our joint share of world production the European Union and the USA have a particular global responsibility, and so it is essential that we should cooperate closely in economic questions as well and strive together towards a progressive removal of trade barriers.
I am sure that the Commission will go into this matter in even greater detail.
Since the Spring Summit, we have achieved a great deal with the implementation of the jointly agreed working programme, for instance the first meeting of the Regulatory Cooperation Forum.
This deals among other things with the reduction or rather the removal of trade barriers which arise because of different safety regulations for cars or other goods.
Moreover, we are working on a common strategy for the protection of intellectual property rights.
We welcome Parliamentâs suggestions and recommendations, as expressed in the reports of your Members MrÂ Brok and MrsÂ Mann.
The reports show us very clearly how hard we are all working together in a united effort, and also that improving transatlantic relations is just as much a matter of great importance for you as it is for the Council and the Commission.
With this in mind, I would also like to mention that a meeting of the Transatlantic Legislators Dialogue â an important component of our relations â recently took place in Vienna.
Passing on to the specific question of the Transatlantic Partnership Agreement, discussed in the report, it seems to us that the time is not yet ripe for this, and so the Presidency recommends, in the first instance, continuing to build upon existing practical cooperation.
The New Transatlantic Agenda of 1995 continues to be the currently-applicable framework for our relations.
Since we have received clear signals from the USA that it takes a somewhat cautious view of the prospect of further formalisation of relations, we have chosen to concentrate on content and concrete results and are now striving towards a more effective use of existing structures.
The regular formal meetings of senior officials are well supplemented by a great many further contacts and agreements in all areas of common interest.
They have made the political dialogue more strategic and at the same time more substantial.
In many areas referred to in your Houseâs reports, we are already working closely together, and so there is a community of actions.
The next Summit in June 2006 in Vienna is currently being prepared by the Council and the Commission.
Our goal for the Summit is to maintain the recent dynamic in transatlantic relations.
We also want to create new initiatives for further cooperation leading up to the next Summit, whereby a matter of particular concern to us is to communicate better the intensity, importance and usefulness of the transatlantic partnership to the Europeans as well.
We have therefore decided to concentrate on a Summit statement that will look towards the future and be as concise and substantial as possible, and to supplement this with progress reports for political and economic areas.
However, we will also state our future priorities at the Summit.
These are among others a reinforced cooperation in the global promotion of peace, democracy and human rights, a new dialogue about energy security, the conclusion of an agreement on air traffic and concentrating on the implementation of intellectual property rights in third countries.
Europe and the USA are bound together inseparably, not only historically, but also by common values.
It is only together that we can meet global challenges.
Our many common economic and political interests as well as our security interests outweigh the differences which can and must exist between partners.
We are ultimately indispensable partners for each other, partners who have to bear a global responsibility together.
Â Â  . Madam President, let me start with my perception of EU-US relations from the external relations perspective.
Commissioner Mandelson will then complete the picture on the economic and trade relations.
I shall focus, therefore, more on Mr Brokâs report.
As this excellent report makes clear, the context of EU-US relations has changed enormously over the course of the last year.
Following President Bushâs visit to Brussels and the 2005 summit, the tensions we experienced in 2003 and 2004 have been replaced by a new spirit of constructive engagement.
We came out of the 2005 summit with eight declarations on a wide range of issues which guided our collaboration.
The declaration on democracy promotion shows how far our cooperation on foreign policy has come.
Even if there are differences from time to time â as we have just seen and the President-in-Office of the Council has just mentioned â we are now taking the initiative and being more proactive in our approach, rather than fire-fighting.
Our activity to spread democratic principles, respect for human rights and the rule of law â which Mr Brok highlights in his motion for a resolution â can only go so far.
Without the full commitment of the country concerned, democracy cannot be sustained.
Nevertheless, when that commitment is there, our coordinated action makes a difference, for instance â as has already been mentioned â in Ukraine, where we supported the reform process; in Belarus, where our common stance against the lack of reform sent a clear message to the regime; and in the Middle East peace process, where coordination is essential and where it works quite well.
I personally have been very closely involved in coordinating our position with the United States.
The motion for a resolution mentions the need to better coordinate assistance.
I am particularly pleased that the Quartet took up the EUâs proposal for a temporary international mechanism to channel contributions to the basic health and social needs of the Palestinian people.
We are working on that basis and I hope that we will be ready by the end of the month.
Before handing over to Mr Mandelson, let me mention four issues which are highlighted in the resolution.
The first is energy.
Both the EU and the US are faced with record high oil prices and increased dependence on foreign supplies of fossil fuels.
According to current trends, the European Union will have to import 70% of its energy in 2030 compared to 50% today.
The US is facing a similar problem.
We therefore need to take a holistic approach in tackling this problem, including involving our major partners.
At next monthâs EU-US Summit, we intend to establish a strategic cooperation on energy, addressing the security of energy supply â including the diversification of supply routes, the enforcement of market rules, the protection of infrastructure, the promotion of alternative sources of energy, and, finally, energy sufficiency.
The key is to increase predictability by creating the right market conditions and legal frameworks in both the producer and transit countries.
This is the message we will bring to the EU-US Summit, but also to the G8 Summit and to other international partners.
The second issue is visas.
One of the Commissionâs top priorities is to resolve the issue of the USâs non-reciprocal application of visa requirements.
Unfortunately, it is unlikely that we will reach a solution soon, but we will continue to press for progress and will raise it again with President Bush at the summit.
Last time, the issue was highlighted and we hoped that things would progress more quickly.
In July 2006, we will issue a second report on visa reciprocity, which may examine the possibility of taking specific measures in response to any lack of progress.
The third issue I wanted to tackle is China.
As Mr Brok rightly points out in his resolution, we need to coordinate our approach to third countries, particularly China, effectively.
We share the same approach: to help China move towards democracy and integrate fully into the world economy and the world market.
Two years ago, we took steps to coordinate ourselves better by establishing the EU-US dialogue on East Asia.
This has proved a very useful forum for discussing relations with China.
Let me address the Transatlantic Partnership Agreement.
I know that MrÂ Brokâs committee feels very strongly about this, and I fully support the desire to see transatlantic relations go from strength to strength.
As you know, I have always been open to exploring the pros and cons of a contractual relationship with the United States.
It is indeed strange that we do not have more formal relations with our most important partner.
As the President-in-Office of the Council has already said, the question is whether a formal agreement would really bring much added value today to our relations.
The most important thing is that the EU and the US work together for our common strategic cause.
For this, we need political will, in particular, but also understanding towards each other.
I feel that a treaty, for instance, would not have enabled us to bridge the differences which dogged our relations in 2003 and 2004, which were political in nature.
At this moment there is no political appetite for such an agreement either in the US Administration or among Member States.
However, this might change in the future.
Should attitudes change or should it become clear that there is, after all, an institutional obstacle to closer cooperation, then the time might be right to go further.
Let me end with a remark about the important role Parliament plays in transatlantic relations.
As you know, I have always been an enthusiastic supporter of interparliamentary exchanges.
I am convinced that these relations benefit greatly from the links between the European Parliament and the US Congress.
I very much encourage you to continue to build these ties.
I thank you for what has already been done in the legislatorsâ dialogue and what might be done before the summit.
Â Â  . Mr President, I want to thank Erika Mann for having shepherded this very impressive report through Parliament with her characteristic effectiveness, dedication and attention to detail; it is very timely.
The fact that the very comprehensive report on transatlantic economic relations has the input of half a dozen committees of this Parliament, and that it would need at least the same number of Commissioners present to discuss all the issues that are covered in it, shows how deep and intricate the EU-US economic relationship is.
That relationship effectively operates at two levels.
On one level, steady leadership is required to promote a further convergence of our shared economic rules and regulatory frameworks â our companies, our jobs and our competitiveness demand this.
At the other level, what happens in the rest of the world also depends on whether and how the EU and the US are able to react to events together.
No political relationship in our time is of greater importance to the global economy than the Transatlantic Partnership.
The response to the rise of China and India, the pressures of globalisation, the current challenges in the energy field, the way multilateral institutions function, climate change: all these depend on the ability of Europe and the United States to cooperate effectively together.
Nowhere is this more apparent than in the continuing WTO negotiations.
I am fortunate to have had a shared sense of purpose with my counterpart Rob Portman, and I look forward to continuing this with Susan Schwab, the new US Trade Representative â I hope she will be confirmed shortly by the Senate.
It is no secret that I think the European Union and the United States need to bring our positions in the Doha round closer together.
The warning bell is ringing on the DDA.
The danger lights are flashing, because if the gaps are not closed in the coming weeks, we will face serious institutional, legislative and political obstacles to ending this round.
The United States will shortly swing into election mode, trade authority is set to lapse, there are electoral constraints in other parts of the world too â a coming election in Brazil, for example.
The window on the Doha round is closing rapidly.
Europe is ready to negotiate further; we have indicated our flexibility, and no sector is out of bounds to us.
We look to our partners to express the same sense of purpose and openness.
Let me say a few words now on Erika Mannâs report itself.
I am glad that it shows strong support for the work programmes adopted last November to implement the EU-US economic initiative.
In the progress report which we will present to the next summit on 21Â June, we will be able to list some good achievements.
The EU-US action strategy for intellectual property rights enforcement in third countries will be endorsed.
It will contain a number of concrete cooperation measures, especially between our customs services and embassies in selected third countries.
On the high-level regulatory cooperation forum, too, I am satisfied that after two meetings in Brussels and Washington within a very short timeframe, we have now clearly established the forum as the place for EU and US regulators to exchange best practice.
We hope very much that the benefits of increased cooperation will soon be felt by companies on both sides of the Atlantic.
The signature of the long-awaited air services agreement, as well as the agreement on civil aviation safety, is now expected during the second half of the year.
On the air services agreement, we will have to keep pushing the US Government to go ahead with the rule-making changes and resist protectionist pressure from Congress.
Your help in this House will be most valuable to us in pursuing this goal.
I welcome your continued interest in a more visionary and strategic approach â I happen to think that there is a place for vision in politics.
I note your call for the 2006 EU-US Summit to design a new transatlantic partnership agreement that leads to the achievement of a barrier-free transatlantic market by 2015.
In my view, the EU-US economic initiative has shown that we are getting there, we are moving in that direction step by step.
Probably the right approach is to advance steadily on issues of mutual interest and to show â for example in the areas of intellectual property rights and regulatory cooperation â concrete successes to our citizens.
We have to earn our way in our acceptance of the approach that I know is supported in the report.
I think this pragmatic approach will be assured of support because in reality there is no US enthusiasm â either in the Administration or in Congress â for any âbigger bangâ EU-US scheme.
On issues like investment and public procurement, which you rightly identify as areas of enormous potential â and they do have very great potential indeed â the US has not so far shown any interest in tackling bilateral barriers.
On the investment side, the Dubai Ports fallout requires careful handling.
We have now at least established a contact group to address both old and new problems, and have proposed to the US government to include an investment paragraph in the summit declaration regarding the importance of an open transatlantic investment climate.
This should send a strong message to the US Congress, which is currently debating the Shelby bill on the tightening of the Exon-Florio Statute.
Again, your continued help on this, along with that of the US Congress, would be much appreciated.
Finally I would like to point out that we have had a very good first half of the year clearing out some important EU-US trade disputes on Foreign Sales Corporations, on Byrd, on the telecoms sanctions â I hope we can keep up the momentum in other areas.
I am looking at two other disputes particularly at the moment to see whether they are susceptible to early resolution.
FSC and Byrd prove that the WTO dispute settlement system works and that the availability of WTO-compatible sanctions can be an efficient way of obtaining US implementation of WTO judgments.
Given the good results of the WTO system, I do not see at this stage the need for the kind of formal bilateral trade dispute settlement mechanism which you propose in your report, but I do not want to reject the idea completely.
Be assured that we will exhaust all our informal channels with the United States and try everything possible to avoid going down the expensive and time-consuming route to Geneva, whenever this is avoidable.
In conclusion, let me say that the transatlantic relationship is one which is too often simply taken for granted.
Especially at this time, what we need is renewed commitment in order to make it work better.
I am grateful for your report, which has highlighted this need once again in a very timely way.
Â Â  Mr President, I too would like to congratulate MrsÂ Mann on the excellent work she has done on this report.
The report contains a goal that I would particularly like to emphasise, namely the goal of achieving a common transatlantic capital market by 2010, for this is a goal that, in turn, shows the way forward in other areas.
We can today already see that the transatlantic economy is defined by, and functions as a result of, direct investments and the ongoing collaboration between industry and research that supports trade.
It is the intensity of those investments and the quantity of acquisitions in both directions which form the basis for comprehensive trade across the Atlantic, but it is also important to achieve a high level of research and innovation.
This must be the best way to face up to and contribute to globalisation and to help bring about a strong global economy, not just for ourselves but for the rest of the world too.
The report also takes up a number of other issues, such as the importance of making it easier for companies on both sides of the Atlantic to become listed on the various stock markets, of facilitating and opening the way for company investments of equal size in both directions, of ensuring that reinsurers have the same opportunities and of ensuring that we achieve a common transatlantic capital market in the true meaning of the phrase.
If we can achieve this, we will also be in a position to achieve other goals for cooperation across the Atlantic.
Â Â  . Mr President, Erika Mannâs report is proof not only of her skills as a rapporteur, but also of the underlying strength of transatlantic economic relations.
On behalf of the Committee of Industry, I would like to make three very important points.
Firstly, as the Commissioner mentioned, in the field of energy we need cooperation on efficiency sufficiency and on sustainability.
Secondly, in relation to research â which is extremely important â our committee is now working with the Seventh Framework Programme.
Equally important is the cooperation with the institutions in the US as well as with industry.
Much can be done to facilitate more cooperation in this field.
Thirdly, we have discussed the setting-up of a body to improve discussions between industries.
We would like to set up something analogous to the very successful Iran-US claims tribunal, which, in a simple and elegant way, resolves thousands of disputes.
We would like something similar in the future.
Finally, I would also like to underline the importance of parliamentary exchanges to begin discussions and to bring success on these three extremely important topics.
Â Â  . Mr President, within the scope of transatlantic economic relations, it is important to recognise the role and specificities of the culture and education sectors.
We are pleased, therefore, to note that the rapporteur has taken into account the entire opinion of the Committee on Culture and Education.
The âcultural keyâ can actually contribute towards strengthening our relationship and promoting mutual understanding between Europeans and Americans.
Consequently, the establishment of a dialogue devoted to culture and education should encourage regular exchange of good practice and experience in fields such as the fight against piracy, the mobility of cultural players, or, again, the development of cultural tourism.
Regarding education, this dialogue should focus on strengthening the mutual recognition of vocational qualifications but also on interchanges of researchers and of university teachers and students.
We should mention, therefore, that the forthcoming renewal of the Cooperation programme between our two continents in the fields of higher education and vocational training will also be of great benefit.
On the other hand, the specificity of the audiovisual sector entails transatlantic exchanges that respect Europeâs cultural and linguistic diversity.
On this point, and in conclusion, we regret, nonetheless, that the United States did not choose to follow the Union and vote in favour of the Unesco Convention.
Finally, I congratulate MrsÂ Mann for the quality of her work and careful listening.
Â Â  . Mr President, since mutual trust between the United States and the European Union has come under pressure in recent years, I should like to single out two things that need to be resolved in order for that trust to be rebuilt.
We should not resign ourselves to the visa requirements which the United States imposes on some EU citizens.
Commission President Barroso was right to urge the United States to lift the visa requirements for citizens from the ten new Member States.
It is unfair, on principle, to use double standards such as these for EU citizens.
In the coming weeks, the temporary committee of inquiry into alleged CIA camps will be discussing its draft interim report.
There are indications that irregularities have occurred in the treatment of suspects, but so far, there is no hard evidence of this.
This temporary committee will continue its activities in order to deliver convincing evidence, if possible.
In that light, Parliament will, in the run-up to the Summit, need to insist on substantial cooperation.
I should like to ask your support for paragraph 11 from the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, which has been tabled as AmendmentÂ 34.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to thank MrsÂ Mann for an excellent report and for her extremely close and constructive cooperation during the time we have spent working on it.
The USA is in a class of its own as the most important trading partner we in Europe have, which is a fact we often forget.
The focus in public debate is mostly on what few problems there are in our trade relations.
There is talk of crisis and conflict between Europe and the USA. This can be the case occasionally in the political sphere, but from an economic perspective precisely the opposite is, in actual fact, the case.
I might even dare to whisper that the trade between us has undergone a revolution.
Today, the flow of trade between us is a fantastical EUR 1Â billion per day.
The deepest form of cross-border economic integration is mutual direct foreign investments.
These have increased sharply and now stand at EUR 1.5Â trillion.
These are more than mere figures.
Even if we do not think about it, the result is new opportunities for us in our everyday lives.
The market that we have has, for example, created nearly sevenÂ million jobs in Europe.
It gives us more and more services and better products.
Transatlantic trade, moreover, forms a large part of the engine of the world economy.
If our relationship shows signs of weakness, there are knock-on effects for the whole world.
The trade between us is thus not an alternative to trade with poorer countries.
On the contrary, it is, in fact, a precondition and something that makes us all, throughout the world, richer.
We must not take it for granted.
We must carry on our work and integrate our economies.
I therefore hope that we, together with the USA, can realise the idea of a barrier-free transatlantic market by 2015.
Yesterday, I received an e-mail from the left-wing antiglobalisation movement.
They exhorted me and every other MEP to vote against this report.
Their argument was that, if this report were voted through by a majority in Parliament, it would open the way for an accelerated process of increased free trade between the USA and Europe.
I hope that they are right and, for exactly that reason, I and the Swedish Conservatives intend to vote, rather, in favour of the report and in favour of a transatlantic freeÂ trade area.
Â Â  .
Mr President, thank you for the record amount of time you have allocated to me, as a result of which I shall be to the point and say first of all that my group supports MrÂ Brokâs report as well as the compromises we have struck in the Committee on Foreign Affairs; I would like to express my appreciation for the work he has done since it is, I think, important that the two major groups more or less take the same line on such an important topic as our relationship with the United States.
What is paramount, as far as we are concerned, is the fact that the United States and the European Union have many shared interests, not least in the economic area, and we cannot sufficiently stress the importance of those economic interests.
Those also include the risks that these entail, considering the differences in financial policy of the EU countries and that of the United States.
Certainly in that area, we must try to strengthen cooperation with them, and MrsÂ Mannâs report contains many initiatives to that effect which are, in my view, very valuable.
There is, by the same token, no denying the fact that we see things differently in certain areas.
That is something that is, in fact, very well demonstrated in MrÂ Brokâs report.
We are both independent partners in the partnership.
I also support the idea of creating a more contractual relationship and partnership, which opens up the possibility, in the event of problems, of being able to discuss those openly and honestly, not least at parliamentary level.
My question is only whether the USA is prepared to recognise the European Union to such an extent that it is prepared to enter into such a contractual relationship.
We must, in the coming years, try to develop fresh policy in a number of areas, including energy policy, given the energy problems we experience and where the US and the Europeans share a number of common interests.
I am in favour of a deeper relationship and of our cooperation to be fleshed out at federal level.
I could go on for hours about this important topic, but I will have to leave it there.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, every partnership has its ups and downs, its strengths and weaknesses.
The most important thing is that the basis is sound, and despite all the differences of opinion and all the frustration felt by Americaâs friends about some of the present administrationâs policies, the basis here is sound.
As the President-in-Office of the Council says, economic exchange is strong; people-to-people contacts are working, and politically too, numerous networks of intensive contacts have emerged from different dialogue formats and ad-hoc cooperation.
Yet the mutual cooperation could still be improved: the New Transatlantic Agenda was well-constructed, but it has not become a genuine foundation and must be revitalised.
The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe therefore supports the proposal put forward by MrÂ Brok in his report for a Transatlantic Partnership Agreement as well as MrsÂ Mannâs vision of a transatlantic market.
Of course an agreement will add value only if it is filled with life, which means that the American side, too â especially in Congress â must demonstrate a real commitment to it.
Given the current and long-term challenges that we face, progress here is absolutely necessary.
As great democracies, we cannot afford not to fulfil our joint potential, and that is why a Partnership Agreement could be a step in the right direction, so let us take it!
I would like to add that I am glad that we are having this debate in Brussels and not in Strasbourg.
Â Â  â Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Madam Deputy President of the Commission, I will concentrate on MrÂ Brokâs report.
Insofar as the report deals with the International Criminal Court or the question of food safety, we hope for clear speaking.
I believe that it is important to ensure that the European position is taken into account in an appropriate way.
In the context of the Transatlantic Partnership, which should enter into force in 2007, it is however an important fact that the present American administration has become a sort of lame duck, and so it is open to question whether it makes sense to conclude this sort of agreement with it.
Finally I would like to discuss a point in connection with environmental policy, to which my group attaches particular importance.
I would like to heartily recommend to all Members the new documentary by AlÂ Gore; his film draws the attention of our American friends to the very, very important problem of global warming, which concerns us all and which should feature more prominently in the report, and I would like to quote Al Goreâs statement that:
âI even believe that there is a chance that within the next two years even Bush and Cheney will be forced to change their position on this crisis.â
Â Â  â Mr President, my group is in favour of strengthening trade activity with the USA, just as much as we support the extension of trade in goods with Africa, South America or Australia.
However, in her report MrsÂ Mann calls, in her own words, for âa barrier-free transatlantic marketâ, and that is a free trade zone.
Trade should not be an end in itself for the purpose of higher profit rates, but one of the instruments for ensuring that the population is supplied with goods and services, for creating jobs and promoting social development and prosperity.
We should therefore first of all assess whether the potential partner complies with internationally agreed standards on the protection of social security, jobs, environment and human rights and whether or not the partner accepts the institutions created to safeguard these.
Three brief examples: Firstly, there are fundamentally different opinions about GMOs and hormone-treated meat.
The citizens of the European Union do not want these things.
In the USA however it is absolutely legal to trade in them.
Secondly, while public services and comprehensive social security systems are basic parts of political culture in the European Union, this is viewed differently in the USA.
I ask you: How, in such an integrated economic area, can these things, which are of such importance to, and in the interests of, the public and the European Union, be preserved?
Thirdly, does it, or does it not, distort competition if the USA does not sign the Kyoto Protocol?
Of course it does, for they can then produce more cheaply to the detriment of the environment.
As for the decisions of the WTO arbitration court on such things as cotton export subsidies, the USA simply ignores them.
To conclude: this House recently adopted the Agnoletto report, which clearly states that the European Union should include a clause on human rights in all treaties with third countries.
The USA makes war in Iraq in contravention of international law; it does not recognise the International Criminal Court; it holds prisoners of war in inhuman conditions in prisons like the one in GuantÃ¡namo Bay.
I believe that this Parliament will lose all credibility whatsoever if it moves towards a free trade zone with the USA, without the USA having previously complied with internationally agreed standards and norms.
Â Â  . Mr President, as this Houseâs rapporteur on relations between the European Union and the Peopleâs Republic of China, I welcome in my draft document the American proposal for a strategic dialogue with the EU about Chinaâs peaceful rise.
This, occurring as it does on a global scale, does, after all, give Europe and the USA an equal share of headaches, which are not restricted to trade conflicts or the enforcement of human rights in China.
I therefore see paragraphs 8, 9 and 21 of the report by MrÂ Brok that we are considering as being a welcome helping hand, for they each promote a transatlantic approach to the relationship with China.
This would, specifically, help diffuse the dangerous tension surrounding Taiwan, as well as move the Tibet issue forward.
Only this morning, the Dalai Lama told me of his personal conviction that the Tibetan issue must, as a matter of urgency, be dealt with at transatlantic level.
I think that we could, by combining transatlantic forces, persuade China to be a real stakeholder in the international system.
Â Â  .Mr President, the plan for strengthening the desired cooperation with the United States has been outlined in an extremely well-balanced manner in the Brok and Mann reports.
Free trade, legislative dialogue and closer cooperation on security and defence are naturally the main areas of action.
I would like to congratulate both rapporteurs.
I should now like to make a few brief political comments.
If we in Europe want to avoid playing the role of junior partner, we cannot afford to fall further and further behind on economic and military matters.
I must say that I am surprised at the complaints regarding American unilateralism, since our defence spending is two thirds that of Americaâs.
I am concerned that Europe has only 25% of the USAâs mobile defence potential, and that we have an outdated structure of NATO bases in Europe, which in addition may be scaled down in favour of vague European projects.
Europe will not be a global player if we lose our capability to create a strategic political partnership with the USA.
We cannot replace the USA for some other, better partner in this partnership.
There is only one alternative open to a Europe with a declining economy, ailing public finances and tragic demographic figures.
That alternative is marginalisation and isolation on the edges of a world that is forging ahead, sometimes recklessly, and sometimes even with hostility to ourselves.
Â Â  Mr President, today we are debating one of the EUâs most important partners, and the challenge our relationship with that partner poses to us.
In this Chamber we often hear strong words of criticism and condemnation of the USA and, much more rarely, appeals to refrain from making any judgments of our largest ally.
We should reject both extremes.
Europe needs the United States, and the United States needs Europe.
I say this against a background of rapid growth in the role of Asia, as well as an increase in the demographic and political role of Latin America and Africa.
Obsessive anti-Americanism is a disaster, but it is equally disastrous to be deprived of the right to ask our friends questions, for example to do with Guantanamo Bay.
We must also patiently explain to Washington that if we are retreating, albeit slowly, from interventionism and protectionism in trade, America should do the same for the sake of balance.
EU-US relations should in the near future take the form of a real partnership and a strategic alliance, but this will only happen if we do not succumb to the stereotype of âEurope the teacherâ on the one hand, and âEurope the American clientâ on the other.
Â Â  â Mr President, I should like to express my warm congratulations both to MrÂ Brok and to MrsÂ Mann for the creative contributions to the dialogue which they have presented to us today.
As shown by the relevant statistics, which I will not comment on due to lack of time, EU-US economic relations are characterised by symmetry and acute interdependence.
Any crises which arise from time to time are, in my opinion, factors of the â so far â unresolved question of the management of this interdependence.
This interdependence does not relate only to the past; it also relates to the new global economic and social challenges, including the so-called Millennium Goals.
Meeting these global challenges depends on moving bilateral relations from the current level of pronouncements to a cohesive, transparent and stable institutional framework and a more harmonised bilateral regulatory environment.
A transatlantic market without barriers is a feasible objective; it just needs to be based on a new and unified regulatory architecture.
Enlargement and intensification of the areas of close cooperation between the European Union and the USA are expected to have a positive spillover effect on all the problems which constitute the challenges of the contemporary global agenda.
I would refer, among other things, to the promotion of common principles and values, such as democracy, the rule of law, defence of fundamental rights and freedoms, taking a broader view of the global trade order, effective international environmental protection, combating terrorism and organised crime and establishing a new financial architecture.
By contrast, breaking the cohesion in EU-US relations will exacerbate international uncertainty and will have adverse repercussions on global cooperation, peace, stability and security, both political and economic.
The completion of negotiations at the Doha Round constitutes, as Commissioner Mandelson has also said, a test ground for this close relationship between the European Union and the USA.
Â Â  Mr President, we need to deepen both economic and political relations between the European Union and the USA, and to draw up a new transatlantic partnership agreement to take effect as of 2007.
I would particularly like to stress the role of political dialogue between the European Parliament and the US Congress.
Every EU-US summit should be preceded by a meeting of the Transatlantic Legislative Dialogue, dealing with political, economic, cultural and social issues.
The aim should be for the Transatlantic Legislative Dialogue to become one of the most important platforms for EU foreign policy-making.
The USAâs hegemonistic role at the start of the 21st century requires the EU to display autonomy and true partnership in transatlantic relations, as well as to ask questions openly and to search for a common political platform.
The most pressing issues are still the need to convince the USA to take part in reforming the UN and to respect human rights and civil liberties in the fight against terror.
These issues must be discussed at the next EU-US summit.
I should also like to highlight the issue of visas.
The European Union should not tolerate a situation in which the citizens of some Member States require a visa to stay in the USA.
The relevant EU institutions should pose the question of lifting visa restrictions for the USA for all citizens of the European Union in their contacts with the US authorities.
Â Â  Mr President, both reports, especially Erika Mannâs, show the intensity of the relationship between the European Union and the United States, and, at the same time, highlight the long list of areas in which there might be difficulties and misunderstandings.
It is a good time to underline how strong this relationship is and to what extent it goes far beyond the current administration and the problems with the specific administration and specific leadership, which some of us will not like.
It is something that is deeper than that and it goes far beyond that.
It goes beyond the strong political debate we might have.
Precisely because the relationship is strong, it allows us to tell the truth to the other party.
However, the relationship lacks a real new structure, a real new architecture.
As is mentioned in the reports, we need a new architecture to protect this relationship, to protect it from external storms and to make it much more solid than it is now.
This needs commitment from the Commission.
We are not seeing this commitment in looking for this new architecture, and I think it is the Commissionâs role to develop and to work towards that direction.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to thank Erika Mann for all her work on this report and for her willingness and openness to at least consider other perspectives and views.
However, I do still have some concerns about it.
Firstly, there is at least a question mark over whether now is the right time, politically, to be advancing a policy of what is essentially a bilateral free trade area.
We are in a time when the multilateral system is in crisis.
We have therefore to consider what political message we are sending by doing that.
Secondly, my concern is that by pursuing extremely controversial issues such as the liberalisation of investment, public procurement and services in a projected transatlantic free trade area, other countries could well perceive that as the EU and US setting the stage for transferring the negotiations over to the global level.
As you know, they have been extremely highly contested in the WTO framework.
Finally, on the issue of regulation and harmonisation, in spite of amendments and some nice rhetoric to the contrary, there is a risk that we will see a levelling down â rather than a levelling up â of hard-won environmental health and consumer standards.
Â Â  Mr President, in the context of the new Transatlantic Partnership Agreement, I would like to draw particular attention to the current controversy between the EU and the USA on the strategies and methods used in fighting global terrorism.
The controversy has had the direct result of diminishing the effectiveness of both partners.
Global terrorism is a new phenomenon whose extent is not yet fully known, but which has a wide reach and operational capabilities.
It has even been compared with Communism, in that it threatens everyone.
Instead of appointing some strange investigatory commission with no real powers, we ought to establish proper cooperation between the EU Member States and the United States, by which I also mean strengthening cooperation between their intelligence services.
Clear principles, coordinated action and mutual trust are needed to fight terrorism, and thereby to provide real protection for human rights in the modern world.
Â Â  Mr President, although the draft resolution points out â and with good reason â the need for a stable institutional framework for transatlantic relations, I do believe that this debate should not just be about structures.
It is, above all, important that there should be a willingness to work together on both sides of the ocean and to address together the problems that we face.
As far as the fight against terrorism is concerned, we in this House have already devoted much attention â as indeed we should have done â to GuantÃ¡namo Bay and the CIAâs allegedly unlawful practices in Europe.
It goes without saying that the fight against terrorism must be conducted within a strictly legal framework.
It should also be said, though, that some groups here in this House are not as much interested in the rights of terrorists or alleged terrorists as they are in mainly indulging in basic anti-Americanism.
If those groups were as active in denouncing the human rights violations in Cuba, for example, much more progress would have been made by now.
We are talking here about people who have not only been charged with terrorism, but are also behind bars because of their political views.
Â Â  Mr President, transatlantic relations are essential if the United States and the European Union are to deal with their shared challenges successfully.
Both of us are firmly committed to achieving a secure international order.
To this end, combating terrorism effectively must be our priority.
In the face of totalitarianism and lack of freedom, there is no option but to have a strong and solid alliance with our natural partners, the United States: that is the only alliance that has produced, and will continue to produce, results.
I would like to take this opportunity to welcome the United Statesâ Secretary of Stateâs announcement on Washington joining the multilateral negotiations on the Iranian nuclear programme.
If Teheran renounces uranium enrichment activities, Iran must completely and verifiably suspend all of its uranium enrichment and reprocessing activities.
We need full cooperation, leaving aside the hypocritical demagoguery of facile anti-Americanism.
The need to intensify relations with the United States and to establish an Association Agreement, as requested in the Brok report, is of crucial importance.
We must enhance our relations, while maintaining a critical spirit, and explore new opportunities for greater joint and coordinated action at international level and greater integration of our markets, which will benefit our citizens.
