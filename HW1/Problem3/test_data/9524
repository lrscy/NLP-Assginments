In the ninth indent â and this is a further technical correction that is required â the figure of EURÂ 1.5 billion should be replaced by the figure of EURÂ 1.2 billion.
These are the technical corrections required to ensure that the text and table are consistent.
Then I should like to draw your attention to AmendmentÂ 6 to paragraphÂ 31.
If the second part of AmendmentÂ 6 is adopted, I would ask you to accept it as an addition to paragraphÂ 31.
This is the part of the amendment that reads, âconsiders that allocation of funding should fall under the ânormalâ EU budget and thus under the discharge authority of the EPâ.
That is all on this amendment.
Thirdly, having held further talks just now, I should like to ask my group, contrary to the voting list, to support Amendment 19 to paragraphÂ 50, second indent, tabled by the Socialist Group.
This is after all only a slight nuance, which does not change my intention as rapporteur.
We take note of your comments, which will of course be incorporated into the text being put to the vote.
Please allow me to make a few brief comments on the importance of this Parliamentâs vote on this resolution.
We are all aware that over the coming days the European institutions have the serious responsibility to reach an agreement on the Union's priorities for the coming years and to provide the financial resources necessary for them.
Parliament has established its position, which we have just voted for by a large majority.
During our debate yesterday, President Barroso told us that, despite certain differences, he is comfortable with Parliament's proposal, because what we have just voted for and what the Commission is proposing are not so different.
I believe that the Member States must do whatever they can to reach an agreement on 16 and 17 June, and I believe that we can trust in the efforts being made by the Luxembourg Presidency.
Minister Schmit has taken the view that Parliament's approach is realistic and consistent.
I believe that we are in a position to call upon the Council also to demonstrate realism, ambition and consistency so that the European Union can continue to operate.
Finally, everybody should be aware that if there were no financial perspectives, the Union would operate on the basis of the annual budgetary procedure laid down in Article 272 of the current Treaty, which provides Parliament with very significant room for manoeuvre.
Parliament would use it, but since that would lead to conflicts we do not want to see between the two arms of the budgetary authority, we would once again urge the Council to reach an agreement Parliament can accept.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the light of the referenda in the two countries that have just said no to the Constitutional Treaty, a more democratic strategy seems necessary.
It is time to prove it, in the matter currently concerning us.
First of all, I shall ask that the Council be invited, as proposed in paragraph 4 of the resolution, to indicate the positions of the national delegations, duly named, within the framework of the legislative process, instead of keeping them secret, including from the European Parliamentâs rapporteur, and this with the peculiar notion of protecting the effectiveness of the Institutionâs decision-making process.
Secondly, the text seeks to make the debates of the Council public, when it is acting in a legislative capacity, and this would enable us, in particular, to know what it thinks of the amendments tabled by the European Parliament.
For example, I gather that the opinion of the European Parliament concerning the framework decision on racism, which dates from 2002, that is to say from three years ago, has still not been examined â or, at least, it had not been last week â by the âJusticeâ Council.
Thirdly, as indicated in paragraphs five and six of this resolution, the text seeks to include the European Parliament when the European Union concludes international agreements, since these agreements are not even referred to the national parliaments.
Finally, I would point out that the European Parliament has already asked, during the preceding session, to be included, within the framework of the codecision procedure, in the creation of the future Agency for Fundamental Rights.
Finally, we can only deplore the disastrous financial perspective for this area.
As the rapporteur and on behalf of the committee that it is my honour to chair, I call upon the President of the European Parliament to submit these demands to the next European Council and to the future British Presidency.
When the new Commission was appointed, we had asked for a review of the regulations concerning transparency.
We were told that it was too soon.
I can only conclude, in the light of the international ballots, that it is perhaps too late.
Someone has to take responsibility for that.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr Cavada.
Your requests will be duly dealt with by the Presidency.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, there are two reports left: the Gaubert report and the Bowis report.
It is 1.15 p.m.
If you are in agreement, and only if you are in agreement, we could postpone the vote on these two reports until tomorrow.
Â Â  If those Members of the European Parliament who are members of the did not take part in the vote on the motion of censure, it was not because of political sympathy with the Commission but because the motion was ill presented and ill conceived.
We would have been quite prepared to censure MrÂ Barroso for his political actions and, in particular, for the obstinacy that allows the Commission to disregard the very clear vote expressed recently both by the French people and the Dutch people.
When, however, one calls into question a personâs worthiness, one has to be sure of where one stands and one has to be prepared to see matters through.
Mr Bondeâs tacit withdrawal of his motion of censure, just before it was voted on, shows that he was in no such position.
Consequently, we feared that hastiness might undermine the motion of censure, which has to be reserved only for the very serious circumstances for which my group has decided to use it in future.
Â Â  There are 90 of us who, as MEPs, have signed a motion of censure on the Commission, because it was the only way we had of getting the President of the Commission to come here to Parliament and explain the connection between a gift of a holiday worth between EURÂ 20Â 000 and EURÂ 25Â 000 and a subsequent decision to provide EURÂ 10Â million in regional aid to his friend Spyros Latsis, 54th on the list of the worldâs richest people.
We wrote in our motion of censure that we would withdraw said motion if we were given a reasonable explanation.
We were given an explanation, but Parliamentâs President has in the meantime decided that, contrary to our wishes, we must vote on the motion.
We are satisfied that, in future, motions of censure are to be accepted from the moment they are submitted with 74 signatures, whereupon they shall automatically be put to the vote.
The motion was submitted under the old rules, however.
Some of us will therefore choose to abstain from voting when the motion is put to the vote.
That does not mean that we are satisfied with the Commissionâs answer, but we are pleased about the undertakings given during the debate, and we shall pursue the matter in the Committee on Budgetary Control and go on fighting for complete openness about gifts and about membership of the Commissionâs 3Â 000 secret working parties.
Â Â  Today's vote on the Motion of Censure was a farce.
The Parliament voted, with a massive majority, to pat Mr Barroso on the back and tell him what a splendid job he is doing.
It tells him and the other Commissioners that they can accept any amount of hospitality, from anyone, without there being any question of being held to account.
The Motion was called only because of Barroso's refusal to come clean over hospitality, and the intransigence and blind obedience of the major political groups.
Well, despite the strong arm tactics and bullying we managed to have a debate, which is a small victory for transparency.
The silence of Mr. Barroso, on the very central and direct question on the Latsis Group and the EU relations, no doubt proves there are no longer business links between them.
However due to a re-interpretation of the rules we are forced into today's vote which was never our intention. So be it.
The European Parliament may have confidence in Mr Barroso, but other recent votes out there in the real world suggest that the peoples of Europe have lost confidence in his project.
Â Â  . As a signatory of the Motion of Censure, my intention, as declared in the Motion, was to ensure that Commission President JosÃ© Manuel Barroso should come to the parliament to explain the lavish hospitality which he had received from a Greek shipping magnate.
This objective was achieved, and like most signatories I should then have been very happy for the Motion to be withdrawn.
Apparently this was not possible for procedural reasons.
Since I did not wish the Motion to be voted at all, it seemed that my most logical course of action would be to abstain on the vote.
Â Â  .Governmental officials are required to keep their hands clean, whether they are employed by the European Union or by local communities.
They have to avoid conflicts of interest such as personally rewarding links with companies.
In Mr Barroso's case, being the President of the European Commission, doubts about such corporate links have arisen.
Therefore we signed a motion of censure with the explicit and exclusive goal to initiate a debate in the plenary session.
Although this debate has already taken place on the 25th of May, we have no reasons to be satisfied with Mr Barroso's replies yet.
We strongly believe that a majority of MEPs indeed has made it too easy for Mr Barroso to take the criticism seriously.
In the meantime we have received fresh information about Mr Barroso's corporate involvement.
Although this information has been insufficient yet for bringing this motion of censure to the vote, it might as well become sufficient later.
If we would have had the freedom to withdraw or postpone the motion of censure, we would have done so.
As it seems, though, that it is no longer possible to withdraw this motion, we have decided to abstain from voting today.
Â Â  . I am unable to vote in favour of the Motion of Censure before us.
The Commission and its President have been involved in very important work in the context of the debate on the Financial Perspective.
Consequently, the purpose of this attack on him, which is devoid of any ethical basis, is simply to undermine a Community institution.
Those responsible have an outlook that errs not by going against the grain but by simply being against, without bringing any positive proposal to the table.
Ethical requirements go hand in hand with a responsible attitude, which is clearly not the case with this Motion of Censure.
Â Â  The reason I voted in favour of the BÃ¶ge report was because I believe it is necessary to demonstrate the EUâs ability to take action through its institutions after the failed referenda in France and the Netherlands.
As an equal to the Council, Parliament clearly formulated its political priorities in relation to the Financial Perspective.
Thanks to the rapporteur, a framework has been created with the utmost professionalism which provides real added value, and which sets out feasible and acceptable financial thresholds that will eventually be transformed into specific tools and programmes.
The fact that cohesion funding will be maintained at 4% of GDP is of great importance for the new Member States, as they stand to receive a substantial amount of funding for cohesion and structural measures.
At the same time, emphasis is laid on a fairer distribution of contributions by net payers, in keeping with the spirit of solidarity.
The BÃ¶ge report represents an acceptable compromise between the generous proposal by the Commission and the inadequate proposal by the Council.
The challenge that the Council faces is to enable negotiations on the Financial Perspective to be concluded while Luxembourg still holds the presidency, and at any rate no later than by the end of this year, by means of its unanimous approval at the June summit.
Â Â  Mr President, in relation to the BÃ¶ge report I speak on behalf of my colleagues in the Irish delegation of the PPE-DE Group: Mrs Doyle, Mr Mitchell, Mr Coveney and Mr Higgins.
We congratulate Mr BÃ¶ge on his report and we are happy with its broad thrust.
However, I have to register our concerns about the financing of agriculture.
We voted with our Spanish colleagues, so the onus is on the Council and not the Member States to meet any shortfall that arises.
In the light of a recent reform of the common agricultural policy, the current position of Parliament, which would suggest cofinancing, will not be viewed very well by our farmers and rural dwellers.
I believe that it sends out the wrong signal, at a time when public confidence in Europe is suffering, and that the common agricultural policy is damaged by any mention of cofinancing.
We have therefore voted to that effect.
Â Â  I am pleased with the position adopted by the European Parliament on the financial perspectives and I now only hope that the Council will do its duty and reach an agreement on the 17th.
But several of us have abstained on a matter of principle, and that is that we do not accept ââ not even hypothetically ââ any reopening of the 2002 agreement on the common agricultural policy.
We want it to remain closed until 2013, as has been agreed.
Â Â  . In light of:
1. the political context and the need to involve the various European partners in building a stable financial framework that will ensure sustainable development and job creation;
2. the need for the European institutions to give a clear sign that they are committed to seeking solutions to the citizensâ problems;
3. the need to channel efforts into reaching an agreement with which most of Europeâs 453Â million citizens can identify, thereby ensuring unity in diversity;
4. the fact that cohesion policy represents the EUâs internal solidarity and that, despite current limitations, this principle has at least been upheld;
the Portuguese Socialists in Parliament voted in favour of the BÃ¶ge report on the Financial Perspective 2007-2013.
Â Â  Tough prioritising of the European Unionâs resources is crucially important to bringing about the changes needed by Europe.
Issues concerned with enlargement and with forging close links between EU countries need to be given priority, as well as the fight against crime and the work on making the EU into the worldâs most competitive economy.
Aid for the weakest regions must be given priority, as must the ambition substantially to increase the EUâs research budget.
Priority must also be given to the role of the EU in relation to the climate issue and to fighting poverty and infectious diseases.
We do not accept an increase in administrative costs of 3% per year.
Low taxes on work and enterprise are one precondition for turning Europe into a successful economy.
These require room for manoeuvre in the Member Statesâ financial policy.
We therefore believe that the levels of commitments and payments adopted by the European Parliament are too high.
In order to reduce the EUâs budget, we wish to revise the agreement from 2002 concerning agricultural expenditure and to carry out an overhaul of regional aid, with priority instead being given to the poorest regions.
For these reasons, we have abstained in the final vote, rather than voted against Parliamentâs proposal, significant parts of which we are able to support.
We cannot, however, give our support to the unduly high level of expenditure, especially as the way in which it would be distributed would not coincide with our priorities.
Â Â  Mr BÃ¶geâs report represents Parliamentâs mandate for negotiation with a view to the next financial perspective for 2007-2013.
I voted against this report for the following reasons.
1.
The process of ratification of the Constitutional Treaty showed that some of the nations of Europe had doubts about the effectiveness of European socio-economic policies.
I am convinced that the European Union has to have an ambitious budget that gives to the Communityâs authorities the means of carrying out their task.
The BÃ¶ge report, which fixes the payment appropriations at 1.7% of the Gross National Income, does not measure up to this challenge.
2.
The emphasis on budgetary restraint undermines the European commitment towards farmers.
It also threatens the viability of the common market organisation (CMO) for sugar, the reform of which it will not be possible to finance.
I do not accept that farmers should become the victims of national self-interest, implicit in the BÃ¶ge report.
3.
The introduction of joint financing, which opens the way to renationalisation of the common agricultural policy (CAP), is, in my opinion, unacceptable.
It signals a departure from the only public policy that is genuinely European, at a moment in our history when Europe needs to become stronger by sharing its strengths.
Giving in to national misgivings would further widen the gap between Europe and its nations.
Â Â  MrÂ Wohlinâs written reservation concerning MrÂ BÃ¶geâs report, together with MrsÂ Goudinâs speech in Parliament on 7Â June 2005, helpfully sum up why the June List has chosen to vote against this report.
We support the Swedish Governmentâs and the other five countriesâ demand that the EUâs budget should not exceed 1.00% of gross national income, be it in payments or commitments.
The EU must fulfil its commitments towards the ten new Member States, but room is made for this expenditure within the present expenditure framework.
The difference between our demand for 1.00% and the European Parliamentâs (and the Commissionâs) proposal lies in the fact that the EU-15 (with the exceptions of Greece and Portugal) have, in particular, to forgo aid from the Cohesion Fund.
The June List welcomes the initiative in terms of cofinancing and hopes that this will open the way to future renationalisation of, for example, agricultural policy.
We also support the idea of a correction mechanism to compensate those countries that, under the present system, account for a disproportionately large proportion of the EUâs income.
The correction mechanism will hopefully also be an alternative to the British rebate.
By rejecting the Constitution, both France and the Netherlands have shown that they prefer less, rather than more, supranationalism.
A Swedish veto in the Council against a bad compromise is a better alternative than a new long-term budget.
A vote against this report is an emphatic vote in favour of increased subsidiarity.
Â Â  . We say no to the proposals tabled by the Commission and Parliament on the Financial Perspective 2007-2013, firstly because, politically and financially, they reflect the objectives enshrined in the so-called âEuropean Constitutionâ, such as the primacy of competition, the reinforcement of âfortress Europeâ and the militarisation of the EU; and, secondly, because they are woefully inadequate in financial terms if we want to foster âsocial and economic cohesionâ and to meet the social, economic and environmental challenges of the enlarged EU.
We say no because we are opposed to any move to help the most economically developed countries â or rather their large economic and financial groups â to derive, once again, the lionâs share of the political and economic benefit from the EU, serving their interests ahead of the interests of Portugal and the Portuguese people.
We say no because what we need is to make a clean break from the EUâs neoliberal policies and, on the basis of cooperation between equal sovereign States, to foster sustainable economic development, create jobs and combat persistently high levels of unemployment, poverty, social exclusion and income inequality.
We therefore reject the report by Mr BÃ¶ge. Instead we advocate the alternative resolution tabled by our Group on the Financial Perspective 2007-2013, containing proposals that defend Portugalâs interests.
Â Â  . Explanations of vote.
We voted against Amendment 26 because its wording implies that the EU's Northern Dimension should be reformulated as the Baltic Strategy.
We are in favour of the creation of a Baltic Strategy for the European Union, but it should be part of the Northern Dimension.
We would have liked those who tabled the amendment to agree to an oral amendment, which would have clearly highlighted the importance of the Northern Dimension and the Baltic Strategy as a vital part of it.
Â Â  . Natura 2000 finds that it has no budget!
The major omission from the financial perspective is, once again, nature conservation.
In the course of numerous debates, however, each Member of the European Parliament acknowledged that Natura 2000 was an integral part of European Union policy, that the first experiments in managing sites had produced very positive results and, better still, they had made it possible to lay the foundations for sustainable development in areas of important biological value.
The environment, having previously been kept in check, was turning out to be the trump card for new development based on a realisation of the importance of the natural heritage of our countries.
The report mentions the EURÂ 21 billion needed to continue to run Natura 2000 for 2007-2013 but there was not a single line of the budget that referred to this figure in the forecasts of expenditure.
An amendment adopted in plenary even managed to remove Natura 2000 from the funding for fishing.
This indicates that there is no policy in a position to contribute to the setting up of Natura 2000.
Does this mean that Natura 2000 will be nipped in the bud by the financial perspective?
The only remaining hope for nature conservation now rests with the LIFE+ fund.
The European Parliament will need to redeem itself by including a share for Natura 2000 in this financial instrument for the environment.
Â Â  . I and my British Conservative colleagues have voted against this report because it falls short of proposing the financial reform that is necessary in order for the EU taxpayer to receive better value for money.
Now is not the time to ask for more money from Member States when the public perceives the EU budget as a 'black hole'.
Instead, the EU should do less but do it better.
Consequently, we support actually capping the EU budget contributions by Member States to 1% Gross National Income.
The EU must manage the funding it receives in a more transparent and cost-effective manner, targeted towards stimulating economic growth and prosperity across Europe.
Finally, the British Government be allowed to abandon the UK rebate for any short-term alternatives.
Currently, the UK receives receipts per capita that are probably the lowest in the EU, receiving less, in terms of infrastructure and agricultural subsidies, than states such as France and Italy.
Indeed, Britain is already the second largest contributor to the budget and without the rebate, it would make us the largest.
Hardly an example of giving value for money to the British taxpayer!
Â Â  . It is because there is more to agriculture than the production of food that its maintenance in all the Member States is an important task for the European Union.
Economic and rural development benefit from it, and a healthy natural and cultural landscape is guaranteed.
Farmers must continue to be guaranteed financial support through the common agricultural policy, and the EUâs long-term financial planning must reflect this.
The accession of Bulgaria and Romania, which is scheduled for 2007, will make the financial situation more acute.
No provision is as yet being made for more funding to be allocated to the CAP in order to take account of this enlargement; on the contrary, the draft envisages a reduction in, or capping of, resources.
The accession would further reduce the funds set aside for farmers in the existing Member States, and so, should the CAPâs financial resources prove insufficient to meet the need, contributions would have to be sought from the individual Member States, which would be obliged to find the shortfall for their own farmers.
Far from adding up to the renationalisation of agricultural policy, this would mean that its funding would be secure in the long term.
If the benefits of the common agricultural policy are to be retained, it may in future be necessary to ask the Member States to bear their share of the costs, for it is not acceptable that farmers should foot the bill for the European Unionâs enlargement, and that funds for other policies should be quarried from the agricultural budget.
Â Â  I am abstaining from voting on this report for the following reasons.
- I am in favour of a stronger, more political Europe.
It is difficult for the European Parliament to put forward a figure for the general budget that is below that proposed by the Commission.
It is difficult to want more Europe without an adequate budget.
I feel it necessary, therefore, to give some pointers to the Heads of State or Government who will make the final decision on the level of the financial perspective.
They must give to Europe the means of achieving its goals
- Joint financing of the first pillar of the common agricultural policy (CAP) must be rejected.
It introduces ideas that could prove destructive to one of the founding policies of the European Union and moves it towards renationalisation. It does nothing at all for the European credit deficit.
Instead it transfers responsibility for part of the cost onto the Member States and/or their territorial communities without ensuring that they actually have the means to pay. It is a false solution for those who refuse to take decisions in favour of a better distribution of public support for agriculture and for a more in-depth review of the CAP that would lead to more sustainable agriculture.
Â Â  . As members of the Dutch Socialist Party, we have no fundamental objections to the possibility of the European Union having the maximum of 1.26% of the gross national product, as laid down in the treaties, at its disposal.
Money spent collectively on democracy, the environment, the provision of public services, social security and international solidarity is money well spent.
A society that omits to set aside resources for this purpose is permanently in crisis.
Although we have no sympathy whatsoever with those who want to reduce taxes by rolling back the state, we are critical of the EU on account of the way it spends money, which is sluiced around unnecessarily to regions in the richest Member States, with much of the agricultural funds ending up with the big farmers and in export subsidies, and the disaster fund suddenly being extended to include a terrorism fund.
The European Parliament costs a great deal of money unnecessarily, with vast amounts being reimbursed in expenses and on account of its permanent commuting between two cities.
Many of the cross-border issues for which the EU could be useful are not tackled, and many of the funds disappear into shadowy spending and fraud.
As long as this situation persists, we have little reason to actively oppose those who want to reduce spending to 1%, even if we condemn their often selfish views and arguments.
Â Â  .â It is an insult to debate the financial perspectives for 2007-2013, when their declared aim is to implement the new Constitutional Treaty which has been rejected, condemned and is dead.
The peoples of France and the Netherlands condemned on the basis of their experience of life the European and government policy which brings austerity, unemployment, inflation and uncertainty through capitalist restructurings as promoted in the financial perspectives for 2007-2013.
This is the direction they are taking, in order to safeguard the profits of and reinforce European capital and the plutocracy in each country, strike at grass-roots rights and reinforce the militarisation of the ÎU and, of course, there are numerous appropriations for propaganda and for diverting the workers from their real interests.
Infighting between the imperialists is worsening and the margins for manoeuvre are narrowing and the rejection of the 'European Constitution' is a good and optimistic message.
The positive outcome of these referenda for the peoples of the ÎU, which â and this is your pseudo-democracy â you disdain in your stand, cannot be reversed by a decision on the financial perspectives which the parliamentary group of the Communist Party of Greece will vote against.
However, it does show the workers the path of insubordination and disobedience to the policy of the ÎU and opens up prospects for the fight for a Europe of peace, grass-roots rights and socialism.
Â Â  . I would like it to be noted that I am in favour of retaining the British rebate.
This should be the case until there is a radical reduction in the amount of money that is paid to agriculture.
Â Â  . I abstained from voting on the report before us, because I feel that what it proposes is somewhere between what I advocate (the Commissionâs proposal) and a position that could not be further from mine (the 1% of GDP option).
Given that the proposal in this report has moved away from the Commissionâs position (both the Prodi Commission and the current one), and would lead to an unjustified and unacceptable reduction in overall amounts, I am unable to vote in favour.
Nor can I vote against the report, however, because what it proposes is more favourable than what the Presidency of the Council had proposed â according to what is in the public domain â and certainly more than what the six largest contributors to the Community budget are proposing, namely to reduce the Union Budget to 1% of Community GDP.
My vote should therefore be seen as a vote in favour of continuing talks so that the EUâs obligations on cohesion and solidarity can be met, and so that the financial needs arising from the enlargement and from a broader range of powers can be met, without that resulting in directing losses for the other budget headings, such as the Structural Funds allocations.
Â Â  .â Restore confidence, make Europe into something better, not bigger â this is one of the key messages the majority of citizens of France and the Netherlands delivered to their leaders last week.
This is also one of our priority tasks: to redefine our project and our very identity, and to make better use of the resources we want to devote to it.
People are saying today that the double âNOâ has revived the chances for governments to agree on the financial perspective, as it is so obviously urgent to restore confidence and strengthen the European project.
And I wonder if this perspective is really such good news for those who, like me, want an ambitious budget to make tomorrowâs Europe a successful one.
How can we hope to achieve our ambitions in terms of research and development, the environment, employment and the protection of backward regions, how can we succeed with enlargement if the âclub of 6 skinflintsâ does not allow some concessions?
A Europe of 25 Members cannot succeed with less money than when it only had 15!
Since the two referenda took place, promises have come thick and fast: a better Europe, a relaunched, pro-employment Europe, and so on.
These are merely gratuitous promises if not backed up by the budget.
This is why I voted in favour of the BÃ¶ge report â a report full of ambition both in its figures and in its aims.
Â Â  . I voted against Amendment 3 because the Lisbon strategy was originally based on a tripod of social, environmental and economic issues.
In its review both the social and environment legs of the Lisbon Strategy have been demoted in favour of an EU brand of competitiveness.
This is a recipe for social and economic stagnation and environmental disaster.
I voted against Amendment 28 because it would allow the EU to backtrack on commitments of support to farmers by forcing countries to co-finance schemes such as the Single Farm Payment.
Irish farmers are already struggling to survive in an economic climate that has been made artificially difficult.
It would only increase our farmersâ difficulty.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of this report because I agree with its objectives and am confident that the proposed solutions are workable.
It is nowadays widely accepted that combating money laundering â the crime of real criminals â is one of the best ways of tackling large-scale organised crime, be it terrorism or otherwise, given that it is one of the most serious attacks on the democratic rule of law.
Against this backdrop, I endorse the objectives tabled in the report before us.
I believe that interinstitutional cooperation has, moreover, resulted in a solution that is reasonable, balanced and potentially workable.
Â Â  Current rules on excise duty are sometimes unclear and difficult to apply.
They lead to unnecessary additional work for private individuals and companies.
We therefore welcome the Commissionâs overhaul of the rules governing products subject to excise duty.
At the same time, we are critical of quite a few of the Commissionâs proposed solutions.
We therefore chose today to vote against the European Parliamentâs legislative resolution which, to a large degree, also supported the worse parts of the Commissionâs proposal.
We believe that only those products transported by private individuals themselves should be regarded as private imports and thus be exempted from taxation in their own countries.
It must be possible for both tobacco and alcohol to be exempted from the general rule that excise duty must be paid in that Member State in which products acquired for private use are consumed.
The reason for our attitude is that tobacco and alcohol are damaging to public health and should not therefore be treated like any old products.
We also object to its becoming possible for private individuals themselves to transport large volumes of mineral oils.
We believe that it should be possible to have separate excise duties on products that damage our environment.
In that way, it will be possible to direct peopleâs choices so that these are environmentally more friendly.
What is more, transport and modes of transport are safer for being managed professionally.

Â Â  For public health reasons, I have chosen today not to support MrÂ Rosatiâs report on amending the directive on the general arrangements for products subject to excise duty, such as alcohol and tobacco.
Neither the Commissionâs proposal nor the European Parliamentâs report safeguard public health to the degree I believe is desirable.
Rightly used, and in conjunction with other measures, indicative guide levels can play an important role in establishing whether products are held for commercial purposes or for the personal use of private individuals.
With a view to limiting the harmful effects of alcohol and working to reduce total alcohol consumption, I believe that the guide levels should remain.
Special efforts should also be made to harmonise excise duty levels with the express objective of reducing the harm caused by tobacco and alcohol.
Â Â  Through this proposal, both the Commission and the European Parliament wish in practice to remove the opportunities that exist for importing limited quotas of alcohol and tobacco.
The June List therefore chooses to abstain from voting on the committeeâs amendments because a ânoâ vote would entail support for the Commissionâs proposal.
The Swedish, Finnish and Danish Governments instead want the indicative levels to be halved and regarded as upper limits for private imports.
The June List thus supports the Swedish, Finnish and Danish position in the Council.
Fortunately, the area concerned is one in which Sweden still has a veto in the Council, so this proposal should not be a threat to the existing legislation.
Â Â  . Although I appreciate the concerns raised by the issue at hand, especially as it concerns an issue as sensitive as taxation, on this particular aspect I am in favour of a more liberalising solution, one that makes an effective contribution towards establishing the internal market.
This is especially true inasmuch as the issue at stake here is consumer activities rather than business activities, as has been clearly stated.
Â Â  . May I inform the President that the E.P.L.P voted to abstain in the final vote of the above report.
The E.P.L.P believes that although a single market for products purchased by individuals is essential, other issues affect decisions over excise duty charges.
Moreover, this report on distance purchasing ignores the related concept of e-commerce.
Secondly, Member States should be allowed to set excise duty rates themselves.
Maximum harmonisation infringes this right.
Thirdly, minimum indicative levels act as a reasonable guide in the UK for personal consumption and help the UK authorities to fight fraud.
Â Â  . We are about to embark on the second stage of implementing the area of freedom, security and justice.
In meeting the citizensâ concerns for more freedom and more security, a legal, and more importantly, political and institutional, balance must be struck.
This is with particular regard to three crucial questions:
- credibility: I am aware of the difficulties and delays that have come to light in a number of areas.
This demonstrates that there is much to do in order to raise the level of trust among the Member States.
I do not agree, however, that the best course of action is to develop initiatives outside the Community framework, such as Schengen+ (between seven Member States), which undermine the development of mutual trust among the Member States.
- legitimacy: The low levels of democratic legitimacy are appalling.
Parliament must be genuinely involved in drawing up legislation.
- effectiveness: Objectives, priorities and responsibilities must be clearly set out, whilst ensuring that efforts are not duplicated and not spread too thinly.
Lastly, maintaining current legislation in the expectation that the Constitutional Treaty would be ratified has served to exacerbate the existing democratic shortfall.
There are a number of aspects that should have, but have not, been addressed, such as the democratic supervision of Europol and Eurojust.
Â Â  The June List believes that police cooperation and legal cooperation should be intergovernmental, that criminal law should not be harmonised at EU level and that no European Prosecutorâs Office should be set up.
Immigration and asylum policy must go on being conducted at national level in order to avoid creating a Fortress Europe.
Moreover, the Member States themselves should determine how their democratic institutions are to be designed, taking account of the Copenhagen criteria and the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.
We cannot, therefore, support the resolution.
Â Â  . In order for a large, open area without borders, characterised by freedom of movement, to become a reality, there must be strong cooperation and trust among the various Member States, and among the political authorities, the police authorities and indeed the legal authorities.
I do not believe that every proposal in the report before us is essential, necessary, useful or desirable.
I voted in favour, however, because I feel that at the heart of this report is the conviction and the awareness that without cooperation, without trust and without a certain Community element in certain areas of internal policy, it will not be possible to achieve the objectives of the area of freedom, justice and security, especially as regards preventing and combating crime and terrorism, which is one of its most significant aspects.
Â Â  The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have today voted in favour of the resolution on an area of freedom, security and justice.
We are, however, aware of the fact that parts of the resolution concern an area covered by Title IV of the EC Treaty and do not therefore apply to Denmark, cf. the protocol on Denmarkâs position.
Â Â  Mr President, the Moraes report is yet another of those documents that are full of good intentions, yet invariably achieving the opposite of what they actually hope to achieve, with constant talk of racism and discrimination, although those terms are not precisely defined.
It does, of course, become a problem when these terms occur in repressive legislation, which is what is being recommended here.
That is how Belgiumâs largest political party came to be condemned partly on the basis of a text on female circumcision.
According to the judge, that text was not published to improve the situation of women in Islam, but to stigmatise Islam.
In that way, freedom of opinion is crippled and problems become unmentionable, which is not, of course, the way to get them solved.
The report speaks, and I quote, in terms of âprofoundly racist, anti-Semitic, islamophobic and homophobic statements and actions by prominent politicians and members of governmentâ.
The reality is, however, that nearly all anti-Semitic incidents can be traced back to Islamic immigrants.
The reality is that so-called discrimination is often the result of a lack of willingness to integrate on the part of immigrants.
The reality is that the indigenous population has never been consulted democratically about the question whether they want to live in a multi-cultural country, and that is something that must change as a matter of urgency.
Â Â  .
I voted against the Moraes report because of the unacceptability to me of Paragraphs 22 and 24.
I cannot accept the promotion of equal matrimonial and other rights for same sex couples.
I believe a Member State has the right to reject such partnerships as not equal to heterosexual relationships.
I strongly support the family unit being based on the natural order of complementary sex couples and I value the benefit to children which results.
Â Â  .Â Â Some of the provisions setting out the rights of sexual minorities in the final version of the Moraes report on the protection of minorities are inherently risky. The reason for this is that the overly broad concepts used in the report could result in too wide an interpretation of these rights.
The wording of paragraphÂ 24, which calls on the Commission to eliminate obstacles to free movement in the EU for married or legally recognised gay couples, could serve as a basis for the recognition of certain legal rights held by gay couples.
Only a small number of EU Member States give legal recognition to the latter.
This would amount to unjustified interference in the family law systems of certain EU Member States.
Given that this area of law is out of bounds for integration measures, such interference is unacceptable.
The rights of faith schools could be curtailed on the basis of paragraphÂ 22 if they were obliged to employ homosexual persons and include homosexuality in their sex education curricula.
This could run counter to the ethos, beliefs and missions of such schools.
A good example of a directive that makes no mention of such issues is the Equal Treatment in Employment and Occupation Directive (2000/78/EC).
Despite being urged to do so, Parliament failed to insert a clause underlining âthe right of parents to raise their children in accordance with their own religious beliefsâ.
Worded in such a way, this right of parents is a universally recognised in international law.
In view of these decisions by Parliament, I have decided to vote against the report and the resolution.
Â Â  . It is crucial that we adopt an integrated and consistent approach to the fight against discrimination and xenophobia and that we derive maximum benefit from exchanging experiences and best practice.
Equal treatment and respect for diversity are in the interests of the whole of society.
We have adopted a series of directives aimed at ensuring that every citizen is provided with effective legal protection against all forms of discrimination.
Yet whilst we have created a strong legal framework to combat discrimination, the big problem that remains to be addressed is that of ensuring that it is implemented effectively and efficiently.
The protection of minorities is of major importance, especially following the last enlargement, which gave rise to a larger number of Member States with a huge cultural and linguistic diversity.
Community legislation and policy must be in a position to support the efforts made by these Member States to address the problems faced by minorities, such as promoting their inclusion and involvement.
All forms of discrimination are unacceptable, but we cannot force any Member State to change its legislation to accept situations that run counter to their moral and cultural traditions.
The subsidiarity principle must be upheld and the responsibility shared by the Union and the Member States on this issue of human rights must be fulfilled.
Â Â  It is important to have an efficient anti-discrimination policy, as well as effective protection of minorities.
These are, however, issues that, in accordance with the Copenhagen criteria, it is up to each Member State to deal with, so they should not be decided about at EU level.
The June List believes that it is the Council of Europe and the European Court of Justice that should take care of political and/or legal supervision.
Â Â  .â The parliamentary group of the Panhellenic Socialist Party at the European Parliament will be voting in favour of the Moraes report.
As the report states, equal treatment is a fundamental right.
At the same time, it notes that the Member States of the Union have different definitions for ethnic, national and religious minorities and groups within their borders on the basis of their legislation and/or international conventions.
The constitutional and legal structure of the Member States and the relevant provisions of international law cannot under any circumstances be construed as being contested or affected by this report.
Â Â  .Â Â The wording of paragraphÂ 24, which calls on the Commission to eliminate obstacles to free movement in the EU for married or legally recognised gay couples, could serve as a basis for the recognition of certain legal rights held by gay couples.
Only a small number of EU Member States give legal recognition to the latter.
This would amount to unjustified interference in the family law systems of certain EU Member States.
Given that this area of law is out of bounds for integration measures, such interference is unacceptable.
The rights of faith schools could be curtailed on the basis of paragraphÂ 22 if they were obliged to employ homosexual persons and include homosexuality in their sex education curricula.
This could run counter to the ethos, beliefs and missions of such schools.
A good example of a directive that makes no mention of such issues is the Equal Treatment in Employment and Occupation Directive (2000/87/EC).
Despite being urged to do so, Parliament failed to insert a clause underlining âthe right of parents to raise their children in accordance with their own religious beliefsâ.
Worded in such a way, this right of parents is universally recognised in international law.
In view of these decisions by Parliament, I have decided to vote against the report and the resolution.
Â Â  . â The report 'on the protection of minorities and anti-discrimination policies in an enlarged Europe' contains everything except the basic fact that the discrimination in the EU against women, young people, ethnic immigrant minorities, the disabled etc. is the result of the anti-grass roots and unfeeling policies of the ÎU, on the one hand, and has a very deep, class-based nature, on the other.
It does not cut across the social divide; it mainly affects the poorer, grass-roots sections of society.
It refers to numerous forms of actual discrimination in the workplace against women and young people, but passes in silence over the high rates of unemployment and the inhumane, flexible forms of employment applied mainly to young people and women, as a result of Lisbon-type strategies.
The report passes in silence over the scandalous discrimination against the Russian minority in the Baltic States, despite the fact that the Communist Party of Greece has repeatedly raised the problem in the European Parliament.
The people subject to discrimination should not delude themselves; only their fight, in cooperation with consistent, working-class movements, with the fighting grass-roots movements, can put the brakes on their marginalisation and exclusion from the social and political rights of which capitalism and its political exponents have deprived them.
Â Â  . The protection of minorities and anti-discrimination policies often swing between two extremes â there is either a shortfall, in terms of policies and protection, or a surplus, in terms of solutions that clearly go beyond their stated objective and become models, which should not be imposed on the Member States and to which I am generally opposed.
This is precisely what has happened in the report before us.
The group to which I belong tabled a number of amendments that would have turned the report into a series of acceptable and positive proposals.
Those amendments were unfortunately not adopted, and I therefore voted against the report.
I feel that on issues such as these, I repeat, both shortfall and surplus are detrimental.
The right to be different should not be confused with imposing equality.
They are not the same thing and do not produce the same results.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the Council and the Commission statements on reform of the UN.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I said this morning that one of the items on the agenda for the European Council was reform of the UN, and in particular the summit in September of this year, during which we hope this reform can be introduced.
As we have already discussed and emphasised, the European Union attaches very great importance to that reform.
On a number of occasions we have expressed our support for the contents of the report of the UN Secretary-General, Mr Kofi Annan, presented on 21 March of this year, and the preparatory reports on which it was based.
These reports are in line with the general approach set out in the European security strategy, and open up some promising avenues towards a stronger and more effective multilateralism.
The European Union supports the global concept of collective security recommended by the Secretary-General, recognising that threats to peace and security are not only represented by war, international conflicts, riots, organised crime, terrorism and weapons of mass destruction, but also by poverty, under-development, deadly epidemics and environmental damage â in particular the issue of global warming.
The European Union gives its agreement in principle to the package of measures presented by the Secretary-General, while at the same time maintaining an open mind.
It intends to play a leadership role in the preparatory process for the September summit.
The Union believes that significant efforts must be made to obtain the best possible results at the summit across a wide spectrum of issues.
It is crucial to maintain a balance between the Secretary-Generalâs three major objectives of development, security and human rights.
The challenge is, therefore, to achieve a critical mass of reforms within a consistent long-term approach, while at the same time holding out the possibility of further progress later on.
We in the European Union are accustomed to these step-by-step approaches, with recourse to transition periods.
As regards development, the European Union fully shares the Secretary-Generalâs view on the interdependence of the various areas involved.
It would also emphasise unambiguously that development is an end in itself, not merely a means to achieve security.
The Union is firmly committed to implementing the Millennium Declaration.
It emphasises the link between achieving the Millennium goals and the implementation of the results of UN international conferences and summits in the economic, social, environmental and other spheres.
I am not even going to reiterate the goals we set during the last General Affairs Council on the issue of increasing development aid up to 2015.
The Union would like a certain number of matters of vital importance for the achievement of the Millennium goals to be taken into due account in the conclusions of the summit.
We also attach particular importance to joint and collective action to combat AIDS.
We want to reflect jointly on the link between environmental viability, security and the elimination of poverty.
With regard to the various security-related aspects, the European Union strongly supports the idea of creating a peace consolidation committee.
This is a priority for the Union, and an agreement on this issue at the September summit is vital.
This proposal serves to plug a gap.
During the migration from a state of war to a state of lasting peace, this peace consolidation committee could help intensify the UN-led planning activity in support of a lasting recovery, while at the same time strengthening the institutions which guarantee the rule of law and good governance.
In parallel, it could play a significant role in the prevention of subsequent conflicts, which is often an important factor in cementing a lasting peace.
This peace consolidation committee would be a permanent body which could assist the Security Council and Ecosoc during the various phases of the conflict.
The link with Ecosoc is particularly important in relation to development.
The committee should also help to ensure that reconstruction and peace-keeping strategies are consistent.
In relation to the prevention of terrorism, the Union supports the global strategy proposed by the Secretary-General both in his report and in his Madrid speech.
We need to emphasise that terrorism is unacceptable in all circumstances, irrespective of the underlying causes invoked.
The Union would point out that the five pillars of the Secretary-Generalâs proposed approach coincide with the strategy which the Union has been developing since the 11 September 2001 attacks, and which it subsequently reaffirmed following the tragic events in Madrid.
The European Union also supports the Secretary-Generalâs recommendations in relation to non-proliferation and disarmament â recommendations which, in general terms, coincide with the approach in the European strategy against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
As it will only be possible to achieve results through a collective effort, the Union is ready to take initiatives in that direction, in a multilateral context, and to raise these issues during its regular contacts and political dialogue in order to convince its partners to take account of these recommendations as well.
The Union believes that the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction represents the gravest and most immediate threat to international peace and stability.
Universal guarantee agreements and additional protocols should now be the norm in terms of nuclear verification.
Additionally, negotiations for a treaty to halt the production of fissile material should be brought rapidly to a successful conclusion.
The Union also intends to take an active part in the development of binding international instruments to regulate the marking, tracing and illicit dealing in small-calibre arms and light weapons, issues we have already had the opportunity of discussing during sittings of this Parliament.
The Union reiterates its hope that adoption of the principle of the responsibility to protect can become one of the major priorities of the summit.
Violations of human rights, impunity and breaches of the rule of law remain among the main factors threatening peace and security, while at the same time hindering the development process.
The Union supports the efforts of the Secretary-General to adopt and apply the principle of the responsibility to protect the potential or actual victims of genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and other mass violations of human rights.
Finally, as regards the use of force, the Union believes that the concept and principles proposed by the Secretary-General represent a good basis on which all parties should be prepared to work.
The criteria proposed are political rather than legal in nature and should reflect a broad international consensus, which should prove helpful to members of the Security Council in their deliberations which could potentially lead to the use of force.
I should like to applaud the importance accorded to human rights and the rule of law in the Secretary-Generalâs report.
The Union supports any proposal to reinforce democracy and to place human rights at the centre of the UN's system.
We insist on the need to reinforce the system of human rights, in particular by incorporating them into all the activities of the UN system, which would strengthen its capacity to react at any time to breaches of those rights.
We also support the appeal to strengthen the office of the UN's High Commissioner for Human Rights and to allocate sufficient funding to reinforce his ability to discharge his mandate.
The Union therefore agrees with the establishment of a permanent Council for Human Rights, as it could help to enhance the importance attached to human rights within the UN system.
Sixty years after the war and after the creation of the United Nations, the time has come to give fresh impetus to multilateralism, to reform the United Nations system, a system vital for global security, harmonious development of all nations and the consolidation of peace.
I believe we have a real opportunity.
The European Union must play an active part in that reform and I count on Parliament to support the Council and Commission in that endeavour.
Â Â  . Mr President, I welcome this opportunity to discuss UN reform before the crucial UN Summit in September.
I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Laschet, on his report.
The September 2005 UN Summit, to be held on the 60th anniversary of the UN, is an opportunity that must not be missed.
The summit represents an opportunity to take decisions leading to a more efficient United Nations and one that is better equipped to deal with the challenges of the 21st century.
In the last three weeks President Barroso and Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner have both been to New York, where they held constructive discussions on the summit preparations with the UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, his deputy, Louise FrÃ©chette, and the President of the UN General Assembly, Ambassador Ping.
During those talks, all the parties underlined the need for continuous and strong EU leadership in the preparations for the summit, in order to achieve substantial results in September.
The Commission, together with the presidency and Member States, is thus reaching out to partners, both in New York and in capitals throughout the world.
The active involvement of Parliament in mobilising other parliamentarians around the world on the summit agenda would also be extremely useful.
On 3 June we received the draft outcome for the summit, which provides us with a good starting point but nonetheless requires a strong European Union input if we are to achieve ambitious results during the September summit.
I am glad to see that the views expressed in the resolution tabled by this Parliament are similar to those of the Commission in many respects.
As the UN Secretary General's report correctly states and as is underlined in Parliament's resolution, progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) requires urgent attention.
A serious boost to common actions is needed to reach the Millennium Development Goals by 2015.
On 24 May the European Council agreed the Commission's ambitious proposals to achieve collectively 0.56% of GNI for ODA by 2010 and 0.7% by 2015.
This is an important step forward for international solidarity and a clear sign of the European Union's commitment to a successful summit.
We hope that it will provide a strong impetus for others to follow our example.
Allow me to address a few of the UN reform proposals on the table that are of particular interest for reinvigorating the effectiveness of the United Nations.
The Commission has been actively engaged in the discussions on the proposed Peace Building Commission, which could fill the very real gap that currently exists within the UN institutional machinery for dealing with the period between the end of a conflict and long-term sustainable development.
I welcome the resolution's support for the Peace Building Commission.
The Commission supports as broad a mandate as possible for the Peace Building Commission, including support for democracy, functioning institutions and strengthening the rule of law.
Its work should consolidate peace and prevent the outbreak of new conflicts.
In terms of its membership, both UN Security Council and ECOSOC membership should be represented, as well as major donors and contributors to peace building, international financing institutions, and key UN agencies, funds and programmes.
The European Community's longstanding, worldwide and sustained peace building efforts are well known.
I am therefore glad to inform you that, in the preparatory work for the summit, the European Union has decided to press for the participation of the European Community in all meetings of the Peace Building Commission.
I trust that Parliament will be able to support that position.
The Commission strongly welcomes the UN Secretary General's proposals relating to human rights A substantial reform of the current UN human rights architecture, including the replacement of the ailing UN Commission on Human Rights by a standing Human Rights Council, is essential if the system is to be made more efficient and credible.
The ultimate objective is to make human rights protection and promotion effective worldwide.
I am therefore delighted to see that we agree on the proposed Human Rights Council.
The proposed election of the Council by the General Assembly should extend a sense of ownership to the wider UN community.
Ownership must, however, be balanced by responsibility and the Secretary-General's view that States seeking membership of the Council should demonstrate a 'solid record of commitment to the highest human rights standards' is a welcome requirement, also in view of the obligations deriving from membership of the Council.
Obviously the issue of reforming the Security Council is one of the high-profile elements of the current UN reform debate.
I note with interest the proposals made in the resolution for the establishment of an 'EU' seat.
Whilst Security Council reform is naturally an issue of great importance, it must not be allowed to stall the whole process of vital reform of other UN institutions or other important areas where progress is needed.
I would call upon all Member States of the UN to make every effort to ensure such paralysis does not occur.
The Commission fully supports better environmental integration across the UN system, including the establishment of a UN Environmental Organisation, and is delighted to see that the European Union is coming together on this.
I shall conclude by stating my satisfaction at the degree of concurrence that exists between us on many of the key topics at the heart of this issue.
Furthermore, I wish to underline the Commission's determination to continue to work towards achieving good results in September and ensuring implementation of the summit's outcome.
Â Â  . Mr President, Mr Schmit, Commissioner Borg, ladies and gentlemen, at a time when the European Union is enduring and debating one crisis after another, the affirmation of belief in effective multilateralism and in a strong United Nations is a credo around which most of this House, along with the Council and the Commission, can unite.
This September, in New York, the European Union should send out a clear message to the effect that we want reform and institutions that work better, and that we encourage Kofi Annan to proceed down this road.
I see this as a typical example that we could put before those members of the public who think that the nation states might achieve more.
The challenges that we face, though, leave us no alternative to action on a global scale.
If we are to combat terrorism, to address the problems of failing states, if we are to deal with the worldâs shifting climate and to campaign for human rights and democracy around the world, then we need a strong United Nations.
So it is, then, that in the report to be put before the plenary tomorrow, the Houseâs Committee on Foreign Affairs has limited itself to responding to the High Panelâs proposals.
Rather than drafting a new report on the UN in succession to the one we adopted last year, we have got to grips with what the High Panel has proposed, and one topic that has been very much on our minds in doing this has been that of collective security.
Reform of the United Nations should be underpinned by the principles of prevention, awareness and shared responsibility.
Something else that had a high priority for us was freedom from want, in the shape of a renewed development policy, something that ties in very well this year with the fifth anniversary of the year 2000âs Millennium Goals.
The third thing that matters to us is that the institutions be renewed and made more representative and more efficient, and so we have reiterated our call for a seat for Europe.
We know it is not realistic to expect to achieve this by September, but, even if Europe does not get a seat, we want it to be more present.
If there are to be new seats of whatever kind, we want them to go to the European Union, which will then appoint its representatives in the Security Council.
That would be a small sign that things were going in the right direction.
The United Nations cannot be reformed by its Secretary-General; that is for the states to do.
It is for that reason that we appeal to the European Council for the states represented within it to join together in supporting Kofi Annan and his programme of reform.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a globalised economy calls for globalised politics.
A stronger United Nations is the right response to the challenges that the international community faces in the 21st century.
I am glad of the general agreement in the House, and grateful to MrÂ Laschet for his report.
We may be in different groups, but we take a similar view of things.
We in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament see it as important that reforms should not be limited to the institutions, but should also aim to strengthen the UN in the performance of its tasks and in its mission.
One prominent objective for the coming years is to achieve the Millennium Development Goals; we have to succeed in halving the incidence of poverty, illiteracy and the major diseases by 2015.
If we manage that, we will have made a contribution to the worldâs peace and stability.
The UNâs role in peace missions and in conflict management needs to be enhanced.
A large number of proposals have been made as to how this might be done, ranging from an anti-terrorist convention to the delegation of the rights contained in Chapter VII of the UN Charter to recognised regional organisations such as the African Union or the European Union.
Why should peoples not resolve the conflicts on their own continents themselves, before the men in blue helmets arrive from elsewhere?
Let me turn to the need for stronger institutions.
The Security Council is the sensitive issue here.
We are agreed that Europe should, in the long term, have a seat on it.
It may be that a mechanism is already being devised for its non-permanent members whereby the European Council would mandate Member States to perform this duty on the European Unionâs behalf and in consultation with its institutions.
The UN also needs to be made more democratic.
The demand is also being made for a Parliamentary Assembly within the UN; let us seize the opportunity, for it is one that does not come often.
Now is the time for the package to be wrapped up!
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, 2004 was a very difficult year for global organisations, and so 2005 will be all the more decisive for the United Nations.
Never before has there been such a great desire for fundamental renewal of the organisation; never before, too, has reform been so urgently needed.
Like Mr Leinen and Mr Laschet, who have already spoken, I rejoice in the broad consensus that we have here: the clear affirmation of belief in the Millennium Development Goals is something we can all echo, just as we can all aim to improve the synergy between conflict prevention, peacemaking and peacekeeping.
We are agreed on the need for better resources â and more of them â for this, and on the need for a more rapid response to events in crisis regions, with clear rules for deployments in them.
To address acute dangers such as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, there is a need not only for clearly defined and internationally recognised rules, but also the political will to act.
It is in this respect that the international legal standard that is coming into being, and according to which we have a duty to defend others, constitutes a quite crucial step forward.
Reform of the UNâs institutions will be the most difficult hurdle to overcome.
Its General Assembly must become more productive; rather than mounting, year in and year out, repetitively vacuous debates without concrete results, it must get back to debating things that really matter.
ECOSOC, too, must make a markedly better job of performing its tasks.
The Security Council, too, is in need of reform.
On 24Â June, the Committee on Foreign Affairs put before the House a resolution it had adopted on this subject.
While united in our desire for a permanent seat on it, we do know â particularly after the failure of the referenda â that the legal and institutional framework conditions for such a seat will not be in place before mid-September this year.
Is this a reason to delay the reform?
No, it is not; the world will not wait for the EU, and so all our Member States must, for the United Nationsâ sake and for multilateralismâs sake, give the reform their backing, even though not all of them will be able to have a seat in September.
The mechanism to which Mr Laschet referred is one that we have devised together; it involves the European seats being allocated in close consultation with the EU.
I might add that this debate â particularly after the failure of the French referendum â should be being held in Brussels rather than in Strasbourg.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the opportunity to implement fundamental reform of the United Nations is an historic one, one in which Europe can and must play an important part, and so it is a very good thing that there is a large majority in this House giving its backing to the High Panelâs report on reform of the UN and to Kofi Annanâs report, which is derived from it.
Implementation of this report and completion of the reform are matters of importance in terms of world politics, and I was very glad to hear that both the Council and the Commission are committed to this.
There are four major and crucial aspects of this reform in which we must make progress.
The first is the reform and extension of the UN Security Council, accompanied by the clear and unambiguous definition of the UNâs exclusive right to exercise force.
It would be a very good thing if the discussion on the expansion of the Security Council were to enable Europe to get a seat on it, resulting in a real structural change in the way in which Europeâs policies are represented.
The second is the process of transforming international development policy into an international structural policy in the true sense of the word.
The essential means to this end is the reinforcement and upgrading of the United Nationsâ Economic and Social Council, ECOSOC; and close cooperation between it and the Group of Twenty really could plant the seed and lay the foundation of a new World Economic Council, which would be capable of steering the global economy in the direction of a sustainable policy.
Thirdly, the UNâs environmental programmes need to be transformed into a real UN environmental organisation, one that is sustainable and well organised.
This is a major task.
The fourth point is an important one: the Human Rights Commission should be upgraded to a permanent council on human rights elected by the General Assembly.
Security policy, development policy, environmental policy, human rights policy â these are the four pillars in which we need to make progress.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, at 60 years old, the United Nations is younger than I am but I genuinely hope that it has a longer life than mine and ours and that it can witness development, democracy and justice for the people of this world.
The devastation of the Second World War, the horror and the uniqueness of the Holocaust perpetrated by the Nazis, the deaths of millions of people and soldiers, not to mention the unpunished crime of the atomic bomb attack on Hiroshima and Nagasaki brought forth a hope and a commitment: that the peoples of the United Nations could be certain of having a vehicle to make war history.
That is now a long time ago.
The UN has lost its effectiveness and the major countries have striven to see it go under â one need only think about the preventative and humanitarian wars, which in reality have been trials of lethal weapons, virtually weapons of mass destruction.
Reform, or rather, a refounding of the United Nations is crucial.
The Organisation has to return to a situation in which it is able to maintain peace by means of justice, promote disarmament, combat poverty and uphold democracy.
Upholding democracy also means guaranteeing transparency and participation, not only by national governments, but also by the people and civil society.
MrÂ Laschetâs report is important, as is the ability of our Parliament to strive towards strengthening and coordinating the United Nations.
I agree with his proposals: strengthening the commitment towards human rights, protecting nature and the environment, combating poverty and strengthening the European Economic and Social Committee (ECOSOC).
Those are all fundamental commitments, also in terms of achieving the Millennium Development Goals.
MrÂ Laschet was speaking about âfreedom from wantâ and about the need to encourage Kofi Annan and obviously to forcefully resume the Agenda for Peace issued by Boutros Boutros-Ghali in 1992.
Finally, I would like to highlight a fundamental issue, that is, the complete anachronism of the Security Council and its anti-democratic nature, which is symbolised by the right of veto.
I believe that it is important to strive towards abolishing it and for the European Union to be represented by one voice, together with the other continents.
Â Â  .â Mr President, we are in a fairly extraordinary situation this afternoon, discussing a project which is devoid of substance in a forum which has no right to debate it.
I will ignore the vacuity of the project, reform of the UN: when I first had the honour of serving my country in the UN, in 1992, the issue of UN reform was already under discussion.
The story is old hat!
The fact is that the UN is based on a Security Council which, in turn, is based on five permanent members, who have taken the UN as far as it could go â often for the better but sometimes for the worse.
As for Europe, it is represented in the UN by non-permanent rotating members and by two major powers holding a right of veto, namely Great Britain and France.
Moreover, no alternative architecture appears possible.
However, that is not the worst aspect.
This Parliament has no power to debate this subject, or even â as MrÂ Laschet has said in somewhat derisory fashion â to send messages to New York.
That is absolutely meaningless.
Our separatist French delegation will not take part in the vote tomorrow as a sign of protest against the determination of this Parliament to act as if it could encroach on the Statesâ prerogatives, and, worse still, to act as if there had been no referendum, or, in other words, as if the Constitution was not dead.
I solemnly warn you against a collective abuse of power: we are behaving as if, one day, there could be a Constitution, or a common foreign and security policy, or a European foreign minister.
These things will never happen!
The people do not want them.
And if you want to impose them by force, you would be basing the future development of Europe on a , thereby rendering all our decisions illegal and eliciting an appropriate â and undoubtedly violent â response from our citizens.
Â Â  .
MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, in mid-June the offensive of the so-called âG4â will be launched, which intends to put forward a proposal for a resolution to the General Assembly that will increase the number of permanent members to 11, thus leaving the other 180 members of the UN to compete for the non-permanent seats.
Approval of that proposal will increase the disparity among the Member States of the UN and will pose the problem of extending the right of veto, with the attendant risk of paralysing the Security Council.
At European level, Germanyâs entry into the Council would conversely mean abandoning once and for all a project of a Europe endowed with a serious and effective foreign policy.
Italy, which has always been committed to the European Union having one single seat, is now leading the UFC group, which is opposed to the G4 proposal, hoping for the Council to be restructured on a regional basis.
It is only by means of this type of reform that the European Union would obtain the role that belongs to it at international level.
National egoisms need to be put to one side if we are to offer the European Union a credible political future.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, we are all aware of the absolute necessity to reform the United Nations, and the Security Council in particular.
In order to be effective, however, a reform has to be agreed upon by the largest number of countries possible, it has to enjoy a broad consensus, it has to reflect the growing importance of regionalism in international relations, and it cannot be rushed through.
We condemn plans to reform the Security Council like the so-called âG4 planâ, as MrsÂ Angelilli pointed out, which would result in weakening the main body of the United Nations and freezing it in its current difficulties.
We believe that all countries have the right to serve in the Security Council, by means of periodic elections guaranteeing that the many regional experiences are represented.
In this spirit, we have asked for separate votes on paragraphs 19, 20 and 21, in order to remove a number of ambiguities in MrÂ Laschetâs nonetheless excellent report.
Much is said, including in this House, on the issue of a European seat.
In order for something like that to exist, however, a common European foreign policy is required, and I believe that we are still very far from reaching that objective.
There is no doubt, moreover, that the recent twin ânoâ vote on the Constitution has made the passage even more difficult.
One day the European seat will be obtained but here and now we rule out permanently delegating one Member State to represent the Union, as that would discriminate against the other Member States, even though Italy would in that case have the full numbers required to be able to stand as a candidate.
The United Nations is currently undergoing embarrassing revelations and scandals that are damaging its reputation.
When we talk about reforms, therefore, we must not only consider the Security Council, but also, as this report rightly does, the United Nations in its entirety.
Having been powerless and crippled for many years by the rivalry between the superpowers, the United Nations has once again to find new energy and new life.
Â Â  â Mr President, as a French citizen I feel bound to begin this speech by rejecting the comments I have just heard from one of my fellow citizens.
The demise of a draft Constitution is not the end of all the Treaties binding us together!
Europe has done enough to earn the right to send a collective message.
Laschet, my congratulations on your good report!
If there is any abuse of power â that was indeed the word used â it is by taking the salary of a Member of the European Parliament and then biting the hand that feeds you, ignoring all the efforts we have been making for sixty years.
Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, I support this Laschet report.
In these dark days for Europe, I am happy to see this rare moment of convergence between the Council, the Commission and our Parliament.
I am pleased to commend the excellent report of a colleague who, rather more than is customary, took the views of his colleagues into account, and I am ashamed that there are only 25 of us at this sitting, a fact which hardly enhances the credibility of our debate.
Mr President, I should like to give you a message for the Presidency.
We can try to reform the United Nations, but it would be better to start by reforming ourselves.
I am certain that the 700 or so colleagues who are absent are not merely enjoying a siesta. They are at work in their offices.
Our work is badly organised.
We need one or two major debates in plenary session each month in this building and, apart from that, everything should be discussed in committees.
These debates should be dignified affairs.
It is impossible, with only a couple of minutes available, to make an analysis or express a line of thought.
I would therefore say, Mr President-in-Office of the Council â begging your pardon for representing a Parliament of which I am basically a little ashamed â that my main concern is that by defending this good report and all the good work we do together in Europe, you might be aiming at the wrong target.
There are too many responsibilities, too may targets.
It is true that Europe has its reasons for wanting a seat on the Security Council.
It is true that the time is not ripe and this is virtually out of the question at present.
I would advise you not to waste too much time on it and to focus on what is reasonably possible, on what would generally make a difference and on aspects where our work, and in particular the Laschet report, can be constructive.
I would quote Article 2 and chapter VII on the transfer of the right to invoke the Charter to regional organisations.
This is a great innovation.
I would also cite the transformation of the Trusteeship Council into a Council for Failed States.
Finally, I would mention the introduction, in Article 17, of a reference to global public goods.
As I have overrun my allotted time, I will stop here.
This is all absurd; we are all saying more or less the same thing.
Do not aim for the wrong target.
Concentrate on the innovative aspects â and only on them â and we shall have done a good job.
Â Â  Mr President, like my colleagues, I believe that ââ as is the case with the European Union ââ if the United Nations Organisation did not exist, it would have to be invented.
That is a fact.
And it is also the case that the United Nations must be reformed, just as we are doing in the European Union.
In the specific case of the United Nations, an in-depth and immediate reform is clearly urgent, fundamentally because the Member States are currently subjecting it to a twofold restriction, of a budgetary nature, firstly, and secondly, of a political nature.
The reports by the high-level panel and by the Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, provide, I believe ââ and here I agree with Mr Laschet ââ an excellent starting point for analysis and debate, and I would therefore also urge the Commission and the Council to take them sufficiently into account.
It is important to remember the anti-war mobilisations, in particular those that led us to question the importance of a war in Iraq.
I believe that, at this time when world military spending has risen to one billion dollars per year while at the same time the States do not provide money for the Millennium objectives, this review is more necessary than ever.
Â Â  Mr President, the recent Brok report argued that the EU as a whole should play a major role within the UN.
The PPE-DE Group amendment to the report demanded that the EU should be guaranteed a seat in the UN Security Council.
That word âguaranteedâ is incompatible with the UN High-level Panelâs view that no change in the composition of the Security Council should be regarded as permanent in the future.
In both of the Panelâs proposed models for reform of the Security Council, the current permanent members would retain seats.
That is not what the Eurofanatics want to hear.
They want the EU to take over the seats of France and the UK.
However, even Mr Brokâs report conceded that an increased role for the EU was pending the entry into force of the new Constitutional Treaty.
The Constitution is dead; the EU has no legal personality; Europe is not a nation and the EU, therefore, has no place in the United Nations.
Â Â  Mr President, we must never forget that the collective interest is the national interest, especially in a world full of terrorism.
One of the most important functions of the United Nations is the delivery of its aid to the less developed world.
Corruption and a lack of transparency erode public support.
A fundamental reform is needed of what the United Nations does with its aid delivery.
For the first time, Internet technology has made it possible to bring transparency into the raising of international aid funding in the donor countries and the delivery of aid in the recipient countries.
We must be able to see how the aid is being spent, brick by brick.
A closer involvement by citizens through the Internet will create a new driving force for the effective delivery of aid and for holding governments, the United Nations and other NGOs accountable.
Civil strife and gross violations of human rights are the principal obstacles to United Nations development objectives.
One civil war can undo decades of development effort.
It is therefore essential to give our full backing to the work of the international criminal courts and to make it clear that anyone who commits crimes against humanity will be personally called to account for his or her action.
The United Nations must be able to anticipate and prevent.
It must be a peace-builder and a peacekeeper.
On 24Â February, this Parliament passed a unanimous resolution demanding that Nigeria surrender to the United Nations international court the former President of Liberia, who has been charged with war crimes by the United Nations Special Court for Sierra Leone.
Why has the United Nations Security Council failed to reinforce this demand with a mandatory resolution under Chapter VII?
The United Nations Commission on Human Rights must be replaced with a stronger human rights council, with membership barred to nations with poor human rights records.
Finally, the United Nations must return to its roots.
It must reform a stagnant bureaucracy.
It must sweep away a dysfunctional committee.
It must focus on an active United Nations parliamentary assembly, a good governance and democracy promotion unit.
It must become the three pillars: peace and security, justice and human rights, and development.
Â Â  First of all, I would like to congratulate Mr Laschet on his excellent report and the UN working group that was also involved in drafting it.
Reform of the UN is indispensable, as it is the only multilateral organisation able to take up the gauntlet of the challenges of the new era effectively and successfully.
Part of this process of reform will involve reviewing the number of members on the Security Council and its scope and the means and adjusting them to meet the new challenges.
The only possible way of solving its problems is to adopt an integrated approach, which takes economic, social, development, security and human rights dimensions into account.
We must not forget that efforts to reform the UN and the common security and institutional reforms aimed at promoting the realisation of the Millennium Development Goals, closely complement one another.
I therefore welcome the development ministersâ decision creating resources for this purpose.
Successful realisation of the aims set out in the Millennium Development Goals is crucial for Europe in a globalised world.
Reducing poverty, effectively eradicating starvation and meeting drinking water needs are all vitally important issues and postponing efforts to find solutions is not an option.
The dangers are imminent and complex; successful implementation of reforms is more urgent now than it has ever been.
Â Â  â Mr President, I shall devote these few words to an extremely important issue, namely the reform of the United Nations programme for human rights.
I am delighted to see â not only here in Parliament but also in the Commission and the Council â that the general outline of a reform of the UNâs instruments assessing human rights is emerging and, moreover, that it corresponds to the work now being undertaken, by which I mean the package proposed by the UN Secretary-General and also the action plan which has just been submitted to Kofi Annan by the High Commissioner, Mrs Louise Arbour.
These are extremely interesting approaches which, moreover, are echoed in the excellent report by Mr Laschet.
The transformation into a permanent council is obviously a revolution in the UNâs system of human rights.
Why?
Because it will provide us with a body able to apply permanent pressure on countries violating human rights, and, as we have just said, these violations are a permanent threat to security, development and peace.
That is an absolutely vital reform.
With regard to the increase in the resources available to the High Commissionerâs office, I believe everyone is in agreement.
I think we shall also have to look at the substance of the activity of this Council and at the way it works: in that area, the reference that the European Parliamentâs report makes to peer group assessment â namely assessment by other countries â which is a transparent, just and equitable appraisal system for all countries, helping to avoid the charge of double standards, appears an absolutely fundamental one.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the EU Member States have different views on how the UN system should be reformed.
Allow the Member States to discuss this matter with other UN members.
This debate should not be conducted within the framework of EU cooperation but in a broader international context.
It is clear that an EU strategy for reforming the UN system is largely aimed at safeguarding European, rather than global, interests.
The motion for a resolution points out that the objective is that the EU countries should in the long run speak with a single voice in the Security Council.
We are unsympathetic to this proposal.
Clearly, the countries of Europe have different foreign policy positions.
This emerged, in particular, in connection with the Iraq war.
France and Great Britain are examples of countries that often have different approaches to foreign policy issues.
Would it be at all possible to speak with a single European voice in the Security Council?
Would the voices of small countries, such as Sweden, be heard at all?
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Laschet, for the work he has done.
It is difficult to achieve a broad consensus between the different groups and delegations on such a complex issue as the reform of the United Nations.
This reform involves many important issues.
I will restrict myself essentially to three aspects.
Firstly, the need for effective multilateralism in order to deal with the problems of the international community.
No single country or single group of countries can say everything, but rather we need a multilateral approach, and multilateralism requires representative and effective institutions.
Hence the importance and the need for a reform of the United Nations.
Secondly, the reform of the United Nations Security Council, the body that is essential to maintaining international peace and security.
Its representativeness must be increased and its operation improved, but I do not believe the best solution to be the so-called âmodel Aâ, that is to say increasing the number of permanent members, an idea which I believe to be rather anachronistic.
One essential objective clearly taken up in Mr Laschetâs report, is that the European Union itself should sit on the Security Council of the United Nations.
This objective is entirely consistent with the idea of a common foreign and security policy, and it will be even more so if the constitutional treaty enters into force.
But if the model that is finally accepted in New York is that of allowing new permanent members, I believe that the new seat should be for the European Union.
I find it particularly striking that, at a time when so much is being said about a common foreign and security policy, or a future foreign affairs minister, this issue, surprisingly, is not being debated in the Council of the Union; the European Union's presence on the United Nations Security Council is not being debated in the Council and, today, the representative of the Council â I do not know if he is listening â appears not to have mentioned this issue.
Given the fundamental importance of the reform of the United Nations Organisation, and in particular of its Security Council, I believe that it should be approved on the basis of the broadest possible consensus.
A reform of this significance should not be implemented on the basis of just a two-thirds majority, because that is not reasonable.
A greater consensus is needed.
Thirdly, I am pleased that the report stresses the fight against terrorism and, in this regard, I will not just emphasise Resolution 1373, but also the importance of assisting the victims of terrorism.
Resolution 1566 has also taken a first step in this direction.
We must continue to improve and to make progress in this direction.
Â Â  â Mr President, the post-war balances reflected institutionally in the UN have now been overturned.
New international problems and challenges threaten world peace and stability.
The international system is governed by the omnipotence of the United States and its unilateral perception of how to resolve international problems.
The legitimising role of the UN has been reduced, while its efficacy and credibility have been dangerously weakened.
Mankind needs a new, democratic, multilateral system which will express contemporary geographical and political realities.
That is why the reform of the UN system is a necessary precondition to a world of peace, freedom, democracy, growth and justice.
The report by the UN Secretary-General and his proposed reforms are a bold response to the challenges of our times.
The report by Mr Laschet also moves in this direction.
However, no reform will be able to achieve its objective unless the UN regains its lost credibility as regards the application of its resolutions.
Crucial resolutions on peace and stability have not been applied on the pretext of serving the current international economic situation and the interests of the major powers.
Up to now we have been witnessing selective sensibilities in the application of UN resolutions and I think that this is a serious omission in Mr Laschet's report.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Kofi Annan stated that environmental damage, water shortages and the effects of climate change were now killing more people than terrorist attacks.
The UNâs proposed environmental reforms, although given a mention, are not yet equal to the challenges facing the planet, despite the fact that the UN has a responsibility to organise the resources to combat predicted disasters, which will turn millions of people into ecological refugees.
Who will provide a home for those dispossessed nations whose land has been swallowed up by the sea?
What authority will defend nature in the commercial decision-making of the WTO, a body which has already shown that it gives scant consideration to environmental damage?
Because the environment is not a commodity, because environmental standards must take preference over trade, because legal relationships must be clarified when settling conflicts between the WTO and multilateral agreements on the environment within the United Nations system itself, the UN environmental programme must be transformed into a global environmental organisation, in order to protect our shared public asset, the earth.
With international institutional recognition, no one will again be able to evade his responsibility to the planet and to future generations.
Â Â  A motion for a resolution(1) to wind up the debate has been tabled pursuant to Rule 103(2).
Â Â  . Mr President, as I have said before, we share many of the views of this Parliament on the reform of the United Nations.
We all agree that a strong and effective United Nations is for the benefit not only of the European Union but also of the international community as a whole.
We can support many of the proposals in the Secretary-Generalâs report.
As I have stated, our priorities are to secure greater success in the achievement of the Millennium Goals.
We are equally committed to seeing progress in the field of post-conflict situations and, therefore, we support the proposal for a peace-building commission as an instrument that will fill an existing gap between post-conflict situations and long-term sustainable peace.
Our commitment to human rights is unwavering and the proposals on the table for a human rights council will get our full support.
Equally, we will support the creation of a UN environmental organisation, which will further consolidate the central focus of our actions in the field of the environment.
On climate change, we believe that the summit should call for more collaborative efforts to achieve the objectives of a UN climate change convention.
The summit should endorse the UN Secretary-Generalâs proposals to ensure concerted global action to mitigate climate change and develop a more inclusive international framework for climate change beyond 2012.
The Commission wholly endorses the contents of the UN Secretary-Generalâs report on the proposal for a comprehensive convention on terrorism and calls for Member States to agree a definition of terrorism.
The UN Secretary-General rightly underlines in his report that the accumulation and proliferation of small arms and light weapons continue to threaten the international security, human safety, as well as socio-economic stability.
The summit should echo the UN Secretary-Generalâs appeal for consensus on the legally binding convention on the marking and tracing of small arms and to expedite negotiations on an instrument on illicit brokering and the supply of arms.
The Commission further hopes that the summit will lead to the start of negotiations on an international arms trade treaty.
With regard to the proposal to set up a democracy fund, this could provide added value.
It would make a real difference if it were used to jointly identify key priorities, general programming and to provide political guidance for those eligible countries seeking to strengthen democratic practice.
Work now needs to be undertaken to facilitate the emergence of a consensus on the modalities of this fund.
The Commission underlines the need to restore the political stature of the General Assembly, asserting its role as the main universal deliberative body.
The Commission is also particularly interested in the ECOSOC reform.
We support a radical reform to render the body more operational and would like to see its role in all the pillars of sustainable development reinforced.
Some Members raised the issue of Security Council reform.
This is clearly an important and central issue.
However, it should not be an issue that hampers our ability to take actions in a range of other areas that I have highlighted.
I have again noted your repeated appeal for an EU seat on the Security Council.
In conclusion, let me state that reform of the United Nations is not an exercise in institutional change for its own sake. Our aim is to enhance the ability of this global organisation to meet the challenges of the 21st century in the interests of meeting the aspirations of the peoples of the United Nations.
Seeking to consolidate the areas of agreement that exist between Parliament, the Council and the Commission further enhances our chances of achieving sound results in the reform of this important body.
Â Â  Mr President, I am grateful to the Commission for having quickly replaced me during that short absence.
I believe that the Council will take account of the suggestions, ideas and proposals emerging during this Parliamentary debate and also contained in this draft report.
The Presidency will obviously communicate the essential aspects of this debate to the future Presidency, because the European Union must now define its position clearly in advance of the September summit.
I believe, as many of you have said, that the UN is an essential building block of a globalised world.
To solve the worldâs current problems, we need a strong and effective multilateral system.
It is for that reason that this reform must not be reduced to a handful of details or a few national interests.
The European Union is best placed â or should be best placed â to show that multilateralism provides the answer to problems which can no longer be solved on a purely national basis.
I should also like to come back to the proposal concerning a fund for democracy.
The United Nations human rights system needs root-and-branch reform.
Too often â and we have discussed this on a number of occasions â developments which are almost absurd occur in the Commission on Human Rights.
For that reason, to restore greater credibility to the protection of human rights within the UN system, reform is absolutely essential.
And I believe that this is yet another area in which the European Union can be at the forefront of reform, encouraging it and achieving positive results and solutions.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the Council and Commission statements on transatlantic relations.
Â Â  Mr President, a few months ago, we debated the strengthening of transatlantic relations.
It followed the visit of President Bush to the European institutions and came after what could be termed the ârelaunchâ of those relations.
We are now in the preparatory phase for the forthcoming Euro-Atlantic summit, due to take place at the end of this month.
It is important that this summit should achieve concrete results so that the relaunch of dialogue, achieved during President Bushâs visit, can become a reality.
For that reason, I should like to raise a number of points which appear of particular importance for the development of stronger transatlantic relations.
Firstly, there is the issue of Iran, which was an important item on the agenda during President Bushâs visit.
Not only have the Americans supported the European initiative, they have also agreed to open negotiations with Iran with a view to its membership of the World Trade Organisation, and Iranâs WTO membership is today an integral part of European strategy.
I therefore believe that on this extremely sensitive and delicate issue, we have been able to show that cooperation between the US and Europe can provide solutions, and above all that it can produce a consistent strategy, which is, incidentally, first and foremost, a European strategy.
The Union and the US are organising, and will jointly chair, a conference on the reconstruction of Iraq, to which I referred this morning.
This decision was announced during the visit of President Bush.
The announcement gave us the opportunity to show that we had left our disagreements on Iraq behind us.
The US and the Union have the same aims for that country, namely to help the Iraqi Government in its huge reconstruction effort and, above all, in reinforcing its security.
It will be a conference at ministerial level with over 80 delegations, a large number of which will be from the region concerned.
The Iraqi Government, which will be at the very heart of that conference, will therefore have an opportunity to set out its plans and discuss the economic, political and security aspects with the international community represented there.
In relation to Sudan, the European Union did not merely insist that those responsible for crimes against humanity should be punished, but also that they should be punished through the International Criminal Court.
As you know, the Union is one of the leading bodies supporting that Court.
For us, the case of Sudan is an important precedent.
The Court was set up for precisely that type of situation.
If the matter were not referred to the International Criminal Court, however, that would create an unfortunate precedent which it would be difficult to overcome in the future.
After several weeks of intense negotiations, we reached a solution acceptable to everyone, enabling the situation in Sudan to be referred to the International Criminal Court â and this without a US veto.
Here was yet another situation in which the European Union exercised a wholly positive influence in transatlantic relations, at the same time rendering multilateral action more effective.
Political dialogue between the European Union and the US has also become more frequent and more strategic on economic issues.
However, we must stress that major problems remain.
We are all aware of the case of Boeing and Airbus, and hope that, in the context of the forthcoming summit, we can still reach a satisfactory solution, thereby avoiding this matter being referred to the WTO and thus putting a damper on future Euro-Atlantic relations.
Additionally, a strategic dialogue on Asia has begun.
It is true that discussions on the lifting of the embargo on arms exports to China have revealed a lack of debate on strategic changes in Asia.
The start of this dialogue, therefore, must show our common interests and help the Union to strengthen its own strategic thinking on that important region, now emerging both as a political and, above all, as an economic force.
In the US Congress, a European Union Caucus has recently been created.
We hope you will seize this opportunity and take advantage of the increasing interest in the European Union on the part of your US counterparts.
Dialogue between legislators is important and should be strengthened, particularly in view of the importance of the Senate in the sphere of foreign policy.
I therefore believe that the development of relations between this Parliament and the US Congress must be a goal of particularly high priority.
Mr President, these examples show the healthy condition of transatlantic cooperation in the last few months.
It is vital to work with our American partners on the challenges now facing us.
These various examples show that we can overcome our differences and adopt a shared approach.
Major preparatory work is therefore now underway for the forthcoming EU-US summit, due to take place in Washington on 21 June.
We are counting on a substantial and strategic summit, because it will be focused on vital issues of international relations.
At the beginning of this month, the troika met the US Secretary of State, Condoleeza Rice, for that purpose.
We are working on a number of draft declarations: the Middle East, international peace and security, the promotion of freedom, democracy, the rule of law and human rights, but also Africa, the environment and economic relations.
In the same way as last year, we are hoping to use these declarations as a basis on which to work.
During the summit, we shall deal with the most important strategic issues, in particular the Middle East and Eastern Europe, the Balkans, the Kosovo situation, but also â and we have just debated it â reform of the United Nations.
We can only reform the United Nations with the support of the US, and we know that there is still a long way to go on this issue.
Like us, the Americans undoubtedly support the proposal to create a peace-building commission, but it now has to be given a more concrete and, above all, operational remit.
The European Union is ambitious in the field of economic relations, as I have just said.
The next EU Presidency â our Presidency will be over by then â will advise you of the results of this summit.
I am confident that the strong revival in transatlantic relations, achieved during the visit of President Bush, can continue during this summit and that we can achieve solid results which will place the future of these transatlantic relations, a vital pillar for the European Union, on a sounder footing.
Â Â  . Honourable Members, thank you for giving me the opportunity to address Parliament shortly before our yearly EU-US summit, which will take place in Washington on 20Â June.
I would like to say at the outset that we share many of the views expressed in your motion for a resolution and welcome the support of the European Parliament for the strengthening of transatlantic relations.
Transatlantic relations are at a turning point.
We are witnessing a new era of transatlantic unity.
This was most recently confirmed by the Condoleezza Rice, when she said that, rather than sitting back and analysing the state of the transatlantic alliance, we are putting the alliance to work.
This is a timely and welcome development.
As global partners, the EU and the United States must take the lead in building a prosperous and safe world and in promoting democracy, human rights and the rule of law.
We must work together to forge a common strategy to deal with global problems wherever possible.
That is the message our leaders will doubtless seek to convey at the upcoming June summit.
President Bushâs successful visit to Brussels last February was a sign of the United States Administrationâs desire to reach out to Europe and work together in partnership with the European Union.
It was an important signal that we have put the problems of approach that arose over Iraq behind us and that we are ready to work together in a constructive manner as allies.
The United States is increasingly adopting a more open attitude to the European Union and listening more carefully to our concerns.
Even where there are differences between us, we are learning how best to talk through them.
A good example is the recently launched European Union-US Strategic Dialogue on East Asia, a forum in which to discuss the security challenges in the region, including those related to the rise of China.
Coordination also continues on United Nations reform, though much work still needs to be done.
The EU-US summit on 20Â June will focus on three global themes: promoting democratic governance and human rights around the world, increasing economic prosperity for our citizens and championing security and development.
I would like to say a few words on each.
Promoting democracy and freedom is the essence of President Bushâs foreign policy in his second term.
European Union foreign policy, which is firmly based on the principles of the United Nations and the European Security Strategy, also aims to promote democracy, together with human rights and the rule of law.
The promotion of democracy remains key in the wider Middle East and in the Mediterranean region, where transatlantic cooperation has increased substantially over the past 12Â months.
Shortly after our summit in Washington, we and the United States will co-host an international conference in Brussels on Iraq.
This is an important signal of unified international support for the government and people in their difficult task of working towards stabilisation and reconstruction.
In addition we have been in daily contact over Lebanonâs election process, and together we will continue to support the Lebanese people as they consolidate democracy.
In Israel and Palestine, our cooperative approach within the Quartet is also intensifying.
On economic prosperity, the European Union and the United States have the most integrated economies in the world and benefit from the largest trade and investment relationship.
But we can do more, and we want to.
To move this agenda forward, we have spent nineÂ months consulting all stakeholders on the obstacles they encountered and distilled the result in the recently published Commission communication, âA stronger EU-US Partnership and a more open market for the 21st centuryâ.
The communication contains a set of pragmatic proposals for boosting EU-US trade and investment and thus promoting competitiveness, growth, and jobs on both sides of the Atlantic.
There are three basic strands to our proposals.
First, regulating the transatlantic market, including areas such as services, investment, procurement and competition; second, promoting knowledge and innovation; and third, instituting smarter and safer borders for swifter trade and investment.
In the field of regulatory cooperation, the idea is to find ways for regulators to engage with each other at an early stage to avoid unnecessary conflicts and costs, and to promote convergence.
The second strand, on promoting knowledge and innovation, is crucial for generating economic growth and jobs.
New technologies, in particular e-commerce, Internet governance and mobile telecommunication services, generated considerable interest amongst the stakeholders consulted.
The third strand of our package is striking the right balance between heightened security requirements and the continuation of open trade and passenger transport.
Our communication also addresses the overall structure and goals of transatlantic relations.
The question we address is what the political profile of our relations should be 10Â years after the signature of the 1995 New Transatlantic Agenda and fifteen years after the 1990 Transatlantic Declaration.
In essence, we must make sure that the structure and the goals of transatlantic relations are adapted to todayâs challenges.
We would also like to see legislators â the European Parliament and United States CongressÂ â build stronger ties.
For this reason we suggest enhancing the Transatlantic Legislatorsâ Dialogue and making it a fully-fledged transatlantic assembly.
The Commission stands ready to assist as necessary, but an initiative of this nature naturally has to come first and foremost from this House and from the United States Congress.
Championing security and development is the third theme of the summit.
As we continue to identify measures to enhance the security of our citizens against terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, it is worth remembering that such phenomena have claimed many more victims beyond our borders than within them.
This reinforces our determination to work with the United States to spread the benefits of security in all its facets and to help release peoples everywhere from the daily tyranny of terrorism and violence.
The European Union and the United States should combine skills and experience in the field of conflict prevention and crisis response and bring to bear the full range of civilian and military tools at our disposal.
We should consult routinely on current and potential crises.
We should strengthen cooperation in post-conflict assistance and reconstruction.
We should prepare, through joint training and exercises, and we should work together to improve international capacities to respond to crises and to prevent future crises from erupting.
The European Union is anxious to cooperate with the United States on crisis management, both civilian and military.
We also recognise the need to tackle poverty, disease, corruption and instability, which terrorists seek to exploit and intensify.
Our common agenda should prioritise the Millennium Development Goals.
In conclusion, the Commission welcomes the Parliamentâs motion for a resolution and, as I have indicated previously, we largely agree with it.
We are taking an ambitious, forward-looking approach in developing our relations with the United States and are working actively in the areas mentioned in the draft resolution.
We have a challenging agenda in front of us.
We are looking forward to your support, and the support of United States Congress, to accomplish it.
Â Â  . Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, at a time like the present, when this European Union of ours is weakened, I believe that we have to make clear what great importance we attach to transatlantic relationships, the improvement of which does, in many ways, help us in turn to manifest more clearly our capacity for action.
What makes the summit so very significant is that it resolves certain issues at the same time as setting certain processes in motion.
On economic issues, solutions must be found, and agreements reached, with greater speed, for the two great democracies on opposite sides of the Atlantic are still, economically speaking, the worldâs great powers.
If they are capable of stimulating growth â and it is very important that they should, from the point of view of combating unemployment and improving the global situation as a whole â then they should do so within the bounds of a multilateral framework.
That is important not least in terms of the overall political situation.
We know from the unresolved developments in the world, and from the hazards and pressures that they bring, that it is only together that democracies can find solutions to these â not only on the basis of Nato, but also on the basis of what the European Union has come to acquire by way of powers and responsibilities in foreign and security policy, in legal and internal policies, and also in the sphere of economic policy.
It now remains for us to find a suitable framework for this, one in which we can properly develop this policy in future, and the Transatlantic Partnership Agreement we have proposed can play a crucial part in creating one.
I was interested to read in the Commission communication that there was no political support for this, apart from in the US Congress and in this House.
The Commission, though, appears to regard the support for it in both these places as irrelevant.
After all, consideration should be given to whether we might now be able to take a bold step forwards, and, instead of seeking the solution in the detail, mandating the Summit to examine, over the next 12 months, ways in which we can make progress in these areas.
The Americans have treaties with almost everyone on the face of the earth, as does the European Union, but there is no treaty between the United States and the European Union.
We should give some thought to the possibility of concluding one, thereby putting things on a better footing, instead of spending 30 years in the belief that the Airbus/Boeing dispute was at the heart of all we did and said.
Â Â  . Mr President, we too are hopeful that the European Union, despite the uncertainty about the future of the Constitutional Treaty resulting from the ânoâ votes in the Netherlands and France, will be able to stand united before the United States at the next Summit.
The world has not ground to a halt and some of the issues, in respect of which it is essential that the United States and the European Union reach agreement, cannot wait until our internal problems have been resolved.
Although there is no denying that the atmosphere between the United States and Europe has improved, that does not mean that all conflicts are in the past.
The EU must ensure that it manages to put across its issues to the US.
The joint resolution that we will be adopting tomorrow contains a whole list of things that we believe should be on the agenda.
I should like to single out three of them.
First of all, there is the question of how to deal with globalisation.
Although it is impossible to sum up the debate on this subject in two minutes, it is clear that the joint economic weight of the European Union and the United States has given both of us influence and great responsibility.
How can we incorporate the issues surrounding fair trade, the environment and a more social dimension into our position on economic globalisation?
Secondly, I am deeply worried about the spread of nuclear arms technology following the failure of the conference to review the non-proliferation Treaty.
In essence, despite lengthy and careful preparations, the participating countries failed to reach agreement, not least because of the line taken by the Americans.
It is possible that the Treaty, the legal basis for the non-proliferation regime, and therefore a , has been considerably weakened, the implications of which cannot be overlooked.
I would therefore call on the EU Member States and the US to table measures that can help restore confidence in the non-proliferation Treaty as a matter of urgency.
Closely related to this is, thirdly, the UNâs reform which will be debated in the autumn.
I am pleased to establish that the President of the Council is aware of the importance of this agenda item.
Although the need for reforms is being felt generally, the position of the United States is as yet unclear.
I consider this agenda item to be a test of American views about the multilateral system and even about the future of the UN system as a whole.
I sincerely hope that the European Union will receive promises of a constructive US position.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, following a depression during the previous EU legislature and the previous US administration, the skies over the Atlantic Ocean seem to be brightening up.
President Bushâs visit to the EU and a number of Member States seems to be heralding a new era.
Needless to say, we would have been keen to welcome President Bush to this Chamber, but we have not given up hope of this happening yet.
More importantly, though, we seem to be united in terms of conditions to put an end to a difficult time in EU-US relations and to lay the foundations for renewed cooperation that must be based on mutual respect, equivalence and the determination to frame our joint efforts in the multilateral perspective of the United Nations, the World Trade Organisation and NATO.
It goes without saying that unilateral initiatives that could lead to trade conflicts must be avoided.
The fact that we have entered a time of reflection and possible review after the referenda in France and the Netherlands must not be allowed to adversely affect the proceedings of the forthcoming Summit.
Ten years after the new transatlantic dialogue was laid down, it is high time we expanded it.
This expanded dialogue must also leave room for us to express our concerns about the unacceptable conditions in the prison of Guantanamo Bay or about the restriction of personal freedom and privacy that can be the result of unilateral security initiatives.
Both the US and we set great store by the worldwide spread of democracy, prosperity and human rights, although our views of how that should be done can differ.
That does not mean that ours are inferior.
Facing, as we are, enormous challenges in terms of world poverty reduction, combating fatal diseases, peace in the Middle East, a peaceful settlement to the so-called frozen conflicts, I hope that both the Americans and the Europeans will be able to join forces effectively.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my group, too, is glad that, after the ice age that temporarily characterised transatlantic relations, things are evidently now being put back on the right track.
I think that the partners on opposite sides of the Atlantic have to understand just how very much they need each other if the values they share are to be defended and caused to prevail throughout the world.
This means that the transatlantic summit is very important, for it will â it is to be hoped â help us to make progress.
I would also like to say how glad I am that our American friends have not, following the failure of the EUâs Constitution to gain acceptance in France and the Netherlands, shown any pleasure in our misfortune.
I am sure that many of us expected a different reaction, and that this is something we have to regard as a good sign.
There are, nevertheless, a number of defects in the motion for a resolution as presented, and it is for that reason that my group has tabled amendments to it, which I would now â briefly â like to present.
One area they touch on is that of climate change.
Only today, we read in the news reports that not even Tony Blair has managed to get the United States to make concessions where climate change is concerned; our American friends are still, lamentably, blocking the way to effective protection against climate change, at a time when we are becoming aware of just how strong the connection is between combating poverty on the one hand and protecting against climate change on the other.
Finally, let me turn to human rights and international law.
In the US, Senator Biden has yet again highlighted how important it is in terms of our American friendsâ public image that the prisoner of war camp in GuantÃ¡namo should be closed down.
Just now, we have again been reading about the mutiny of the prisoners at Abu Ghraib.
Both these camps, along with other illegal camps around the world, must be closed down as a matter of urgency, for they are a disgrace that flies in the face of the United Statesâ values.
If we want to combat poverty, I see it as very, very important that we should not revert to competing to see who can invest most in armaments.
Rather than allowing our age to be characterised by the setting of new records in spending on rearmament, we must do everything we can to discharge our responsibility to the world at large.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, it seems to me that the Council report, the Commission report and also the motion put forward by the majority of the political Groups are all aimed at seeking agreement with the United States at any cost, even by removing principles that have always underpinned the foundations of the European Union.
I am talking about respect for human rights, for instance: the Guantanamo affair is not an isolated case, as demonstrated, for example, by the Abu Ghraib situation â which absolutely no one has mentioned â and the kidnapping of free citizens, as documented by the major European newspapers, which was carried out by the US Secret Service on European Union soil.
We do not see anything and we do not say anything at all on the matter.
There is also no mention of condemning preventative war, which is completely at odds with international law.
Building transatlantic relations is achieved, moreover, by continually paying tribute to all forms of liberalism, and even â I heard it said by the Commission representative â by proposing to put services on the market of transatlantic relations, which up to now â fortunately â have been excluded from International Trade Organisation agreements and are still considered to be services for accessing rights, and not goods for generating profits.
Â Â  . Mr President, as the Council only knows too well, the European Parliament remains opposed to its intention to abandon the arms embargo in respect of the Peopleâs Republic of China on the basis of the human rights situation, see paragraph 7 of the joint draft resolution.
Although I support this position, it is too restricted because it completely overlooks the eroding military balance in the state of Taiwan as well as the general regional stability in East Asia.
These are geopolitical developments which give the US cause for concern about a possible European lifting of the arms embargo against Peking.
If, as appears to be the case, Brussels wants to give Washington sole and short-term responsibility for peace and security in the Far East, then a fresh crisis in transatlantic relations is looming in the distance in succession to Iraq.
I hope that at the EU-US Summit on 20 June, the Council will prove this sombre scenario wrong.
How can it do this?
It can do it by joining with the Americans in taking responsibility, in taking real responsibility for geopolitical stability in Asia.
After all, as Chinaâs key trading partner, the European Union ultimately owes it to itself to do this.
Â Â  .Â Â Â MrÂ President, the main basis for the EUâs relations with the United States should be healthy economic competition.
The European Union will only reap the rewards of such competition if the European economy is not held back by various curious notions relating to the state, society and taxation.
Similarly, we will only reap the rewards of cooperation with the United States if cooperation is based on a US-friendly foreign policy.
The United States acts as a stabilising force in global politics.
Without it, the world would turn into one great battlefield.
Anti-American sentiments, which are expressed particularly frequently by French politicians, are not conducive to neighbourly relations between Europe and the United States.
Two years ago, President Chirac told the countries supporting US intervention in Iraq that they had missed a good opportunity to shut up.
Now that PresidentÂ Chirac and his predecessor, MrÂ GiscardÂ dâEstaing, have plunged Europe into utter confusion as a result of premature support for the Constitution, thus shattering the vision of future common European policies, we in turn can say to the French President that he has missed a good opportunity to shut up, or, in his native tongue, ââ
Â Â  Mr President, we have talked about transatlantic relations many times in the past.
There was a debate only last January, which was followed by a resolution, and we now have a Euro-Atlantic Summit in Washington at the end of June, to name but a few.
That is all useful and interesting of course, but there is still room for improvement in those relations, primarily by way of a change of mentality.
For example, we are all agreed that the fight against terrorism on the one hand, and the promotion of democracy and peace in the world on the other, can only be successful if our partnership with the United States is reinforced, based on the western values we share.
When it comes to translating the principles into practice, though, things invariably go wrong.
A perfect example is the European Councilâs intention to remove the arms embargo against China.
The USâs opposition to those plans is entirely appropriate.
There is absolutely no point in paying lip service to democratisation in the rest of the world if, in practice, we do exactly the opposite by accommodating the wishes of a Chinese regime that is still as dictatorial as in the days when it crushed the protests on Tiananmen Square.
We as Europeans should therefore search our own hearts from time to time.
In this part-session, I have heard the situation in Guantanamo Bay being discussed in various debates.
Far be it from me to deny that we have a problem there, but constantly harping on about this issue does, however, reveal a certain level of hypocrisy on our part, certainly if we take the European shortcomings in fighting terrorism into consideration.
We can only be delighted about the positive outcome of the subsequent visits of President Bush and Condoleezza Rice to Europe.
We must continue on this path, but if we talk about respect, then that respect should be mutual.
Â Â  â I should like to begin by congratulating the authors of the report on achieving a rare feat: they have drawn up a document that might prove very useful for the Washington Summit of 20Â June.
I should also like to raise two points.
First, I should like to point out that, during the cold war, Europe was the theatre of strategic operations and that the perception of threats was the same on both sides of the Atlantic.
This changed after the end of the cold war, German reunification, the collapse of the Soviet Union and 11Â September.
The theatres of strategic operations have changed, but the real difference is in the perception of threats on both sides of the Atlantic; and if the perception of threats has changed, then so too must the strategies and operating methods.
Whereas in Europe we have developed a multilateral concept of soft power, in other words diplomacy, economic sanctions and political sanctions, the United States has become more inclined, after 11Â September, towards hard power, namely the idea of unilateralism and of âwith others if possible, by ourselves if necessaryâ.
The two concepts and perceptions of threat on either side of the Atlantic have thus grown apart.
Attempts are ongoing to strike a balance whereby soft power becomes less soft and hard power less hard, and, more importantly, the perception of threats and the means of combating those threats are consistent and complementary.
This is the key objective of any transatlantic summit.
There is a second objective, which concerns the area of trade, both on a bilateral level, but also in particular with regard to its concerted attack in the area of globalisation and the World Trade Organisation.
It is appalling that social dumping and environmental dumping, which jeopardise jobs in Europe and are at the heart of unfair competition, can be allowed to continue unchecked in the world and to continue to act to our detriment.
Unless the EU and the United States can join forces on this issue, it will be very difficult to prevent this from happening, and the consequence will sooner or later be a form of protectionism that will itself be unbridled.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are, primarily, two things at issue here.
One is the need for the United States of America, and Europe, to use the wealth they have created to help those less well-off to achieve similar prosperity.
I believe that the British Presidency is planning to do something about this shortly, and we can play our part in it, even though we may disagree about one thing or another.
We also need, not only to take pride in the democracy and freedom that we have established in our own countries, but also to offer them to others as instruments of development.
I quite deliberately say âofferâ rather than âimposeâ, for offering is what we have done in Europe itself, in Eastern Europe and in the Balkans â which I mention because I have just been told that a large party of visitors from Macedonia is present â and it is surely what we intend to do in the Middle East as well.
We regard the Middle East as a very unstable region and a very important one.
We, Americans and Europeans alike, agree that everyone who lives in these countries needs democracy and development â free development in particular â as a means towards peace.
This makes it particularly important that Europe and the USA should cooperate with one another.
Let me reiterate, though, that the approach to be adopted must be that of enabling people to establish freedom and democracy in their own countries, without feeling that these have been imposed upon them.
It is also important â and here I would cite Iran as an example â that we join together in preventing new dangers and new risks from rearing their heads.
Here, too, though, I would strongly advocate doing this, not by way of threats, but through negotiations, thereby, I hope, arriving at something we can all regard as a success.
Â Â  Mr President, it is indeed good to hear the Council and the Commission restate so firmly the European Union commitment to renewing transatlantic cooperation.
There are many areas of work in which the shared values of both partners directly coincide.
The United States of America has recently taken the lead in openly encouraging the establishment of democracy in the Arabian Peninsula.
The European Union has set up the unique Euro-Mediterranean Partnership: quieter, in-depth work, helping to establish the rule of law and rights-based legislation in North Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean.
Dialogue between these two key actors is not enough.
Our whole world is now riven by conflict and insecurity, from weapons of mass destruction, which sadly do exist, to the continued act of genocide in different countries.
Our citizens and the worldâs citizens are in danger.
Full-scale cooperation between the European Union and the United States of America, as well as with other key democracies such as India, is a prerequisite for peace.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, terrorism, terrorism and more terrorism, democracy and common values; it is always these same phrases that we hear in relation to our big brother observing us from across the Atlantic and from space, monitoring us from bases in Germany, Italy, Hungary and Turkey, from African, Asian and Latin American countries, from nuclear submarines, from pilotless aircraft and from who knows where else.
We should therefore start work on a resolution on mutually beneficial, balanced and forward-looking relations.
We must beware of sensitive topics, however.
Inhumane and degrading conditions in certain US prisons must be kept secret.
It is essential to make loud declarations of cooperation in the war on terror and bioterrorism and to attempt to uncover the sources of funding for terrorism.
What do we not mention in our resolution?
The sources of modern arms for terrorist organisations, cooperation in removing nuclear weapons from the Middle East and ending support for terrorists in Central Asia, the Caucasus and Western and Central Africa.
It is certainly no easy matter to tell a stronger partner oneâs views openly and clearly.
We may criticise Turkey and Russia, however, and perhaps even Bangladesh.
You will undoubtedly be aware that literacy and universal health insurance are among the values of European civilisation.
What a shame that our partner does not recognise the same values.
Which of you, ladies and gentlemen, will propose these common values in the next resolution?
Do you not know that illiteracy affects millions across the pond, and that universal health insurance has yet to be successfully introduced?
According to public domain research, thermonuclear fusion is an ordinary task for civilisation, which should be resolved together.
If we are allies, let us not shrink from pointing out these tasks and encouraging our partner to resolve them.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, the 60th anniversary of the end of the Second World War, which we recently commemorated, reminded us of the historical significance of the assistance we received from the United States.
At the time Europe was weak in both economic and military terms, and without such assistance it would have been unable to defeat the Nazis or to put up at least partial opposition to the Communist dictatorship.
As things stand today, the EU is incapable of ensuring its own security unless it engages in military and political cooperation with the United States.
Instances in the past when we joined forces, excellent examples of which include Iraq, Bosnia and Kosovo in the 1990s and, more recently, Afghanistan, should serve as a blueprint for our future military and political cooperation.
The significance of this cooperation is plain to see in Central and Eastern Europe, and NATO enlargement is proof that this region is regarded as a credible partner.
A sense of security is particularly important for countries whose history has been one of great suffering, such as Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia and Poland.
These countries were deprived of their sovereignty for many decades because they had no partner prepared to perform the duties of an ally without hesitation.
Economic cooperation is of course an inherent feature of harmonious political cooperation.
It is in Europeâs vital interests to prevent an economic war with the United States, and after all we are currently the two largest trade partners in the world.
This should be the line taken by Parliament in the run-up to the June summit, and we should send out a clear message that our policy is underpinned by credible partners who share our values.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, I do not intend to follow MrÂ KohlÃ­Äekâs example and discuss illiteracy in the USA, or to dwell on the fact that America has a dubious track record on certain issues.
Instead, what I want to say is that Europe and America belong to the same family.
Members of the same family often have differing opinions, but a family should always put up a united front.
Our opinions on Iraq may well differ, and indeed they do, but in strategic terms we are allies.
Hysterical anti-Americanism is not in Europeâs interest, and it is not in the interest of the USA to treat Europe like a younger brother.
There are two tasks facing us today that we must tackle together.
The first of these is the fight against terrorism, and the second is the peaceful resolution of the Middle East conflict.
We must not forget that Asia is gaining ever more importance as a political and economic power in the shadow of the bizarre rivalry between America and Europe, and the conclusions we should draw from this are as follows.
Instead of waging a nonsensical economic war, what is needed is close cooperation.
We may well have grounds for complaint about the USAâs economic perfectionism, but we should still be more flexible on economic issues.
We should never forget the other continents are happiest when they see us fighting.
I believe that the new EU Member States, and in particular my own country, Poland, will know exactly what I mean.
Â Â  Mr President, the atmosphere has changed significantly since the visit of George W. Bush to Brussels a few months ago, but it is interesting that in the international press this is not yet recognised.
It would be nice, Mr President-in-Office, if you could show, when you are in Washington with the Commission, that we can make a real step forward in EU-US relations.
Clearly there are a whole range of issues of a political and security nature on this agenda to which you have referred, particularly the political challenges dealing with democracy, human rights and the rule of law.
It would be nice, Mr President-in-Office, if you would listen to my contribution, because I would like to draw your attention to one particular issue on the economic side.
It is through the economics that we must drive this particular relationship.
That is where the businesses want the remaining barriers to trade and investment to be removed. That is where an OECD report released this week shows that if we go for growth and remove these barriers, we could be adding 2 to 3% GDP per capita in Europe as a result.
I would therefore like the summit to be able to set out an ambitious agenda, a vision of how these remaining obstacles can be reduced and removed, to have a route map, to be able to have a clear timetable so that we would be able not only to stimulate our economies, but to bring Europe and America closer together.
To do that you are going to need the cooperation of this House.
You have spoken about the cooperation between this House and that of the US Congress, the significant support in this House for this concept, and also for a broader partnership framework between the United States and Europe.
It is up to you, to Mr Juncker as President-in-Office of the Council, and to Mr Barroso, to take the leadership and to make sure we do not miss out on this opportunity for a strengthened European-American relationship which will not only be good bilaterally, but will also enable us to face the multilateral global challenges, a relationship without which they will not be resolved.

Â Â  Mr President, let me immediately pick up on the point raised by Mr Elles and referred to by my colleague Mr Swoboda, that being that both Europe and the United States bear a great responsibility in global terms and that it is only by acting together that we will enable the less well-off countries to be integrated into the global economy.
I would like to congratulate the Commission on its statement, for it has taken a bold step.
Politically, we have had a rough ride, and it was for a long time unclear what, if anything, we could achieve in the course of preparations for this summit.
Written and oral statements have been made, and these take us a step further.
By these I mean particularly the proposals for cooperation in the negotiation of specific agreements, in the field of new technologies and, most especially, in research and safety.
All these things are right, proper and important.
I am especially glad that the Commission has ventured for the first time to use the term âtransatlantic marketâ and also to find a way of describing what it is â still rather cryptically, it has to be admitted, but it is going down the right road.
This is something that this House has frequently addressed in its resolutions.
We are very well-advised to acknowledge the reality of what we already have, which is an integrated market.
I might add that the OECD study to which Mr Elles referred not only says that we will achieve growth if we press on with integrating the market only within Europe â from which, according to the study, Europe will derive greater benefit than the United States â it also says that we must do this throughout the world, which is an extremely important point.
If we benefit from this, then the other countries will do likewise, and so we should take very careful note of what this study has to say.
I would, though, like to congratulate the Commission on the study it initiated.
It is a good job of work and will enable us to make progress.
Now for my last point: here, too, we see the Commission taking on board a proposal from this House; in this instance, that we should work together more closely in the sphere of inter-parliamentary exchange.
Mr Jonathan Evans will be saying more about that later.
It is an important point, and I propose that we should have further discussions of everything the Commission is proposing â which the Summit will, I hope, take on board â in an inter-parliamentary context.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, we are seeing real improvements in the climate of cooperation between Europe and America, which is good news for those of us in Europe who are friends of America.
One can only hope that the good news will continue.
There are further hurdles to overcome, however.
One of the most significant obstacles we are currently facing is the restrictions on entry into the United States imposed on the citizens of certain EU Member States, or in other words visa restrictions.
Many people in Europe regard practices of this kind as discriminatory, not least because they amount to unequal treatment of EU Member States.
This view is particularly widespread among the public in countries such as my own, Poland, and the other Central European countries whose citizens continue to need visas to enter the United States.
I would also remind the House that the changes we recently made to the reciprocity mechanism mean that the EUâs visa policy is coordinated at Community level.
It is now the Commission, and not the Member States or the Council, which takes the decision to impose sanctions on a third country.
It is therefore also the Commissionâs duty to ensure that all citizens and all EU Member States enjoy equal rights.
I hope that this issue will be raised during the forthcoming summit.
The second issue I should like to address is the need for cooperation between the European Union and the United States in support of democracy and human rights, in particular in the post-Soviet space.
Europe and America must speak with one voice on this issue, as they did during the Orange Revolution or when DrÂ Condoleezza Rice and MrÂ Solana made their recent declaration on support for the Belarussian opposition.
Words are not enough, however, and what is needed is joint action.
It is an unfortunate fact that Europe is lagging behind America in this respect.
We are less flexible than the Americans and too slow and bureaucratic in the way we take action.
This is particularly true in the case of the Commission.
I believe that our attention should be focused on ensuring that the European Union and America speak with one voice and take joint action on issues relating to the promotion of democracy and human rights.
