These are descriptions of the situation by organisations and high-profile leaders who know more about what is happening than we do.
But it is our duty, as Members of the European Parliament, to debate these massive violations of human rights which are taking place in Russia and therefore in Europe, in Chechnya, for as long as they continue to be a reality.
We therefore call for a ceasefire and a political solution.
Those Russian soldiers who have no respect for civilian lives, who have scant regard for human dignity and human life, should not only be criticised for their actions in political statements in Moscow; we call for them also to be brought before the courts and for judgment to be passed on them, because if not the violations of human rights will just go on and on.
(Applause)
We also call on Russia to open up Chechnya to observers - to an even greater extent than it has done so far - and also to work with organisations in the European Union.
The President-in-Office of the Council and also the Commissioner referred to this and generally speaking we are of the same mind.
In addition, we in the European Parliament should ask our delegation and the corresponding delegation in the Duma - and Parliament should as it were give the go-ahead for this - to establish a well-ordered procedure for attending to Chechnya properly on an ongoing basis.
Soon - as we of course already decided on 16 March - we should send a European Parliament delegation to Chechnya and that region.
For my part I would very much welcome it if you, Commissioner, were personally to travel there to speak to those affected on the ground.
(Applause)
Finally, we need to cooperate closely with Lord Judd of the Council of Europe, who is of course very involved in working on this problem, and overall we need a political solution.
Allow me, in conclusion, to say the following: I have visited all of the republics of the former Soviet Union, including Tatarstan.
Tatarstan, the capital of which is Kazan, has a high degree of autonomy, indeed the greatest degree of autonomy in the Russian Federation.
Why is it not possible for Chechnya to have something comparable?
The representatives of Chechnya, who were here two months ago, appeared to have lost all hope; they were depressed and their concern and despair were palpable.
It is our duty as the European Parliament to give hope to those who want to live in peace in Chechnya - within the Russian Federation, but with autonomous status of some kind - and to act as an advocate for human rights on this continent and throughout the world, including in Chechnya.
(Applause)
Mr President, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party welcomes the fact that this debate is taking place, as we already did before our friend Mr Dupuis went on hunger strike.
It is important to devote special time to Chechnya and to discussing the situation there.
I have the feeling that the atrocities and the military offensive are taking place under cover of the events of 11 September and the situation in the Middle East.
Just like China, which we shall be discussing later, Russia is using the fight against terrorism as a kind of alibi for oppressing its own political opponents and minorities.
The war between Chechnya and Russia is a long, stubborn and apparently irresolvable conflict which has gone on for many years.
Obviously, atrocities are being committed on both sides.
These must of course be investigated, and the people responsible held to account.
It is true that a number of positive signs can be detected.
Lord Judd, for example, has pointed to certain modest improvements.
Here too, just like in the Middle East, there is a battle as to what news is to be released to the outside world.
We are awash with testimonies from human rights organisations concerning the situation of, in particular, civilians in Chechnya.
Death squads, summary executions, torture, rape and disappearances.
Terrible, systematic atrocities are quite clearly being committed against the civilian population of Chechnya.
The Russian authorities must get to grips with this state of affairs, investigate the events and punish those responsible.
Nearly 200 000 people have taken flight within Chechnya, and a quarter of a million have fled the country.
Their situation is, of course, incredibly precarious.
The European Parliament has adopted quite a number of resolutions on this conflict but, now, action is required.
It was good to hear from the President-in-Office of the Council that the troika is to be sent to Chechnya.
It would also be good if the Commissioner could travel to the area in order to discuss the situation and address the issue with the Russian President.
We must be very clear in demanding of Russia that it put an end without delay to the atrocities and massacres directed against civilians.
The ELDR Group demands that an independent committee of investigation be sent to Chechnya to ascertain what is really happening.
We also want to see President Putin and the Chechen President, Mr Maskhadov, invited to Parliament to discuss the situation, so enabling us to demonstrate our support for peace talks.
The tentative negotiations begun in November 2001 resulted in only one meeting, and there was no major progress.
Together with the OSCE and the Council of Europe, the EU can play a role in facilitating talks so that we can bring about a political solution. There is, of course, no military solution.
My political group also wants the EU to take action by submitting an initiative concerning Chechnya at the UN Commission on Human Rights's session in Geneva.
Mr de Miguel spoke of the EU's support for the UNHCR, and that is important.
The truth, however, is that the EU's contribution to the UNHCR's budget has declined by a third in recent years.
Yesterday, we discussed the Middle East situation in this House, where there is a strong commitment to resolving the conflict.
Our commitment ought not, however, to lead to our closing our eyes to other conflicts and giving the Russians carte blanche to commit these atrocities.
The situation is drastic, and the conflict is in danger of spreading to the whole region, with devastating consequences for Russian democracy.
The ELDR Group supports the resolution before us, even though we think it is rather faint-hearted.
We must send a strong message to the Russian Government and President: We know what you are doing, and we find it unacceptable.
Mr President, Mr de Miguel, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the events of 11 September last year are still clearly dominating world politics.
And we all know that world politics are particularly cynical, which is certainly also true for Chechnya.
Since 11 September, I have the impression that Chechnya has indeed fallen into the cracks of world history and has been banished from current affairs, and today's debate is therefore of particular importance.
Since my appointment as Chairman of the EU-Russia Parliamentary Cooperation Committee, I have conducted many talks with Russians, Chechens, aid workers and human rights activists.
Certainly, the situation is complex, and talking about this issue in black and white terms will indeed not bring any solace but, despite this, I have to make a few observations.
The problems in Chechnya cannot be solved by military means.
What we need is a political solution, an immediate cease-fire and political consultation.
In this vein, I support the appeal made by human rights organisations to invite Mr Mascadov to Parliament in Strasbourg in September of this year and to start consultations with the Russian representatives of the Council of Europe.
As Mr Poettering pointed out a moment ago, a number of Russian colleagues paid us a visit last week and told us that Chechnya is returning to normality.
This was also confirmed by the Russian ambassador.
I am not credulous, as you may have gathered.
The many reports of human rights organisations and the testimonies of refugees themselves are flooding into our offices via the ordinary mail and via e-mail.
Mr Poettering was right to mention a few organisations, including Human Rights Watch, MÃ©decins sans FrontiÃšres and Amnesty International.
He mentioned the testimony of Mary Robertson and of a Chechen Member of Parliament.
It is obvious that daily life in Chechnya today is not that simple.
And we must therefore invite our Russian colleagues to enter into consultation and to promote goodwill.
We can hardly label these organisations, these people who are mentioned in our compromise resolution, as agents of international terrorism, as representatives of Bin Laden.
This would be all too simplistic.
I am therefore delighted that our delegation will be spending half a day next Monday with our Russian colleagues in Chechnya to talk over the difficulties. I am also pleased that, in the compromise resolution which will be voted on in a moment, our delegation will be given the task of setting up a working party, which will very specifically follow the situation in Chechnya and will mount an independent inquiry into what is actually happening in Chechnya.
I am therefore thrilled that we are repeating our request of sending an ad hoc delegation to Chechnya.
We decided on this in March 2000, but this has not yet been acted upon.
I would therefore ask the Parliament Bureau to ensure that this is at long last done.
Finally, I would turn to Mr Nielsen on behalf of my Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance.
Parliament has asked you twice to visit Chechnya.
Can I make a suggestion to you, Mr Nielsen?
We will go together.
I am prepared to take some time out, and we will assess the situation in Chechnya together.
And we will try to take action at long last.
Ladies and gentlemen, I can assure you that the delegation next Monday will do everything in its power to move the situation on by one little step and to enter into consultation with our Russian colleagues of the Duma and of the Council of Federations.
I thank you, Mr President, for the extra time you have given me.
Mr President, during the debate on Palestine yesterday, there were many who brought up the subject of Chechnya, and there are also an incredible number of parallels between the situations in the two areas.
Like Palestine, Chechnya is a country occupied by a strong and sizeable superior force.
As in Palestine, people in Chechnya see their ordinary, fundamental rights being violated and, in the case of Chechnya, we also see a country completely reduced to ruins and in which 20% of the population has been killed.
It is quite clear that both Israel and Russia are exploiting a situation in which the United States has declared war on terrorism and, under cover of this, are waging a war against a whole people; a war, moreover, that resembles ethnic cleansing.
I think we should remember that there was no terrorism in Chechnya when, in 1991, the country made use of the law of 16 December 1966 - which said that countries within the Federation too were entitled to independence - to acquire independence from Russia.
At that time there was no terrorism but, from 1994, Russia has done everything it can to prevent such independence.
It is another example of the way in which the oppression of a people and the desperation felt by a population can lead people to do things they would never otherwise have done.
Terrorism does not come about of itself.
Terrorists do not fall from the sky.
Certain population groups obviously do not have special genes which make them behave differently to the rest of us.
It is of course the conditions people live under that make them behave as they do.
It is important that we take a decision to invite Mr Maskhadov and Mr Putin to Strasbourg in September.
In that way, we can bring about a debate, obtain a report and make an impression on both parties.
I think we must demand open access for the humanitarian organisations and news media so that the information war is not a factor operating to the Chechens' disadvantage.
In the end, it is also necessary, however, for people who have been subject to atrocities to be given a clear sense that those who violate human rights will in the last analysis be punished.
Unless they have that sense, I do not believe we shall get very far either with the fight for democracy and human rights or with the fight against terrorism.
Basically, we must demand that the Russian occupation of Chechnya cease - preferably now.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this text, which was chiefly drafted by Mr Oostlander, is an appalling document.
It is totally immoral and cannot be considered to be politically credible.
To continue to demand that the Russian authorities and military forces, which have waged war for two and a half years and have systematically breached the fundamental rights of the Chechen people for two years, bring an end to their deliberate acts of violence, is absolutely appalling.
Similarly, it is absolutely appalling to continue to demand that humanitarian aid be allowed to get through to Chechnya, when we know that the Russian authorities are doing everything to prevent humanitarian aid from reaching its destination.
We are not talking about a massive breach of human rights taking place in Chechnya today. We are talking about outright genocide.
It is the first genocide to take place in Europe since the genocide of the Jewish people.
When 20% of the population, namely 200 000 people out of a population of one million inhabitants - is massacred, when tens of thousands of men are tortured and when their reproductive organs are systematically destroyed, we are no longer talking about human rights violations. We are talking about genocide.
Forty per cent of the Chechen people are refugees and have nothing to live on. These people are surviving in dreadful conditions in Ingushetia, and only 20-30 % of the Commission's humanitarian aid gets through to them; the rest is lost 'in the system'.
As Mr Poettering said, the aid supplied by Russia does not arrive at its destination either.
Taking all this into account, you can only arrive at one conclusion. This is genocide and Europe is sitting back, watching this genocide take place.
Comparisons with Palestine can be made, but only up to a point, as we are talking about terrorism in Palestine.
I would like some evidence that the Chechens are committing terrorism.
We have proof that there are Palestine suicide bombers but, as for the attacks in Moscow of two or three years ago, there has been no evidence unearthed to prove that these were committed by Chechens.
On the contrary, there is increasing evidence to show that the FSB - the Russian secret service - may have been responsible for the attacks.
Is it possible that thousands of Chechens have been fighting with the Taliban?
Hundreds and hundreds of foreign reporters have searched for Chechens in Afghanistan.
The international forces which were and still are in Afghanistan looked day after day for Chechen fighters.
But, so far, no one has found a single Chechen fighter in Afghanistan.
This rumour was put about by the FSB and the Russian counter-intelligence service.
So, it is wrong to call the Chechens terrorists when they are defending themselves, just as the Bosnians defended themselves, when they are defending themselves like the Croats defended themselves, when they have no Russian civilian targets because there are no Russian civilians in Chechnya. There are Russian soldiers and there are Chechen fighters who are fighting the Russians.
It is, in fact, the Russians who are carrying out acts of violence and torture on a daily basis, resorting to blackmail, imprisoning Chechens in filtration camps, who are involved in bargaining and trafficking of corpses and prisoners.
They are asking people who do not have the equivalent of one euro to spend several dollars in order save their families.
This is the situation in Chechnya. It is genocide.
Two and a half years have passed and Commissioner Nielson still has not managed to visit this country where genocide is taking place.
Mr Poettering, Mr Watson, Mr Cohn-Bendit and Mrs Frassoni met Mr Oumar Khanbiev, the Health Minister, who is sitting in the public gallery.
Mr BarÃ²n Crespo and Mr Wurtz are meeting him today.
Mr Nielson, Mr Khanbiev is not suffering from the plague, you can also meet him.
He is sitting there, all you have to do is walk up to the public gallery and you can see him.
He knows everything about the needs of the Chechen population in Chechnya, Ingushetia, Georgia and Azerbaijan, you can discuss this with him.
Mr President, I am the reprehensible author, or co-author of the resolution.
Needless to say, I am also impressed with the enthusiasm and commitment with which Mr Dupuis is talking about this issue.
Nevertheless, I take the view that it is very important, particularly in a situation as complicated as this one, where it is important to help find a solution, to keep a cool head, even though we have a warm heart.
It is true that, after the first war, the politicians in Chechnya actually received all our sympathy.
The outlook was, in fact, very rosy and, indeed, as the Chairman of my group, Mr Poettering, said, Tatarstan was a shining example.
Chechnya could have developed into a Tatarstan, and perhaps even a Tatarstan with more independence than Tatarstan itself.
This was also provided for in Russian policy.
What did we ultimately see?
That, in the time between the two wars over Chechnya, nothing was achieved in the way of forming a state.
A failed state emerged, which is a disaster.
We have seen this everywhere where the situation is similar. We have seen this in former Afghanistan and in Somalia, where this is still a live issue.
We have also identified this in other parts of the world.
A failed state is a disaster for all citizens and for the international community, for what can happen in such a failed state always has international repercussions.
We therefore watched - and this was also observed by our Western journalists - Chechnya degenerate into a kidnapping state, a robber state, a smuggler state revolving around the oil which runs through it.
This is a disaster which we are facing.
Then a war breaks out. One of a kind which we would never ever want to see, neither from the Chechen point of view nor from the Russian point of view.
So a war ensues in which it is even difficult to distinguish citizens from the military and which therefore claims many civilian victims.
The battle surrounding Chechnya has elements of a freedom struggle, but these are terribly overshadowed by radicalisation and imbued with criminal activity.
We are now also informed of Russian troops and Chechen rebels together earning a handsome figure from oil which is transported through the region illegally.
These are very ironic facts which we are facing and it is not easy to say: this is black and this is white.
It is not like that in this case.
I have to admit that I am pleased that, at the time, I was able to hold extensive talks with colleagues of the Duma, namely the chairman of the committee responsible for Chechnya, the chairman of the Human Rights Committee and the spokesperson of the army, General Manilov.
They were all very honest with me about the concern which all of this has caused them.
And they never disguised anything, which shows me that Moscow, too, takes this matter very seriously but fails to find the answer.
All the more reason why we should intervene on the strength of our partnership with Russia.
Human rights are in our line of business. They will never be able to disappear from our agenda, and certainly not if they involve a close partner, as Russia currently is.
We should make it our concern.
This is why our resolution is full of questions.
It is indeed easy and exciting only to address Russia with accusations, but we also have a great many questions.
We also have a number of proposals, and these are all aimed at reconstruction, humanitarian aid, better reception of refugees from those regions, options to return home and the development of the social conditions under which it is possible to return home.
This is also self-evident, even to the politicians in Moscow with responsibility for the situation.
During talks with them, it is impossible to ignore the feeling that they too are very much struggling with this issue.
And if the situation could be different, they would be in favour of it.
They are also very much convinced that war criminals from their own ranks should be brought to justice.
The difficulty and the uncomfortable fact that we are left with is that this is not done frequently enough, because commanders on the ground tend to protect their own soldiers from jurisdiction.
This is a reprehensible attitude, but we recognise it in different wars, including colonial wars, such as the one which the Netherlands fought in Indonesia after the Second World War.
It was very often the case that, only 20 or 30 years after the event, was it possible in the Netherlands to mention war crimes which our own boys had committed in Indonesia.
I am pleased that, at least in Russia, openness is being achieved more promptly in this matter, which also creates the opportunity for action.
Once again, we read recently that President Putin collects people around him and asks them to moot ideas for a viable policy to inject, where possible, peace and security into Chechnya once again.
Maybe in conjunction with Ingushetia, there are all kinds of plans afoot in Russia to examine to what extent it would be possible to create a reasonably functioning state, for that is something which concerns us all.
There are indeed 200 000 refugees, and it would be of crucial importance - and we have insisted on this in the past - for Commissioner Nielsen, who is, after all, responsible for refugee issues and humanitarian issues, to have a personal input in this.
It is, of course, the case that it would be quite difficult to ask for entry into Chechnya right now.
We, and I personally, have on a couple of occasions asked the ambassador and other Russian representatives here to allow us entry to Chechnya.
Every time, this question is avoided, and this is why I will give my full backing to the proposals, including those made in the Council of Europe, to set up delegations, possibly in combination with members of the Duma who have a sense of responsibility, to go there and to establish for ourselves what is going on.
For only if we really know what the situation is like over there and if the international press, as stated in the resolution, and the Russian press, are allowed entry, will it be possible to make well-informed proposals which make any sense.
Mr President, first of all let me say to the House that when we, as politicians, begin to trade insults on the issue of war in another place, we lose our purpose which is to drive forward the peace, and that must be our ultimate goal.
Mr Dupuis has spoken of atrocities which I find horrifying, because these atrocities are happening to real people; to grandmothers, grandfathers, mothers, daughters, fathers and sons for no reason other than that they are different.
I do not hold to the cosiness of the view that Russia is doing all that it should, or that it is deeply concerned.
After all we were told that, post-September 11, the world had changed, that fundamental human rights would be scrutinised with more vigour than before.
However, in the case of Chechnya, this is clearly not the case.
The rights of the Chechens, of whom 200 000 are living in direct danger and fear, are being ignored by the Russians.
Moreover, I believe, the situation is getting worse rather than better.
It seems that September 11 has been a catalyst for a cosy relationship between Russia and the US, in which the US turns its eye the other way.
I welcome this resolution but we must drive it forward.
Why have our actions lacked punch up until now?
I will tell you why; because there has been a lack of co-ordinated and consistent international approach for fear of offending Mr Putin and allies.
Atrocities grow, they do not diminish.
Conflict goes on for years.
It is an ongoing war that has been almost unnoticed.
Yet we see the denial of human rights, the denial of the right of humanitarian NGOs to operate effectively on the ground.
We need more co-operation with the Russian authorities and the independent media to report the truth to the outside world.
But let us never forget that the fundamental right is to live in peace without fear of persecution.
We need a political resolution, but Russia must be held to account.
Let me finish with this: When war begins, politicians have failed.
When wars continue, humanity loses its purpose.
This war must end.
The peace process is not an option; it is the only way forward.
Mr President, I agree with Mr Cashman.
For eight years the Russian military has been waging war on the civilian population in Chechnya.
This is the reality and we must not close our eyes to it.
That is why I should like to ask you the following question Mr President-in-Office of the Council: in the trilogue did you present and explain the list of measures, which you have just presented to us, to the Russian Foreign Minister, Mr Ivanov, in the same terms in which you have just presented them to us here?
Did you also tell Mr Ivanov about the threats you mentioned of adopting measures against Russia?
Was this really the focal point of the agenda or was it only mentioned in passing.
The fact remains that it has not yet had any effect.
It is my impression that this was not put to the Russian side in the same serious tone that you have just adopted here.
This makes us guilty of these crimes too.
We know that in Chechnya people are being abducted, killed and abused every day.
In addition, we know that Chechens are known as 'blacks' in Russia, a derogatory Russian term denoting that they are second-class citizens.
Remaining silent and looking away when civilians are being hurt and abused on a daily basis damages our credibility in the eyes of the world whenever and wherever we defend human rights.
That is why it is important for us not to believe President Putin's protestations, which bear no relation to reality and which he repeated yesterday in Weimar, that the people need to be protected from bandits and that State rule needs to be re-introduced.
This is completely unrelated to what is really happening on the ground.
We need to ensure that there is international monitoring to report on violations of human rights by the army.
In any case I would support all calls to invite President Putin and Mr Machadov here to Strasbourg in September so that the dialogue can finally begin and the guns can fall silent, and so that we can end the spiral of violence in this region.
(Applause)
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I very much welcome this debate, because since 11 September the need to fight terrorism has been cited as justification for nearly every military intervention.
This is also true of the situation in Chechnya.
A change of thinking is required.
Conflicts and terrorism cannot be resolved by military means.
I was pleased to see in yesterday's debate on the Middle East that this is also the unanimous opinion of this Parliament.
In the case of Chechnya, as in all other crisis areas, the only things that will lead to a solution to the problems are negotiations, a willingness to compromise, confidence-building, the development of civil society and the rule of law, and reconstruction.
The dialogue with Russia about these problems definitely needs to be stepped up.
We should press for the Russian Government to continue and intensify the contacts it began in November with Mr Maskhadov and other Chechens who are ready to talk.
The judicious proposals of a Council of Europe working group, in which members of the Duma are also represented, have got these initiatives for a comprehensive Russian-Chechen dialogue off the ground.
We should support this.
The human rights situation in Chechnya remains critical.
I welcome the fact that Parliament has drawn attention to these points in its compromise motion.
In my view, we should criticise the sluggish progress being made on prosecuting perpetrators of human rights offences and sentencing those who are found guilty of such crimes, despite the fact that President Putin claimed otherwise yesterday.
It is positive, however, that the Russian Government has taken the first steps towards rebuilding the country and restoring normality to everyday life.
I would refer in particular to the efforts that they have made to build up the civil administration, the judicial system and the local police force.
I do not think that it is fair for us to call into question or reject everything that the Russian side says a priori.
We need to trust both sides.
Because the only basis for being able to talk to each other at all is mutual trust.
The Commission should support this development by providing more funds.
To get an idea of what is needed we should finally implement our own decision of the year 2000 and send an ad hoc delegation to Chechnya.
Mr President, previous speakers have referred to the parallelism between Chechnya and Palestine.
Today in Madrid the Spanish Prime Minister and the Russian Foreign Minister are meeting to tackle the most dangerous conflict of our time.
Two days ago Mr Aznar told Mr Sharon that the Palestinian conflict could only be solved by political means under the premises of the mutual recognition of the States of Palestine and Israel.
Mr Aznar should firmly protest to Mr Ivanov about the violation in Chechnya of the basic principles of international law, including the right to self-determination of the Chechen people.
Unfortunately, he will not dare to do so because he knows that the Russian response would be to remind him, as Mr Putin did, of the ongoing conflict in the Basque country.
Yesterday Mr Solana, backed by the President-in-Office, proposed a very reasonable solution to the Palestinian conflict; this would be an excellent solution for Chechnya, why not for the Basque country too?
Mr President, while Chancellor SchrÃ¶der and President Putin sit down together today in Weimar and do business as though there were nothing wrong, a secret genocide is taking place in Chechnya.
I use the word genocide advisedly because this is precisely what has been happening in Chechnya in recent years: a fifth of the population has been driven out of the country, tens of thousands have been systematically murdered, and there is no end to the killing!
These are not isolated violations of human rights or one-off attacks.
They are systematic.
It began with one of the bloodiest, if not the very bloodiest election campaign in the history of mankind, the election campaign which President Putin was fighting when he unleashed this war in Chechnya.
At that time his purpose was not to fight terrorism.
It was to sweep away a democratic, though - as it is quite clear in this region - extremely unsatisfactory, regime which had been elected under the supervision of the OSCE, and to appoint his own governors.
I find it rather grotesque that we should now be asking these same governors to investigate their own misdemeanours.
It has to be our task to make this issue an international concern and finally to expose it to the glare of world publicity.
That is why I am grateful to Hans-Gert Poettering and all those who overcame considerable resistance to enable this Parliament today to devote peak debating time to these really dreadful violations of international law and human rights and to this genocide, and finally to make it clear that it is not acceptable for a high-level EU delegation to travel to the Middle East and try to reach Mr Arafat while at the same time saying that they cannot travel to Chechnya because it is not possible or because permission would not be granted.
We cannot let a partner country like Russia get away with systematically isolating an area like this where such brutal violations of human rights are taking place, with closing it to journalists, to observers and to humanitarian organisations.
We must not stand for this any longer.
That is why I also agree that the Commissioner must go there, the troika must go there and the parliamentary delegation must go there.
We are all prepared to support this proposal.
I have to say quite clearly that we must also take the opportunity in September to discuss the situation in Chechnya with the Council of Europe and the elected head of the Chechen Government - of whom the motion unfortunately makes no mention - and to work towards a political solution.
We have to remember one thing: courageous journalists, such as Thomas Avenarius of the SÃŒddeutsche Zeitung, or his colleague from the Frankfurter Rundschau, have risked their lives to fight their way into the country.
Around 4 March alone, they personally documented five systematic acts of terrorism involving numerous murders in five places in Chechnya.
It is Russian human rights activists, such as those from the organisation Memorial, who have risked their lives to go there and document the existence of death squads, set up by Russia's military secret service in Chechnya.
These are facts which we finally need to take seriously!
We have cases of villages allegedly being cleansed 33 times - and another place 27 times - with around a seventh of the population being killed each time.
Civilians, including pregnant women, were pulled out of minibuses and shot.
This is not a war on terrorism.
Suspected terrorists were shot in their slippers.
I really must make it clear that the public is being systematically fed disinformation if the impression is being given that this is simply a rather overblown war on terrorism, quite apart from the fact that this is not how to fight terrorism, but at best how to produce terrorists, and here I must echo what Olivier Dupuis said, that so far there is not a shred of evidence to show that large-scale Chechen terrorism even exists.
As far as the assassinations in Russia are concerned, even the highly respected Neue ZÃŒricher Zeitung has stated quite clearly that there is not even a scrap of circumstantial evidence to show that it was Chechens who were responsible, and the Neue ZÃŒricher Zeitung thinks that we are dealing here with rather dubious circumstances and quite different people pulling strings.
This also needs to be stated openly in this Parliament: we have a long tradition of issuing many clear statements on Chechnya.
We have put ourselves at the forefront of those who finally wish to ensure that light is shed on this policy of systematically suppressing a people for the sake of oil and other raw materials.
This is a colonial war at the beginning of the twenty-first century and nothing else!
We have every right to oppose this colonial war.
We have a special partnership with Russia.
We are both members of the OSCE.
We are both members of the Council of Europe.
We have the means to take action, but we must finally use them. We must stop sleepwalking and acting as though these were isolated incidents.
The few officers who have already been brought before the courts or charged, such as an officer who raped and murdered a young woman in the year 2000, a colonel, have not yet been sentenced.
This is all propaganda.
No one is investigating these crimes.
We must not stand for this any longer!
We must spell this out to Russia, because it is an important partner which we take seriously.
Mr President, it would appear important not to confuse the situation in Chechnya with the situation that has developed after 11 September.
Clearly, the Russians have a tendency to lump together what is happening on the various chessboards of the world - in Afghanistan, the Middle East, Chechnya and Georgia - as if it were all part of the same phenomenon, which it is not.
The Russians often appear to be the most avid readers of those geopolitical experts who predict conflict between the Islamic and Christian civilisations, some ideological gymnastics being necessary here in respect of the positions they held not so long ago.
In my opinion, we too make mistakes every now and again.
For instance, when the European institutions label the Chechen guerrillas 'bandits' and 'terrorists', it is impossible to imagine being able to hold a dialogue with bandits and terrorists.
Therefore, I would look for a single term to define this section of the fighters, who have strong support from the Chechen people.
Given that the European position overall is much more complex, we need expert observers on the ground to counteract attempts to oversimplify the situation locally.
I therefore wholeheartedly welcome Lord Judd's mission; I wholeheartedly welcome the proposal to set up troikas, or quintuples I should say, with the Russian opposition party and the Working Group on Chechnya, to monitor the situation and investigate the violations of human rights; it would appear appropriate, in addition, to set up an ad hoc delegation for the Northern Caucasus to discuss all the current issues with the Russians and Chechen representatives.
All this is very positive: it means that we will, at least, be present.
In essence, the resolution we are discussing today calls, for the most part, upon the Russians to help the victims, to accept the setting-up of monitoring committees and groups and to assist and cooperate with those who work for humanitarian organisations and need permits, visas and protection in order to be able to do their jobs.
In hoping for the return of 200 000 refugees, Parliament is, of course, doing no more than just expressing a nice idea.
It all depends, then, on goodwill, on the willingness of the Putin Government to accept what are essentially implicit criticisms of the current situation in Chechnya - for otherwise it would not be necessary to send so many delegations.
We will be able to measure the extent to which Russia intends to establish good working relations with the European Union from its willingness to accept these invitations.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we will not be able to say that we did not know about the tragedy unfolding in Chechnya.
We are receiving cursory reports from the second war waged by Russian federal forces in Chechnya, based on the terrified accounts given by refugees and reports by the last journalists who were on the ground, that systematic violence and heightened and vengeful acts of barbarism are being committed.
Once again, we will not be able to say that we could not help.
Russia is no longer an autarchic state, conducting its affairs behind closed doors and determining which Russians have a right to live or die.
Russia is linked to the European Union and, consequently, to other parts of the world, through moral and political undertakings, on which its credibility and reputation on the European and international stage depend.
One of these undertakings is the European Union's common strategy on Russia and the cooperation and partnership agreement compelling Russia to respect human rights.
Russia is supported in its difficult transition towards achieving Western economic standards by means of programmes, partnerships and funding, in which the Union plays a key role.
The enlargement of the Union will mean that Russia will soon find itself in a new geo-political situation which will force it to completely renegotiate its status and relations with its new European neighbours.
This time, we must condemn this state of lawlessness and send observers and representatives from the foreign media to find out what is really happening in this tragic, barbaric situation, or impose genuine retaliatory measures if attempts to do this are blocked.
We must demand that medical and humanitarian assistance be sent, as a matter of extreme urgency and, above all, we must stop using statements to hide our lack of action and stop soothing our conscience by claiming that we are preserving fragile democracy in Russia.
We must avoid any simplistic equation between the fight against terrorism and deliberate genocide. As long as we remain indifferent, the barbaric situation in Chechnya can only deteriorate further.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council has taken good note of everything that has been said in this debate and thanks Parliament for raising this very important issue, which is important not only from the point of view of our general international policy, but, above all, of the policy of our European family, since we consider Russia to be a country that belongs in our area and we want it to show the same behaviour, the same respect for the Rule of Law and the same respect for human rights as we do in Europe.
I would like to say that all the views expressed here are largely shared by the Presidency and the Council, who view the Chechen situation with concern.
I fully agree with the view that what happened on 11 September must not encourage anyone, especially Russia, to systematically violate human rights in the name of the fight against terrorism.
It is true that there are violations of human rights, very serious ones, but the Council believes that there are positive developments.
I therefore believe that we have to continue with our efforts: Parliament must make its voice heard and approve this Resolution - which I personally believe to be excellent - and the Council must continue to take every opportunity to communicate our position to the Russian authorities - the positions of the Council, the European Union, and the European Parliament.
I would like to reassure Mrs Schroedter, who has asked whether in our meetings with the top leaders of the Russian Federation, from Putin and the Foreign Minister to the Deputy Ministers and other high representatives, the Council really says what it is saying now.
I can tell you that the Council says the same things to the Russian authorities that it is saying here today.
I would not dare to come to Parliament and say something that we are not capable of saying to the authorities of the Russian Federation.
I can assure you completely that, during this Presidency and the Presidencies to come, we will continue to say the same things we have always said to the Russian authorities.
It is clear that we all have to continue with this effort. It is reassuring that the European Parliament support us in it and we believe that the fight to re-establish normality in Chechnya, to establish fully-democratic conditions, respect for human rights, the return of refugees and a return to normal life are objectives that we can and must aspire to.
I can guarantee, Mr President, that the Council will spare no effort, together with the Commission and with the support of the European Parliament, to achieve this objective.
Mr President, let me again stress that we are present in the region.
We are present in Chechnya; and the level of humanitarian aid funded by the Commission of EUR 40million in 2001 is clear evidence of the priority that we give to this crisis and to the suffering in Chechnya.
Our field experts and ECHO staff are evidence of our presence there.
We are also the only agent from the outside that has established an independent distribution system for food and assistance inside Chechnya.
The Danish Refugee Council is the only alternative to the Russian EMERCOM Ministry, which insists on doing this itself.
For instance, World Food Programme assistance is provided through the Russian organisation.
We are insisting on continuing to have an independent channel of distribution in order to ensure that we perform better than has been claimed in this debate.
I cannot accept the figure of only 3% actually reaching the right people. If this were true, the 200 000 refugees in Ingushetia would no longer be alive.
We are able to make a difference, but we are not in any way trying to portray this as an easy or flawless operation.
It is extremely difficult and that is one of the reasons why we have to continue putting pressure on the Russian authorities, both on the safety aspects of access to VHF radios and the work permits and general conditions for the international humanitarian organisations working in the area.
The first mission I went on after taking office was the humanitarian mission to East Timor in the autumn of 1999, the second one was to the region we are talking about today.
I am grateful for the advice that it may be useful for me to go there once again, and we will consider that.
The effort of the Commission, the funding and the resolute support to our implementing partners is the only real effort to secure an international humanitarian presence in this theatre.
We are determined to continue this work and there is no weakening whatsoever of that determination.
It may also be useful to say, in view of what has been said in this debate, that I find it both necessary and clearly meaningful to maintain the established division between, on the one hand, the broader political dialogue - a dialogue also accentuating the human rights aspects - and the clearly defined humanitarian aid effort.
That division of labour as to who does what and how it is carried out is both necessary and meaningful.
If we mix all this up into one single cocktail, we will get carried away for good, sympathetic, political reasons, but we would actually endanger the access of international humanitarian organisations into this troubled arena.
Humanitarian aid has its own rationale and it is important to recognise that if we allow ourselves to politicise the whole thing, we are doing humanitarian aid no favours.
This is important to keep in mind, and I beg Parliament to understand that it in no way indicates any weakening of the purpose and strength of our political dialogue with Russia on the political aspects of all this.
But we have to put on a credible performance as a serious funder of humanitarian aid.
I have noted the many good pieces of advice given in the debate, and that will provide important input for our further deliberations.
Thank you, Commissioner.
Yes, Mr Dupuis, why are you requesting the floor?
Mr President, again on the humanitarian issue, I have the following question to put to Commissioner Nielson: is he willing to walk 20 meters - yes, 20 meters - to meet the Chechen Minister for Health, who is sitting in the public gallery of the Chamber?
To conclude the debate, I have received five motions for resolutions
The next item is the report (A5-0087/2002) by Mr Esteve, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the Commission communication to the Council and the European Parliament on the preparation of the Euro-Mediterranean Foreign Ministers' meeting in Valencia on 22 and 23 April 2002.
Mr President, I would firstly like to thank all the groups for their attitude - something which I said in committee - which has been constant throughout the preparation of this sitting.
I must also acknowledge the cooperation and dialogue we have maintained with the Commission and the Council, which reflects the unanimous approval of this report by the 49 Members who were present in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy.
I will now comment on the amendments.
Firstly, Mrs Boudjenah tabled seven amendments, of which I am aware that Nos 4, 6, 7 and 8 have been withdrawn and Nos 3, 5 and 9 are maintained.
I would say to Mrs Boudjenah firstly that I believe that Amendment No 5, on the harmonisation legislation on immigration, is fully justified in paragraphs 45 and 46 and that the issue of foreign debt is appropriately dealt with in paragraph 29.
I would therefore remain opposed to these amendments.
However, I believe that Amendment No 3 on public services is positive and improves the report.
Therefore I am in favour of it, although I would propose that in the vote we do not accept the place suggested by Mrs Boudjenah, but rather paragraph 26(ii) as the appropriate place.
I believe that Amendment No 2 by Mrs Napoletano is a very positive contribution, since the Euroscola programme is a programme for young people which works and therefore I am in favour of it.
With regard to Amendment No 1, which I tabled as rapporteur, I believe that everybody would agree that to include the Security Council Resolutions in the recitals of the report makes great sense.
I am obviously referring to Resolutions 1397 and 1402.
Finally, Amendment No 10 by Mrs Napoletano on the Euro-Mediterranean Bank is the one that I feel requires most comment.
I believe - and in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy we believe this - that the current wording expressed firm support for the creation of the bank.
Now, the Barcelona European Council established certain positions and measures which, although they do not move in this direction, neither are they contradictory with the possibility that in one year we could establish the bank.
I therefore sincerely believe that the Group of the European Socialist Party has made an effort to achieve consensus which could be valid for the debate in various groups - in my own - and that the amendment it proposes is a positive summary of the situation, since we could maintain a consensus on supporting the bank and advocate that the Commission present a new proposal which, of course, should be debated in depth in this House.
I am therefore in favour of Amendment No 10.
Mr President, I also propose the reordering of four paragraphs.
Specifically, I believe that paragraphs 31, 32, 33 and 34 would express their ideas in a more organised fashion if they took the order 33, 32, 34 and 31.
I also believe that paragraph 52, which clearly belongs in the economic chapter, must be included in it and not it in the chapter it is in currently.
I think that it should come after paragraph 22.
In conclusion, I believe that the important elements of this report, without going into detail, are two issues: the first is that the report will help and guide the Valencia Conference as a priority within Euro-Mediterranean policy and in terms of efficiency.
I believe that this is the case, and therefore I hope the vote reflects this, in relation to the part that corresponds to us.
Secondly, I am thinking of the grave situation in the Middle East, of the debate we held yesterday, of today's tragic news from Haifa, of the meeting being held today in Madrid, which we hope will lead to a joint position.
Bearing all this in mind, I believe we can state that the Barcelona Process demands positive action in favour of general peace and stability in the region and in the Middle East.
Allow me to remind you that, if the meeting in Valencia takes place as expected, it will be the only forum that the Israeli and Palestinian delegations can attend.
I sincerely believe that, as the European Union, our instrument of the Barcelona Process is, if not the most important, probably one of the most important instruments for dialogue and cooperation.
It is also a process within our reach, because it is our responsibility.
I believe that it must continue to carry out its task, and do so genuinely.
We hope that that will be the case and I therefore thank you, Mr President, for the way this report has been drawn up and negotiated.
Mr President, Mr Esteve has indeed prepared an excellent report.
I have taken the unusual step of asking for the floor following the presentation of this report by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, because the Presidency would like to state publicly how grateful it is to the committee and in particular to the rapporteur.
This report was prepared in the run up to the Valencia Ministerial meeting on Euro-Mediterranean dialogue. It was drafted against the background of the very difficult situation we find ourselves in, and at a critical stage of the Euro-Mediterranean dialogue.

As Mr Esteve himself stated, it is the only issue on which all those in the Mediterranean area agree. It may represent the only remaining window of opportunity for Arab and Israeli delegations to engage in productive dialogue along with European delegations.
We therefore believe that the report provides the necessary political support from Parliament to encourage the Spanish Presidency not only to go ahead with the event despite the circumstances, but also to give a special impetus to this Euro-Mediterranean dialogue. The Presidency can now further boost the process launched, significantly, in Barcelona in 1995.
I believe it is highly symbolic that a Member representing Catalonia in this House should today remind us of the Barcelona spirit. We are hoping to revive that 1995 spirit today and in the near future.
To be precise, we would like to see it revived on 22 and 23 April in Valencia. In my view, the involvement of the Committee on Foreign Affairs is absolutely vital and provides the political backing the Presidency needs in these difficult times.
I would therefore like to put on record the Council's appreciation and thanks for the work undertaken by the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the rapporteur, Mr Esteve.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, first of all, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, I would like to thank you for your praise of the committee's work just now and, of course, to applaud Mr Esteve for pointing out that this report was unanimously adopted and that it is the first time this has happened in our committee's history.
I would also like to support the proposals that Mr Esteve, our rapporteur, has just made regarding the amendments, and to tell you why there is unanimity. In my view, it was due to the quality of the work, but also to the realisation, since 11 September, that the European Union must not be content to sit back and watch, from afar, what is happening on the other side of the Mediterranean.
This unanimity is also the result of the realisation that it is in the EU's interest to help the African continent to escape from the chaos and poverty that makes it a breeding ground for some of the recruits to Islamic fundamentalism. We have furthermore become aware that it is now impossible for Europe to enclose itself in a fortress, which is certain to be attacked, as all fortresses are - and which has, in fact, already started to be attacked with the growing phenomenon of illegal immigration.
Consequently, there is also a need, as you have said, to relaunch the Barcelona Process.
I was appointed rapporteur by my fellow Members of a joint resolution for the Euro-Mediterranean Forum, held on 6 November in Brussels, and I could see that the cooperation which had developed between our Palestinian and Israeli colleagues within the drafting committee could serve as an extremely valuable symbol of hope, despite the tragedy that is unfolding in Palestine today.
Therefore, I too firmly support the conclusions of the report which call for the talks that were launched by the Barcelona Process to be recommenced. These talks were intended to lead not only to joint economic and political efforts but also to intercultural and even inter-faith cooperation.
I hope that they will also bring restoration, throughout the Mediterranean region, of this dimension of understanding and mutual respect which, once the difficult phase of decolonisation has been completed and the wounds accompanying this stage have begun to heal, must restore to the Mediterranean that sense of Mare Nostrum, that sense that we have of sharing with our colleagues values which are the basis of our civilisation.
I therefore believe that it is not only the duty, but it is also in the interest of Europe, currently the leading global economic power, to help establish privileged partnerships with our Euro-Mediterranean partners.
It is on this basis that we shall continue our work within the framework of the own-initiative reports on the union of the North African Arab countries which will be submitted to the House at the May part-session.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I feel that today's debate is appropriate for it places the debate we held yesterday in a more general context: the Middle East, the Mediterranean, Europe.
I would like to thank the rapporteur for his acceptance of contributions from all the groups to this report, which I believe will be a genuinely useful contribution to the Valencia meeting, and because he has used and accorded due importance to the contributions of all the political groups.
I would also like to thank the Commission for presenting an effective communication containing innovative proposals, which Parliament wishes to strengthen and promote through the Esteve report.
In this regard, I would like to emphasise three points.
Firstly, the Mediterranean is now the Union's strategic priority. After enlargement, that is our political priority.
We must therefore be consistent as regards both our policies and our resources.
Secondly, we need to explode this myth that the partnership primarily concerns the free market.
We need to make this partnership a major policy that includes the economic, social and cultural aspects and the questions of training and the parliamentary institutions.
We want to enrich this partnership much more than it has been in the past.
Thirdly, we need a human rights policy.
We cannot oscillate between Realpolitik and threatening to suspend the agreements; there must be commitment from all the institutions, particularly the Commission, to promoting human rights in the countries of the Mediterranean region.
We are concerned - myself, in particular - because the more power the Commission gives to its offices in the Mediterranean countries, the more important it will be that it is efficient and capable of resisting pressure from those regimes.
Otherwise, we will be throwing our money away.
Lastly, I have to say that we would like to strengthen the institutional dimension of this partnership, giving the Parliamentary Assembly a leading role, involving ourselves in the initiative too and strengthening the two institutions proposed by the Commission, namely the Bank and the Foundation.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of my group, I would like to pledge our total support for the Commission communication and the implicit decisions to reinvigorate the Euro-Mediterranean policy.
As has already been said, after eastward enlargement, this is becoming an absolute, essential priority, a duty we cannot shirk.
To all the reasons for this which have existed thus far must be added the tragic war and terrorism in Israel and Palestine.
We are currently faced with the proof, with constant confirmation of the fact that, if Europe does not become more involved and establish policies addressing the root causes of the region's instability and lack of development, well then, we will be unable to prevent either real or potential conflict or its uncontrollable consequences such as illegal immigration.
I therefore look forward to a more effective European Union policy on the Mediterranean; I welcome the idea of exporting the method of European integration, starting with the promotion of a genuine area of free trade facilitating as much south-south trade as possible, even above north-south trade.
The plan for funding this process, through specialised sections of the EIB now and a Euro-Mediterranean Development Bank in the future, must be welcomed with open arms.
However, where the Mediterranean is concerned - and I would stress once again, the Israeli-Palestinian crisis is evidence of this - we need to go deeper.
This means concentrating now on recreating the necessary conditions and developing the dialogue between cultures and religions, a dialogue facilitating that mutual awareness and understanding which - we must realise - is no longer sufficient to avoid conflict between the Western and Islamic worlds, between Europe and the other Mediterranean cultures and between the Mediterranean cultures themselves.
Good intentions or occasional interventions are not enough to achieve this: we need ongoing work with a lasting impact.
That is why I feel I must support and call strongly for the immediate initiation of the work of the Euro-Mediterranean Foundation mentioned in the Commission communication.
The Mediterranean is steeped in history and full of symbolic places in which the intercultural and interfaith dialogue has developed over the centuries.
I come from a city, Venice, which has a tradition in that area, and I am sure that, if the Foundation taps into all these energy sources, the many energy sources present in the Mediterranean, the many tales and experiences of cooperation and understanding, we will certainly be able to address the root of the matter.
We tend to see the cultural element as an optional extra in our programmes, as something which is second to politics and the economy, but in this case it must be given pride of place for it is the very foundation stone which will make it possible for politics and the economy to play their role too.
Mr President, the conflict in the Middle East is today sending shock waves through all the countries of the Mediterranean.
This subject will certainly be at the centre of the discussions in Valencia.
Sympathy for the colonised Palestinian people, which is felt well beyond Arab societies, is increasing in these countries in particular, due to the endless cultural, social and political humiliations and frustrations that the people suffer and for which they hold Arab and Western leaders jointly responsible.
That is why the desire for a dignified life where they and the law are respected is leading the people of these countries increasingly to take the dangerous path of anti-Western nationalism, be it Arab or religious.
This development, which is heightened by the international community's inability to put an end to the massacre and restore respect for law in the Middle East, is detrimental to the cultural and civil dialogue called for by the Barcelona Process. It also demonstrates the urgent and important need for this dialogue.
In fact, the only thing the Barcelona Process can do - the challenge before it - is to provide the support it has hitherto failed to provide for democratisation in the countries of the Mediterranean.
If we do not suspend the Association Agreement with Israel, then not only will the Israeli tanks have crushed the territories, they will have also crushed Article 2 of this Agreement, as well as Article 2 of all the Association Agreements.
What would we be able to say in response to the constitutional coup d'Ã©tat of Ben Ali in Tunisia?
How would we be able to respond to the aspirations of Algerian society, which has been taken hostage by two camps that are both enemies of democracy?
The notion that economic development necessarily leads to democracy is absolute nonsense.
The aim of sustainable development, namely ecological development and development of solidarity, in the Mediterranean, cannot be reduced to the concept of the free-trade area.
Do we have any idea as to the consequences for employment, public services, and people's lives, the consequences of the measures to liberalise this trade?
From this perspective, democracy is certainly a condition for development.
The requirement for democracy is not only a necessity, which some people describe as neo-colonial, it is, in fact, a fundamental element of the relations that we must establish in this region.
Mr President, I should begin by saying how much I appreciate the excellent work done by Mr Esteve on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy and how grateful I am for it.
Mr Esteve has presented a well-balanced document which is certainly positive whilst also taking account of all the suggestions made by the various groups
It is indeed vital for the European Union to give due consideration to the future role of the Euro-Mediterranean area as regards peace, economic development, democracy, energy provision and economic investment.
This report and the meeting to be held in Valencia to deal with these matters are therefore crucial.
It is nonetheless worth mentioning a number of issues giving rise to concern.
Firstly, as has already been stated, we have to come up with a decisive response to the situation in the Middle East. I refer to the military invasion of Palestine, and would point out that there has been no military incursion into Israel by the Palestinians.
If we fail to come up with such a response, I fear this conflict will dash all the hopes vested in European Union development in the area and put an end to it.
We should also keep Western Sahara in mind. That conflict is only simmering at present, but could boil over at any moment.
As we have always maintained, it is essential to recognise the decisions taken by the Security Council of the United Nations and hold the referendum on self-determination.
It might then be possible to defuse a possible conflict in line with the conflict prevention strategy advocated by the European Union.
As has already been stated, it is important to make it quite clear that respect for democracy and human rights must be re-established in several countries in the area. The future of the region as a whole is being compromised.
Another worrying issue concerns the paradoxical situation whereby if investment in the area is made without preserving the necessary balance, undesirable consequences ensue. Unemployment increases unexpectedly and peasants flock to the cities.
They then fail to find work.
This in turn boosts emigration, illegal or otherwise.
We ought therefore to take these important issues into account.
I believe that the suggestion of setting up an Association Agreement for this area, along the lines of the one for the European Union, and allowing us to be involved is helpful. It should however be worked on more energetically and with a greater degree of urgency.
I therefore also recognise the importance of the latest proposal by the Parliamentary Assembly, crucial to the development of the region.
Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to endorse what the honourable Members who congratulated Mr Esteve on this report said. I refer of course to the way in which the report was drafted.
As already stated it received the unanimous support of the committee. The content is outstanding too, and represents an improvement on the splendid proposal previously presented by the Commission.
I should like to focus on an aspect I believe to be of fundamental importance, namely political dialogue.
The relationships enshrined in the Barcelona Process can only flourish on the basis of political dialogue and political will. Both the Member States and our Mediterranean partners need to be involved.
Clearly, the rapporteur has put forward positive proposals in his report. Clearly too, Parliament can and must play a key role where political dialogue and political will are concerned, to give credibility to our plan for integration.
We therefore very much welcome the initiative to set up a Euro-Mediterranean Assembly.
It is also clear that this revived dialogue requires a broader agenda providing for a whole series of issues to be taken into account. I have in mind challenges to governance, conflict prevention and important issues relating to democratisation and the defence of human rights.
In our view, the war on terrorism also has a significant bearing on this political dialogue.
Furthermore, this is clearly not the only approach.
We are proposing a financial and economic partnership extending beyond commercial matters. It should also take account of the opportunities for mobilising an ever-increasing flow of foreign investment.
In addition it should promote integration processes within the Mediterranean partner countries and strengthen our dialogue in the field of economic policy. In this connection, we believe that the proposal to set up a Euro-Mediterranean Bank could promote the dialogue and economic and financial partnership we are advocating.
Clearly also, priority should be given to setting up intercultural dialogue and establishing a genuine Euro-Mediterranean partnership in the social, cultural and human fields.
In conclusion, I should like to say a few words on the issue of financing. This is a key element insofar as there is a need for better recognition of the commitments made by the European Union and improved and more effective management of the MEDA programme funds.
This does obviously involve a greater capacity for absorption on the part of our Euro-Mediterranean partners and the decentralisation of those programmes.
Mr President, in my estimation the Euro-Mediterranean dialogue will prove a vital asset in overcoming the conflict in the Middle East.
I am also convinced that in life, in politics, in science and in society, it is important to have more than a superficial acquaintance with other people. Rather, we should strive to have a true understanding of those who are seeking the same truth, harmony and solidarity as we are, though they might be travelling along a different road.
Mr President, I should like to begin by saying how delighted I am that Parliament has reached a consensus on Euro-Mediterranean policy. It has done so by unanimously endorsing the policy summarised clearly and positively in Mr Esteve's report.
At the same time, I am bound to say not just how disappointed but bitter I feel. I imagine there must by now be broad agreement that this Euro-Mediterranean process is like a game of snakes and ladders in which we have just gone down a very long snake and lost all the ground gained.
As regards the economic and social aspects, there is a clear tendency to estrangement and breakdown of the relationship between the European Union and our Mediterranean partners. There is shared responsibility here, but also purely European responsibility.
Above all, however, it is in the political sphere that the situation arising as a result of the dreadful events in the Middle East means at least that Euro-Mediterranean relations are exceedingly delicate, if not that the whole process is in danger.
I should like to take this opportunity to say that the Valencia Ministers' meeting will undoubtedly prove a valuable opportunity to bring Israeli and Palestinian representatives together round a table. Nonetheless, attendance by the Palestinian Authority must be a condition sine qua non for the meeting to be held.
It should be remembered that President Arafat himself was present at the previous meeting. The European Union could never be party to the mockery of bringing together Euro-Mediterranean countries whilst the Palestinian Authority's seat remained empty.
Mr President, Commissioner, I must first congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Esteve, on his wide-ranging and detailed report, which covers each and every one of the concerns and uncertainties regarding Euro-Mediterranean cooperation.
Re-launching the Barcelona Process is more necessary than ever in the interests of peace and stability. This should involve strengthening Euro-Mediterranean dialogue.
We need to tackle crucial issues such as the need to promote democratic values and fundamental rights, so flagrantly disregarded in the conflict in the Middle East. Other factors to be considered include the terrorist threat and matters relating to economic cooperation, the environmental aspects of development, emigration and drug trafficking.
I shall focus on just a few areas in the short time available to me. Setting up a free trade area might seem the obvious way of stimulating the economy and ensuring that the people of the southern shores of the Mediterranean are not dying of starvation whilst on its northern shores we are being killed by cholesterol.
It is important to ensure however that such a free trade area does not become a time bomb that would destroy all the efforts made by countries in southern Europe to achieve genuine convergence and genuine cohesion, something they do not yet enjoy.
The far-reaching changes anticipated within the European Union should be taken into account when establishing a free trade area. I refer to the reform of the common agricultural policy and to enlargement.
Trade in agricultural products is both necessary and useful, but caution is called for.
It is important to promote political dialogue amongst our Mediterranean partners, in addition to dialogue between them and the Union.
It does not seem logical to strengthen the Association Agreement without strengthening the South-South dialogue. Closed border situations in diplomatic relations cannot continue.
International agreements must be complied with for the coastal nations to be in a credible position in relation to the Union. This is certainly true of the potentially explosive situation in the Western Sahara.
Further, the need to combat terrorism should not be used as a weapon or an excuse for doing away with a political opponent or an enemy. Yasser Arafat has to be present as a recognised interlocutor if peace is to be achieved.
Following the attacks on 11 September, dialogue and mutual understanding have become essential. Those attacks resulted in a deep divide between the two cultures.
This has to be bridged. Cultural and social exchanges must therefore be encouraged, through the promotion of mutual information by means of shared means of communication such as Euro-Mediterranean television.
In conclusion, the important role the regions in southern Europe are already playing and will continue to play with regard to Euro-Mediterranean cooperation should not be overlooked.
Mr President, I would firstly like to extend my heartfelt thanks to Mr Esteve for his opening remarks explaining the amendments. I shall, of course, take note of these.
It is impossible to give thought to Euro-Mediterranean relations without contemplating concerted action to bring an end to the war in the Middle East, at a time when Israeli tanks are crushing the Palestinian population and Shimon PÃ©res himself is speaking of massacre.
Sharon's aggressive, murderous and colonial policy is leading not only the Palestinian people, but also all the people of the region - and that includes the Israeli people - towards a bloody and violent dead end.
We must condemn the crimes and the destruction of infrastructure financed by the European Union. We must call for urgent aid to be sent to the civilian population and for an international protection force to be dispatched to the region.
Since Mr Solana and Mr Patten claim - as they did yesterday in this very House - that acceptable boundaries have been crossed, the European Union must therefore take swift and objective action.
It has the resources that are needed.
It can decide to suspend the partnership agreement with Israel.
The bombings and killings must stop.
The settlements must be dismantled. Israel must respect the United Nations' resolutions.
These are all matters of extreme urgency. If the summit in Valencia can assist in achieving this, so much the better, but it would be totally unrealistic to think that everyone is willing to come around the table in a few days' time - even if the Palestinian leader were able to leave the territories - if the European Union has not adopted a clear position.
The Mediterranean region is in need of peace so that it can contemplate its future.
Another conflict is also placing strain on this partnership, and on relations with North Africa, in particular, and that is the conflict in the Western Sahara.
The good relations that the European Union enjoys with Morocco should be used to break the deadlock in this situation and to apply the United Nations' peace plan which provides for the self-determination of the Western Saharan people.
The situation that has come about since 11 September means that everyone, on both sides of the Mediterranean, must avoid any religion-terrorism equation and must work together to eradicate terrorism from its breeding grounds, which can only encourage the most violent forms of fundamentalism and nationalism.
At this point, I would like to mention the growing poverty, the pillaging of natural resources and the attempts to curtail and sell off national industries.
I am in favour, as Mr Esteve states in his report, of encouraging a dialogue amongst equals, which meets social needs by adopting measures to combat unemployment or which promotes trade between countries of the south. I continue to believe, however, that the path towards shared prosperity has been blocked, for the time being, by agreements which are guided by solely economic and financial interests, thus denying the needs of the people who are already suffering from the burden of debt, the drop in the price of raw materials and the austerity imposed by structural adjustments.
How can we continue along the path of unbridled liberalisation, which is failing everywhere, without taking stock of previous agreements and ignoring the concerns that are growing in all parts, including the Mediterranean countries?
Although one of the major objectives of the partnership is to improve the economic and social situation of our partner countries, it is now necessary, in addition to this, to satisfy basic and fundamental requirements in terms of health and education.
Unemployment figures, for example, or jobs that are directly threatened due to the abolition of customs barriers - namely, 500 000 in Algeria - illustrate how far off-target we are and would even tend to illustrate that other options must be explored, such as that of cooperation between public services.
Is it not also a good idea to take a bolder approach, for example, by establishing a Euro-Mediterranean development and cooperation fund, which would enable the people to define and monitor local projects?
Lastly, the free movement of individuals should be the condition for an equal and fair partnership.
We wish to establish harmonisation in the area of immigration and asylum, but only if this contributes to the development of the country of origin and ensures that migrants, on our soil, enjoy dignified and fair treatment which observes human rights and is based on equal rights.
Mr President, the Valencia Summit is most likely to be remembered just for having been held.
Obviously, as both the rapporteur and the Commission stated, the Barcelona Process must not be confused with the Middle East peace process.
It is also obvious however that there can be no Barcelona Process without peace in the Middle East.
I should therefore like to congratulate the Spanish Presidency on its efforts to bring about peace.
To my knowledge, the Barcelona declaration is the most strongly worded declaration in existence on this issue. The presence of the President of the Council at the Arab League Summit was a first.
The mission to the Middle East did take place. That was a success in itself.
Further, it succeeded in retaining its dignity. There was no meeting with Mr Arafat, but none with Mr Sharon either.
I should also like to say how pleased I am that the EU-Israel Association Council has been convened, as well as the Madrid meeting.
This process has to guarantee the security and viability of two states, the Palestinian State and the State of Israel.
Having clarified the relationship between the peace process and the Barcelona Process, I have to say that in my view the Commission is being unduly self-congratulatory.
True, progress has been made regarding the Association Agreement, the Agadir Process has been launched and a development process tentatively put in train. As I understand it, however, all this is simply a drop in the ocean.
A single statistic suffices to indicate the gap between what is required and the current situation. The Commission has correctly stated that 45 million new jobs need to be created in the coming decade just to retain the present levels of poverty and unemployment.
If this is not achieved, the growth of fundamentalism will threaten the security of our southern borders, as Mr Morillon and other speakers pointed out. Our internal security will also be compromised, due to the increased flow of illegal immigration.
I therefore believe that Mr Esteve has chosen the points to highlight in his report wisely.
I also believe that if we are to move on from words to action we must set up a Euro-Mediterranean Assembly. This would serve as a spearhead, breathing new life into the process and speeding it up, which is urgently required.
I am glad more speakers from non-Mediterranean countries have taken the floor.
This has not often been the case when we have dealt with these issues in the past. It suggests that the European Union is starting to understand that it needs to look South as well as East if it is to ensure its own survival.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, as a speaker from a non-Mediterranean country - at least a country which no longer qualifies as such - I should also like to extend my warm congratulations to the rapporteur, Mr Esteve, and thank him for liaising with us.
The Barcelona Process is of tremendous significance for peace, stability and prosperity in Europe.
Unfortunately it is suffering as a result of the recent intensification of the conflict in the Middle East.
Nevertheless, we need to continue this process of rapprochement across the Mediterranean.
We even need to reinvigorate the Barcelona Process with the aim of making the Mediterranean a real mare nostrum for all of the countries on its shores.
The forthcoming meeting in Valencia - and I hope that it will be able to take place - should therefore be seen as a starting point for considering the creation of a new permanent and stable structure for cooperation and coordination.
I know that in many cases not even the existing agreements are sufficiently implemented, but it is precisely in the light of recent events - from the attacks of 11 September to the war in the Middle East - that a multilateral organisation embracing the countries and regions on both sides of the Mediterranean is essential.
Clearly the variable records on human rights are still an obstacle to this vision becoming a reality.
In fact, human rights need to be a central component of our dialogue.
We need to convince our neighbours, firmly and persistently, that respect for and enforcement of human rights do not stand in the way of or contradict the fight against terrorism, but are actually prerequisites for a successful war on terror.
However - and I should also like to draw your attention to this - we must not express our opinions self-righteously or arrogantly; we must do so with a willingness to engage in an intensive dialogue.
Finally, it remains to be said that in the light of the huge social problems, to which various colleagues have already referred - above all unemployment among young people - it is going to be necessary to create many new jobs in the region.
To this end we need to fight a joint battle against corruption, nepotism and bureaucracy, but we also need to make it possible for increased investment to be made, in particular in small and medium-sized enterprises.
To do this we also need a Mediterranean Bank, in which the European Investment Bank should, admittedly, for logistical reasons, have a majority holding.
I might mention once more that the delicate political human rights issues on the one hand and the explosive social situation in this region on the other, in particular in the light of high population growth, are a volatile combination, which may affect all of us.
Mr President, this report on the Commission communication to prepare the meeting of Euro-Mediterranean Foreign Ministers in Valencia on 22 and 23 April is about furthering Euro-Mediterranean cooperation, the aim of which, in our view, is to impose the economic and political terms of the European Union on the other countries in the Mediterranean, using economic means and political blackmail.
Of course we have the usual pronouncements about peace and democracy.
Conditions on the ground, however, as experienced in Cyprus, where 37% of the island is still occupied, or by the long-suffering people of Palestine, subject to a criminal all-out attack by Israel, unfortunately not just tolerated, but still being funded and armed by the European Union, are somewhat different.
For example, the adoption of the Euro-Mediterranean charter on peace and stability has been postponed because Euro-Mediterranean cooperation is not being used to serve the peace process in the Middle East, and we have the European Union to blame for that.
There can be no doubt that the Euro-Mediterranean cooperation which we are constantly hearing about is not intended to contribute to the viable development of third Mediterranean countries and the prosperity of their people, let alone democracy and peace in the Mediterranean; its purpose is to promote the interests of the European Union's multinationals.
That is why we shall continue to fight against this policy and for a radically different policy to make the Mediterranean an area of peace, mutual benefit and equitable collaboration and coexistence for its people.
Mr President, I should like to start by congratulating our rapporteur on his detailed and highly topical report.
However as he himself points out, our aim today is not to go over again the strategic targets set by the European Union in Barcelona. No, what we must realise is that the tragedy all around us, with the fight against international terrorism and attempts to establish peace in the Middle East, provide a perfect opportunity for the meeting of ministers in Valencia to demonstrate once and for all that the Member States of the European Union have the political will to put the policies of the Barcelona Process to proper, continuous and efficient use.
And both the nations of Europe and the nations of the Mediterranean need this process if we are to achieve an area of security, prosperity and peace for one and all.
And that is precisely why I feel that our rapporteur's report is so valuable, because it focuses on the need for a deeper process with global policies which have prospects.
At institutional level first, the proposed annual summit of the countries involved in the Barcelona Process and the proposed parliamentary assembly, responsible primarily for monitoring Association Agreements, will provide a far-reaching tool which can last the course.
The involvement of regional and local society and the involvement of civil society and women in all three pillars of the Barcelona Process rather than just the economy, as the European Parliament recently pointed out in one of its resolutions, will put our efforts on a democratic footing, make our plans sustainable and offer protection for human rights, for which there is a dire need in the region as a whole.
Cross-cultural dialogue and a new Mediterranean Research Institute will provide a good basis for the mutual understanding, mutual respect between partners and greater mutual trust needed in order to face up to major challenges such as combating terrorism, managing waves of immigrants and resolving the Arab-Israeli crisis through dialogue.
In addition, the European Parliament must support the proposal to set up a European Investment Bank because, as has already been pointed out, it will not just strengthen the development process in the partner countries, it will also establish financial relations and other forms of cooperation between the partners and the European Union.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the fifth Euro-Mediterranean ministerial meeting will meet in Valencia on 22 and 23 April and will adopt an action plan containing proposals and measures designed to promote Euro-Mediterranean cooperation.
Luckily, the report by Mr Esteve has come along at precisely the right time, just before the ministerial meeting, giving the European Parliament a chance to express its views and, with its proposals and ideas, make a useful contribution to this cooperation, which is proceeding at a snail's pace and has wandered hopelessly far from the spirit and needs which the Barcelona Declaration - and many more meetings and resolutions since - acknowledged and undertook to satisfy in November 1995.
The Esteve report quite rightly gives its unreserved support to the Commission's proposed new action plan under the Barcelona Process, which it has improved and enhanced with practical proposals and suggestions of its own.
There is one issue on which the Esteve report is lacking in my opinion and, unfortunately, it is the key to the success of any initiative concerning the approach to and unanimous cooperation with Europe on the Mediterranean side.
As I am sure you can guess, I am talking about the Arab-Israeli conflict, Mr President, the tragic and dangerous Israeli-Palestinian conflict which is again in the headlines.
Obviously, things had not reached today's tragic proportions when the Esteve report was drafted and the rapporteur has referred diplomatically to the need to settle the conflict in a way which highlights the new cultural, economic, social, political and institutional approach.
But what worries me, although I unreservedly support this new approach by the rapporteur, is that, if the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is not settled this time under arrangements acceptable to both sides, I repeat, arrangements acceptable to both sides, this nightmare will simmer below the surface and keep on obstructing the Euro-Mediterranean cooperation wanted and needed.
The European Union must be proactive and move effectively in this direction, quite apart from any other initiatives which it takes.
Valencia is a unique opportunity and it must not be wasted.
Mr President, Commissioner, I too am proud of the work Mr Esteve and the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy have produced with total consensus.
With this report, Europe has unambiguously defined the two priorities of its foreign policy: a policy concentrating on eastward enlargement and a policy focusing on the Mediterranean area as fundamental in the creation of a future of peace and prosperity.
The Euro-Mediterranean Conference is now the only genuine, existing forum for dialogue between the Arab delegations, the Israeli delegation and the European delegation.
Providing that forum for work and dialogue with tools such as the Euro-Mediterranean Development Bank and the Foundation and pursuing the MEDA programmes will allow us to create and foster an area of south-south and north-south free trade, on the one hand, and an area of dialogue, knowledge, training and communication on the other.
Only thus will the common values of different civilisations be clearly revealed; only thus will understanding of and respect for the cultures, religions and histories of different peoples grow.
Only thus, I feel, will we be able to create a far-reaching area of democracy, economic growth and emergence from poverty, which are essential conditions if we are to promote and uphold the need for an area within which there is a shared policy of respect for the individual and safeguarding of human rights, which is the prerequisite for the success of any peace policy.
Mr President, firstly I would like to congratulate Mr Esteve on his excellent report, as many others have done in this debate.
It clearly shows the importance that Parliament gives to the Mediterranean region.
I noted Mr Swoboda's remark about his being the only non-Mediterranean participant in the debate - there is in fact more than one, but it can be looked upon as a strength of this Parliament that we have such commitment to and identification with an issue like this.
From the outset, let me just reiterate, if need be, the strategic importance of the Mediterranean for the EU.
On the eve of the next enlargement and in the face of the developing political situation this is truer than ever.
After a careful reading I must confess my satisfaction with the convergent approach between this report and the Commission's communication.
More has to be done, but the Commission and Parliament are in broad agreement on the way we understand our political, economic and social relations with our southern neighbours.
Despite the serious political setbacks in the region - the current dramatic situation in the Middle East being one of them - and a certain scepticism at the end of the 1990s as to whether the Barcelona Process constituted the right means to make the Euro-Mediterranean partnership move forward, the process has stood the test of time.
We cannot ignore the implications for the process of the tragic development of the situation in Israel, Gaza and the West Bank.
This is not the occasion today to debate Europe's role in bringing an end to that conflict but the situation as it is, and the continuation of this dreadful violence, stresses even further the need to continue with the development of the Barcelona Process as a means for Europe to make its contribution to the peace, stability and prosperity of the region.
One can always discuss how strong an instrument the Barcelona Process really is, but it is beyond discussion that this process is part of the solution and definitely not part of the problem, so we had better strengthen it.
In substance, substantial progress has been accomplished since 1996.
All Euro-Mediterranean partners are now used to having a permanent dialogue and to working together.
The Barcelona Process is the only place where we can hold a 27-member discussion and, more importantly, where the 12 Mediterranean partners can regularly discuss and meet.
In the present circumstances, this is a meaningful indication of the resilience of the process.
We have also made substantial progress towards introducing a free trade area.
Most of the association agreements are already ratified, signed or initialled.
Intra-regional agreements, such as the Agadir Process, are being negotiated.
Yet, although our Euro-Mediterranean trade relations are progressing steadily in North/South terms, South/South trade is still stagnating at a mere 5% of Mediterranean trade.
Macroeconomic stabilisation has indeed taken place successfully in most Mediterranean countries, but reforms related to the business environment are not progressing at a sufficient pace.
The challenge for the Mediterranean partners is to unleash the full potential of their economic forces, and in this regard the Barcelona Process has become the framework of reference for all international donors to relate to and further pursue.
In the cultural sphere, substantial work has been accomplished.
Some hundreds of regional projects have been financed and have promoted a dense network of human exchanges.
So what is the way ahead?
How can we raise the profile of the partnership?
How can it better be used to guarantee a common area of peace and stability?
Politically, we must pursue and reinforce our support for the Barcelona Process as a tool for promoting understanding and political dialogue.
The road is well-paved, despite some potholes on its way.
A clear example of this dialogue is the senior officials' meeting on terrorism just held on 27 March.
By the same token, the 27 partners have been able to come a long way towards an agreement around a set of priority actions on an issue as sensitive as Justice and Home Affairs.
We hope to reach a final consensus in Valencia.
Based on these priorities the Commission will launch this year a regional programme on judicial cooperation, the fight against terrorism and organised crime, and migration. This success marks a milestone for the partnership and demonstrates its political capabilities and potential.
In particular, as far as migration issues are concerned, several of the requests by Parliament (observatory on migration flows, network of contacts) will be included in the coming regional programme.
At an institutional level, further efforts need to be made in order to promote the "co-ownership" of the Barcelona Process.
A feeling that the EU "imposes its agenda" exists among the southern partners and needs to be alleviated.
In this sense your proposal of launching a Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly is more than welcome.
Economically, signs are encouraging.
The grid of association agreements is almost completed; South/South trade integration progresses, notably in the framework of the Agadir Process - even if not as fast as we would like.
The Meda programme has dramatically improved its delivery - though given the starting point one might say that improvement had to happen - but still, it is happening with a ratio of payments to commitments of 53% in 2001 compared to a mere 26% for the 1995-1999 period.
We are catching up.
Yet the economic situation of the region remains uncertain and demands supplementary efforts from everybody.
I am glad that Parliament supports our proposals to further this process, in particular in areas such as investments, environment, transport, infrastructures and energy.
As you know, the idea of launching a Euro-Mediterranean Bank did not receive the full assent of the Member States at the Barcelona European Council.
Nonetheless, a new European Investment Bank facility will be launched and a representative office of the EIB in the region will be created.
Finally, the social and human aspects of the partnership show today, more than ever, its relevance, creating bridges across the Mediterranean and promoting a better understanding of each other's cultures and societies.
I noted that this aspect was given prominence in many of the contributions in the debate here today.
The Barcelona Process allows a unique and structured framework that allows this social and cultural dialogue at regional level - not only North/South, but also South/South and indeed South/North.
The European Commission has put forward a set of new proposals.
I am happy to see that they are very well taken by Parliament, in particular the Euromed Foundation and the cooperation between universities (the Tempus programme).
As regards the launching of a new Euromed Foundation, the Commission is persuaded that it would contribute to the enhancement of the partnership.
However, some Member States do not seem to be as convinced as we are.
Some efforts of political persuasion will be required in the coming weeks.
The Commission has also proposed the enlargement of the Tempus programme on university cooperation to the Mediterranean.
The approval of this extension will be obtained at the Council of Education Ministers on 30 May.
Moreover, all existing regional programmes in this area (heritage, audiovisual, youth) will be pursued in the near future.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
Mr Esteve, you asked for the floor.
. (ES) Mr President, I asked for the floor just to say that the thanks I expressed earlier for the cooperation received should now be extended to all the speakers for being so pleasant.
The difficulty is that the situation is not at all pleasant. Quite the opposite is the case.
All the speeches do indeed suggest that the situation regarding peace and development is difficult and challenging.
Consequently, Parliament's main concern about the Valencia meeting at present should be that it takes place, not the outcome of the vote. It is important to ensure all the participants attend and that proceedings are brought to a successful conclusion.
Other than that, it only remains for me to point out that Parliament's role and involvement in the Barcelona Process is increasing. Setting up an Assembly would consolidate it, which would obviously be a most welcome development.
We shall now take the next item.
There will not of course be time to deal with it adequately prior to the vote.
We shall therefore open the debate and interrupt it for the vote.
The debate will be concluded this afternoon.
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0076/2002) by Mr GraÃ§a Moura, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the Commission communication on an EU Strategy towards China: Implementation of the 1998 Communication and Future Steps for a more Effective EU Policy.
rapporteur. (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the first idea I wish to get across is that relations between the European Union and China are continuing to develop favourably, although not always at an even pace or at the desired speed.
In any event, the Commission communication on the development of a comprehensive partnership with China, presented to the Council and Parliament half way through last year, outlines a strategy and incorporates a set of principles, aims and methods which are wholly commendable, and it seems, incidentally, that China's reaction to some - although not all - of the aspects this communication deals with is positive.
Similarly, the support that the People's Republic of China has so readily provided for the international fight against terrorism is evidence of an attitude that we should note and applaud.
At the same time, we have seen China become a member of the WTO, which opens up considerable prospects for that country to play an even more significant role on the international stage.
There is a range of issues that have been on the table for a long time: the role of China in the Far East, its relations with the ASEM countries and other parts of Asia, its internal political situation and its political, trade and cultural relations with the European Union.
In this framework, we are still seeing a certain disparity between the various methods of cooperation already in place and the development, which we consider to be desirable, of areas related to the political situation, the establishment of the rule of law and respect for human rights. It could, nevertheless, be said that there are already signs, here and there, which give reason to believe that these things will gradually be achieved.
The experiences of Hong Kong and Macao, in particular, show that it is possible to ensure that these developments take place at the political, social, economic and cultural levels.
We must, therefore, deepen cooperation and dialogue whilst continuing to insist on the other objectives that go beyond the framework of economic relations and which could even, in some cases, have a harmful effect on them unless the People's Republic of China finds a satisfactory solution to certain issues that we consider to be fundamental.
Some of the problems that require closer attention are raised in the specific chapters of the report.
These are: China's entry to the WTO, the need for sustainable development, for better coordination between the strand of economic progress and the strands of political and social progress, concerns about the problems of employment that will ensue from China's accession to the WTO and the need for the gradual conversion and modernisation of its economy, respect for the interests of its neighbouring countries, the need for environmental protection, the advantage of stepping up cultural exchange, particularly at university level, etc.
Our range of concerns about relations with Taiwan also falls into this category.
The European Union's recognition of the 'one China' principle cannot, under any circumstances, lead us to accept solutions involving force.
We all feel that there is no real alternative to dialogue on this matter, as difficult as this may prove to be.
Furthermore, we feel obliged to express our concern about Tibet, with regard to which it is also becoming necessary and urgent to pursue dialogue with a view to defining a new and real statute of full autonomy, with the only exceptions being foreign and defence policy.
Thirdly, whilst acknowledging that China seems to be making a degree of progress in the field of human rights, it should be understood that a vast area in which the situation is far from satisfactory is still wide open and this Parliament must, therefore, make this absolutely clear.
These points are covered in some detail in the report which I have had the honour of drafting and I shall, therefore, not go into them now.
Consequently, Mr President, a complex framework with countless positive possibilities is opening up for closer relations and cooperation between the European Union and China, but it also still contains countless problems that must be addressed frankly and an acceptable solution must be reached on the basis of democratic standards that will lead to the establishment of the rule of law, to the strengthening of civil society and to human rights being fully respected.
With regard to the 22 amendments that have been tabled, I should like to make the following brief observation: some, which simply replicate the contents of the text, should not be accepted, and there are also some amendments whose thrust would be more appropriate in a report on Hong Kong, which is why I am rejecting them at the present time. Lastly, there are other amendments, dealing either with the taxonomy of the text or with improving it, which I have accepted.
To conclude, Mr President, I am convinced that, by voting for this report, this House will be making both an institutional and a political contribution to the strategy drawn up by the Commission for the development of a comprehensive partnership between the European Union and the People's Republic of China.
Mr President, my congratulations and thanks go to my colleague, Mr GraÃ§a Moura, for a balanced and thorough report.
China is a very important trading partner for the EU, not least for my own country, Finland. Nokia, for example, already employs more than 4 000 staff in the manufacture of mobile phones.
It is important that China joined the WTO at the Doha meeting. It is important for the outside world, but still more for China, which must clarify many of its laws and its rules over the next few years to be able to implement all the requirements for membership.
WTO membership will also lead to social and political pressures in China.
How China is to solve these problems fairly is of course an internal matter but I agree with the rapporteur that in the longer term programmes jointly implemented in cooperation with the EU, Japan and the United States of America will be desirable to solve the employment and social problems of the country's vast rural area.
It is in our interest and that of the world as a whole that China should be a stable, open and prosperous society which we will support if and when it moves further towards democracy and a free market economy and embraces the principles of human rights and the rule of law.
We are pleased to welcome China's involvement in the international effort against terrorism and the rapprochement between China and India.
I believe that the values we hold to be important here in Parliament - democracy, the rule of law, human rights, equality and pluralism - will also gain ground in China if we maintain a vitally interactive relationship and encourage China to open up in all respects and permit its citizens to enjoy the freedom of modern communications media and allow them the right to become unionised and freely express their opinions.
Mr President, Mr GraÃ§a Moura is entitled to more than the usual courtesies extended in the House. I should like to thank him most sincerely for the draft resolution presented in plenary.
Moreover, the draft has received almost unanimous support from the relevant committee. I have been a member of the delegation for relations with the PeopleÂŽs Republic of China since 1986, and I believe it is fair to say that this is the most balanced text ever presented in plenary on the issue.
Were the Socialist Group's amendments to be included, it would indeed be almost perfect.
I have absolutely no doubt that, along with the introduction of the euro and enlargement of the European Union, the development of China will be remembered as one of the four or five milestones in the history of the world in the twenty-first century.
Hence the importance I attach to relations between China and the European Union.
I could comment on a great many issues, but I shall focus on just a few points in the interests of saving time and bearing in mind that other members of my group will be taking the floor.
I will start from the premise that in our culture drawing a friend's attention to his or her shortcomings is not considered to be interference. On the contrary, we believe it is a friend's duty to do so.
I have endeavoured to explain this to our Chinese partners on numerous occasions. For example, we speak out against the death penalty wherever it is in force, whether it be in the United States or in China.
Nonetheless, we consider both these countries to be our friends.
Mr President, it must be a sign of the times that the Chinese authorities have responded favourably to the Commission communication on which the report is based.
All the Union's institutions agree that it is in China's own interest, not just in that of the European Union, for the People's Republic to become stable and prosperous and move towards democracy. This must go beyond holding municipal elections with more than a single candidate per post.
It is important to promote exchanges of all kinds.
Those of us unfortunate enough to have the experience of living under a dictatorship for many years realise that isolation tended to strengthen the dictator's position instead of helping democrats striving to overthrow them. Accession to the World Trade Organisation is a challenge the Chinese Government has been brave enough to rise to.
It will involve risks and will have untold repercussions within and without the country. In the short term, it has already caused restructuring and large-scale lay-offs in certain sectors of industry.
Turning to the major area of human rights, China still has a long way to go, in our view.
Under-development is no excuse here.
A moratorium on execution of the sentence on those already condemned to death must be achieved, prior to pressing for the elimination of these sentences.
We have received very many well-founded allegations of torture. Torture must be eliminated.
We welcomed a delegation from Tibet a few weeks ago, and feel that was a positive step.
They provided some useful information, but many questions remain unanswered. The Chinese authorities should therefore be urged to pursue their recent policy of freeing Tibetan political prisoners.
These are moves in the right direction, and are bound to benefit China and relations between China and the European Union.
Mr President, I should also like to thank the rapporteur for a sound and well-balanced report which expresses the greater number of common interests there are between the EU and China today.
China is in all respects becoming a more and more important player on the world stage, and that also applies in the combating of terrorism where we must appreciate China's active support for this serious struggle.
The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party wants to see a democratic China that respects the principles of a free market, human rights and the rule of law.
We also want China to fulfil the Copenhagen Criteria. There is no reason why these criteria should be confined to applying only within the borders of Europe.
The ELDR Group has tabled a list of amendments, all designed to tighten up the report a little.
The most important issue for us in this context is the One China policy.
We are all familiar with this, and we know why it exists.
As liberals, we are not proud of the One China policy, because it impedes development in a country that respects democracy, social pluralism and constitutional principles - namely Taiwan.
The ELDR Group believes that the will and desires of Taiwan must be respected and that the China policy is an obstacle to their being so.
We also believe that the European Parliament is the right place from which to send this signal, and it is therefore up to our governments to follow our advice.
Last year, the President of Taiwan, Chen Shui-bian, was awarded the Liberal International Freedom Prize.
Unfortunately, no EU country would also give him a visa so that he himself could collect it. His wife instead collected it, here in this House in November.
Nonetheless, we should like to express our dissatisfaction with the fact that the Member States do not comply with their obligations to respect the President of Taiwan's basic right to travel freely. The Olympic Games are to be held in China in 2008.
That decision has been taken and is not to be altered, but let us take this opportunity to demand that China use this opportunity to demonstrate that it will comply with all the international standards and conventions relating to human rights.
Recently, China has employed a practice whereby children born in mainland China are separated from their parents in Hong Kong.
That is an infringement of human rights that is very much to be censured, and we will therefore demand that the Chinese Government stop this practice immediately and begin reunifying families so that parents in Hong Kong can be together with their children.
I would again thank Mr GraÃ§a Moura for a thorough and well-considered report which aims at a more effective EU policy on the China issue.
Mr President, human rights organisations are unfortunately continuing to report atrocities committed against dissidents and minorities in China.
At the same time, there are continuing protests by workers about the fact that at least 25 million jobs have disappeared in state-owned companies as a result of liberalisation and privatisation.
In the old industrial areas in northern China, unemployment is estimated at 40%.
In a study concerning the risk of instability in China, the Conflict Prevention Network observes that, if China's Communist Party does not manage to guarantee provision for the increasing number of poor and unemployed at a time when others in the population are becoming rich, the party's ideological legitimacy may begin to be called into question.
Things could then become unsettled in China.
In spite of a series of reforms, grassroots democracy has not seriously taken root.
China's leadership is in a race against time, according to the CPN report which also observes that this is creating a dilemma for the EU.
Is the EU to support a repressive regime because it maintains stability or is the risk of instability to be incurred through promoting citizens' rights?
For the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, there is an obvious answer to this question.
Citizens' rights and democracy must be promoted in all circumstances.
The Beijing Government must fulfil its promise and initiate talks with the Dalai Lama.
It is also necessary to continue the normalisation process with Taiwan without a show of arms, and China must comply with the content of the UN Conventions on Human Rights which have been signed.
It is not therefore acceptable for people to be imprisoned because of their religious convictions or ethnic affiliations or because they wish to form a trade union or political party.
Nonetheless, something is perhaps in the process of happening.
The latest issue of the Far Eastern Economic Review reports that there is a relaxation of the rules governing mass demonstrations under way.
A policeman has even had a letter published stating that the right to demonstrate is written into China's constitution and that it needs therefore to become easier to obtain permission to demonstrate.
The CPN report says that the EU must be cautious in attempting to influence China.
Certainly we can be cautious.
However, that presupposes a constructive response from China in which the latter implements the conventions it has signed and in which Chinese representatives do not interpret each friendly criticism as undue interference in China's internal affairs.
Mr President, I salute the rapporteur for his efforts.
Whenever the Union's relations with the People's Republic of China are assessed, economic interests are always to the fore.
This is certainly understandable; after all, a market of around 1.3 billion people promises absolutely inexhaustible profits for those companies and banks active in it.
China's accession to the WTO will further improve the terms for capital recovery.
It will also intensify competition between Pacific economic powerhouses like Japan, Taiwan and the United States on the one hand and the EU and its Member States on the other.
Everyone wants as large a slice as possible of this huge cake.
This is accompanied by constant reproaches from the political side that China should have more respect for human rights.
These overlook or underestimate the fact that China is trying to complement the economic reforms, which have been underway for years, with federal democratic structures, social security systems and economic regulatory mechanisms.
In acceding to the WTO, China is continuing this process.
Nevertheless, nobody should be under the illusion that this separation of the State and the economy will solve China's immense social problems.
The much lauded market of global capitalism is - whether you like it or not - amoral and not a suitable vehicle for translating basic values such as social justice and solidarity into action.
It is and remains the state which is called upon here.
There is no other government in the world that bears responsibility for 1.3 billion people.
Seeking to establish a multilateral dialogue with China is all well and good, but in so doing nobody should put China under pressure or only have their own interests in mind.
Anyone who does put pressure on China should keep a sense of proportion, carry out a realistic assessment of their own potential to meet the same demands and have a clear idea in advance of the effects that it might have.
A dialogue is only meaningful and successful if a consensus is sought in the interests of all parties.
This also applies to the death penalty.
It is right to call for it to be abolished, but we should be just as consistent in calling for it to be abolished in the USA.
Relations with China are more than ever before of strategic political significance.
Uni-dimensional development, as is currently happening on China's doorstep as a result of the USA's strategic intentions, would not be very beneficial.
Instability would be the result.
As the EU enlarges, indeed precisely as it undergoes this process of enlargement, it is called upon to oppose any unilateral attempts to accumulate power, and to maintain and - if necessary - establish and consolidate stability by cultivating a balanced relationship with China.
Judging from the report on China and the Commission communication, a fresh start, appropriate to spring time, seems to be being made in relations between the EU and China.
Relations of the EU and its Member States with China are increasingly improving and being extended.
These are, in themselves, promising signs.
However, the Commission and the rapporteur will agree with me that quite a few difficulties have to be overcome before mention can be made of a true spring breakthrough.
Compliance with human rights, in particular, leaves a great deal to be desired.
Reports of torture, maiming and even killings are too systematic to be ignored.
Various groups in Chinese society are suffering such human rights violations, including, for example, non-registered Christians. According to a reliable report issued by various NGOs, their persecution has, in recent years, even been ordered at a high level in the Chinese Government.
Since this persecution is hardly given any attention in the report by Mr GraÃ§a Moura, I have tabled a few additional amendments in this respect which I hope will find backing in the European Parliament.
The EU's response so far to these abuses is, in my view, very disappointing.
According to the Commission document on China, ten rounds of political dialogue have already been held.
At the same time, the Commission realises that there is still a yawning gap between action and international standards.
Should we then not conclude that the 'critical dialogue' is inadequate as an instrument?
And would it not be preferable by far to link economic interests to China's observation of human rights much more than is now the case?
The critical dialogue should not be there to ease our conscience, while we in the meantime keep a keen eye on our own economic interests.
This will probably cost us something, but surely we should be prepared to go ahead nevertheless if human rights are so important to us.
We in the European Union cannot conceive of spring if in China itself it is still the middle of winter.
Thank you very much, Mr Belder.
The debate is now adjourned. We shall proceed to the vote.
Mr President, I rise to raise an important issue for individual Members of this House relating to Council Question Time.
I was informed yesterday by the questions office of this House that my question relating to the Middle East would not be taken by the Council today because the matter I was raising, the Association Agreement between Europe and Israel, would be dealt with by the Council in debate yesterday.
The Council did not deal with that issue yesterday, so I contacted the office again today to have this question restored to the order paper.
I have now been informed that the Council will not deal with my question or ten other Members' questions because it claims it has not had time to prepare its replies.
I do not think that is acceptable.
This is one of the few rights that individual Members have: to question the Commission and the Council directly in this House.
It is a display of contempt for the Members of this House for the Council to seek simply to push aside important questions which individual Members may want to raise.
I would ask you, Mr President, to make the strongest possible protest to the Council to ensure that my question and the other Members' questions are restored and in fact replied to; and to make it clear that neither this Council nor any other council is entitled to treat this House with such contempt.
Question Time is on the agenda at 5.30 p.m. this afternoon.
When we finish the votes I will try to communicate with the Council and revert to you on whatever it is I have discovered.
Your point is clear, well made and well taken.
I will convey that to the Council after the voting session.
The Commission can accept Amendments Nos 1 and 9 to 15.
The Commission cannot accept Amendment No 3.
While some of the other amendments - Nos 2 to 8 - could be accepted in principle, the wording of Amendments Nos 9 to 15 is far preferable.
Mr President, I have worked very closely with my colleagues in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and I feel that this compromise package of amendments, which we are going to vote on today, is the best outcome we could have hoped for on integrated coastal zone management.
As some of you will be aware, at first reading last year I proposed that this recommendation be strengthened to include a review which would lead to a further legal framework on coastal zone management.
The protection of our coastal zones is essential and I feel that stronger legislation is needed to ensure this protection.
At first reading, the report was adopted by a large majority of this House.
However, it was not possible for the Council to accept our amendments on the legal framework at that stage.
As rapporteur, I was very disappointed that we lost these legal framework amendments.
However, as I said, these compromise amendments are a very good step in the right direction and a clear signal that we are serious about protecting Europe's coastal zones.
At my initiative, as rapporteur, I felt it was essential to reach a compromise with the Council on a second reading, and this package is exactly that.
I am delighted to say that we have reached a good compromise on the timetable of this recommendation.
Firstly, concerning the time in which Member States must report back to the Commission on their experience in implementing the recommendation - the Council can accept our suggested 45 months.
Secondly, the Council can further accept our suggested 55 months for the review of the recommendation.
In essence, we have gained an extra year on the timetable, which essentially means that further steps in protecting our coastal zone will come sooner rather than later.
I would like sincerely to thank the Council for its understanding on this significant point.
I would also like to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues in the Committee on the Environment who supported the compromise package and the Council for recognising the importance of this compromise and for putting the recommendation on COREPER's agenda at very short notice.
I should also like to thank the people in the Commission responsible.
Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his constructive work on this directive which will ensure more security in maritime traffic.
As my colleague, Mrs De Palacio, said yesterday, the Commission can confirm its support for all the amendments tabled.
I trust that the Council will follow Parliament's position to enable this directive to be adopted as soon as possible.
Mr President, on waste electrical and electronic equipment, the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 9, 11 to 19, 24, 27 to 37, 39, 40, 43, 44, 45, 50, 57, 65, 76 and 77.
In Amendment No 23, the Commission supports the new paragraph 1 and paragraph 1(b), last subparagraph in full and paragraph 1(b), third and fourth subparagraphs, as well as paragraph 2 in principle.
In Amendment No 73, the Commission can accept the first part.
In Amendments Nos 1, 3, 5, 6, 7 and 10, the first, third and fourth sentences can be accepted in full.
In Amendments Nos 10, 20, 21 and 41, the first sentence can be accepted in full.
Amendments Nos 42, 48, 49, 51 to 55, 66, 78 and 92 can be accepted in principle.
On restriction of hazardous substances the amendments acceptable in full to the Commission are Amendments Nos 3, 4, 10 and 17.
Amendment No 5 can be accepted in part - i.e. the first paragraph.
Amendments Nos 2, 6, 7, 8, 9 (the first paragraph of Amendment No 9 can be accepted in full), 13 and 15 can be accepted in principle.
Mr President, as my colleague Mrs WallstrÃ¶m explained during the debate yesterday, the Commission is unable to accept those amendments of Parliament which would extend the scope of the proposed directive to include a total and immediate ban on octabromodiphenyl ether - in short octaBDEs and decaBDEs.
This concerns Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9 and 10.
The reason for the position of the Commission is that the risk assessment for these substances is not yet finalised.
Furthermore, the Commission is also unable to accept the amendment that would introduce a future total ban on decaBDEs from 1 January 2006, should the risk assessments conclude that the substance causes concern.
This is Amendment No 4.
The reason we take this stand is that the ban should be introduced much earlier than 2006, as the risk assessment will be concluded during 2002.
. (DA) Mr President, I should like to draw attention to an error in the English version of Amendment No 3, in which the last word, 'status', should have read 'place'.
I would therefore ask for this to be corrected in the original English text.
. Mr President, following consultation yesterday, I should like to propose an oral amendment to the end of paragraph 41, adding a few words which take into account the actions taken by the political groups in response to criticism a couple of years ago from the Court of Auditors.
It would read as follows: "Notes the Bureau ruling on budget line No 3701 following the answers from the political groups to the Court of Auditors' special report."
That is the addition and it is also in the voting list.
Mr President, here is my own Amendment No 13 and the original paragraph 43, to which the PSE Group wishes to table an oral amendment.
Paragraph 43 orally amended is much the same in terms of content as my own Amendment No 13.
This being so I would ask whether the PSE Group could withdraw its oral amendment, as it might be overturned if twelve Members of Parliament oppose it, because Amendment No 13 is approximately the same as paragraph 43 orally amended by the Social Democratic Group.
Mr President, I can well understand why the rapporteur is asking this question.
On the other hand all that this is about is a different legal assessment of the relevance of the Financial Regulation.
We believe that our amendment is clearer on this point.
But it actually does not make much difference which of the two amendments is adopted.
That is why I would request that we first vote on the Liberals' amendment and then on ours.
We believe that even taking into account the oral alteration we have a rather clearer amendment.
It will not, however, be of great consequence to either party, whatever is adopted.
.
Mr President, this relates to the situation we have with the Council.
The Budget Control Committee requested information from the Council on the common foreign and security policy.
Initially, the Council was reluctant to provide this information which is why the text, as it stands at the moment, postpones discharge for the Council.
Late last night, however, following a meeting of the Council Finance Ministers, they agreed to answer the questions by Friday of this week.
Due to this change in the situation, and as I wish to avoid a clash with Council if at all possible, I would like to propose an oral amendment to Amendment No 4, which has now not been withdrawn.
This amendment is almost identical to the oral amendment relating to Amendment No 3: "Is grateful for the answers that, in principle, the Council has agreed to provide to questions relating to aspects of the common foreign and security policy within seven days".
I would therefore urge that we first vote on Amendment No 4, with the oral amendment, and if this falls, we then have to vote on Amendment No 3 And I wish to indicate that if this should happen, I withdraw paragraph 3e.
I am sorry if it is a bit complicated but it is because of the changing situation.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we postponed the vote on this report from yesterday to today because we were waiting for an official response from the Council.
That was the reason given on Monday by the chairman of the PSE Group, Mr Baron Crespo.
We went along with that.
However, we still do not have an official answer now.
An unofficial, possible answer from the Council, which was given to me today in the form of an unofficial translation, is what I actually have in front of me as chairman of the committee.
I do not think that it is fair to either the Council or the committee, which has after all not even been able to examine this material, for us now to set about the discharge procedure and decide yes or no or whether to postpone a decision.
I think a reasonable course of action is to wait for the following year, for 2001, where budget lines are already shown for the foreign and security policy and home affairs, and in the meantime to reflect calmly on the discharge problem both on our own and in discussion with the Council.
That is why I would ask that these matters be dealt with in a clear and transparent procedure in the committee responsible, so that we can also make a well-founded judgment.
I would therefore ask our rapporteur, and also the PSE Group, to abandon this very hasty, indeed perhaps over hasty, procedure.
Mr President, I should like to speak against the proposal, because it seems to me that Mrs Theato's reasoning is full of contradictions.
You see, on the one hand she said that she wanted the report to be referred back to committee, because she wanted to grant discharge to the Council soon.
But on the other hand it is well known in this House that in her very group there are those who have serious reservations about doing this at all.
At the same time, Mrs Morgan has made a proposal that would take away a lot of the pressure and difficulties associated with this particular issue and would constitute an elegant solution to this problem.
Incidentally, I would point out that we also need to make decisions on a whole series of other institutions, and I do not think that, on the basis of this contradictory reasoning, we should throw away an opportunity to resolve this problem elegantly.
We would be quite happy to address the questions raised by Mrs Theato next year.
Mr President, the Group of the Europe People's Party is of the opinion that Mrs Morgan's approach, introducing last-minute changes, is not the best way to deal with such an important report.
The Council has undertaken to provide a reply on Friday.
Given the importance of this report, it would therefore be wisest to refer it back to the committee. This would allow for further reflection, taking account of the Council's response, with a view to reaching the best possible solution.
I urge Mrs Morgan to request that the report be referred back to the committee.
I have already tried to convince her of the need for this.
The PPE-DE Group will not give way on this point. It is opposed to the oral amendment.
. Mr President, if we send this back to the committee, I cannot promise in which form it will come back.
We could start a major constitutional crisis with the Council.
We have just got an answer from the Council on the common foreign and security policy.
We should acknowledge that as a major shift from the Council, which is why I am urging you to vote today in favour of the line that I have proposed.
Mr President, I would like to move a point of order regarding Annex 5.
The Rules of Procedure state that, on decisions giving discharge, the House shall vote on the basis of a report by the Committee on Budgetary Control, regardless of whether discharge is refused or granted.
The report submitted by Mrs Morgan tended towards favouring a certain decision.
We cannot now recommend that the House take a different decision.
I fully understand Mrs Morgan's objections.
This group was not responsible for initiating a dispute with the Council on this issue; on the contrary in fact, we called for moderation.
Now we believe that, in order to bring this matter to a satisfactory conclusion, we must, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, refer this report back to committee, or at least the part of the report that concerns the Council, and vote on the rest of the report.
But we must refer back to committee the part of the report regarding discharge to the Council.
This is the only solution that conforms with common sense and also with the Rules of Procedure.
Mr President, Mr Bourlanges said that he was moving a point of order, but he was, in fact, speaking in favour.
I wanted to say that we have played the sorcerer's apprentice in this area and we now find ourselves in this situation.
Therefore, I firmly support the referral back to committee and I urge you to forge ahead, because we have important votes on the Middle East and on Chechnya that must absolutely take place today.
Mr President, on Monday our group made a request for the vote on this motion to be taken tomorrow, because this would have enabled us to take account of the Madrid Summit.
First listen to what I have to say!
After all we are exchanging arguments and each side needs to take the other seriously.
You are fighting for human rights, so listen too to what the chairman of the PPE-DE Group has to say!
(Applause from the right)
We proposed voting tomorrow so that we could react to the Madrid Summit.
This would also have given us more time to reach agreement on the substance because it does not make much sense for us to vote on the Middle East if the result will not be unanimous.
Now, this was objected to on the grounds that we in the European Parliament needed to send another very strong signal to Madrid.
The Madrid Summit, at least as far as the Middle East is concerned, is over, and even if there were to be a majority in favour of this motion here today, the European Parliament would no longer be able to send a signal to influence the outcome of Madrid.
Your argument for getting this through today is no longer valid.
I would ask you to take note of this at least!
(Applause from the right)
On the issue itself, I very much regret to have to tell you that our group cannot endorse the joint motion for a resolution as it stands.
Rarely have we debated anything with each other more extensively, at greater length and on such a serious basis, and in this debate political, moral and historical points have been put forward.
We are very critical of the policy of the Israeli Prime Minister, Ariel Sharon.
But we ought also to have called in the resolution - and as it stands this is not the case - for, for example, the President of the Palestinian Authority, Yassir Arafat, to address the Palestinians in the Arabic language and call a halt to the terror of the suicide bombings.
(Applause and heckling)
I am only saying what the terms of our discussion were; we also take your arguments seriously, and as far as the moral and political issues are concerned we claim the same arguments for our group.
But - and here I turn to the Commission, to Mr Nielson; Commissioner, I would be grateful if you would listen to me - we also have questions about how the money, which the European Union makes available to the Palestinian-controlled areas, is used.
Since this does not appear in the motion, but very many other remarks ...
(Heckling and violent protests from the left, applause from the right)
Loud shouts have never yet been an argument powerful enough to win me round, and if that is now the new argument of the left in the European Parliament then my group will not find it very persuasive.
(Applause from the right)
So, in summary, the vast majority of our group will not be voting in favour of this motion as it stands because we deem it to be imbalanced.
There are, however, other colleagues who have told me that they have decided on the basis of their own conscience to support this motion, and we respect that.
Incidentally, we wish the Secretary of State of the United States, Colin Powell, who is now travelling to Palestine, every success.
We hope that he will not only see Mr Sharon, but also Mr Arafat, and that this will contribute to the quest for a peaceful solution in the Middle East.
Our group sends its best wishes to the American Secretary of State for his efforts to bring peace to the Middle East.
(Applause)
I have listened carefully to what you have said.
I did not hear in any of it that you made any procedural proposal.
Many colleagues have indicated that they would like to speak.
I would ask the House - notwithstanding the intervention of Mr Poettering - not to reopen the debate.
We had the debate yesterday.
So let us move to the vote.
I note that this resolution has not been signed by Mrs Muscardini and any reference to her as a signatory will be removed.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Joint motion for a resolution (RC B5-188/2002)
Our coastal zones have been in continual decline for many years now, and the efforts of Member States to tackle this phenomenon vary according to the policies that the governments decide to pursue.
Some countries, such as France, do not make land planning a political priority.
The decline of our coastal zones is often a result of this reprehensible wait-and-see policy.
The problems encountered, both on land, such as demography, road networks and housing, and at sea, such as oil discharges, excess algae for instance, are shared problems. Europe therefore has a duty to play a specific role in initiating and drive policy-making in this area.
We must, of course, take the various geographical areas into account.
No one coastal zone is the same as another.
We must urge the Member States concerned to carry out a national inventory, to put in place a genuine preservation strategy that is coordinated at local level and guided at national level and to apply Community legislation that has an impact on coastal zones.
(Explanation of vote cut short pursuant to Article 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
It has been twenty-eight months since the sinking of the Erika and we are still debating measures to control maritime traffic. These measures are included in a package of legislative provisions entitled 'Erika II', which are designed to help prevent any similar environmental disasters.
We have not reached the end of the procedure, since new amendments tabled by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism have just been adopted in plenary.
Most of these amendments are unrealistic or call into question the national organisation arrangements which are perfectly satisfactory.
We are thus unacceptably prolonging the procedural time frames which are further delaying the application of the useful preventative provisions that this draft directive contains, such as the compulsory introduction of automatic identification systems (AIS) on ships and voyage data recorders (black boxes).
Therefore, by refusing to support the realistic installation dates for transponders and black boxes, the European Parliament is delaying their effective introduction.
And by proposing a complex compensation process for ports which welcome vessels with difficulties, and disregarding the efficient national organisations that already exist, the European Parliament is heading for a dead end situation.
(Explanation of vote cut short pursuant to Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
Mr President, I will do my best to be serious in today's explanations of vote.
The first concerns Mr Florenz' report on the directive on the differentiated collection of waste electrical and electronic equipment.
I voted for the motion today and I was in favour of this report when I voted for it in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy too.
I believe it is extremely important for the European Parliament to promote the improvement of our environment.
In particular, I would like pensioners to be employed in the activities of waste electrical and electronic equipment collection.
They will feel less like discarded waste than they are sometimes made to feel.
. (NL) The PvdA [Dutch Labour Party] Eurodelegation would like to state the following:
1.
The PvdA delegation warmly supports the directives on electrical and electronic waste.
The environmental objectives should be paramount in these directives.
We therefore endorse all the amendments designed to reinforce the environmental objective.
2.
The Netherlands is one of the few countries which has experience of collecting electrical waste.
Producers must be encouraged to design with the environment in mind, but this is much broader than recycling.
In addition, producers must be individually responsible.
But different makes of TV sets, hairdryers, electric toothbrushes or hand blenders hardly differ in terms of recyclability.
Individual funding is, therefore, not obviously better than collective solutions.
Collective systems have, in fact, major advantages: they are less bureaucratic and more practical.
There is no need, therefore, to reserve collective systems only for exceptional circumstances.
3.
My final point concerns the waste disposal fee.
In our view, environmental costs should be incorporated into the price of the product - but these are more transparent if it is mentioned separately.
Moreover, visibility enhances consumer awareness.
This is of major importance, for in order to achieve the environmental goals, the cooperation of the consumer is required.
Finally, a visible waste disposal fee is significant in connection with competition laws.
Today, waste electrical and electronic equipment, such as televisions and household appliances, are disposed of without these products undergoing any specific treatment.
Almost 6 million tonnes of waste are produced every year in Europe, an average of 16 kg per capita.
Yet, these products contain toxic substances that are harmful to the environment such as lead, cadmium and mercury.
I therefore believe that it is crucial to adopt legislation which will enable us to manage this waste more efficiently and to urge manufacturers to take an active part in the collection system.
Currently, consumers assume part of the responsibility by sorting their waste, which they are asked to do. Local authorities have also taken on some responsibility by providing specific equipment.
It is logical, therefore, that manufacturers play a part in this collective effort.
It is essential that manufacturers make an effective financial contribution to the collection system for their product(s).
However, we must have realistic collection objectives so that they can be applicable.
We must also exclude from this system those products which seem particularly difficult to collect, such as incandescent lamps, for example.
This text offers a perspective for preventing electrical and electronic waste and for developing systems to recover and re-use this waste.
(Explanation of vote cut short pursuant to Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
. (NL) There is a conflict of interest between the industrial world and the world outside of industry.
Consumers and the environment benefit from sustainable products whose individual components can be re-used at the end of their life cycle.
Industry, however, benefits from competitive sales prices and minimum costs afterwards.
It also benefits from passing on problems to other parties, particularly governments, which then need to organise solutions by using tax money.
Industry has tried to turn the proposals to its advantage.
I too have been approached with reasonable sounding arguments.
Environmental fanatics would only want something that is costly and impractical, and the envisaged environmental benefits could also be achieved without compulsion.
They may be right in some cases, but to admit to them that they are right would offer scope to less well-meaning competitors who, with less responsibility and therefore lower prices, would like to take the markets by storm and expand.
This is why it is useful for regulations to be put in place for recycling, for 'orphaned' products made by companies that no longer exist and for 'historical' waste, in the case of which the manufacturer is not certain whether it was produced before or after the directive entered into force.
Exemptions for small companies are unfair, and certainly for those that produce military equipment.
Unfortunately, the Group of the European People's Party and European Democrats is once again using the requirement of 314 votes to get its own way.
.
(DE) On Amendments No 15 and No 41, the delegation of the Austrian People's Party voted in favour of an exemption for SMEs and in favour of a collective system.
A great deal of bureaucracy is to be expected at the introductory stage.
SMEs should be able to find and choose a functioning market.
The second directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment concerns the ban on the use of certain extremely harmful substances such as lead, mercury, cadmium and hexavalent chromium in the manufacture of electric and electronic equipment.
I fully support this directive too, both on my own behalf and as representative of the Pensioners' Party, and I am thinking not just of the citizens who could be harmed by these hazardous substances but also and above all of the workers in the companies that produce electrical and electronic equipment containing these harmful substances.
I feel that it would be good to have much fewer people retiring because of occupational diseases caused by using these harmful substances and I hope that a directive or regulation or recommendation will soon be adopted stipulating that these workers should work six rather than eight hours a day in these toxic environments.
.
Mr President, I fully support the move to make producers and consumers of electrical goods more environmentally responsible.
By compelling producers to participate in take-back schemes, this directive will be hard-hitting and effective.
Indeed, disposing of electronic waste has yet to be dealt with effectively and shifting the onus onto the producer may well prove to be an effective solution.
However, to ensure that manufacturers adhere to this directive and that it is successfully implemented, account must be taken of the peculiarity of some manufactured goods.
It should not end up being the case that some producers bear an unfair share of the financial burden that this directive implies.
The directive is also right to mention the role that consumers must also play in disposing of electrical waste.
Lastly, since some Member States are clear laggards when disposing of electrical waste, it is vital that there is ample provision of information about the new rules.
Mr President, I should like to explain my vote on the issue of the use of the official languages of the European Union in the European Patent Office.
I defend unequivocally the right of all the official languages of the Community to be used in all circumstances, particularly since in the near future there might be a tendency to renounce this principle, in light of the increase from 11 to 22 or more official languages when enlargement to include further states takes place.
I also believe that if a European Union language is to be considered the most appropriate as a working language, its universal dimension should not be forgotten.
By this token, I should like to remind you that the Portuguese language - including Brazilian and Galician Portuguese - is the third universal language of the European Union, following only English and Spanish.
This must be taken into account where patents and indeed any other issues are concerned.
We Swedish Social Democrats voted against Amendment No 2 which is about increasing the number of translations of patents.
Our reason for doing so is that we wish to keep down the costs of patent applications, and we therefore advocate a solution in terms of just one or two languages.
Amendments Nos 3 and 9-17 propose that straightforward national courts should function as first instance courts for Community patent litigation.
We believe that this would militate against the principle of a uniform Community patent.
Our view is that the first instance court to be set up by virtue of Article 225a should have regional or local chambers.
In that way, continued access to local expertise within the patent sphere is guaranteed in all Member States.
It also means that the parties are closer to the court.
Parliament's vote on the Council regulation on the Community patent draws a definitive line under 18 months of work necessary in order for Parliament to adopt a position which a broad majority of Members supported today.
Along with the majority of Members, I felt that the proposed regulation aimed to ensure we combined three elements: efficiency, lowest economic cost and linguistic diversity.
The latter cannot be extended ad infinitum and it is good that Parliament realises this.
We will, in future, be forced to make other, even more painful decisions.
Despite the fact that I am convinced of the need for a Community patent, I voted against Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi's report and the final resolution on the Community patent as I believe the conditions governing its implementation are unacceptable.
Since the fundamental aspects of this regulation relate to the linguistic arrangements, legal certainty and the role of the national offices do not meet the expectations of users.
In these conditions, the Community patent would not be profitable and there is a risk that those within the profession would not use it.
My group has voted against the opinion on the Community patent because the ELDR proposals have been rejected on three fundamental counts.
We need an affordable and uniform European patent system for the European market.
The discussion surrounding the language regime has illustrated the fact that, unfortunately, political sentiments have carried more weight than practical arguments.
Translation costs push up the price of the patent disproportionately, so that it will become too costly for European industry, the ultimate users.
That is why my group is in favour of a limited language regime and cannot endorse the 'Alicante' regime of five languages (Amendments Nos 31 and 32).
