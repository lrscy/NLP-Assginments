Immigration law and criminal law are fields in which there has been quite extensive legal protection in all the Member States from the earliest times.
In this respect, the key function of the Court is therefore the uniform interpretation of provisions.
I have noted that if the Union uses decisions to step on the areas of immigration and criminal law, this will necessitate a uniform interpretation.
It is then the Unionâs prime responsibility to ensure that the interpretation of those provisions in the procedures in which the freedom of people is at stake, is done promptly.
If not, it will be true, as the saying goes, that âjustice delayed is justice deniedâ.
That is the Unionâs first responsibility and that is the reason why I have highlighted this.
As for your remarks about decision-making by qualified majority, I have already indicated the presidencyâs minimum ambitions on this score.
In this connection, we will need to await the further course of events.
With regard to your remark about the Human Rights Agency, I should like to say the following.
As you know, the European Council took a decision on this in September, and the Dutch Presidency will ensure at the earliest opportunity that âŠ
Â Â  Mr Donner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, as a matter of institutional courtesy, the Bureau naturally does not set fixed time limits for the Council or the Commission, but time must be allocated on the basis of fair access to the floor.
This is at least how it was allocated to the Members of this House.
The Council was scheduled to speak for five minutes at the end of the debate.
I am well aware that you are speaking in the middle, not at the end of the debate, but please allow me to draw your attention to the fact that we are now coming up to twelve minutes.
I should therefore request that you be somewhat brief, so that the Members of this House have some time to speak.
Thank you very much.
Â Â  . I have tried to be as succinct as need be and had reached a natural conclusion with my comments insofar as the questions are intended for the Council.
Thank you.
Â Â  In that case, I apologise most humbly for hearing this much-anticipated end.
Let us therefore return to the agenda.
I give the floor to Mrs Kudrycka.
Â Â  Â Â Â I should like to thank you, MrÂ President, for protecting Membersâ rights.
MrÂ President, the Member States that joined the European Union in 2004 were the first to have to meet demanding requirements with regard to the protection of external borders, and in the course of accession negotiations the European Commission gave a very positive assessment of their efforts.
Since 1Â MayÂ 2004, these ten countries have participated in cooperation measures under the Schengen Agreement, yet a fundamental obstacle to their equal participation in such joint measures is lack of access to the Schengen Information System.
This hampers reciprocal implementation of the commitments entered into under the Treaty with regard to legal assistance in criminal matters, such as the European arrest warrant, police cooperation and a common immigration policy.
Consequently, for example, the new Member States are prevented from issuing uniform Schengen lists, and, most importantly, the time period during which checks must be carried out at the EUâs internal borders has been greatly prolonged.
This problem is viewed in a negative light by the majority of citizens of Poland and of the other new Member States.
It is difficult for them to understand why the pre-accession strategy, which the EU and the candidate countries took nearly ten years to implement, could not have ensured that the information system was ready to accept additional users on 1Â JanuaryÂ 2004.
In 2003, the European Commission and the Member States set a date of late 2006 for completion of the second-generation Schengen Information System.
Currently, however, the estimated date is given as 1Â MayÂ 2007.
I believe the Commission and the Council should keep to the original deadline of 31Â DecemberÂ 2006 as the date when the second-generation Schengen Information System must be ready for operation.
Integration of the new Member Statesâ IT systems and transfer of data from the old system to the new system must also be completed by that date.
The European Commission should make available to the Council the report containing positive evaluations and assessments by EU experts based on objective indicators of the situation at the eastern external border.
I regret to say that press reports still uphold the stereotype and myth that the new Member States do not provide satisfactory protection of the EUâs common borders.
I believe dissemination of appropriate information by the Commission would not only encourage recognition of the efforts made by the new Member States, but also help to ensure their positive impact was appreciated.
During a hearing before our committee, ProfessorÂ Buttiglione gave a very positive assessment of the state of preparedness for implementation of the second-generation Schengen Information System at the European Unionâs eastern border.
At the same time he committed himself to accelerating operational measures in this field.
I hope that, in planning the future of the area of freedom, the Commission and the Council will rise to the challenge of ensuring that freedom of movement for European citizens, one of the EUâs fundamental freedoms, is implemented as rapidly as possible without discrimination.
This would be the fastest way of achieving the highest possible level of security.
It would also enable us to combat terrorism more effectively.
I thank you.
Â Â  Â As I take the Chair, I would like to call once again upon all Members to keep strictly to the time limits.
It is already late, there is a long list of speakers and we still have another item to consider.
Â Â  Mr President, any future development of the area of freedom, security and justice must take account, amongst other considerations, of the eruption of Islamic fundamentalist terrorism in Europe, which struck the Union in the heart of Madrid.
It is a threat we have to face in addition to the threat from the nationalist terrorism of ETA, which is weaker than ever, it is true, but which still has the capacity to kill.
Islamic fundamentalist terrorism shares both ETAâs objective of destroying democracy and the fanaticism with which ETA takes action against its victims, who are always innocent, but they differ in terms of their strategy, their organisation, the way they act and the support they receive.
So, in order to combat both, we must create this area of freedom, security and justice with a shared objective: to defeat them, arresting and bringing to justice the instigators and authors of these crimes and by matching our tactics, and also our strategy, to the size, the context and the structure of each terrorist organisation.
Recent history has shown us that we are capable of acting together after an attack, but on the other hand we are incapable of mobilising all the instruments of the Rule of Law in order to prevent them.
I will give you an example: the Council has adopted a series of framework decisions which have yet to be transposed into the national legislations of certain countries and, therefore, apart from the fine expressions of solidarity from their Heads of State and Government, they are not operational.
What are they waiting for?
What has got to happen?
How many more trains have to be blown to bits before they understand that the fight against terror is our responsibility, that it is a tragedy for those who are victims of it, but that the policy for preventing it and destroying it must be European?
I wonder, ladies and gentlemen, whether the time has come, if such a case arises, for a State to be penalised for endangering the security of its neighbours by not applying common rules in the fight against terrorism.
I know it is the third pillar, but it depends on political will.
This situation can change.
I would insist that it only requires political will.
Should we penalise a State which does not comply with the Stability Pact but not a State which jeopardises the lives of its neighbours by not applying Community legislation?
This is the tragic paradox.
Ladies and gentlemen, it would be very useful if the new Commission could produce and present to Parliament an assessment report on the way framework decisions have been transposed into national legislations and on the added value they have provided.
Mr President, I am coming to an end, but please allow me to address Mr Vitorino very briefly: I know that, from our desks, we sometimes forget that the ultimate beneficiaries of political action are real citizens.
I know you are not guilty of this, and I would like to say that, as a result of your tenacity, your work and your intelligence, many European citizens, many of my neighbours, have felt freer.
Â Â  Mr President, many among us have read, even studied this document, the 9/11 Commission report.
We all know what it is, we know what it says.
It is the reaction â multipartisan, objective, rigorous â of the politicians of a society trying to protect that society, trying to be self-critical of their own institutions and to identify what was not working within them.
Then, if we turn to Europe, we find these documents, one of which was produced yesterday by the Council.
It is the Council report, dated 12 October, following the report by the Commission dated 8 June 2004, and it tries to fill the gap.
What has happened with the framework decision on terrorism?
These documents are almost clandestine, because big political decisions are made in public, yet this one is not.
This is depressing.
It shows that not even the Netherlands Presidency has given the Commission the answers it needs in order to produce these documents.
But the Netherlands Presidency is not alone in this: only 13 countries out of 25 have done their homework.
Less words and more work: legislation is work.
It is all very well to come and say fine words and try to protect the states and the image of the states instead of protecting citizens.
But that is not working.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I am horrified at what has been said in the House today.
One after another, speakers have affirmed their belief in the Union and in its splendid achievements.
What indeed can be more splendid than equality, freedom, brotherhood and an area of freedom, security and justice?
But where is this area, I ask myself?
Where is the justice and where are the equal rights, if you cannot even manage to provide interpreters during committee meetings, something all Member States and Members of this House are entitled to under the Treaties?
Where are the justice, ethics and morals, if you fight against child pornography on the Internet, but at the same time promote access to pornography in general in the name of so-called citizensâ freedoms?
Is this not a case of split personality and a peculiar schizophrenia?
In my opinion, the European Union is currently at a crossroads.
It is trying to build on quicksand, having rejected the principles of civilised ethics and Christian ethics, which have acted as a foundation for millennia.
It is claimed that the spirit of the old foundation is being retained, as it is replaced by a new one, namely law and human rights.
Yet at the same time I have sat through worrying debates, even within my committee, which is actually called the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs.
I have heard of the need to combat the criminal actions of paedophiles on the Internet.
Simultaneously various sexual deviations are being allowed to proliferate in the name of this very freedom.
So I wonder, MrÂ President, whether this whole edifice is not set to come tumbling down.
In the name of these principles, I would like to end by referring to a Polish poet who said that anyone who dares to take sparks from the devilâs forge to scorch the devilâs power blasphemes against eternal wisdom and forces the world into outer darkness.
Let this serve as a warning!
Â Â  MrÂ President, I must make an overall observation.
The EU now faces the difficult challenge of successfully devising common legal rules for the newly enlarged EU and, soon, the even more enlarged EU.
The demand for the rule of law must be the same in an EU both of 30 and of 25 countries.
We Swedes are expected right now to extradite a 21Â year-old, Kalle Jonsson, to Greece in accordance with a warrant for his arrest.
Kalle Jonsson has been waiting to be tried since 2001.
Is it fair that a young person should have to wait three years?
The EUâs legal system is based upon mutual trust: trust in each otherâs legal systems.
Most people in my country believe that the EU is about trade and the internal market.
They have no idea that we have to recognise each otherâs court judgments, and to do so also in the further enlarged EU of the future, irrespective of, for example, the circumstances of such recognition.
The EU already has â and will have more â problematic areas within its own external borders.
People need, at the same time, to be given the necessary confidence in the legal systems in all the Member States.
That is more difficult than obtaining popular support for the treaty.
If no such popular support is successfully obtained within the scheduled time, enlargement will be delayed, legal cooperation weakened or the rule of law even tampered with.
Quite simply: how is the Commission successfully to carry out this task, or is the idea of its doing so utopian and a mere dream?
Finally, a sincere thank you, MrÂ Vitorino, for having helped bring us closer to that dream, and a sincere thank you, MrÂ Bourlanges, for showing that you intend trying to speed up this process.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, how, in future, are we to fashion the area of freedom, security and justice so that it meets the needs of Europeans in the twenty-first century?
We have to ensure that the EU continues to stand for openness to the world, for liberality and tolerance.
We are agreed that we must act decisively against international terrorism and organised crime, but the measures we take to deal with them have to be appropriate.
To take one example, we set great store by the European arrest warrant, but, unfortunately, not everyone does.
We, on the other hand, have no desire to take action for the sake of it, nor any headlong zeal for collecting every conceivable item of data about people, storing them for unspecified periods of time, and passing them on to every official body.
The greater security this promises is illusory, and civil liberties and the protection of the individual, for which we have struggled for so long, must not be sacrificed to it.
These values must underpin everything we do in the sphere of justice and internal affairs.
Tampere I made that clear, and to that we must hold fast.
We still need a common asylum policy and a policy enabling us to bring illegal immigration under control and to prevent people-trafficking, without diluting or even abandoning the principle of solidarity.
What, in the future, is to be Europeâs concept of men, women, and freedom â that of the nineteenth century, or that of the twenty-first, which meets the needs of its people?
We in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament favour that of the twenty-first century.
Brilliant though Mrs Klamtâs speech was, there is a saying in Bavarian football to the effect that ânarrowly wide is still not a goalâ.
I should also like to say a few words to MrÂ Vitorino.
Thank you very much for your excellent work.
I wish you all the best for the future.
I can say, on behalf of my political group, that you will be missed here, genuinely missed.
Thank you very much.
Â Â  Mr President, in looking to the future of an area of justice, could we also focus more attention on cooperation and access to justice in civil and commercial matters? It tends to be the Cinderella area pushed out by more topical issues, yet it touches the daily lives of our citizens and businesses.
A coherent civil and commercial legal order would ensure the proper functioning of the internal market and thereby the attainment of the Lisbon goals.
The basis of our approach must be mutual recognition, showing respect for our differing legal traditions and cultures.
However, we should also question whether we are not creating a more tangled legal web and a two-tier system of justice, one for cross-border cases and another for so-called internal cases, as with the legal aid directive.
An additional, optional, European cross-border justice system, which may emerge from the European payment order proposal, could bring less certainty and more confusion.
On 25 October we are meant to be celebrating the European Day of Civil Justice.
I wonder if many people will notice the celebration.
I would ask that we make it more visible in years to come.
Â Â  Mr President, as we debate an area of freedom, security and justice it is somewhat derisory that this proposed area extends all over Europe but does not appear to be available here in the European Parliament.
For Members to attack the purely personal views â and the right to express those views â of Commission candidates because they do not comply with their own is an example of intolerance which demeans our Assembly and the parties concerned.
If those are the principles of socialism and liberalism, they are deeply undesirable in this place.
In relation to the main issues, we do not need a prescriptive envelope.
It benefits us sometimes, in our area of freedom, security and justice, to have more bilateral and multilateral agreements, such as the agreement on joint investigation teams, an initiative I was proud to be involved in at the time.
However, we do not cooperate enough.
It is arguable that if we concentrated on more cooperation between Member States and organisations, instead of creating complex and over-reaching structures, we would achieve more practical results for our citizens and we would thereby encourage greater acceptance of the sort of Europe that they can really accept and benefit from.
In conclusion, I do not think I voted for Mr Vitorino.
I do not think I even liked him very much at first.
However, I want to make it clear that I think he has been an extremely effective and cooperative Commissioner and that he respected this House.
That, in my view, certainly puts him into a top category and I wish him the very best for the future.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr Vitorino, in this new phase of the Union, the area of freedom, security and justice must be strengthened in order to achieve greater efficiency and legitimacy in view of the new challenges facing us, which in some cases are genuine, acute, proven, dormant or latent threats to our fundamental values.
We believe it is essential for the European Union to commit itself to a common anti-terrorist political strategy which is able, unhesitatingly and with the determination allowed by the law, on the basis of reason and the desire to protect lives, to neutralise any terrorist organisation that acts within our area of freedoms or from our area of freedoms.
In that way we will enhance the credibility and trust in our democratic institutions amongst our citizens.
Mr President, we cannot promote or enhance our freedoms or rights unless we are able to defend them.
And those rights and freedoms are our greatest heritage.
Mr President, in order to contribute to this aim and this inescapable obligation we also need to respond to certain problems, such as the problem of asylum.
We need a common procedure and effective measures to protect refugees and to tackle the mafias who run the cruel traffic in those refugees.
We need common management of our external borders and, finally, it is essential to make great progress on judicial and criminal cooperation, particularly in the criminal field.
I am delighted at the level of agreement between the Council and Parliament, despite the reservations on the competences of the Court of Justice.
I would like to praise the Dutch Presidency for its sensitivity and to correct it: yes, terrorism is our principal and fundamental problem.
I will end, Mr President, by congratulating MrÂ Bourlanges and particularly Commissioner Vitorino, with whose speech I agree entirely.
Â Â  Mr Bourlangesâs excellent report has come as we approach the fifth anniversary of Tampere in 1999, which attempted to establish an area of freedom, security and justice.
In some respects, the situation we are facing in this plenary is a snapshot of what we have experienced over the past five years.
The Commission has always been present, with Mr Vitorinoâs intelligence and tenacity â and I wish to extend my greetings to him â and the Council, when it has not been absent, has proved incapable of making decisions.
I look at the Councilâs empty chair and I have the image of what has happened over the past five years in the area of freedom, security and justice.
I would like to believe that the European Council of 5Â November will be what Parliament was asking for in Mr Ribeiro e Castroâs resolution.
What we proposed was a Tampere II to evaluate the area of freedom, security and justice and to set fresh targets and timetables, with urgency and determination.
I must say, Mr Vitorino, that I feel that the agenda for the 5Â November Council, to which the Commission also contributed greatly, is a highly practical approach.
I agree with the overall principles of the political guidelines for the multi-annual programme.
The main priority must be to fight international terrorism by means of an across-the-board anti-terrorist strategy, at both EU Member State level and on a worldwide scale.
At the same time, there must be a policy of protecting and promoting fundamental rights and freedoms.
Special attention must also be paid to aspects such as controlling migratory flows, running the Border Management Agency, starting up the Visa Information System (VIS) and the second generation of the Schengen Information System, and stepping up security in the area of travel documents and visas.
Lastly, I should like to say to the absent Council that if setting up this area of freedom, security and justice is really one of the EUâs main political priorities, this must be clearly reflected in the allocation of sufficient funding in the coming Financial Perspectives.
Thank you very much.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to start by registering my strong protest at the lack of interpretation facilities in Maltese.
It is an official language of the European Union and yet the interpretation booth up there is empty.
These are shortcomings that are quite inconvenient and frankly unacceptable.
I wanted to take the floor to draw attention to the very serious situation that my country is facing on the issue of illegal immigration.
During the first nine months of this year alone, 1Â 200 boat people landed in Malta.
Some may think that 1Â 200 is not such an extraordinary number, but when you consider the size of Malta and its very high population density, one would immediately acknowledge that the situation is indeed very grave.
To give you a clearer picture, 1Â 200 immigrants landing in Malta are roughly equivalent â in terms of impact â to as many as 140Â 000 people landing in Sicily.
And this in the first nine months of this year alone.
Therefore, the impact is massive and it is clear that my country needs support to be able to cope with this serious situation.
On the issue of illegal immigration, it is very easy to point fingers at others.
It is less easy to shoulder the responsibility of dealing with a constant influx of boat people when you have insufficient means to cope with them.
Therefore, as a minimum, we must acknowledge that this is not just one country's problem, or that of a few countries: it is a common European problem.
As such we should seek a common European solution.
The European Union should therefore put its money where its mouth is and help the affected countries equip themselves better to cope with the situation.
In particular, adequate financial resources should be allocated to help them improve their infrastructure and services to be better able to handle the situation.
We say the European Union is built on the principle of subsidiarity.
On this issue the time has come to move from words to action and to express solidarity in practice.
Â Â  Â I should like to apologise for the lack of interpretation from Maltese, which is due to a shortage of interpreters.
This is of course no justification, and I hope that the situation will be rectified soon.
Â Â  âMr President, in my statement I would like to concentrate on the freedom of movement of citizens of the European Union.
This area of freedom and justice must justify its name in the coming years, not just on paper, but also in practice.
The citizens of the New Member States in particular will not feel themselves to be full citizens of the European Union until borders are actually removed for all EU citizens.
Unfortunately, the present documents do not adequately deal with existing problems regarding the implementation of the freedoms of European Union citizens, including the application of the so-called âvariable geometry schemeâ.
I believe that existing divisions also need to be addressed more clearly in the European Councilâs Tampere II programme.
We should avoid situations where citizens of third countries, for whom special regimes and regulations apply, are in a more favourable position compared to citizens of the New Member States.
In the near future, one practical question requiring serious work is the enlargement of the Schengen system to include the new members as quickly as possible.
We need to concentrate our political will, so that this opportunity can be created by 2007, not in theory but in practice.
The Council and the Commission need to allocate funds for this, in order to set up the necessary visa information system and ensure the availability of experts to carry out missions to the New Member States.
This process also involves targeted policies on the part of the European Union, which aim to bring to a conclusion the process of border agreement negotiation between the New Member States and their neighbours, for which the new members have done everything in their power.
Finally, I would like to thank Commissioner Vitorino for his very effective and valuable work in managing EU internal affairs and his considerable contribution to the European Convention.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I really am glad that todayâs agenda includes this topic, which is of such importance to every citizen of the EU, and I am very sad that many of the groups have left the Chamber.
In this area, too, our enlarged Union is facing new challenges, simply because our external borders have been moved, and we have to be able to guarantee that these will be well secured.
A coordinated border policy is a priority, and the securing of our external borders must be jointly funded, but I regard with some scepticism the establishment of a Corps of Border Guards for the EU.
Our future objective must be the creation of common asylum law and clear rules on migration, with the fixing of quotas being reserved to the Member States.
In this context, it is important that action be taken against illegal immigration.
Sacrosanct though the right to asylum is, immigration cannot be a right.
We also have to work towards greater cooperation with the states bordering the EU in dealing with asylum and migratory flows.
The protection of our citizens demands that we take action against terrorism and organised crime, and, in the area of data protection related to this, it is important that we come up with a good compromise between counter-terrorism, our economic interests and the rights of citizens.
Our policy must increasingly focus on combating child pornography, the traffic in women and drugs, corruption and on stabilising the Balkans.
In conclusion, and speaking on behalf of my own country, let me emphatically thank Commissioner Vitorino for his commitment and for his very positive efforts for the Europe in which we share.
Â Â  Â Â Â I should like to turn to the issue of asylum policy in the context of the new Member States.
The European Unionâs enlargement in 2004 was accompanied by a significant rise in applications for asylum in the new Member States.
According to the predictions of the UN High Commissioner for refugees, who recently paid a study visit to Poland, Slovakia and Hungary, numbers will continue to rise at the present rate in these countries for at least the next few years.
For example, following the escalation of the conflict in the North Caucasus, Poland is currently accepting the largest number of Chechen refugees.
Since mid-September their number has risen by several hundred per cent.
Every day, around 50Â Chechen citizens cross Polandâs eastern border.
Most of them are mothers with children, and a great many are unaccompanied children.
Work on a common asylum policy needs to be stepped up, and measures should and must be taken to set up a joint funding mechanism based on solidarity between Member States, as well as an organisational mechanism for the integration of persons granted refugee status.
An integrated system for border management and the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders also need to be created rapidly.
The Agency should commence its activities as soon as possible in order to establish common standards for protection of the European Unionâs external borders.
The most suitable place for the Agency to be located is Poland, as Poland has the longest land border in the European Union.
Â Â  Â That concludes the debate on the report.
I would like to invite MrÂ Vittorino to take the floor.
Â Â  Mr President, first of all, with regard to Members' remarks on the new generation of the Schengen information system, I would reiterate that according to our initial planning, the Commission is fully on time in its effort to guarantee that the new generation system will enter into force by 2007.
We hope that the new Member States will make maximum use of the Schengen facility to prepare themselves for the important moment when internal border controls are abolished.
My second remark is about the Lampedusa situation.
We recognise that the Italian authorities are under enormous pressure, but we have been reassured by the Italian Government that all those who arrive at Lampedusa asking for asylum are treated in accordance with international conventions, in particular the Geneva Convention.
Therefore, their requests for asylum have been analysed by the authorities in the field.
I would emphasise that it is up to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to verify the situation there.
Thirdly, I should like to reiterate that the pilot project that the Commission and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees intend to develop in Morocco, Mauritania, Algeria, Tunisia and Libya does not include anything about camps.
There is confusion on this point: the aim of the project is to strengthen national asylum systems.
It does have anything to do with camps.
I share the views of several Members of the House who have emphasised the need to guarantee that in the next financial perspectives there are sufficient financial tools to improve solidarity in the management of internal borders and in the management of migratory and asylum flows.
I hope that we can count on the support of the House on the Commission's proposal on this matter.
Finally, I would like very much to thank several Members of the House for the very kind words that they addressed to me.
I left this House as a Member of Parliament ten years ago, and I am now leaving as a Member of the Commission.
Goodness knows in what capacity I might come back!
Â Â  Â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 11.30Â a.m.
Â Â  Â The next item is the report (A6-0013/2004) by MrsÂ Gill on Draft amending budget NoÂ 9 of the European Union for the financial year 2004.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to set out the history and the role of European Data Protection Supervisor and the reasons for draft amending budget No 9.
Earlier this year the European Data-Protection Supervisor and the Assistant Supervisor were appointed. This is three years after the regulation came into force.
In February this year the Commission presented preliminary draft amending budget No 2, providing the appropriations for the budget lines in Section VIII (B) of the 2004 budget.
The Commission proposed an overall amount of EUR 1.2 million for the Data Protection Supervisor to start his activities.
The proposal was endorsed at the time by the Council and Parliament, and the new Data Protection Supervisor MrÂ Hustinx and the Assistant Supervisor Mr Delgado have started working and are based in the premises of the European Parliament.
So, this amending budget No 9 will modify the appropriations of the EDPS by topping up the amount granted in amending budget No 2, which was passed earlier this year.
However, it should be noted that the figures that were originally foreseen in amending budget No 2 were only for nine months.
They were predicted in 2001 and the fact is that the Data Protection Supervisor came into being in 2004.
As a result of this delay of two years, this particular amending budget is necessary because we need to increase the appropriations in commitments by over EUR 670Â 000 and in revenue by EUR 170Â 000.
Furthermore, additional amounts of some EUR 300Â 000 are needed to cover ongoing legal commitments.
This includes remuneration of members of the institution; there is an adjustment to the appropriations for staff; there are also issues with regard to graduate traineeships and exchanges of officials.
In addition, there is a requirement for rent and for data processing and telecommunications.
I am also proposing that we enter EUR 200Â 000 in the reserve.
We will be reducing some of the appropriations for mission expenses, secretarial allowances, translation and interpretation costs, as well as expenditure on publishing and information.
As I said earlier, these problems came about because the European Parliament and the Council adopted the regulation in 2001.
The main purpose of this regulation is the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies.
With regard to the free movement of such data, this regulation established an independent supervisory authority, called the European Data Protection Supervisor.
This Supervisor is responsible for monitoring the processing of personal data by Community institutions and will work with each institution and its data protection officer.
The Supervisor will deal with sensitive personal data, relating for example to health methods and evaluation of staff.
I am pleased to inform the House that the Council has adopted this draft amending budget.
However, I need to point out that in the debate in the Committee on Budgets there were some reservations about the costs.
Given that this is a newly established institution, we are prepared to accept this particular budget as it is.
Yet I do want to make it clear that in the future we want to see greater budgetary rigour as well as better planning and forecasting on the part both of the Commission and these new institutions that we are establishing.
I appreciate that there are constraints in relation to how the money can be spent, the legal basis, and so on. However, we have to ensure that we have better forecasting.
Looking at the number of amending budgets and so forth, we must also remember that we are at a critical point and that Parliament will be establishing a new temporary committee on the financial perspectives.
It is therefore important that whilst we fight for our main political objectives â which will be enshrined in the new financial perspectives â we also examine some of the internal structures, as well as interâinstitutional arrangements.
Our internal procedures are often too complicated for the EU citizen to understand.
We need to simplify the budgetary process.
It is important to remember that what we are doing today is not just a question of technical information in the report: it matters to my constituents in West Midlands and it matters to everybody's constituents across Europe.
This new institution will protect our citizens in relation to data processing, which is everâincreasing.
That is a good thing and I am very pleased to recommend to the House that we adopt this amending budget as it stands.
Â Â  . Mr President, Mrs Gill, ladies and gentlemen, the report that has now been presented deals with practical implementation of Article 8 of the EUâs Charter of Fundamental Rights, which covers the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data, which has been yet another of the European Unionâs successes in recent years.
The role of European Data Protection Supervisor was established as long ago as 1997 by the Treaty of Amsterdam.
Protection of fundamental rights in the EU, including the protection of personal data, was advanced in particular by the adoption of the Charter of Fundamental Rights in 2000.
On 22 December 2003, the European Parliament and the Council agreed to the appointment of the European Data Protection Supervisor, which became effective on 17Â January 2004.
The European Data Protection Supervisor has the task of ensuring the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and the free movement of such data through the Community institutions and bodies established by this Treaty or on the basis of it.
This is the third time in this year that this new supervisory body has been the subject of an amending budget.
On 9 May, your House adopted the Second Amending Budget, which allocated the Data Protection Supervisor the sum of EURÂ 1.272 million and 15 posts in the 2004 Budget.
The organisation plan takes into account the Fourth Amending Budget relating to the introduction of the new Staff Regulations for officials and other servants.
Mrs Gillâs report proposes that the draft Ninth Amending Budget be adopted without amendment.
The amending estimates for 2004 are based on assumed expenditure of EURÂ 670Â 279 and assumed income of EURÂ 172Â 443.
Section VIII, Part B for the 2004 Budget year amounts to EURÂ 1.9 million in total and provides for the conversion of three permanent posts into temporary ones, with no change in the number of staff employed, as approved in this yearâs Second Amending Budget.
To the rapporteur, I extend my very warm thanks for the support given to this draft, for the report itself, and for Parliamentâs support in this area.
Â Â  Mr President, I speak on behalf of Mr Ferber, who is unable to be with us this evening, and also in my capacity as PPE-DE Group shadow rapporteur to Mrs Gill.
The committee has been disappointed at the perceived inability to control the budget for the body in question, although I accept that it was only introduced this year.
I was delighted when an institutional administrative cooperation agreement was signed in June between the Commission, Parliament and the Council.
This was designed firstly to ensure that this body took advantage of the experience gained in other institutions in the administrative and financial fields through the transfer of know-how; secondly to enable it immediately to take its place as an institution by exercising its functions and prerogatives; and, finally, to ensure compliance with the golden rule of good financial management through the introduction of economies of scale.
We have not seen enough of the latter, which is why the PPE-DE Group abstained when it came to the vote on this particular supplementary and amending budget.
We did not want to cause any disruption to the process and passage of the budget, but what we did â and MrsÂ Gill will bear this out â was to urge extreme caution for 2005.
This will be a matter for another rapporteur, I know, but given that the EUR 1.2Â million initially required rose to 1.9Â million, as the Commissioner has just said, and 2.8Â million is being requested for next year, I would urge the greatest of caution, because we expect better financial management than this.
We have no grumbles or gripes about what this organisation does â it is badly needed â but we do have our concerns about how it does it.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, my greetings to the Commission.
Establishing the Office of the Data Protection Supervisor is an appropriate and necessary step.
The draft amending budget under discussion is a routine matter connected with this, which we should adopt in accordance with MrsÂ Gillâs proposal.
In connection with this, I would like to remind the Commission that it ought to take more drastic action in getting the work of the European Chemicals Agency underway as soon as the legislation on chemicals has been passed.
The decision to set up a Chemicals Agency has been made by the European Council.
It will not start its work in good time, however, unless preparatory work is done to provide office space and undertake other tasks to establish the Agency in Helsinki; faster, moreover, than has currently been the case with the establishment of the Office of the Data Protection Supervisor.
There has been an astonishing amount of time wasted with regard to this project.
The number of offices and agencies has already grown from seven to 23 since the start of the millennium, and in just the same way as we are now about to open the Office of the Data Protection Supervisor in Greece, we must also, in a credible manner, set about the task of fulfilling the promise made to Finland.
The work of the Chemicals Agency must begin at the first opportunity.
Â Â  Mr President, all one can say is here we go again folks, roll up and see the incredible bureaucrats of Brussels make another 1.2 million pounds of taxpayers money vanish in the blink of an eye.
Watch in amazement as they create yet another unwanted institution designed to bury our hard-pressed business community in realms of delightful new paperwork.
Before your very eyes see the European Union keep on getting bigger and bigger.
At the stroke of a pen a new interfering busybody will be given a gigantic budget with which to expand their personal fiefdom and create another mountain of red tape.
Mr President, the nation states can and do make their own arrangements on data protection.
Britain has its own dataâprotection register and very detailed regulations to go with it.
We simply do not need this post of European DataâProtection Supervisor and I strongly urge Members to vote against this amending budget and, just for once, to say 'no' to the EU empire builders.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, the good thing about the tail end of a debate is always that one can listen attentively, and I, personally, would say that every one of the speeches made had something plausible about it.
To come to the point, though, my position is that it makes sense, when there are so many European regulations, that there should be, and must be, a European Data Protection Supervisor.
I do believe, though, that it makes little sense to do this in the way that is being attempted now.
I think the conservatives had good reason to abstain, and that there are very, very good reasons for voting against.
Instead of making much more efficient use of what we have and retrieving things that have long been available, we are again attempting to add on new things, and to that I am indeed opposed.
I see the Data Protection Supervisor as another example of how one could manage efficiently with much less.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all IÂ would like to support the proposed draft for the amended budget of the European Union for 2004 regarding the European Data Protection Supervisor item.
At the same time, however, in connection with the budgetary management of the European Union in the first seven months of 2004, IÂ would like to express my concern at the obvious discrepancy between the handover of contributions, 74% of which have been paid, and the handover of payments, only 54% of which have been paid and which are lagging behind quite noticeably.
When projected onto the budget of the Slovak Republic for the first nine months of 2004, this represents aÂ 70% fulfilment of contributions to the budgets of the European Union while just 15% of the projected yearly payments from the European Union budget have been made.
This situation means that instead of receiving post-entry aid, Slovakia and the other new Member States have become net contributors to the European Union budget.
This state of affairs should be subjected to urgent scrutiny, both at the level of the European Commission and at the level of the Council of Europe and the national governments.
Thank you very much.
Â Â  Â That brings us to the end of the list of speakers.
I declare todayâs sitting closed.
(1)
(1)
Â Â  Mr President, I rise to speak on statements made in France by one of the Members of this House, Mr Gollnisch.
I would like to give two or three examples of remarks which he has recently made; âthere is not a serious historian alive today who adheres completely to the conclusions of the Nuremberg trialâ, âas to the existence of the gas chambers, that is up to the historians to determineâ, and âI question the number of victims of the Holocaustâ.
Such comments cannot be allowed to go unchallenged, and I would ask you, Mr President, to refer the matter to the Bureau.
These comments, made by a Member of Parliament, are an attack on the values which formed a basis for the construction of both the EU itself and the Charter of Fundamental Rights, as included in the Constitutional Treaty. I should like to say from the outset that if a debate were to be held on parliamentary immunity as a result of the legal proceedings which cannot fail to be instigated, I would be in favour of waiving this immunity.
Â Â  â Mr President, I have a request to make of you.
Yesterday, the Conference of Presidents, which both Mr Watson and I attended, decided to ask the President of Parliament, Mr Borrell, to forward to the President-designate of the Commission, Mr Barroso, the letters from the various committees of this House containing the outcomes of the hearings, so that he could take note of them and draw his own conclusions from them.
I read in yesterdayâs evening newspapers and in yesterday eveningâs press agency reports that Mr Barroso, even though these letters are not yet in his possession, is already making statements about the outcomes of the hearings, to the effect that he is not interested in what the letters contain, regards â in as many words â his own Commission as perfectly suitable, and is unwilling to make any changes.
I would ask you, Mr President, to ensure that Mr Barroso is given to understand that my group is no longer prepared to be on the receiving end of this sort of talk.
If Mr Barroso wants the Socialist Group in the European Parliament to have any confidence in him, he will have to take a different approach to this House.
The fact is that this is not just about Mr Buttiglione, but now also about Mr Barroso himself.
I would ask you, Mr President, to see to it that Mr Barroso, when he receives these letters, also receives along with them the message that we expect a different attitude from the President-designate of the Commission.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, the Bureau has been examining the issue raised by MrÂ Poignant since yesterday evening, and the Presidentâs thoughts on the matter are very similar to those which you have just expressed.
Mr Schulzâs remark will naturally be forwarded to the relevant bodies.
Â Â  Before opening the debate, I have a statement to make.
I have received from MrÂ Matsakis a letter and a legal opinion concerning the request from the public prosecutor of the Republic of Cyprus to waive his parliamentary immunity, which was noted by the European Parliament on 13Â OctoberÂ 2004.
In his letter, MrÂ Matsakis challenges the public prosecutorâs authority to make such a request.
Pursuant to Rule 6(3), the letter has been forwarded to the Committee on Legal Affairs, the only committee competent to deal with such matters, to verify the public prosecutorâs authority to make the request.
Â Â  The next item is oral questions to the Council and the Commission on the function of the Communityâs Generalised System of Preferences for the ten-year period from 2006 to 2015.
I hope that the Commission will join us as soon as possible, and in the meantime I should like to begin by giving the floor to Mrs Morgantini, the author of the question.
Â Â  I hope that todayâs debate will only mark the beginning of a useful and necessary collaboration between institutions and between committees of this Parliament on a question of the greatest importance for the Committee on Development, a committee that I have the honour â not too greatly merited perhaps â to chair, and which I am representing today.
Since its creation in 1971, the Generalised System of Preferences has become an essential instrument of the development policy of the European Union.
I should also like to emphasise the good name that accrues to the European Community, in that it was the first to put this system into practice from 1971 and today, in actual fact, it is still the major donor in terms of trade concessions to developing countries.
In examining the Commission communication, we started from a principle according to which the main objective of the Generalised System of Preferences is, and must above all continue to be, the economic and social development of those countries, pursued in the spirit of international solidarity that should govern the foreign policy of the Union.
In this context, we welcome the objectives put in place by the communication, namely the simplification of the regimes, the concentration of preferences on those developing countries that need them most and, above all, the promotion of sustainable development.
We are fully cognisant that in order to attain these objectives the current system will have to undergo substantial reform.
We cannot, however, ignore the fact that any change to the current system will have considerable effects in the countries that currently benefit from that system.
There will be favourable effects but also, as representatives of various countries have pointed out, adverse effects.
It is for this reason that the European Parliament has wished to make its voice heard from the very beginning of the reform process, namely to take note of the concerns, the opinions and the points of view of stakeholder countries.
It seems to me that this democratic necessity is even more essential and important at this time, when the Commission has, to tell the truth, most regrettably not consulted adequately with interested parties before formulating its proposals.
One must take into account, on the other hand, that the Council did take the opportunity to consult the European Parliament at its last meeting.
The opinions I am expressing today, as Chairman of the Committee on Development, are therefore only preliminary opinions, but they also appear in the motion that all the political groups have deemed it advisable to sign.
Hence I trust that todayâs debate will nevertheless help to clarify the issue and above all will allow the Commission to include some of our demands in the regulation that must be adopted by the Commissioners probably on 20Â October.
Consequently, I should wish to request the Commission to reply to the questions that we have posed in our examination.
In detail, there are three issues on which I should like to insist: the graduation mechanism, the functioning of GSP+ and the reform of the system of rules of origin.
With regard to the first, while we welcome the simplification of the graduation mechanism, the fact that the Commission is proposing to base it exclusively on the criterion of market share, leaving aside any indicators of development and poverty, almost fills us with dismay.
We cannot overlook the fact that these arrangements could have very negative consequences for major exporters.
Without being necessarily hostile, we should therefore like to join the Commission and the Council in studying the consequences and the modality of this proposal in great detail in the coming months.
In relation to the new GSP+ system, which we consider to be of benefit, given that it supports sustainable development, it seems essential to us, however, to define criteria that are clear, reliable and at the same time realistic.
We should like to see a firm commitment by the Commission to supply the necessary technical assistance.
In conclusion, I should like to stress that one of the obstacles to an efficient use of the system has, as we know, been the system of rules of origin.
That is why we welcome a substantial reform of the system which favours regional expansion, although we hope that good intentions will result in concrete initiatives: a proposal, therefore, and an examination of the systems applied by other countries.
I shall stop here, aware that I have highlighted only a few aspects of this difficult subject, but that is all I can do in the time allotted to me.
As for the rest, I very much want to hear my dear fellow Member, Mr BarÃ³n Crespo, Chairman of the Committee on International Trade, and, of course, my other fellow Members, as well as the replies â which I trust will be detailed â that the Commission and the Council may possibly provide.
I truly hope that we can have a fruitful collaboration that can yield positive results.
Â Â  Commissioner, Luisa, I am delighted to be able to present a question jointly with the Chairman of the Committee on Development.
As you know, it is normal amongst parliamentary committees to fight for competences but, in this case, I believe that working together is a good omen for this new term in office.
Turning to the Commission â in relation to the Communication it has presented on the Generalised System of Preferences âI would like to add to MrsÂ Morgatiniâs positive assessment with the following observations:
Firstly, we believe it would be very useful â and this can be done when the proposal for a Regulation is presented â for there to be an assessment of the functioning of the system, for us to work on the basis of more than ten years experience and for the interested parties to be consulted.
I believe this would be useful for everybody, including the Commission.
With regard to the general elements of the Communication, I would like to point out firstly that if we want the GSP to make a greater and better contribution to the development of the neediest countries, the commercial preferences must reflect the comparative advantages and export interests of those countries.
It is also important that the preferences cover more products and, above all, that a significant number of products currently considered sensitive be transferred to the non-sensitive category.
To this end, we must consider the possibility of broadening the preferential margin.
Secondly, I would also like to say that our committees are pleased with the Commissionâs determination to improve and simplify the system of rules of origin.
I would urge the Commission to promote an accumulation of trans-regional origin and to move towards harmonising the rules of origin systems in the various existing commercial agreements and systems.
Finally, please allow me to refer to the new single system of additional preferences â known as GSP+.
Although the creation of this new system responds, at least in part, to the need to dismantle the current âDrug Systemâ following the decision of the WTO panel, I believe it is very important to ensure that the current beneficiaries of the system enjoy a reasonable transitional period in order to meet the new requirements that the GSP+ imposes on them, so that they are not suddenly faced with the loss of preferences which they very much need and which they have justly deserved until now.
With a view to guaranteeing a reasonable degree of transparency and democratic control, I would ask the Commission and the Council to begin a process of consultation on the first Regulation on the application of the new GSP sufficiently in advance for the associated countries, the non-governmental agents and the institutions of the European Union â including the European Parliament first and foremost â to participate and be adequately consulted.
In this regard, I believe the Councilâs conclusions approved in Luxembourg on 11Â October are positive, since they refer to the need for explicit consultation with Parliament, thus going further than what is currently laid down in the Treaties.
I hope that both Mr Lamy and Mr NicolaÃ¯ will make a firm commitment in this regard.
I would like to end my speech, Mr President, by highlighting the presence here today of Commissioner Lamy, which is an example â perhaps the last example â of his excellent willingness to cooperate with this House.
As you all know, Mr Lamy has been an enthusiastic interlocutor with Parliament throughout the last term in office and a defender of joint work.
Since I do not know whether I will have another opportunity to do so, I will end by inviting my fellow Members to join me in thanking the Commissioner for his excellent work on the Trade portfolio and in particular for the spirit of cooperation he has demonstrated in his work as Commissioner.
[Mr Lamy, I wish you every success in your next reincarnation].
Â Â  . Mr President, thank you.
Like the honourable Members of this House, the Council welcomes the Commissionâs communication on developing countries, international trade and sustainable development, the role of the Communityâs Generalised System of Preferences for the period 2006-2015 and, above all, the general objective outlined therein.
The GSP should be stable, predictable, objective, simple, transparent and compatible with the WTO, and it must take account of the developing countriesâ specific needs.
The Council backs the Commissionâs efforts towards a comprehensive simplification of the GSP, the general objective of which is to help the developing countries drive back poverty and promote sustainable development.
For that purpose, the countries eligible for GSP must be selected on the basis of objective development criteria.
Like the European Parliament, the Council notes that further information is required about implementation before a definitive position can be adopted, so that it can, at this stage, say only a few words about the basic principles that are explained in the Commissionâs communication.
As is stated in the Councilâs and Commissionâs declaration about the European Communityâs development policy, the Council takes the view that the common trade policy can lend force to the objectives of the development policy, with specific reference to the eradication of poverty and the promotion of sustainable development, of which the fight against drugs forms an integral component.
Preferential access to the markets of the developed countries is a contributory factor in the economic development of the developing countries and helps to integrate them into the global economy.
I would now like to address a number of specific questions raised by the honourable Members of this House, and I should like to start with the GSP+.
The Council is prepared to give favourable consideration to the GSP+ proposal.
The substantial preferential rights conferred by GSP+ encourage developing countries to abide by treaties in the areas of human rights, labour rights, the environment and good governance, of which the fight against drugs forms an important component.
However, a number of crucial aspects still need to be addressed, including a list of relevant treaties, the question of which treaties will be compulsory, the conditions and procedures for awarding and withdrawing the GSP+, fourthly, the monitoring systems that will be used; fifthly, any additional criteria which are tied in with the beneficiariesâ development needs, and, finally, the possible transitional regulation for the beneficiaries of the present incentive regulations which are unlikely to qualify for the GSP.
Â Â  . Mr President, the Generalised System of Preferences has now been in existence for nearly 30 years.
It consists of granting preferential tariffs, or reductions in customs duties, to nearly 180 developing countries, on the basis of general principles which we revise every ten years.
As it encourages European importers to source supplies from these countries, the Generalised System of Preferences is in fact an aid to development through trade.
The system which was adopted ten years ago will expire in late 2005, and in 2006 a new ten-year cycle will begin.
This is why I presented a Commission communication to the Council and to Parliament last July, the aim of which was to outline the general principles which will act as a basis for implementing legislation during this new period.
This legislation will in turn provide a framework for Council regulations, and it will be possible to revise these regulations every three years in order to adapt them to economic realities, if experience shows that these have changed.
The European Union is the most generous partner by a long way with regard to trade preferences, and nearly EUR 53 billion of trade flows benefit from them, without mentioning the ACP regime.
These figures mean that we exceed by a long way all the other countries in this field, as only USDÂ 17 billion of trade flows benefit from preferences granted by the United States, which is the second largest donor.
In addition, we are all aware that the EUâs enlargement to include ten new Member States can only increase its superiority in this area.
In response to Mrs Morgantini and Mr BarÃ³n Crespo, the results produced by the GSP have been evaluated, and we have been provided with all the figures which are currently available.
The evaluation shows that, broadly speaking, the system has produced positive results, but that there is still room for improvement.
Be that as it may, the system has produced positive results; for example, the latest definitive figures available show that, between 2000 and 2002, our imports under this system grew from EURÂ 47Â billion to EURÂ 53Â billion, which is a significant growth, especially as certain products were removed from the GSP list for technical reasons.
Similarly, the GSP utilisation rate, or the ratio of trade flows which are theoretically eligible for GSP to imports which actually benefit from GSP, has regularly increased over the past few years, and currently stands at nearly 55%.
These are therefore the positive aspects, which demonstrate that the system works.
In contrast, the currentÂ incentive regimes, and in particular all matters relating to the application of the social and environmental clauses, have had little success, as only two beneficiary countries, Sri Lanka and Moldova, which are not exactly giants of global trade, benefit from the social clause.
We should take these experiences into account,Â and the objectives of the Commissionâs proposed reform are therefore to make the system of preferences simpler, more generous, more targeted at the countries which need it and more objective.
Firstly, the system must be made simpler.
Why?
Because a simpler system will be more targeted at developing countries and at operators in these countries who need security.
This is why we propose moving from a five-pillar system, which is what we have at present, to a three-pillar system.
The five pillars include the general arrangements, the social clause, the environmental clause, the drugs regime and the âEverything But Armsâ initiative, which is in force for the least advanced countries.
I propose a move from five pillars to three; general arrangements will be kept in place, and the âEverything But Armsâ initiative will exist for the least advanced countries. There will also be an intermediary regime called GSP Plus, which will encourage sustainable development in all its aspects, including those relating to social, environmental and good governance issues and to the fight against drugs.
GSP Plus will abolish customs duties for beneficiary countries which have committed themselves to ratifying and applying the main international conventions in the field.
Which conventions would this involve?
We propose choosing conventions which are, so to speak, âunquestionedâ in the international arena, such as the United Nations pacts on political, economic, social and cultural rights, the International Labour Organisationâs fundamental Conventions, or the United Nations Convention against Corruption.
Accession to some of these conventions will be mandatory in order for countries to benefit from GSP Plus, for example the two United Nations pacts, the eight International Labour Organisation Conventions, conventions against racial discrimination or that concerning women and all conventions relating to torture, childrenâs rights and genocide.
We will of course demand that these conventions be ratified, and indeed not merely ratified but also applied effectively â this in response to MrsÂ Morgantiniâs second comment.
We expect there to be a two-fold evaluation in this area, the first being carried out when applications are assessed, as access to GSP Plus will be refused to beneficiary countries which make no commitments in this field.
The second evaluation will consist of asking the competent international organisations to carry out some kind of evaluation of the application of each convention.
A country such as Belarus, for example, whatever progress it makes with ratifying these conventions, could not at present be eligible.
So much for conventions.
The system will therefore be simpler, and also more generous.
Why more generous?
Because customs duties are frequently eroded during multilateral trade negotiations, which means that the comparative advantage for countries benefiting from the system of preferences is also eroded.
We must therefore compensate for this tariff erosion if we wish to maintain the benefits gained by developing countries from the GSP, and we propose extending the coverage of the GSP to include a certain number of new products, so that this tariff erosion is compensated by a growth of the export base.
We are in the process of discussing this growth within the Commission, with a newÂ deadline next week, and this is a point to which I shall return. We will deal with issues which are difficult, delicate and sensitive, but upon which we wish to make progress, as is the case with fisheries products.

Still on the subject of a greater generosity, and in response to Mrs Morgantiniâs third comment, we intend to put forward proposals to adapt the rules of origin.
As has been shown in a large number of studies, the rules of origin are a necessary condition for access to trade preferences.
The conditions which we impose with regard to the origin of products do not exist in order to take with the left hand what we give with the right, but in order to guarantee that preferences actually benefit the country at which we are targeting them, and not others instead.
In order to achieve this, conditions regulating origin and checks of origin are required.
That said, it is true that the rules in force today were drawn up several decades ago, at a time when the European Union was more defensive in its trade policy than is the case today.
We must therefore adjust them in order to move away from the old system and to take into account the fact that processes today have changed.
For example, in the context of globalisation and international division, as a result of which production processes have been splintered among different countries, renewed attention must be paid to the issue of whether there should be a cumulation of origin between the country from which the goods originate and certain countries from which other inputs used in the manufacture of the same goods may come.
It is therefore in this spirit that we intend to put forward proposals, following the Green Paper which we published with Mr Bolkestein late last year.
For example, and as just suggested by Mr BarÃ³n Crespo, research could be carried out into ways in which the system could be relaxed in order to encourage the regional integration of countries benefiting from preferences.
The reformâs third objective is to target preferences at the countries which need them most.
This is clearly a politically sensitive issue, as there will be winners and losers as a result of any reform of this kind.
We intend to target the system of preferences at the beneficiary countries which need it most, which in reality means the smallest developing countries, those which are landlocked and those which are the most vulnerable, and not the large countries which already occupy positions of increasing significance in international trade, such as Chinaâs position in the international textile and clothing trade.
We will of course keep the âEverything But Armsâ system in place for the poorest countries, as trade integration under this system is one of the characteristic features of the EUâs development policy.
As well as limiting the criteria, we will therefore also need to continue helping a certain number of countries to gain access to our market and, once they have done so, to follow this up with a system of graduation.
Quite simply, and in response to MrsÂ Morgantiniâs first comment, we wish to carry out a radical simplification of the graduation system in order to meet the requirements of the World Trade Organisation, following cases against India on the drugs regime which were heard before WTO panels and which we lost at least partially.
Our response on this issue will be to target graduation at the idea of competitiveness of beneficiary products.
The key criterion will be market share, and the trigger for graduation will be a given percentage of imports into the Community.
From the moment when a developing country achieves a certain share of the market in the European Union, we will consider that we have done what is necessary to help it export and that, to use a metaphor, the country can now fly with its own wings.
Where will the threshold lie?
It is still a little early to give you any figures, as we are in the process of discussing the issue within the Commission.
This will clearly have consequences for the countries concerned.
That said, I can already assure you that whatever the final figure we choose, it will be the very large exporter countries which could be affected, and not the majority of our beneficiaries, of which there are a total of 180, as I just mentioned.
The last point upon which I wish to speak, MrÂ President, is in response to the oral questions.
I understand from MrsÂ Morgantiniâs speech that she is concerned that this House should be able to express its opinion fully on this new project.
It goes without saying that we hope that this House will give its opinion, as this reform is important both from the point of view of development and from that of trade policy, and I should like to thank Mr BarÃ³n Crespo for his comments on the work of this Commission, in particular in its relations with Parliament, an aspect which will remain unchanged.
It is quite simply the case that we have a number of time constraints, to which I referred very recently when I spoke before the parliamentary committee which is responsible for such issues.
Firstly, we could not begin this reform before the arrival of the new Member States last May.
It is absolutely essential that we involve them in a decision which will be binding upon the Union until 2015.
Secondly, it was necessary to wait for the decision on a dispute brought before the WTO, namely the proceedings instituted against us by IndiaÂ with regard to the drugs regime.
This decision was taken in April 2004, and it was then that we were able to start in-depth work.
In addition, as this reform is to enter into force on 1 January 2006, it should be completed one year earlier if possible.
Why one year earlier?
In order to allow beneficiary countries and economic operators to adapt to it.
This means that the first implementing regulation should be adopted during the next few months.
Next week, on 20 October, I will present it to my colleagues, and it will be available to you immediately afterwards.
I am aware and I understand that Parliament requires a certain amount of time; we will of course do all that we can to ensure that it has this time, and, as you know, our staff is entirely at your disposal.
To put it in simple terms, the goal is to help developing countries to export goods to us.
These are developing countries and, by definition, they need more time than others to adjust to rules which can sometimes be complicated, even if the system we are putting in place will be a simplified one.
My feelings are therefore that they will need at least nine to ten months, and this is the message I would like to convey to this House.
I am sure that those of you who are committed to the system for development policy reasons will understand my concern on this point.
Â Â  Mr President, it has already been stated that the Generalised System of Preferences offers trade benefits to the countries that are most in need of them.
In the European Union, we have established millennium objectives for development and have committed to those. They are, above all, focused on fighting poverty.
The economic development is a key condition in this respect, and so we think it is upon this that the revision should focus.
It is unfortunate that we need to do this under time pressure now that the complaint lodged by India with the WTO has been declared founded.
Our group is of the opinion â one fortunately shared by the Commissioner â that, firstly, the poorest countries should not become poorer still.
In those cases where preferences have been eroded by lowering the rates for most-favoured nations, we would therefore ask the Commission to consider what else could be done.
Secondly, we think that the system of graduation must meet its objective that the only countries or sectors to be excluded should be those that are already operating sufficiently competitively within the market and thus no longer need the GSP.
Also, it is our view that good governance should certainly be given a place in the new GSP+.
Finally, revision should also mean that the countries for which the GSP+ is specifically designed could make more use of it.
What should become the most important instrument is being used only for 52%, or 55%, as the Commissioner stated a moment ago.
This increase is positive, but the result is not yet satisfactory.
I have two questions for the Commission.
The idea behind the GSPâs revision is sound and clear; the intention is to create a simpler, more transparent and more objective system, and here, it goes without saying, we are completely behind the Commission.
What is less clear is how exactly this can be achieved.
For example, how does the Commission aim to prevent the planned GSP+ regulation, which admittedly will become one single regulation, from not becoming too complex in terms of implementation, adherence and control so that there is in practice too little of the proposed simplification and transparency?
The other question, which has already been raised, concerns assessment.
According to the communication, there is no assessment, or no sound assessment at any rate, a statement denied by both Mr Mandelson and Mr Lamy.
If this assessment is available, could Parliament have this without delay?
Thank you.
Â Â  Mr President, MrÂ Lamy, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank you, MrÂ Lamy, for the detailed information you have provided us with on the way in which this reform will be implemented. Against a background of trade globalisation, the reform demonstrates the will of the European Union to make market laws subject to the development objectives of the poorest countries and to human rights objectives, as well as testifying to our ambition to make globalisation more moral.

In this context, a thorough evaluation must be carried out of the previous system, and in particular of its impact on the goal of poverty reduction.
The complex and partial nature of agreements has sometimes made it impossible to achieve any kind of overview of the way in which the system works, especially as the close relations between exporting countries and certain multinational companies have prevented a thorough evaluation of the systemâs impact.
The Commissionâs proposal to simplify the system is therefore to be welcomed.
I should also like to emphasise how important it is to clarify the conditions according to which preferential tariffs are granted, in particular with regard to respect for core labour standards.
The need to promote core labour standards goes well beyond relations between poor nations and rich nations.
Two conditions must be fulfilled in order to ensure that the system is as meaningful and effective as possible; industrialised countries must naturally be prepared to comply with it, but beneficiary developing nations must also take advantage of it to reduce inequalities within their countries and to improve living and working conditions for their populations.
The way to achieve this, of course, is to incorporate criteria and conditions into the system which guarantee respect for workersâ rights and for the human rights conventions to which you referred.
In this respect, it is essential that a distinction be made between the ratification of international conventions and their effective application.
All our attention must be directed towards ensuring that future regulations clearly indicate the need for beneficiary countries both to have ratified international conventions on core labour standards and to apply them effectively and in full.
Procedures for evaluating these two aspects must therefore also be laid down.
Whilst on the subject of procedures, why should social partners not be involved in these evaluations by means of consultations?
This would provide a guarantee that the experience and practical knowledge held by trade unions in the field of core labour standards would be put to use.
More specifically, the European Union should endeavour to promote a greater effectiveness of the instruments of the International Labour Organisation, for example by the possible opening of enquiries to monitor respect for core labour standards under the GSP procedure.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European preferential system is certainly, post-enlargement, the most important and most generous system in the world by far.
It follows that any change to the system has crucial implications for everyone concerned.
The livelihoods of many producers in developing countries, but also in Europe, depend on it.
I share the Commissionâs view that the system should be simplified and should focus more on the countries in greatest need of it in order to be able to compete within the global market.
What is important is that the system should become more flexible so that there can be systematic investigation of whether some sectors in beneficiary countries still really need the system in order to be competitive.
If a country is guilty of unfair trading practices, of violating the WTO rules or human rights, a temporary suspension should always be possible.
In short, I support the Commissionâs objectives with regard to the GSP, but like Mrs Martens, I have my doubts whether the proposed reforms will reach far enough in order to achieve the planned objectives.
It is, for example, unclear why the number of beneficiary countries is not subject to a thorough review, so that countries that are in the Top 20 in terms of world trade no longer walk away with preferences that are, in fact, intended for the poorest.
It is also very much the question, Commissioner, whether the proposed reform is in keeping with the WTOâs current Doha round, at the end of which the poorest countries are to be awarded full quota-free and tariff-free imports.
I can understand Commissioner Lamy when he states that prompt action is needed, but like the Council, I should like to insist on thorough consultation with the European Parliament and on all parties involved being given the time to adapt.
It appears from the resolution on which we will be voting today that there is broad consensus about this revision.
I therefore hope that the Commission will be making every effort to take Parliamentâs opinion, which is unanimous, into consideration.
Â Â  Mr President, I welcome the plans for serious revision of the GSP, which is long overdue.
I also welcome the Council's recent conclusions, which very clearly demand meaningful consultation with the European Parliament.
It is a matter of regret that the Commission's Communication was not the result of a full stakeholder consultation and did not appear sufficiently in advance to allow for meaningful consultation before the release of the next regulation.
It is vital that Parliament and all other interested stakeholders have a proper opportunity to input into this very important process, and I am glad that Commissioner Lamy has agreed to that.
In terms of substance, it is clear that the GSP urgently needs to be simplified since it is clearly not working properly.
The rules of origin requirements are far too strict, with the result that a large proportion of developing-country exports to the EU fail to gain preferential access because they are deemed to be non-originating.
One of the justifications for strict rules of origin is that they should promote so-called backward linkages, i.e. the production of intermediate goods in developing countries themselves.
Yet the experience of this clearly demonstrates that rules of origin are not an appropriate instrument to achieve that goal.
In fact, most developing countries are small, with little capacity to develop a full supply chain.
Sri Lanka is a classic example, having developed a thriving garment sector but still not having the capacity to supply textiles to support that industry.
It relies essentially on an indirect instrument of trade policy to foster a supply response in developing countries that is likely to be much less efficient and much more vulnerable to abuse than straightforward financial incentives or technical assistance or infrastructure provision for the industries concerned.
I am pleased that Mr Lamy says that we are going to have some real action on rules of origin.
The Commission should be looking at far-reaching proposals, such as proposals that would in general allow a least-developed country export to qualify for duty-free access to the EU if at least 40% of a good's value is added in a least-developed country that is not necessarily the final country of export.
In the case of textiles and clothing, we clearly need to go even further, because some of the poorest countries will face enormous shocks when the Multifibre Agreement is withdrawn.
Organisations like Oxfam have made some very detailed proposals in this area.
My last point relates to textiles again.
When the MFA is withdrawn, some of the poorest countries will face major problems.
I would suggest that developing countries which are highly dependent on textiles and clothing, but are not necessarily classified as least-developed countries, should be exempted temporarily from the existing rules of origin requirements.
This applies particularly to countries that obtain more than 50% of their current export revenue from textiles and clothing.
I would be very interested in the views of the Commission and Council on that proposal.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, it is apparent from the separate motions for a resolution submitted by the individual groups in response to one Commission communication that a very large number of their demands were identical.
What that means is that there exists in this House a certain consensus, particularly as regards graduation, the preferences that are to be changed, and the form that additional concessions are to take in the future.
What amazed me about the debate was that, if one wants to change systems of preference â which we do â there has to be an analysis first.
Trade is not an end in itself; it serves to promote countriesâ economic and social development, and so it follows that an analysis has to be produced, stating what existing trade under the existing conditions under the preference systems has achieved.
Did it make countries poorer or less poor?
Did it or did it not promote industrialisation?
Did it help to improve health service provision in underdeveloped countries, or did it not?
Have their young people become better trained and educated or less so?
What that means, then, is that we need in the first place objective criteria in order to evaluate what the existing systems have achieved in the way of development.
I regret that I have seen no analysis of this whatever.
Today, Commissioner Lamy said that such an analysis exists.
There must be in-depth debate of these components in this House before the new Regulation is hammered out.
There are two more comments I would like to make.
Firstly, when dealing with the systems of preferences, we will, in future too, have to work on the assumption that certain countries must be evaluated in different ways.
It may be that markets in the developing countries will have to be protected if they are to be able to develop at all.
There is a place for that.
I cannot âopen upâ every market if I want to promote countriesâ development, particularly as regards food safety, agriculture and so on.
Secondly, this is not just about trade, but also about the fact that, if things are produced in countries in which we want to promote social measures, the jobs involved must be proper and dignified ones.
I believe that this should also feature in the analysis.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted that the two parliamentary committees have initiated this debate.
Since its signature nearly ten years ago, the Marrakesh Agreement has resulted in fundamental changes to the nature of the relations entered into by the European Union, and by France in particular, with their developing country partners.
Today we have a new Commission communication presenting a project for reforming and improving the Generalised System of Preferences.
It should firstly be noted that the Generalised System of Preferences has been a battlefield between two world views: on the one hand, that of a Europe â and more specifically of France â which is committed to its developing country partners and conscious of its responsibilities and historical ties, and, on the other hand, that of a Europe which believes that exposure to global free trade should be the only real means of economic and social development.
I fear that this new Commission communication merely serves as a smoke screen to disguise the simple fact that it renounces our previous commitments in favour of those arising from our participation in the World Trade Organisation.
This is what is euphemistically known as a WTO-compatible system.
In reality, and more generally, this House and the Council have allowed the Commission to pursue two contradictory policies at the same time, namely an external trade policy of absolute free trade, and a policy of providing development aid to privileged partners.
If we did not wish to allow the WTO to dismantle the LomÃ© Convention systematically, instrument by instrument, the Council should have acted as a supervisor and recognisedÂ authority, in order to provide coherent definitions and a determined defence of clear and long-term strategies, including all external policy instruments, in broad fields of common interest such as development.
This fundamental contradiction affects all of the policies which we intend to pursue together.
How can we ask our fishermen to reduce pressure on fish stocks, at the same time as signing trade agreements with countries which do not wish to agree to make the same efforts?
How can we impose environmental standards, social constraints and solidarity commitments on our companies, while exposing them to a competition which bears none of these burdens?
Finally, how can we ask our partners from the South to believe in the long-term commitment of the EU and its Member States to their development, if, with advantages that are now barely appreciable, we expose them, reform by reform, to the forces of the single global market?
I am speaking on behalf of the French delegation of my group.
We are in no way opposed to the market, and we believe in free enterprise, in initiative and in individual responsibility, but we also believe that the State should play its role as regulator and strategist, both to protect its citizens and in the interests of its poorest international partners, as in the absence of this the market is nothing but a jungle.
Given that the prosperity of our continent was mainly established in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries under relatively protected conditions, how can we demand of our partners from the South that they expose their nascent economies to the four winds?
Maybe the young shoots of developing countries require assistance in some form from us on a provisional basis.
Although admittedly imperfect, our GSP system must be kept in place. I also fear that, as in a great many other cases, the Commission proposal is not based on any impact study or evaluation of the system as a whole.
I hope that this House will vote on a detailed proposal, but we must demand, ladies and gentlemen, that this only take place if we have been informed of the consequences which this reform will have.
Â Â  Mr President, I welcome the objectives that the Commission has set for simplification, stabilisation and clarification of the regimes.
The European cooperation policy, which has as its goal the eradication of poverty in the world, cannot in fact be limited to development programmes, however detailed, substantial and advantageous they may be in many cases, but must make use of all the means at its disposal to promote growth in the most disadvantaged countries and thereby facilitate the economies and the exports of those countries as much as possible.
This must naturally take place not only transparently and fully in the open, and therefore after an exceptionally scrupulous analysis of the effects of the proposed action plan cuts, but also with the utmost speed so that poor countries may take advantage of these facilities as soon as possible.
In addition to purely economic factors, such as market share, other criteria such as the level of development and the commitment of beneficiary countries to follow the path of democracy should then be taken into consideration, and preference should be given to trade in those products that frequently play a distinctive role in the economy of a given country, such as textiles for Sri Lanka, bananas for Barbados, and cocoa in the case of CÃŽte dâIvoire.
Most of all this must be carried out in strict coordination with the World Trade Organisation, in order to avoid going behind the backs of the countries involved and to avoid performing the job of regulation within the Commission itself, as has happened in the past, when it is a matter that should instead remain within the strict competence of the WTO and of the entire international community.
Â Â  Mr President, I welcome the Commissioner and wish to pick up on something he referred to rather poignantly: development aid through trade.
As a member of the Committee on International Trade, I believe very strongly in this and we welcome the 2006-2015 reforms to the Generalised System of Preferences.
They cover areas such as textiles, which is a particularly big area.
However, there are potential dangers for developing countries in this revision; one country that has been mentioned already is Sri Lanka.
I feel therefore that graduation is needed for some countries that are now independently competitive in this area.
In connection with graduation, it is important to extend the scheme to new products.
One of our concerns relates to the new products the Commission proposes to add to the GSP system.
The proposals appear to be rather vague and the graduation extension must be fully explained in the Commissionâs legislative process.
We also need to bear in mind that the GSP system was designed for the least-developed countries.
I agree with the Commissioner that resources should therefore be focused on them.
This brings me to a point that Mr Van Hecke raised: first of all we must try to ensure that rules of origin take into account second-stage products, which help countries to industrialise, and particularly ones such as cotton.
However, we need to ensure that when the detailed proposals are set out on the rules of origin, which allow countries to industrialise without the scheme being too far-reaching, we also look at the way in which countries apply them.
There has been some dispute as to whether countries have been apply them to transit products, thereby adding value to these.
This is something about which we feel very strongly.
Finally, Commissioner, the Commission Communication itself suggests self-regulation for LDCs under the GSP.
We argue against this in the resolution, because the time is not yet ripe.
We request technical assistance in the implementation of new schemes, especially with regard to self-policing.
It is important that the Commission shows how this is to be done.
Â Â  Mr President, the European Union is a community of values and we would like to put this across to the different regions in the world.
In the West, we have basic services, such as water, education and care, and we want these to be available elsewhere too.
International trade plays an important part in this.
Trade revenue can help increase the level of investments in basic services, but, in developing countries, particularly on the African continent, world trade plays far too small a role.
The African continent accounts for only a 2% share in it.
The European Union can, and must, change this.
It is of the utmost importance that we, as the worldâs largest trading bloc, should open up our markets to products from the least developed countries and, by way of positive sanctions, give development in the poorest countries an opportunity.
As has been said before, the present system of trade preferences has, in practice, worked to only a limited extent, particularly socially speaking.
Only Sri Lanka and Moldavia have benefited from it, and, as MrÂ Sturdy stated a moment ago, the complexity of the rules and limited capacity have meant that even Sri Lanka has, in fact, made too little use of the potential.
That is why it is a good thing that we are moving towards a GSP+ system, one that is far simpler and involves fewer countries, but yields major benefits gradually and new products, which also creates real incentives.
Indeed, if we really want fundamental working standards, to name but one major aspect, to be adhered to in practice in those countries and to be given a chance in them, we must actively focus our efforts.
We resist the lobbying that would result in an enormous patchwork quilt of goals and countries, from which a huge number of people draw benefit, but where the poorest countries lose out.
Commissioner Lamy should be praised for the excellent work he is making of the EPA (Economic Partnership Agreement) regulation, and we must carry on in the same vein.
If the Caribbean Sea area and the Pacific Ocean experience special problems, which they do, we should try to use EPAs as a targeted and generous solution to them.
We should adopt a harder line with regard to the new upcoming superpowers China, Brazil and India and impose stricter requirements where fundamental working standards are concerned.
Finally, we should not pursue fair trade alone, but also, with regard to the protection of our own employees, fair competition.
With regard to the rules of origin, I would request the Commission to focus on benefits for the least developed countries and agree to relax rules of origin, and to regional and developmental cumulation.
Finally, if we want to encourage the regional economy, we must be open-handed in this respect too.
An incentive of this kind, which is hugely concentrated, could really help the African continent to take a step forward.
Â Â  MrÂ President, local markets must be maintained, at the same time as exports are strengthened.
In order to do this, trade must operate within the framework set by the environment, and human rights must be respected and social cohesion strengthened.
In order to reduce suffering and poverty, the GSP must be made more generous.
Social and environmental clauses must be developed, and we should help countries develop environmental labelling so that they might be better paid for their products.
The ACP countries make use of the Cotonou Agreement.
In actual fact, their use of the Everything But Armsinitiative is confined to 2.6%.
There are just a few ACP countries that have succeeded in exploiting Cotonou to the maximum.
We must now help the rest of them to make greater use of both Cotonou and Everything But Arms.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to applaud the Commission's initiative to present a Communication prior to the reform of the GSP system, and I also applaud the timely initiative of our two parliamentary committees to present this oral question with debate jointly, the terms of which are indicative of Parliamentâs desire for clarification of the Communication and, even more importantly, of the future legislation to modify the current GSP system.
We agree with the Commission that we need to simplify, concentrate and ultimately improve the system in order to make it more effective in terms of achieving its aims.
There are still grey areas, such as the improvement of rules of origin, the key element of the system, which must play a vital role in helping the countries benefiting from the GSP system through clear operating rules.
The same can be said of the simplification of the GSP+ system, which we agree with, but which we believe still requires clarification in terms of the ratification or application of international standards which do not in practice represent an obstacle to the genuine application of the GSP system, as stated by certain Latin American countries such as El Salvador, or key aspects relating to incentives in the fight against drug-trafficking, which are crucial to countries such as Colombia and Bolivia.
For all these reasons, ladies and gentlemen, we are in favour of the objective of simplifying, concentrating and improving the GSP system, although we feel it prudent to wait to see how it translates into the Commissionâs forthcoming legislative text.
At this point we would draw attention to the need to set clear criteria with regard to rules of origin and maintaining the GSP system for the benefiting Latin American countries and, in particular, the rules relating to combating drugs, which still need to be refined.
I will end, Mr President, by saying that we support the joint resolution presented today as a joint compromise amongst the different political groups putting their signature to it, which has meant everybody giving ground for the sake of consensus.
We therefore reject the amendments which go further than this compromise and which create ambiguity in the treatment of rules of origin, which we wish to make as clear, transparent and precise as possible in order to help third countries, while preventing fraud in their application.
Â Â  Mr President, I too welcome what is an extremely necessary and timely initiative by the Commissioner, and I would also like to thank him very much for his cooperation and hard work during his time as Commissioner, which Parliament has appreciated very much.
However, although I welcome the initiative, it must be said that it is very general.
The Commissioner himself acknowledges that it contains a lot of very broad proposals.
We want more information on thresholds for graduation and on how much the GSP will be improved for countries that are not graduated.
I also look forward to more details on the rules of origin, because it is quite difficult to judge at this point whether what is being proposed is anything more than cosmetic.
I would like to know whether the Commissioner agrees with my assessment that if the EU substantially enhances its preference system, it could meet the requirements of the improved GSP option, the EPA alternative, which some non-LDCs are continuing to call for, as the Commissioner is well aware.
At the meeting in Gaborone, the EU agreed to postpone until 2006 the anticipated review of the situation of non-LDCs that are not in a position to enter into EPAs.
It also seems to me that WTO rules allow for differentiation between developing countries in non-reciprocal trade preference schemes, provided that such arrangements are based on objective criteria and that identical treatment is available to all similarly-situated developing countries.
On the basis of that analysis, I would like the Commissioner to be more specific on whether, when Cotonou was negotiated, an enhanced GSP was looked at as an option for those that could not or did not want to enter into EPA negotiations.
I asked for this information in committee, but I was not entirely satisfied with the answer.
Finally, I should like the Commissioner to provide more information and clarity on what is meant by 'vulnerable', 'special development needs' and 'small economies'.
The Commissioner talked about landlocked countries, etc., but he needs to spell things out more clearly so that we know exactly what he means.
Â Â  I should like to echo the words of thanks expressed by my fellow Members to Commissioner Lamy for the cooperation and to wish him well in his future career.
I should also like to thank him for his clarifications today; I agree with him that the Generalised System of Preferences is, in principle, a sound instrument for giving development opportunities via trade, but that the system is clearly in need of revision.
I have two questions for the Commissioner.
I share his view that phasing out the trade barriers does, in fact, partly erode the Generalised System of Preferences and that it is thus more than necessary for us to concentrate on the countries that need this the most.
I therefore share Mrs Lucasâ concern about the future of some developing countries when the textile quota lapses.
I would very much appreciate it, Commissioner, if you could explain once more how this system of graduation can be deployed to help those least developed countries.
You mentioned China as a very obvious example, but what about the position of Pakistan and India, for example?
Secondly, the GSP+ system does indeed make it possible to use trade as a lever for human rights, labour rights, the environment and good governance.
I welcome the fact that the existing regulations are being combined, for what is the use of awarding GSP+ to Pakistan on account of its drugs policy if child labour is still rampant?
Commissioner, you explained that it is not only about ratification, but also about application, but quite honestly, it was not entirely clear to me which treaties you have in mind.
You gave a whole list of items and tried to explain how those should be monitored, but I fear that the list you have given will make the GSP+ system completely inoperable.
You also failed to mention in what way sanctions will be tied in with non-compliance with those fundamental treaties and how this system can be implemented effectively.
All too often, GSP+ or the linking to working standards or treaties become ineffective instruments, because non-compliance is simply not followed up by sanctions.
If you could explain this once again, I would be very grateful.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this reform of the Generalised System of Preferences adds to the view of human rights as an indivisible reality, by directly linking our concepts and policies on trade, development and human rights.
The reform of the GSP effectively incorporates the idea that the best commercial preferences should be conditional upon respect for certain standards in terms of social protection, human rights, good governance and environmentally-sustainable development into our view of trade as an instrument for development and of development as a collective human right.
Unifying all these criteria within a GSP+ category, as well as simplifying the system and making it more generous, as the Commissioner has said, moves in the right direction in terms of the coherence of Community policies affecting developing countries and corrects the fragmentation which has traditionally been dealt with within development policy.
As spokesperson for the Socialist Group in the Human Rights Sub-Committee, I must congratulate the Commission on this aspect of its proposal, although other points of it can clearly be improved, particularly those which provide for rigid mechanisms for the preferences established for the less developed countries.
We shall closely follow the reform, its application and its effectiveness in terms of good development and, above all, in terms of human rights.
Â Â  . Mr President, thank you.
As you have requested it, I will indeed keep it brief.
First of all, I should like to thank the various Members for their observations.
It was very useful for me as President of the Council to hear your observations and we will certainly take them on board in our further discussions on this topic right up until Christmas.
Thereafter, we will, of course, be handing the torch to our successors in Luxembourg.
I have already addressed most of the questions in my first speech and the other questions are directed at the Commission, but I would like to assure you that the Presidency will be making every effort to take the discussion on the resolution as far as it can in the coming months, and in doing so, to involve all parties as effectively as possible, including the European Parliament.
I would also like to note that the Netherlands can very much identify with some of your questions, particularly those about the rules of origin, about product cover and preferential margins.
Finally, I should like to warmly thank Commissioner Pascal Lamy for a fruitful cooperation over the past couple of years.
We have made a lot of progress in the WTO and in the European Union because of your personal commitment, your analytical capabilities and your endurance.
You have run a marathon in the past years and while doing so you have left some footprints that we will be able to follow in the years to come.
So, Pascal, thank you, .
Â Â  . Mr President, this is not the very last time that I will appear before you because I will have the chance to see you again in plenary in October. Had this actually been the last time, I would have seen â in the combination of circumstances that sees Mr Moscovici in the chair â a sign, the like of which I receive from time to time.
Unusually for me, I will not be able to respond in detail to each of you individually, because I can only speak for a few minutes.
I shall restrict myself to addressing the essential aspects, keeping it brief and to the point.
Mrs Martens asked me if the âeverything but armsâ scheme is to be changed.
No, it will not be changed, and there is no graduation in the âeverything but armsâ scheme.
She asked, as other speakers did, about the rates of use by the beneficiary countries of the Generalised System of Preferences.
She is right.
Let us simply be clear that, among the reasons why certain countries do not, in fact, have access to our market, even though they have the right to such access, are all of those factors that do not fall under the category of tariffs, such as those relating to sanitary and phytosanitary norms and the problems of standards, quality and certification.
There will always, therefore, be a difference between theoretical and practical access, due to non-tariff-related issues, for which, unfortunately, we are unable to set up a specific scheme for developing countries. We are not about to set up a scheme for tolerance of antibiotics in prawns for the whole world, only later to set up a specific scheme that favours prawns from the developing world.
Unfortunately, we cannot proceed in such a manner.
Mrs Castex suggests that I involve the social partners in cases where benefit from these preferences is linked to compliance with social clauses. We are already doing this, Mrs Castex, and we shall continue to do so.
To give you an example, the inquiry that we are currently undertaking into respect for union rights in Belarus, which may lead the EU to remove the benefit of those preferences from that country, was triggered by a complaint from the European Trade Union Confederation.
This is also, in fact, the basis for my reply to Mr Markov.
I was asked if the number of beneficiaries would be reviewed.
The number of beneficiaries will, of course, be reviewed, and this review will be based on one criterion â that of market share.
I said earlier, and I repeat, that the number of beneficiaries will scarcely be affected by this system.
Let me state clearly that when we speak of graduation, we do not refer to one country and one product as being graduated, but to a country-product pair â country âxâ, product âyâ.
Mrs Lucas asked me again about the timetable. I feel that I have explained our constraints, in particular those arising from the India dispute.
As regards rules of origin, which she emphasised, as did others, namely Mrs Van Lancker and Mrs Kinnock, let me simply say this: supposing we removed China, a major exporter of clothing and textiles, from the scheme and we authorised Sri Lanka, which exports clothing, to procure its textiles in China; if I have understood correctly, this is what MrsÂ Lucas would like us to do.
If this were to happen, we would be handing back to China through the back door, if I may put it that way, the advantage in the clothing and textiles sector that we would be taking away through the front door.
We must not, therefore, put ourselves into that kind of contradictory situation.
If, however, Sri Lanka wishes to procure its textiles in the surrounding region, we are probably â I must check with my colleagues â open to this.
I have almost finished on this point.
Mr Louis does not like the World Trade Organisation; that is his prerogative.
What is more worrying is that he considers the EUâs trade policy as characterised by unbridled free trade.
This is obviously an exaggeration.
Furthermore, I did not hear that from the mouths of other Members of this House during this debate.
I should like to pinpoint the one sole point in his speech on which he agrees with the Commission â which is not bad going, incidentally â namely that the GSP must be preserved. I would, in fact, go slightly further and say that it must be improved.
Mr Sturdy agrees on the link with technical assistance.
Mrs Kinnock and Mrs Van Lancker want more details on the thresholds and on the lists of the conventions and the sanctions.
Those details will be available on 20Â October, when the Commission will make a decision on my proposal.
Mrs Kinnock would like me to shed more light on the relationship between the economic partnership agreements and these unilateral schemes.
They are two distinct systems; the function of the economic partnership agreements is to encourage regional integration within the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries, whereas, for the moment, the GSP does not have that objective, other than through the rules of origin.
I have finished on that point, Mr President.
I am delighted that, once again, Parliament has had the opportunity to hold a debate on trade policy one week before the Commission itself has debated the issue. This proves that, from the point of view of transparency, we have made some progress.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr Lamy.
At the close of this debate, I have received six draft resolutions.(1)
The vote will take place at 11.30 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the Commission statement on the European Unionâs strategy to combat the use of drugs in sport.
I should like to ask the Commission and the Members of this House to keep strictly to their allotted time, out of courtesy to MrsÂ Leyla Zana, who will address this House at 11 a.m.
Â Â  .
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today, on the occasion of one of your first plenary sessions, you opted to put the issue of the fight against drug use on the agenda, which clearly reflects the priority that Parliament attaches to combating this scourge that is damaging the image of sport and the health of sportsmen and sportswomen.
Drug use is not, at the moment, only a matter of fair competition, it is also a problem of public health.
The Commission shares the determination that you have shown in this field.
In fact, as you know, I have made strenuous efforts for the past five years to bring drug use onto the Communityâs agenda and to take the most effective action possible within our competences.
On the day that I leave this portfolio, to which I have devoted a great deal of energy, I should like to thank you for giving me the opportunity to present you with a breakdown of the progress that we have made together and to set out some guidelines for the future.
The breakdown is as follows: I feel that, in five years, we have done as much as we possibly could within the existing legal framework, and bearing in mind the reluctance on the part of several Member States and sections of the sporting world to consider Community level to be an essential level in the fight against drug use.
As you are aware, sport is not yet a Community competence.
To put it another way, the Commission could only intervene in strict compliance with its competences, and in this field, the Commission can only intervene, in any event, with the aim of complementing and strengthening action taken by sports organisations and by Member States.
In recent years, we have been obliged to behave like teachers in explaining what our powers and our limits are in this field.
Indeed, on the one hand, we have been asked why the Commission did not take more initiatives, and on the other, we have been told that we were launching initiatives to harmonise procedures for checking lists of doping products; in other words that we were appropriating powers that we do not have.
The reality is that we have done a great deal within our field of competence: information, prevention, training, awareness-raising and supporting projects such as the athleteâs passport, multimedia information tools and scientific studies.
We have promoted dialogue aimed at cooperation.
What does that mean in specific terms?
The beginning of my tenure coincided with a period in which drug use was making front page news, with the events of the 1998 Tour de France.
We were able to see that national responses were no longer adequate and that cooperation â even coordination â between Member States was crucial.
At the end of 1999, I asked the European Group on Ethics, whose President at that time was MrsÂ Lenoir, to give us its opinion.
This was the first time that this body had spoken on the subject of drug use, and the opinion that it gave proved extremely useful in the ensuing years and will continue to do so in the future.
It has been the springboard for everything that we have done.
In December 1999, a Community support plan to combat drug use was adopted by the Commission.
This plan was received favourably by Parliament.
Mrs Zabel was the rapporteur at the time.
We were calling, in particular, for the concern over drug use to be incorporated into all Community policies.
Within the framework of that plan and with Parliamentâs help, an annual budget of EURÂ 5Â million was earmarked for projects to combat drug use âÂ studies, research, conferences and actions.
We were thus able to support projects that promoted both information and research in the field.
I should like to mention, for example, our study on the use of drugs in gyms, together with projects involving young people and a list of the laws and regulations in the Member States.
Three studies were carried out by external consultants: on the socio-economic factors of drug use, protecting the young and the European communication strategy.
Let us speak now about WADA, the World Anti-Doping Agency.
I made a substantial personal investment to ensure that an agency came into being, and I fought particularly hard to advocate principles for the purposes of effective action, so that the new agency corresponded to the wishes of those wanting to see zero tolerance applied to drug use.
I stressed the need for the agency to be independent and transparent.
WADA was taking shape along the lines of what we wanted and was set up in 1999.
Owing to a discrepancy between WADAâs budgetary rules and procedures and Community law, it was not possible to provide Community funding, and I do not see that this can change in the future.
The draft Constitutional Treaty, which does make reference to sport, will not bring any change in this regard.
It must be pointed out that WADA is doing an honourable job.
I would like to see it become an international institution established under public law. This would, to my mind, make it more effective and give it more credibility than the current body, which is governed by private law, a factor that poses problems.
After all, the fight against drug use is, by definition, an international phenomenon.
This is the main reason why we arranged the Marrakesh Conference in January 2002, which gave us the opportunity to look into the problem of drug use with our colleagues from the Mediterranean area.
I should also like to mention the European Year of Education through Sport, during which we set up an information and warning system for our young people; in other words, an entire prevention system.
Prevention is the key word, because we are not here to be repressive, which is why the Commission must place the emphasis on the aspect of prevention.
It must address the phenomena that help to create an environment that is conducive to the phenomenon of drug use â the educational background of sports coaches, the role of the medical field and the pressure for success coming from sponsors.
As you can see, very important work has been done over the past five years. It has been joint work, within the framework of which I have always been able to count on Parliamentâs total support.
In the future, this responsibility will fall to the new Commissioner, MrÂ Figel, and I know he is aware of the importance of this issue.
Mr President, I should like to make two points, if I may.
Firstly, the Constitutional Treaty represents a source of hope in this field because it states that young peopleâs physical and moral integrity, particularly that of young sportsmen and sportswomen, must be protected.
We must therefore step up support for the Member States and the federations, which will still be primarily responsible. Additionally, we can support Member Statesâ activities in prevention, information and awareness-raising.
I should also like to mention a very important aspect for all future action, namely the ruling handed down by the Court in the Meca-Medina case on 30Â September, which had the merit of clarifying the place of the fight against drug use in the Communityâs legal environment and which ultimately confirmed the Commissionâs position - one such as I have been advocating for five years - and this is to be welcomed.
The ruling stated that the fight against drug use did not pursue any economic goal.
In the Courtâs view, the International Olympic Committeeâs anti-doping regulation does not, therefore, fall within Community competition law.
The purpose of this regulation is to preserve the spirit of sport and the health of athletes.
To put it another way, it is a sports regulation, which leaves the main responsibility for regulating the matter to the sports federations.
Mr President, I am very pleased with both the conclusion itself and with the way in which the ruling was expressed.
I have effectively been trying to demonstrate, for five years, that the Commission is not solely interested in sport as an economic phenomenon, but that sport is, above all, a social activity with educational and ethical aspects.
I also know that my successor will follow this path, because it is important that Parliament support MrÂ Figel on this matter, as it has always supported me.
We have a responsibility to our society, and, with sport being such an important element in this society, we thus have a responsibility in the field of sport.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Reding, we have noticed recently that fair play, which is the basic principle of sport and of the Olympic Games, has turned into 'unfair play'.
Polite rivalry and sporting ideals have now been sullied by athletes' intense efforts to win and distinguish themselves.
Within the framework of this huge effort and of massive competition, science is contributing by finding new solutions which promise great performances.
Today, however, I should like to comment on the case of women and young people.
The use of anabolic agents by female athletes, especially young female athletes, damages their femininity, while abuse harbours serious risks to their health, frequently resulting in their being deprived of motherhood.
Within a broader framework, therefore, the disastrous consequences of anabolic agents on young people endeavouring to mimic their idols are becoming more acute and society clearly needs our protection.
We therefore find ourselves up against a new reality, the much-publicised doping.
These substances are available on the market in abundance in numerous forms, either via the Internet or via the television or by mail order and, even more, in gymnasia and at sports grounds, as reported in the media.
However, what we are basically ignoring is the fact that doping is a practice not only among top athletes, but also, essentially, among a lot of young people, in that substances such as these have penetrated the young generation, filling aspiring champions with hope.
I would remind you that the turnover from sales of anabolic agents exceeds EUR two billion a year in Europe and about EUR six billion a year worldwide.
Even though WADA updates its list of banned anabolic agents almost daily, the social problem is becoming more acute and it is the young people watching their models humiliated who are the victims.
We therefore need immediate solutions and action at global and, more importantly, at social level in order to identify the problem and promote the necessary legislative arrangements.
The intervention of the European Union in this huge social problem, which damages both the image of sport and public health, is urgently required.
Do we need to mourn even more victims before we wake up and accept our responsibilities?
Just the other day, one of the best baseball players in the United States died of a heart attack due to excessive use of anabolic agents.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the problem of doping is contrary to the ideals of sport, as you quite rightly said.
The spread of this problem, not only in professional sport, but also in amateur, individual sport, is such that we need to give this major issue priority attention, so that we can coordinate the Member States in combating it.
I know that, as recorded in the Commission's 2002 survey, 6% of people who exercise in gymnasia and fitness centres use pharmaceutical substances which enhance their performance.
In fact, the number is higher and these substances are not approved by pharmaceutical organisations.
In other words, some 3Â 700Â 000 European citizens use these substances.
Unfortunately, even despite our efforts, they continue to be used.
This battle needs to be fought on four levels.
First, by highlighting the use of anabolic agents as a public health problem, as you quite rightly said.
Secondly, by creating a legal framework â and I am delighted that you corrected the point that WADA should be an organisation under public law â which will allow the European Commission to participate efficiently in its work, in accordance with everything we had the opportunity to discuss together.
I know that this organisation is indirectly financed to the tune of EUR two million for various initiatives, at a time when the European Commission, as you accepted, does not participate directly in it.
Thirdly, by taking action so that sport is promoted through education and is not cut off from it.
Fourthly, by correctly labelling the relevant concoctions which are widely available on the market, so that they clearly state that they are anabolic substances.
The European Parliament's Committee on Culture and Education, which I have the honour of chairing, decided at my initiative to organise a massive public hearing in November entitled 'Doping â An Obstacle to the Sporting Ideal'.
This will give us an opportunity to examine matters and perhaps contribute with initiatives which we need to take jointly ...
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner Reding, sports organisations do not have sufficient resources to deal with the drugs problem alone, and so there is a need for cooperation with governments as well as the European Union, with the competence it will have when the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe has been ratified.
The role of governments and the European Union and the action they take will be especially important in allowing the effective prevention of the illegal manufacture, importation, exportation and spread of drug use.
Legislative cooperation to prevent the spread of drug use and collaboration between the authorities are the means by which the European Union can effectively address the drugs problem in sport and prevent it and any other drug-related abuse at the same time.
Governments should also adequately ensure through their own legislation that drug dealers face the consequences of their actions to a sufficient degree.
There should be no genuinely harmonised legislative action to criminalise drug use in sport, nor should any be planned, as this is not something that can really be compared to the issue of narcotics, although the two do share similar features.
The World Anti-Doping Agency, WADA, coordinates and promotes the fight against drugs worldwide.
The European Union should, for its part, actively support the work of WADA.
The International Olympic Movement has been quite actively involved in the administration of WADA, but the role of governments has been less assertive.
The combined action and energy of the Member States of the European Union would make it possible to balance the involvement of governments in WASA, thus enabling the agency to operate more effectively and efficiently.
A global government agreement against drug use in sport is being drafted under the auspices of Unesco.
The European Union should actively monitor the drafting of the agreement and coordinate the views of the Member States.
With its new competence in the area of sport, the European Union should take an active role in implementing, promoting and supporting the obligations under this forthcoming agreement.
Matters relating to drug use in sport often make up quite a conspicuous number of sports news stories in the media.
Nevertheless, we need to keep a sense of proportion.
As in other areas of society, there are and always will be those in the world of sport who do not obey rules designed to apply to everyone.
We in the European Union, however, must do all we can to try to promote a clean image of sports and physical exercise.
Sport is beneficial, and promotes human health and welfare.
Â Â  Mr President, it strikes me that we have finally emerged from ignorance, hypocrisy and demonisation in the area of drug use in sport.
It is perfectly clear, Mrs Reding, that you have done an excellent job of finally establishing a genuine fight against drug use, at European level and at world level.
The main problem is, indeed, that of our athletesâ health, particularly the health of professional or high-level athletes, and at that level, we would of course need more time to see how, from zero tolerance, we could also achieve a genuine public health policy that enabled our athletes in high-level competition to be up to the level required.
What needs to be done is, therefore, a matter of medicalisation and of seeing how, with the doctors at our disposal, particularly independent doctors, and with regular independent checks, we can effectively achieve a genuine public health policy.
Â Â  â Commissioner, I am sorry, but I think that both the European Parliament and the Commission need to make more of an effort to combat doping.
Numerous efforts have, of course, been made, but I do not think that they suffice.
In 1999, the Commission announced that it would promote a proposal for a recommendation to the Council in accordance with Article 152 and, in the first half of 2002, that it would publish a proposal on doping based on Article 152.
Two and a half years have passed since then and we have seen neither the one proposal nor the other.
That is a black mark on the European Commission's copybook.
I am sorry because, on 14 September, in reply to a question in the European Parliament, you told us that there was no legal basis for us to do more.
Yet, in May 2000, you said that there was a legal basis and it was public health.
The Commission should therefore draft a directive on the basis of public health and the European Parliament should give it its urgent attention.
Â Â  Mr President, the fact that the recent Olympic Games in Athens saw two gold medals taken away on the grounds of drug use as well as the disqualification of several athletes demonstrates the persistence of an abuse that involves amateur athletes and great professionals alike.
This ever-increasing phenomenon is in fact not being fought with the severity it deserves and this is also probably why more and more athletes start using drugs, in some cases in the foolish belief that they are practically harmless or at least not very dangerous.
Drug use is also assuming really worrying dimensions as an economic phenomenon: it is in fact behind an enormous volume of business which evidently benefits large criminal organisations among others.
Our question to the Commission is whether Community support measures in the battle against drug use in sport, which financed 32 pilot projects from 2000 to 2002, can truly show a positive result in terms of effective action, or whether instead the entire Community programme should be entirely rethought.
Let us bear in mind first that it is actually today that the tenth conference of Sports Ministers is meeting within the ambit of the Council of Europe, with the aim of encouraging honesty and transparency in sport, and second the great educational values associated with the development of sporting activities, as evidenced in this very year of 2004, which has been the Year of Education Through Sport.
We therefore ask the Commission whether it should not actually commit itself more thoroughly to the battle against drug use and whether, after having financed research projects on the phenomenon, it should not now go on to finance information and persuasion campaigns, prevention campaigns in brief, which would be truly more incisive.
Â Â  Mr President, as we are condemning the use of stimulants in sport, IÂ would agree with all of the previous speakers that it is aÂ question involving amateur sportsmen and women as well as professionals.
We are talking about the use of substances that are very often not just drugs but are also medicines that are used to treat aÂ variety of conditions.
On the other hand, what kind of Community have we got when there is toleration and even encouragement of aÂ whole host of measures enabling the sale of soft drugs in aÂ number of states?
To whom, then, are we allowing the use of drugs and from whom are we forbidding them?
Should we allow people other than sportsmen to use them?
Should teachers or doctors use drugs or substances that act as stimulants?
Should children use them?
Â Â  The sitting is suspended for the formal sitting.
(1)
Ladies and gentlemen, today is a special day for our Parliament.
We are all delighted that we can finally hear the voice of Leyla Zana.
President Klaus HÃ€nsch, in his speech to this House when you were awarded the Sakharov Prize, was waiting impatiently for the day when you could speak to us in person.
On that day, your husband, Mehdi Zana, received the prize on your behalf and today I would like to welcome him as well, a free man, after years in jail â and we are talking about no less than 16 years in jail â and years of suffering over recent decades.
Mrs Leyla Zana, before you take the floor, I would like to remind the House why this Parliament awarded you the Sakharov Prize, the freedom of conscience prize, and I would also like to take this opportunity to welcome Mrs Roth and Mrs LalumiÃšre, who are with us today and who, as leaders of their respective groups, were amongst those who proposed that you receive this prize, almost ten years ago.
Four years earlier, during the worst period of conflict in the South East of Turkey, you were the first Kurdish woman to be elected to the Turkish Grand National Assembly.
When you took your seat in Parliament you promised â in Kurdish â to fight to ensure that Kurds and Turks could live together within a democratic framework.
And it was because of that and your subsequent speeches and writings that you were sentenced to 15 years in prison by the National Security Court in Ankara together with your three colleagues, Turkish Members of Parliament Dicle, Sadak and Dogan.
You were fully aware of the impact of your words on the occasion of your oath-taking and of the language you spoke them in.
You have paid dearly for them, in terms of years and of health.
But despite that, you remained firm in your democratic fight for the rights of your people, rejecting the offer of a pardon you were made for health reasons.
You refused to remain silent, even when that meant prolonging your sentence.
And you had to carry this burden alone.
But many people in the international community supported you.
This Parliament â the European Parliament â condemned the accusations against you and your conviction, as a violation of democratic principles.
This Parliament called for your release in many resolutions.
You can take great satisfaction, however, from the fact that your suffering has not been in vain and that your personal fight has made a significant contribution to the changes that have taken place in Turkey since you were elected as a Member of Parliament.
For example, it is no longer illegal to speak Kurdish, radio broadcasts and education in Kurdish are beginning to be allowed, there is no longer martial law and a state of emergency in the South East, following the unilateral truce by the PKK, and the long armed conflict which has lasted 15 years has practically come to an end.
There is undoubtedly a long way to go â and you have explained this to us over recent days â and many improvements still to be made in the practical situation in terms of respect for the freedoms and rights of the Turkish people.
But, when the Turkish Court of Appeal finally decided to release you on 9 June of this year â we are not talking, ladies and gentlemen, about events that happened a long time ago, but on 9 June of this year Mrs Leyla Zana was still in prison â you justified our faith in you by calling on your compatriots to fight for peace and recognition in the South East and demanding that the Kongra-Gel, the successor to the PKK, maintain the ceasefire.
Mrs Zana, over and over again you have demonstrated the truth of what you said when you were tried again: âI am first and foremost a woman, then a mother, and finally a politician.
In my capacity as a woman, a mother and a politician, I swear that I will fight for brotherhood between the Turkish and Kurdish peopleâ
Please allow me, Mrs Zana, to use your own words and welcome you in your own language, in Kurdish:
Mrs Zana, it is a great honour to have you in our Parliament.
Â Â  . Mr President, by speaking in Turkish and Kurdish, you have made a highly significant gesture and, before starting my speech, I would like to thank you in Catalan.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, dear friends, I spoke in Kurdish for the first time in 1991 from the parliamentary chamber during my oath-taking ceremony in the Turkish National Assembly.
When I spoke the words, âI take this oath for the brotherhood of the Kurdish and Turkish peopleâ, I wanted to draw attention to the fact that peoples, languages and cultures can co-exist in a brotherly fashion.
The years I spent behind cold bars, surrounded by deaf and mute walls, will remain in our consciousness as suffering that went unacknowledged at the time.
In any event, the fight for freedom, justice and equality could not have been fought without suffering.
Those years I spent in prison have not left me with a broken heart, nor wanting to blame anybody, nor feeling anger.
I had to live through those years for my love of democracy, and I did.
I have begun my speech today in our brother language, Turkish, and I would like to end in my mother tongue, Kurdish.
My aim is once again to emphasise the brotherhood between peoples, languages and cultures.
I greet you all in this spirit and in friendship.
I would like to express my gratitude and my warmest wishes to Parliament for having considered me worthy of the Sakharov Prize.
I would also like to thank you for the unfailing solidarity you have shown me and my friends throughout my years in prison.
In fact, you are not awarding this prize just to me, but to the Kurdish people, to the Turkish people, who are our brothers; you have in fact awarded it to Turkey and to the defenders of peace, equality, freedom and fraternity.
You have awarded it to the children who have lost their parents in the wars, to the women who have lost their children, to people who are oppressed, whatever their colour, language, religion or race.
In short, you have awarded this prize to a bright future and to hope.
You have given democratic public opinion a voice and have encouraged it to speak.
The fact that the values represented by Sakharov are sacred and inviolable values has increased my moral and humanitarian responsibilities, and I am speaking to you now fully aware of this fact.
It breaks my heart to see that our children are being lost, in whatever part of the world it may be happening, but first and foremost in my own country of course.
It is a pain that sears through me.
I beg you to hear my voice and to regard it as the voice of the mothers whose hearts are full of pain, as the voice of the children, of the young people, of the women, of the thousands, of the tens of thousands and millions of people, of human beings.
Wars have caused great suffering, they have inflicted deep wounds; there has been much suffering, nature has suffered, the flowers, the birds and the butterflies have wept.
The wars in Iraq, in Palestine, in Halabja, in the Balkans, in Beirut, in Chechnya, in Ireland, in Spain and all kinds of other wars that do not come to mind at the moment, have taught us many things and continue to do so.
Bitter experience has taught us that violence leads to more violence, without providing a solution.
We have also seen how policies based upon repression, denial, extermination and deceit, have led to more injustice, poverty and suffering.
We must, therefore, reject violence and war, whatever the cause of it or the justification for it may be.
We should be in a position to reject it.
Violence must be consigned to the past.
The language and method for resolving conflict today is dialogue, compromise and peace.
It is not âKill and be killedâ, but âLive and let liveâ.
As Members of the European Parliament, you are sitting here together today in peace despite divisions and wars that have lasted for centuries and generations.
Is the unity you have created while preserving your national characteristics not one of the most striking symbols of peaceful coexistence?
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as a person seeking justice, the first appeal I would like to make here today is addressed to myself: I give you my word that I will meet the expectations of my country and of democratic public opinion, even if it costs me my life.
I make this commitment without expecting anything in return.
I address my second appeal to my country, Turkey.
The Turkish Government must include the democratic resolution of the Kurdish problem on its agenda by giving it an appropriate name.
All living beings on earth have a name: flowers, trees, birds.
They all have their names.
Only the Kurds have no name.
There is no reason not to define this problem and not to give it an appropriate name.
There is no reason to fear dialogue and peace.
The Kurds want a peaceful solution within Turkish sovereign territory.
These are the building blocks and raw materials of the Republic of Turkey.
They respect all the values symbolising the Republic of Turkey, but the government appears to be inflexible, and unwilling to appreciate the sincere initiative of the Kurds, which is based on openness to dialogue.
If a peaceful solution is not on the agenda, whatever political party may be in power, that dialogue is doomed to disappear.
Significant steps have certainly been taken towards democracy, but the implementation of these steps appears to have been purely cosmetic.
The Copenhagen criteria must be implemented in practice, and not just in words.
The most urgent need is to remove the basis for armed conflict and violence.
A legal system that would bring about disarmament will be an important initial step towards peace.
Yet there is another urgent need, which is that political prisoners, the intelligentsia, writers and politicians must be included in democratic life.
We would also like to see democratic areas opened up with no barriers to freedom of thought or association.
Social and economic measures aimed at eradicating differences between regions are of vital importance.
Obstacles to the use of our mother tongue in the media must be eliminated and it should be possible to learn this language in primary schools.
A new democratic constitution that is in line with universal law must be drawn up and, within that constitution, as the Turkish President, Mr Sezer, has said, the Kurds must be recognised as majority elements and they must be protected.
Nobody should be in any doubt that the Kurds will support any measures taken for the sake of democratisation.
My third appeal is addressed to the world, and first and foremost to Europe.
Peace in Turkey will mean peace in the Middle East, peace in Europe and peace in the world.
Today, peace is in your hands, in our hands.
We will achieve it by extending our hands to each other and in order to do so we must begin by knowing what is right.
If you know what is right, you also know what is wrong, but if you do not know what is wrong, you will never achieve what is right.
The right thing to do is to begin by giving the problem a name, and then to acknowledge it and define it.
An entity that does not have a name and has not been defined has no identity, and as such that entity is considered non-existent.
It is time for the world to recognise the political, social and cultural rights of the Kurds, who make up a population of more than 40 million human beings.
The Kurds have openly expressed their will to achieve their full recognition and integrate themselves into todayâs world.
What we expect from the world is that our will should be respected and that this should not to be used as a negotiating tool, or as a bargaining chip in international relations.
If this problem is not dealt with from the point of view of conscience and humanitarian spirit, regional and world peace will continue to face a potential threat.
Nations have been left alone because they have built walls rather than bridges.
Europe has experienced that suffering over the years and humanity has demolished those walls, one after the other.
Europe and the world should be able to demolish the invisible walls that have been built between them and the Kurds, and furthermore act as a bridge in order to find a solution to this problem.
We must bear in mind that a Turkey that is a Member of the European Union, which has resolved the Kurdish problem, will allow western civilisation to meet the great cultural wealth of Mesopotamia.
Not until that happens will western civilisation become a contemporary democratic civilisation.
My fourth appeal is addressed to democratic public opinion and advocates of peace.
It is not enough to be an advocate of peace and to be peaceful oneself that alone will not bring peace.
Unless men wage war against war itself, there will be no way to put an end to wars.
Wherever there are wars, therefore, we must be warriors for peace and we must organise ourselves.
I address my final appeal to the Kurds, to those who have fought for democracy in all the geographical regions they live in; they must first of all live in peace amongst each other.
They must promote democracy, authorise freedoms and demonstrate cohesion.
There will be no solidarity without mutual respect for values, no cohesion without solidarity, no strength without cohesion and no peace without strength.
They must be aware that any attempt to fashion their own variety of Kurd amongst the Kurds will lead to a âfeast of wolvesâ.
The only way to prevent that is through internal unity and cohesion, peace amongst ourselves, and our own solidarity and our own policies.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, why can the Turks, the Kurds, the Germans, the French, the Laz, the Circassians, the Spanish, the Georgians, the Assyrians, the Americans, the Czechs, the Arabs, the Yazidi, the Bretons, the Catalans, the Persians, the Chechens, the Aborigines, the American Indians, the Alawites, the Africans, the Palestinians, the Jews, the Catholics, the Protestants, the Muslims, the Christians, the whites, the blacks and all the peoples of the world not live together in peace and harmony?
We all gaze at the same stars and we are all fellow travellers on the same planet and live under the same sky.
As VictorÂ Hugo said, because âpeace is the happiness that absorbs everythingâ, we must forget everything relating to war, pain, revenge and hate.
We must absorb all of it.
Otherwise, we will not be able to travel together and be happy.
I dedicate this speech to brotherhood and happiness amongst the Turkish and Kurdish people.
My best wishes to all of you in love and friendship.
Â Â  Mrs Leyla Zana, in your speech you talked of Turkey as your country and called for recognition of the identity of the Kurdish people within Turkish sovereign territory.
So, Mrs Zana, just as earlier I welcomed you in your language, Kurdish, please allow me now to also thank you in your other language, Turkish:
Which means, âthank you very much for your speechâ.
Mrs Zana has spoken to us, and spoken very well, about identity, about the process of overcoming antagonistic differences, the antagonistic identities which have been mutually destroying each other throughout history.
This is a good example of creating a common identity, which is more complex than our own individual native identities, since it encompasses a richer reality.
Leyla Zana offers an example of precisely this search for a multiple identity which is compatible with everybodyâs own individual identity.
So once again Mrs Zana, â.
Â Â  We will now continue with the debate on doping in sport.
We still have a number of speakers on the list to get through before we can proceed to the vote, so I would ask for self-discipline.
Â Â  Mr President, this should prove a popular moment in this House and I am grateful for the massive turnout for the continuation of the debate on drugs in sport.
From the health promotion point of view, we want to see the encouragement of sporting activity and sporting excellence.
We also want to see prevention of the use of drugs that damage health.
Sporting excellence can only flourish in an environment of fitness, skill, training and fair competition.
It must be based on the natural abilities of the individual athlete or team, and never on performance enhanced by pharmaceutical or technical aids.
That is cheating and must be rooted out through a policy of accurate and random testing.
Such tests must distinguish between genuine medication and performance-enhancing drugs.
In fact it is worse than cheating, because it puts the health of the athletes at risk.
What athlete would knowingly cause damage to his heart or liver, his kidneys or reproductive organs?
Who would willingly stunt his growth or make himself prone to violent or aggressive behaviour?
Who would put at risk his memory or his mind?
All these things can result from taking oral or injected steroids, without mentioning the risks entailed by sharing needles.
Too many athletes and coaches either do not understand this or knowingly take the risk.
These drugs distort and damage sport, the health of individual competitors and the example set to young people, who look up to sporting heroes as role models.
That is why we must educate and prevent, why we must test and deter and why we must do both these things together.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, doping in sport has become a worrying phenomenon, which the European Union is obliged to confront because, as the Commission has said, national responses are not sufficient.
It is important that we combat these practices, since they violate sporting ethics by preventing fair competition between athletes in all sports and in all countries.
The practice of doping undoubtedly gives society a negative image of the values which should govern sport.
As a member of Parliament's Committee on Culture and Education, I see sport as an instrument for educating people and I sincerely believe in the values that should be communicated through sport.
European children and young people must return to the idea that sport is a healthy, character-building and sociable activity, in which the important thing is to participate.
It is clear that doping in amateur sport is a reflection of something very different, which has nothing to do with education or sociability.
I would, therefore, call on the Commission to intensify its research into doping substances, detection methods and the impact of using doping substances on health, with a view to reducing cases of doping and protecting our sportspeople from the danger it poses to their moral and physical well-being.
Â Â  Mr President, doping is the cancer of modern sports.
It invades, spreads and destroys the healthy spirit of competition and fair play amongst our athletes.
Despite the brave efforts made by the World Anti-Doping Agency, its incidence appears to be growing faster and faster, especially amongst professional sportsmen.
As the number and sensitivity of drug-screening tests increases, athletes discover new, undetectable drugs or combinations of drugs, or other ways of avoiding being caught.
Faced with this malignant state of affairs we must seek to discover the root cause of the problem.
We do not have to look very far or think very hard to find it.
It is the same root cause that so often turns individuals into criminals. The same one that often leads people to kill each other and, sometimes, even causes whole nations to fight one another.
It is called money.
As sport becomes more and more competitive, there are ever more material gains to be made by winning.
Competition is often not about winning an event or a game, but about winning the sometimes unbelievably lucrative contracts that come with that.
The crucial question is whether we can convince our athletes to dissociate sport from money.
In my view the answer is unfortunately ânoâ, because athletes are only human and greed seems to be an inherent human weakness.
In conclusion, I disagree with the Commissioner that this is a public health problem.
In my view it is mainly a socio-economic problem.
Sadly, I consider that the only way to keep drugs away from sportsmen is to decommercialise sport.
While the chance of that remains remote, the prospect of truly drug-free sport remains bleak.
Â Â  â Mr President, the real reason behind the huge problem of doping is the commercialisation of sport, the admission that there can be professional athletes and that there is therefore such a thing as professional sport.
Within the capitalist method of production, professional sport is a special case, because it accepts athletes at such young ages that they are prohibited from participating in the rest of production, educationally at least.
