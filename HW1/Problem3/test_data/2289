Parliament is not at the beck and call of the media and Parliament must have its own rhythm of working, or we will end up putting any old thing on the agenda.
Mr President, the fact is that it was only at the weekend that a note reached me; it dates back to last year and I am utterly astonished by it.
The reason for my astonishment is that this note had not previously come to light following the many questions we had put to the Commission, particularly concerning the book-keeping and accounts, and because it is obviously not through the Commission that it has found its way to me.
I do not know whether other Members have had a copy, and have not, as yet, had the chance to seek further information about this.
For now, though, that is of secondary importance.
What is important, though, is the fact - which I note with amazement - that the Director-General of internal audit is due to join us for the meeting scheduled for 7 p.m. today.
I know nothing about this, though, and he has not even been invited.
I have tried to reach him by phone in order to get some information about this note, but have not, for the moment, been able to do so, as he was in a meeting.
Discharge will not, of course, be under discussion at this mini-conference - that will be dealt with in plenary in April - but this is, of course, vitally important right now.
In eight days' time, the committee will have to vote on what we are going to do about giving discharge, and on what proposals we are going to put to plenary.
This really does make it a matter of urgency that we should have information about this.
I really do not know any more when I am meant to do this if we are to be able to deal with this properly in committee.
Although we will, self-evidently, be discussing it this evening, it is already my view that we should know what is going on when such a thing lands on the table, and that we should discuss it among ourselves.
Mr President, the situation is, in fact, very simple.
Either the Security Council votes on Tuesday evening, or it votes on Wednesday, or it votes on Thursday.
In other words, it either votes before us or after us.
If it votes after us, I believe it is important for a vote to be held within the European Parliament asking the States represented on the Security Council to vote against the resolution proposed by the United Kingdom, Spain and the United States.
In other words, I believe it is important for the representatives of public opinion and the European peoples to adopt a motion calling upon the States concerned to use their Security Council vote to reject the idea of war.
(Speaking to Mr Panella who was trying to interrupt him: Oh, Mr Panella, really!
At least, you were alive in 1938 whereas I was not.
That is the only difference and I shall put this way of thinking down to your age, because, otherwise, what you have just said is not very clever at all.
Not very clever at all!)
If, however, the Security Council votes before we do, I think the European Parliament should adopt a position on this vote.
In any case, therefore, as an expression of the European peoples, we should adopt a position on Wednesday on what is to be decided or what has been decided.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, whilst I always admire the commitment that the esteemed Mr Cohn-Bendit brings to what he has to say here, I have to ask that we stick to logic and bear in mind the way this issue has historically developed in this House.
After all, Wednesday's debate, which will be a thorough one, will not be the first we have had on the terrible way the Iraq crisis is developing, and our group has always taken a stand in favour of action within the bounds set by the international community. I say this so that this may not be in doubt.
Mr Cohn-Bendit, though, knows as well as any other Member of this House that we voted on this in December.
There is now no occasion for us to have a new vote every time we meet here in order to introduce new emphases; on the contrary, Parliament's position is unambiguous, as is that of our Group of the European People's Party and European Democrats, and I believe that the other groups - most of them, at any rate - want this House's position, once decided upon, to be binding, and for us not to have to make much ado about exchanging views every time.
On Wednesday, everyone will have the opportunity to give an opinion, and I recommend that we do so with the gravity and seriousness of purpose that this crisis merits.
That is why we oppose a new resolution.
Mr President, my group is also against a resolution, probably for slightly different reasons from Mr Poettering, because - not in December, Mr Poettering, but on 30 January - we adopted a resolution stating quite clearly that the majority of Parliament is opposed to military action without a UN resolution.
It is that Parliamentary resolution, therefore, that is still valid today.
If the situation were to change, it would clearly also change as far as we are concerned.
What is more, according to our information, the Security Council vote will, in any case, take place before we have had time to act in this regard.
Mr President, we are in a particularly delicate situation because a minute can last forever and events are taking place which allow us to remain hopeful that the resolution approved by a majority of Parliament in January - not December - will remain valid.
I am not going to speculate about what may happen in the Security Council.
We have a debate with the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Papandreou, on Wednesday morning and I believe that, in these circumstances, Parliament is perfectly able to reconsider the issue of the resolution at this time.
We still have time and this seems much more reasonable than adopting a closed position at the moment.
Mr President, on behalf of the committee, I have asked that the vote on the resolution be postponed until the second part-session of March in Brussels.
Since this is a complex and delicate issue, we are going to hold a debate in committee this afternoon, in an extraordinary meeting, and on Wednesday we will hold another, as a result of the Commission's statement.
I believe, since we are dealing with an issue which, as I have said, is delicate and on which we have to act prudently, it is better to transfer the vote on the resolution to this month's part-session in Brussels, with the presentation, of course, of the corresponding amendments by the political groups.
Mr President, I am sorry to rise to speak against my successor on an issue like this, but it seems to me that, just as we rightly ask the Committee on Budgetary Control to look at the allegations about the reform process that have been raised in some newspapers over the weekend, we should also ask the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs to look urgently at this matter.
What is at stake here is the possibility of the Americans coming back to us with a request for access to databases on European airline passengers which would ride roughshod over our own data protection legislation and indeed could form a major intrusion into the civil liberties of European citizens.
It seems to me that, if the House does not take a position this week, then we are impotent.
We ought to be stressing very strongly our opposition to what the Americans are requesting and our opposition to any potential agreement by the Commission to such a request.
Thank you, Mr President.
In fact I would just like clarification on something.
I am very pleased that we will be voting on this issue this week, because it is clear that information is already being passed on to the United States.
We therefore urgently need this week to call a halt to this.
I am not clear as to who is responsible here, however.
Is it true that the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs is getting down to it this evening?
I would welcome that very much, but in that case we would need to draw up a resolution this evening that would have to be put to the vote on Wednesday.
I would definitely welcome that.
The most important thing is to arrive at a resolution this week, and the second most important thing is to leave it in the hands of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs.
If we are unable to do so this evening, I would like to have an urgent additional meeting tomorrow to ensure that the specialist committee retains control of this matter.
My understanding on the question of substance is that it was the preference of the groups that the committee should prepare the resolution.
Unless there is an indication to the contrary, that remains so.
The only issue concerns when it should be voted.
The clear decision of the House is that it should be voted on Thursday of this week, as foreseen in the draft agenda.
(The order of business was thus established)
The next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance.
Mr President, I should like to convey to you a message I received when I was in New York last week.
I met a group called 'September 11 Families for Peaceful Tomorrows'.
They are relatives of some of the victims of the 11 September atrocity and they asked me to convey to you and this House that they do not seek revenge.
They do not want a war against Iraq in their name.
They want a peaceful future for their children, the children of Iraq and the children of the world.
They are looking to Europe for support and in view of that I would ask you to contact President Bush and the leaders of all the Member States that are members of the Security Council, to convey the very clear decision made by this Parliament some weeks ago that there is no basis for a unilateral or pre-emptive war and that the inspectors should be given adequate time to complete the peaceful disarmament of Iraq.
I am happy to convey the views of the House to the American authorities, as I did to the Council some weeks ago.
Mr President, I would like, on behalf of my group, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, to strongly criticise the disgraceful treatment of the dock workers earlier today in front of this building.
We consider their protest to be legitimate and we support them.
It should be pointed out that the aim of the proposal for a directive they are criticising is none other than to reduce salaries and, therefore, to authorise the recruitment of staff from outside the docks to do the work instead of them.
This means the destruction of their status, their trade and their jobs, and we expect them to come to the European institutions bearing flowers!
I find this police control unacceptable!
We should listen to them, we should hear what they have to say and review the proposal for a directive accordingly.
Mr President, I too have a complaint about police repression outside the building, but it relates to Members of this House and not to dock workers.
I arrived from Basle in the bus, with a number of colleagues from various countries, to find the gates barred.
There was no immediate security problem, there were no demonstrators in sight, but the French police refused us admittance to the building.
When I sought to exert my right as a parliamentarian to enter the building, I was physically prevented from doing so and a rather unedifying shoving and shouting match took place.
It is my understanding that for police from a Member State to obstruct parliamentarians in the course of carrying out their duties is contrary to the Treaties.
It is certainly an affront to the dignity of this House.
I should be grateful, therefore, if you would contact the appropriate authorities and make sure, firstly, that nothing like this ever happens again and, secondly, that the French police concerned are given appropriate retraining in the rights and responsibilities of parliamentarians.
You will understand that I am not at all opposed to the liberalisation of port services, but I too would like to lodge my objection to the paranoid way in which the French army insists on protecting our parliament building against possible demonstrators at the moment.
This is, after all, not a barracks or a military academy, this is a house of representatives, and parliamentarians are being refused access to their own Parliament in a particularly arrogant, insolent way by real machos.
First they make you get out of the taxi or the car or the bus in the wrong place, and then when the taxi has gone, they tell you that you have to walk another 400 metres.
There was not a single demonstrator to be seen anywhere nearby, only soldiers protecting a building and not the Members of Parliament.
This is the umpteenth time the city of Strasbourg and the French Government have made it impossible to enjoy working here in Strasbourg.
Either our flights are being cancelled or our cars are being taken away, and now we are even being denied access to our own Parliament.
I think that you must do something about this.
Mr President, I would simply like to tell my fellow Members that I am somewhat surprised.
On the one hand, they complain that there is no security in Brussels and that they are sometimes exposed to abuse.
Here, where every measure is taken to guarantee your safety, you are not satisfied.
You could at least be consistent!
(Applause from the right)
Mr President, I should like to raise once more the case of the plane-spotters in Greece.
You will remember that they were arrested on 8 November 2001.
At their trial on 26 April 2002 many of them were sentenced to terms of imprisonment, but at their appeal on 6 November 2002 those present were acquitted of all charges.
That, eventually, was the good news.
The bad news is that, over four months after their acquittal, their bail money has still not been returned.
At GBP 9 000 each, this is a considerable amount of money and I request that you draw this matter to the attention of the Greek presidency and ask it to take urgent action to redress this regrettable state of affairs, which is causing hardship to the plane-spotters and to their families.
We will follow that up for you.
Mr President, there is something I should like to bring to your attention. A few days ago, I visited Turkey as part of a representation of six MEPs.
May I start by saying that we were delighted that Turkey has made real progress towards the Copenhagen criteria over recent months.
I should like to point out, however, that the former Member of Parliament, Leyla Zana, has been in prison for some ten years now.
When Mr Erdogan's political freedom and rights were violated when he was mayor of Istanbul, we defended his human rights and political freedom here in this Chamber.
We therefore expect the new government to be sensitive to the need to respect human rights; all other things being equal, it is intolerable that a Sakharov prizewinner should languish in a Turkish prison for ten years.
I should like to ask you to lobby the Turkish Government directly for the release of Leyla Zana, for her immediate and unconditional release.
As you know, that is a long-standing position of Parliament.
I am happy to correspond on that matter since you have raised it again, in the light of your visit.
Mr President, I wanted to inform you and the whole of Parliament of the plight of two women, Maria and Natacha Illiasova, who, since summer 2001, have been in prison in Tallinn, Estonia.
Many of us have complained to Estonia, to the Commission delegation in Tallinn, because these women were imprisoned on the grounds that a businessman had been assassinated by two professional hit-men.
These women are accused of ordering the assassination.
The only witness is an Estonian policeman who has declined to testify.
For over 18 months, however, these women have been in prison without trial, in that they have never had a public hearing.
All their hearings have taken place in camera.
The officially-appointed lawyers have not provided them with any documents concerning their case or any information at all on their situation or the proceedings that are underway.
Mr President, could you resume your efforts to ensure that the law, the law as we understand it here in this House - human rights, the rights of the individual - is respected in Estonia in the case of Natacha and Maria Illiasova?
I take note of that.
I will try to follow it up, as requested.
Mr President, I would like to take advantage of the presence of the Commissioner, Mrs Reding, to ask her a specific question.
I refer to what must certainly have been a rather embarrassing decision on the part of the Commission to abolish budget heading B3-1026 relating to the field of sport, which supported the programme entitled 'Sport: preparatory measures for a Community policy in the field of sport', on the basis of notice No 33 published in 2002 by the DG for Culture and Sport.
This programme covered two themes: sport as a tool for educating young people and combating the scourge of doping.
Without warning, the Commission said that there was no longer enough money because the funds had been absorbed by enlargement, an explanation which is decidedly inappropriate, particularly given that many projects had already been carried out and also in view of the fact that next year - as you are aware, Mr President - will be the Year of Educating Young People through Sport.
This was to be a programme to prepare for the Year of Sport and it has been abolished. I would like to know why.
Rather than replying now, perhaps the Commissioner could take note of that and communicate the Commission's view to the Member later.
Mr President, I have taken the floor to ask for information on the participation of the European Parliament in the ministerial segment of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs, which is to take place in Vienna on 16 and 17 April 2003, to take stock, after the first five disastrous years, of the progress made in the UN ten-year plan to combat drugs, which, in theory, should have wiped drugs off the face of the earth by 2008 but which is only bringing a resurgence of repression and suppression of individual rights and freedoms in the field.
I have just returned from a trip to South America, specifically Peru, where the battle to eliminate cultivation of the coca bush is destabilising the region and furthering the ends of terrorism.
There is therefore another war that needs to be stopped.
The April meeting is our chance to do so. I hope that Parliament will take part according to the proper procedures and that the Members will also make representations to the governments of their countries and call upon them to present formal demands for the revision and evaluation of the international conventions and policies on drugs.
We have a delegation participating in that.
Perhaps Mr Cappato could be informed and then make direct contact with the colleagues who will represent us.
Mr President, I was deeply disappointed that the initiative to launch a parliamentary committee of inquiry into the allegations of misuse of EU funds by the Palestinian Authority was not even discussed at the meeting of the Conference of Presidents last Thursday.
Over one quarter of the Members of this House signed a petition to this effect and this controversial issue, which generated a lot of press attention and outside interest by our constituents, deserves better than to be swept under the carpet with no democratic debate being allowed.
Surely the intention of Rule 151 is not to give the political groups the right to decide that the matter should not even be discussed in plenary when across the House so many Members regard this as a very serious matter.
I would appreciate your ruling on the correct procedures under Rule 151(3), as in my view the very democratic credibility of this House is now at stake.
The issue was discussed at some length in the Conference of Presidents in Strasbourg, two meetings ago.
The issue has been handled correctly, in line with the Rules of Procedure.
If colleagues have problems with the Rules, that is a separate issue.
I will send you a note outlining the procedure that was followed and the interpretation of the relevant Rules.
Mr President, I would like to speak on the basis of Rule 8 of our Rules of Procedure.
Current French law stipulates that any Member of the European Parliament elected to a post that places them in a situation of incompatibility, such as president of a French departmental council, shall, purely by virtue of that fact, cease to exercise their mandate.
The legislator's intention to avoid an appeal or option period is clear since the case where a Member of the European Parliament finds themselves in a situation of incompatibility with the exercise of a mandate rather than a post is also provided for.
In the case of incompatibility with a mandate, the legislator considers the consequences of the election being called into question, which it does not do in the case of incompatibility with a post.
The spirit and the letter of the law are clear: in standing for this election, Mr Pasqua must have been aware of what the immediate consequences would be.
Since our last plenary, however, Mr Pasqua, a Member of our Parliament, was re-elected president of the departmental council of Hauts de Seine on 27 February last.
It would seem that the competent authorities in my country have not informed you of the end of Mr Pasqua's mandate.
Mr President, in your role as guarantor of this institution, it is up to you to make enquiries of the competent authorities in my country regarding the implications of this new situation, because, in the eyes of French law, Mr Pasqua is no longer a Member of the European Parliament and we should note the vacancy.
I need to take some advice on this, but under Rule 8(4), incompatibilities, as you have remarked, should ordinarily be notified to the President of the House by the authorities of the Member State in question.
I can only confirm that so far, neither the services of the House nor I have received any such notification in respect of the individual named.
Mr President, on the point made by my friend Mr Tannock, concerning the failure to have a proper debate on the proposed resolution on the Palestinian Authority's spending of EU funds, this is not a question of legality.
I am sure the Rules were complied with. I have no quarrel with that.
What does concern me is the political aspect.
170 Members of this House simply asked for a debate and a small group of people decided, in a closed session, that there would be no debate.
If we are democrats and believe this Parliament has meaning, then we should allow debate to flourish.
That was a mistake and it is a bad signal to send, not just to Members but to the wider public, who now know that, despite the force for that resolution, a small group of people denied them the right to be heard.
That was an error of judgement, and not of legality.
I take note of your point.
I will send a response to you as well as to Mr Tannock.
The request by 170 Members was for the establishment of a committee of inquiry. It was not a request to hold a debate.
The Rules, as they stand, vest the Conference of Presidents with the authority to decide whether or not a committee of inquiry is set up.
That procedure was followed in this case.
I will nevertheless correspond with you concerning the details and interpretations.
We can return to it if colleagues remain dissatisfied with the matter.
Mr President, about two weeks ago, the British authorities arrested a Greek student because, according to press reports, he was collating material for a dissertation on terrorism.
I realise it is up to the British authorities to decide on what criteria they arrest students, but they had a duty, which they failed to honour, to tell the authorities in Greece, as another Member State of the European Union.
This is intolerable and must not happen again.
We are not living in an era of autocratic regimes.
We cooperate within a framework and countries have to tell other countries if for any reason they arrest their citizens.
Mr President, Commissioners, I am particularly glad that you are here.
The Charter of Fundamental Rights, approved by this Parliament, prohibits any discrimination on the grounds of language or of belonging to a national minority and enshrines the principle of freedom of expression and information without the interference of public authorities.
Well, Mr President, Commissioner, the Basque people have suffered further abuse and discrimination from the Spanish institutions.
For preventive reasons - the same argument used by Mr Aznar to justify the war against Iraq - the newspaper Egunkaria has been closed down - and I have a copy in my hand - the only daily entirely published in Basque, the language not just of the Basques, but - according to the most prestigious experts - the primitive language of the Europeans.
And, in order to try to justify the unjustifiable, the Interior Minister of Mr Aznar's government has issued a joint communication with the judge of the National High Court.
This unusual fact calls into question the existence in Spain of the democratic principle of separation of public powers.
This newspaper has been closed for preventive reasons, putting all of its workers out of work, without even complying with the provisions of Article 129 of the Spanish Penal Code, on which their decision is based, since they have not allowed the required prior hearing of the company's legal representatives.
This means there has been no defence, and furthermore means that this judgment is illegal.
Not a single piece of incriminating evidence has been produced on the content of the newspaper, since it is a pluralist, objective and democratic publication.
They have closed it simply because it defends the right of Basques to their own identity and to use their own language.
Furthermore, the director of the newspaper was imprisoned and later freed.
But he has accused the Civil Guard of torture, which takes us even further back, if that is possible, to the times ?
(The President cut off the speaker)
I am sorry to interrupt.
We are running over the allotted time.
Your point was well made but I would ask you to respect our time constraints.
Mr President, the judge of the National High Court issued a cautionary order which explains that the companies Egunkaria Sortzen and Egunkaria, as well as the newspaper which the latter edits, fall within the framework of ETA and, following this cautionary closure, that same judge interviewed the directors of the company and committed five of the ten people arrested to unconditional prison, accused of belonging to a terrorist organisation.
Mr President, this should not come as a surprise to anybody because in 1992 the former Interior Minister for the Basque Government, and now President of the Basque Parliament, said that Egunkaria was part of ETA and in 1993 the spokesman of the Basque Nationalist Party stated publicly that ETA participated in the appointment of the management of the newspaper.
We are not talking about an issue of language, but of the manipulation some people wish to carry out in order to achieve radical votes on 25 May and that, Mr President, is simply repugnant.
I apologise to colleagues who wished to speak but we have overrun our time.
(Protests from Mrs Laguiller, who maintained that the President had ignored the left of the House)
We have rules and I am doing my best to observe them.
The next item is the Commission statement on the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) within the WTO, including cultural diversity.
Mr President, services are one of the new areas of international trade that directly concern social preference and lifestyle and that, therefore, more than goods, are a source of concern to the citizens and their representatives.
These concerns relate, in particular, to the transparency of international negotiations, preserving our public services and behaviour towards developing countries, if I am to go by the questions raised by a number of you.
They are, moreover, reflected in the motions for resolutions tabled before this House.
Before I present to you the European Union's offers for opening up the services markets, I would briefly like to remind you what these negotiations involve.
First of all, let us recall the spirit in which the Union is conducting these negotiations: we need to pursue our economic interests proactively while also defending our European social model and enabling developing countries to integrate more fully into the world economy.
It is that balance which has inspired the Commission's proposals.
In order to clear up certain misunderstandings, let us also recall that our objectives with regard to opening up trade in services are completely unrelated to the liberalisation that seems to be taking place left, right and centre.
What we are discussing is a combination of market access and rules.
The two cannot be separated if we want to achieve our objectives in these international negotiations, which are to reinvigorate growth, integrate the developing countries into world trade and ensure that, in opening up the markets, we respect the various preferences and values of our societies.
We at the Commission believe that negotiations on services are in the interests of both the industrialised countries and the developing countries, for several reasons. First of all, from a general perspective, we can no longer separate trade in goods from trade in services.
Without access to the high-quality systems provided by insurance, banking, accountancy services, telecommunications, transport and distribution, an economy is no longer competitive today.
This applies equally to developed countries and developing countries.
Secondly, the European Union has a great deal to gain from these negotiations.
Services are the most dynamic sector of the European economy.
They represent two-thirds of our gross domestic product and jobs.
Lastly, services are often the Achilles' heel of many developing countries whose export capacity is restricted by low productivity levels and the lack of competition in their service industries.
Most of these countries, furthermore, are well aware of this, as is shown by the fact that more than half of the requests received by the Union relating to opening up trade in services come precisely from developing countries: Kenya, India, Mali, Gambia, Egypt, Mauritius and Brazil, amongst others.
Do these arguments therefore point to a need for the full liberalisation, or even deregulation or privatisation, of services?
Certainly not: a significant number of services are already the subject of trade which is, quite rightly, strictly regulated, and encouragement given to trade in services must respect this regulatory framework which was established by the competent public authorities.
That is why, in our opinion, the Union was right to choose the WTO as the main framework for opening up the services markets.
Contrary to what is sometimes claimed, multilateral negotiations provide greater transparency and better conduct on the part of States since they are based on clear rules which are familiar to and accepted by all participants in the negotiations.
Without organisation of trade at a world level, negotiations on services would take place on an entirely bilateral basis with no common rules of play, which would undoubtedly lead to pressure on the developing countries.
From this perspective, the World Trade Organisation, which is a multilateral organisation if ever there was one, is thus a useful and necessary safeguard against uncontrolled liberalisation.
This framework having been established, the negotiations conform to certain principles that should be broadly recalled before this House, so that the debate is based on clear, accurate facts.
First principle: the negotiations concern trade in services and not the way in which it is regulated in each country.
The States retain the freedom to impose any rules they wish and to entrust the management of these services to public or private undertakings.
The WTO negotiations have no direct or indirect connection with the decisions on privatisation that particular States might take.
Second principle: each country is free to determine which sectors it intends to open up to international competition and which it wishes to keep closed.
I would remind you that, in the WTO, decisions are taken by consensus, with each State having one vote.
Agreement is not possible without the consent of the developing countries, in particular, the most advanced of which, such as China, India and Brazil, are fully able to make themselves heard.
Third principle: there is no sectoral reciprocity in these negotiations.
The United States, for example, could very well decide to open up the education sector without obliging other States to follow suit in the negotiations.
Fourth principle: kingly services are excluded from the scope of the discussion.
The General Agreement on Trade in Services does not cover services that are not provided on a commercial basis or in competition with other service providers.
It is only when the States choose to subject their public services to market rules, therefore, that they become subject to the rules of this market and can enter the negotiations.
Fifth and final principle: with regard to major services of public interest - education, health, culture, water, energy and public transport - each country is free to choose between various formulas.
They can organise the service as a public or private monopoly.
They can open up the services market to competing suppliers but restrict access to national companies.
They could also, for example, open up the services market to national and foreign suppliers, but without entering into any multilateral GATS commitment.
Lastly, they can, for example, enter into GATS commitments relating to the right of foreign companies to supply services in addition to national suppliers, but have the choice of whether or not to grant them full national treatment.
In any case, liberalisation, once accepted, only affects non-discrimination and in no way involves giving up regulatory power.
The General Agreement on Services does not, therefore, affect the definition of public service missions, their organisation or their funding.
From this point of view, the member States of the WTO retain all their freedom.
We consider these protective barriers to be the best guarantees for Europe to be able to continue to develop its own model of services of public interest while still benefiting from the advantages relating to opening up trade in services.
This is a more effective way of preserving the European model than excluding services of public interest from the scope of the General Agreement on Trade in Services, a suggestion which I have often had cause to debate.
I believe that such exclusion would be counterproductive, as it would lead to the multilateral definition of a comprehensive list of services considered to be of public interest and would open a multilateral debate on the desirable content of this list, a subject on which each Member State of the WTO might have a different view.
I feel that, ultimately, we would run the risk of ending up with a more limited list than the Union itself would wish for.
I shall now come to the negotiations themselves.
What are our objectives?
Eliminating or reducing a number of barriers to access to several sectors where the Union has world-class companies - telecoms, business services, professional services, financial services, construction, distribution, transport, energy and tourism.
In order to be able to achieve these proactive objectives, the Union must present a substantial offer.
Naturally, our requests and offers are not just improvisation.
They are the conversion into specific negotiation documents of political guidelines that were drawn up in December 2000, following discussions with the other European institutions - the Council and Parliament.
Since then, the documents that set out our approach to the negotiations have been widely published, in particular on our website.
The requests made of the WTO partners, which were tabled last July, cover a number of sectors which have been made public. I may come back to them later.
I would specify that these requests do not seek to dismantle public services or privatise public companies.
No request has been made to any country by the Union with regard to health services or audiovisual services, and only the United States has received a request from us, restricted to privately funded higher education.
As regards the offers, we at the Commission sent the proposed offer to the Council and to Parliament at the beginning of February, trying to respond to the requests of both developed countries and developing countries, with particular emphasis on the requests made to us by developing countries.
In terms of sectors, we propose to respond to the requests we have received on financial services, information technology services, telecoms, transport, distribution, postal and courier services, professional services and tourism.
In so doing, we would like to make a particular effort to take account of the requests of developing countries by proposing to improve the Union's commitments in terms of the temporary movement of persons.
This offer was designed to safeguard public services fully within the Union, and I shall come back to that before concluding.
No new commitments have been proposed in the fields of education and health, and we are not proposing any commitments in the field of audiovisual services.
I shall come back to that with my colleague, Mrs Reding.
The Commission's work has mainly been inspired by the comments received in response to a public consultation that began at the end of last autumn.
I would specify that the details of our proposed offer are still confidential at present, so that the Member States have the necessary room for negotiation and those of you with access to the details of this offer can work on it.
I know and I am well aware that the restricted classification under which this text was sent to you does not fully satisfy you, or in any case some of you, and that is why we have done our best to contribute to an informed parliamentary debate.
Today's sitting is proof of this, in addition to the appearances I have also made before the committee to which I report.
One last point on this matter of transparency: I have decided to make all our proposals public once they have been finalised.
The European Union will be the first member of the World Trade Organisation to take this step.
I did this in response to a number of requests, including, moreover, a significant number from this House.
I did not do it with regard to the requests addressed to third countries.
Indeed, if I were to make these requests public, a number of our partners in the negotiations would view this publicity as an attempt to put pressure on them, which would not be good for our negotiating position.
A quick word about two sectors for which the current proposal does not contain an offer.
First of all, energy services.
We are not proposing any improvement in our commitments at this stage, pending completion of the work underway within the WTO on the classification of energy services within the scope of the Agreement on Services.
At this stage, we are not proposing any commitments with regard to trade in water collection, purification and distribution either, both because we have only received one request in this sector, and because we would also like to clarify with our WTO partners what exactly the provision of services covers in this sector.
Having said that, this is a field in which we have significant active interests, and some of our Member States have already pointed this out to us.
One last point before I talk about cultural diversity and the audiovisual sector: we are currently at the offer stage.
It is the beginning of the negotiations and our opening offer would, of course, only become a commitment if, during the negotiations, others were also prepared to improve access to their services market for our European operators.
Lastly, let us talk about trade in cultural and audiovisual services and about cultural diversity.
Culture and, more specifically, the audiovisual sector, are not excluded from the General Agreement on Trade in Services.
Quite simply, at the end of the Uruguay Round, the Union fully preserved its current and future freedom of manoeuvre by not making any commitments in terms of market access or national treatment in this sector.
Furthermore, at the time, we kept a long list of exemptions from the most-favoured-nation clause which allows us to discriminate between third countries with regard to the treatment given, within the Union, to their audiovisual works.
It is this freedom of manoeuvre that we used commonly to call 'cultural exception' and which has been renamed 'preservation of cultural diversity'.
The Commission's mandate for the negotiations underway consists of preserving political requests in terms of preserving and promoting cultural diversity.
Entirely naturally, we are therefore sticking to our mandate and are not proposing any commitments in the field of audiovisual services in these negotiations.
As the promotion of cultural diversity is included in the EC Treaty, it naturally forms part of our trade policy.
Some WTO Member States have already made known their expectations in the audiovisual sector. These include the United States, Brazil and Japan.
Others, such as India, have also announced active interests without, however, having tabled specific requests.
It is therefore clear to us that developed countries and developing countries share the same interests and we must - and this is the position Mrs Reding and I want to put to you today - be fully aware that the promotion of cultural diversity cannot be reduced to the defence by each Member State of its own national industry.
This is not about creating a new form of disguised protectionism which would not convince anyone.
We believe we could convince countries, in particular the developing countries, more effectively of the legitimacy of our argument if we were able to show our genuine openness to diversity and, to that end, we need a proactive approach.
The defensive role in this matter is my responsibility.
My colleague, Mrs Reding, is responsible for the proactive part and will now update you on our progress.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, the European Union has always declared its commitment to cultural diversity, a commitment which is also an obligation under Article 151 of the Treaty.
Our ambition is to unite the peoples, not just build a free trade area.
In this regard, respect for cultural and linguistic diversity within the Union is a basic principle, a principle which the Union is under obligation to uphold in international trade negotiations, as my colleague, Mr Lamy, has just said, but also to promote with active, proactive policies which can influence our cultural policies.
The Union is also called upon to promote at international level both preservation of and respect for this diversity, which is the essential basis for intercultural dialogue and cultural exchange at world level.
In this sense, the Union is one of the major players in a controlled globalisation which meets the expectations of the people.
In terms of cultural matters, particularly, the European project is incompatible with a form of globalisation which would be liable to erode national, regional or local identities and threaten linguistic and cultural diversity.
Moreover, the debates underway in the various international forums on cultural diversity clearly demonstrate that Europe is not alone.
In this matter, we have allies.
I see the response of the Commission and the European Union in the area of cultural diversity as being structured around three main lines.
Firstly, as Mr Lamy explained, a firm position in the WTO comprising no commitments in the area of the liberalisation of audiovisual and cultural services, in order to preserve the freedom necessary for the preservation and development of national and Community instruments seeking to achieve cultural diversity objectives.
Secondly, the promotion of cultural exchanges which respect cultural diversity at world level, in particular by means of a debate on cooperation policies.
In this regard, the enhancement or strengthening of the Union's role in cultural cooperation with third countries would appear to be very important, for the Union is one of the leading players in North-South solidarity.
Thirdly, the active participation of the Union in international discussions on cultural diversity.
Ladies and gentlemen, I personally am convinced that such a debate is appropriate and necessary, for globalisation raises a number of questions to which the liberalisation of trade cannot alone provide the answers.
It is therefore important that we are present in international forums such as Unesco to discuss cultural diversity and to fight to preserve it.
At this juncture, the Commission has not decided on the form and content of a possible future international instrument on cultural diversity, but I feel it is important for you to know that the Commission is present at the forums where these discussions take place.
Moreover, I welcome the fact that the Greek Presidency wants to develop the debate at Community level on cultural diversity in general, including the aspects related to international law, with a view to the informal Culture Council at the end of May.
I intend to contribute to the coordination of Member States' deliberations desired by the Presidency by sending ministers information, particularly on the Unesco process, in order to stimulate the debate between the European nations on this matter.
Another aspect is education.
The most important thing to remember is that public services are not under threat from GATS.
Firstly, the agreement lays down a general provision protecting a large number of public services, specifically services which are provided on neither a commercial nor a competitive basis.
Secondly, even where services which are not covered by this exemption are concerned, the States have the right to decide, according to a basis which can be very detailed, the bottom up approach, in which sectors and sub-sectors they will grant access to their markets or national treatment.
Thirdly, even after opting for market access or national treatment, they can qualify their commitments with conditions stipulating the restrictions they will apply under their national legislation.
Fourthly and lastly, GATS recognises the States' right to preserve or introduce regulations, laws or other provisions providing for access to quality services at reasonable prices.
This applies to universal service obligations.
Let us take as an example an area which concerns us and you particularly, the area of education.
The commitments given by the Commission and its Member States at the Uruguay Round only relate to private education.
Public services in the field of education are not affected by these commitments at all and the aim of the commitments given is to ensure that, insofar as and only insofar as a private services market exists, the nationals and operators of the partner countries can have access to them under the same conditions as the nationals of the country concerned.
Moreover, even as regards the private sector covered by the commitments, the Member States have been able to specify the content through a whole series of conditions that they already apply and that they will be able to continue to apply.
Thus, one country requires teachers to be employed from among its nationals, another that the majority of members of a board of governors must be nationals, and another that non-nationals have to have authorisation from the ministry before opening an establishment.
As regards the current round, the Doha Round, we certainly do not intend to change the commitments we have given in the field of education to include any points relating to public systems.
The public education system will therefore remain exactly the same.
We examined the requests of the different countries with a view to changing our commitments relating to private education services.
After consulting the Member States and the different parties concerned, we concluded that it is not appropriate to give new commitments increasing access to the Community market in this sector either.
Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the position is clear and precise.
I would, however, like to say one more thing.
Although we are not going to open up the market in the sense I have just described, we will subscribe to the offer on the provision of education to students from third countries. This is precisely the aim of the project 'Erasmus World'.
Indeed, although we are protecting our European system within Europe, this European system is open to students from all over the world.
Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, today we are discussing the European Commission's offers on GATS, and these are very important offers, because we must remember that the service sector in the European Union is a key sector for our economy.
The Commissioner rightly points out that this is the most dynamic sector.
The European Union is also one of the biggest exporters of services in the world, so it is also an important matter of self-interest.
We must provide access to the services markets.
Not only in our own interest but also in the interest of developing countries.
After all, the development agenda is what the Doha WTO round is about.
I think that we must see the practical results in the light of the economies of the developing countries, so I am very pleased that 50% of the requests have come from developing countries.
Our experience in the EU also tells us that the liberalisation of services, both in the energy and telecom sector and in the financial services sector, should normally deliver a better quality and more efficient services market with a broader range of products and better prices, as long as it goes hand in hand with properly established rules and guarantees for citizens.
I therefore think that the Commission is setting a great deal of store by the concept of general services, and I would like to call on it to take a closer look at the so-called universal service obligations that can also be delivered by private service providers instead of solely by the public sector.
My group can support the Commission's offer to exclude the health sector, the social sector and the education sector from an offer, but I would also like clarification on the situation with regard to universities.
The Commissioner has mentioned the Erasmus project, but does this mean that only individual Member States can make an offer on this point and that nothing is happening at all with regard to universities throughout the whole of the EU?
Commissioner Reding provided a very convincing argument for not making a new proposal for the audio-visual sector.
I do not have to go into that in any more detail.
I would, however, like to say something about computer-related services.
On the one hand, we must naturally ensure that we do not cause a massive brain drain towards the West from countries like India.
We must also provide our own training.
On the other hand, we must also avoid a situation in which people work under other conditions in the European Union, because this could result in social dumping.
I therefore think that it is important to create a good balance, and since September 11 we have naturally also had to look at security aspects.
It is of course a good thing that we are doing more to include the environment in this.
Sustainability is not just a matter for the West, it is a matter for the whole world.
I therefore think that it should also benefit developing countries.
Excluding water treatment and distribution for the time being seems to me to be a wise policy.
GATS directly affects the interests of many EU citizens, and I appreciate Commissioner Lamy's efforts to broaden communication and provide more information.
This is still a matter involving ambassadors, closed doors and a lack of transparency, and I am of the opinion that there should be much stronger parliamentary representation in this regard.
Bearing Cancun in mind, I therefore also hope that the Commissioner will put forward new proposals to make this process even more transparent.
We cannot turn our backs on current events, however, and Iraq is of course putting us into a situation in which the world community is split right down the middle.
How can we now prevent the Iraq question from resulting in serious trade conflicts between the European Union and the United States which may obstruct the results of Cancun?
I would like to ask the Commissioner what initiatives she has taken in this area and what results they have produced.
In this context, there are of course two essential problems with the United States that have not yet been resolved.
On the one hand, the so-called FSC arrangement, the favourable tax legislation for American exporters which must now be reviewed thanks to the WTO statement, and on the other hand, the alarming reports that American draft legislation is being prepared that will limit the tax benefits of subsidiaries of non-US companies.
I should like to ask the Commissioner what the situation is in this regard.
Can we expect something like this from the Americans?
Then there is the pressure we are under to agree to the American proposals regarding genetically modified food.
I think that it is very important to set this issue right and to hear what is happening about it.
In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Commissioner Lamy speaks about the fact that 2003 will be the year in which the WTO must deliver.
What does he mean by this, and what can we expect in this regard?
Commissioner, since your appointment you have adopted a very good habit of consulting and informing the European Parliament, for which we are grateful.
We are also grateful for your support for the changes to the Treaty necessary to give us the powers we need in the trade area.
Just as you are responsive to us, we have to be responsive to those who elect us.
You know as well as we do that there are genuine and widespread worries about GATS.
You have mentioned some of them: transparency, the feeling that a lot of unsavoury things are being done secretly; threats to EU jobs, which have prompted, I suppose, the dock workers' demonstration we saw today; threats to public services, with particularly acute dangers to developing countries; threats to the ability of Member States to regulate, and particular fears in the culture area, on which others will speak.
At the same time, the European public is well aware - since 60% of them or more work in service industries - that there are possibilities for EU firms in widespread trade in services.
So they face the dual interest which you have delineated.
Developing countries have not rejected GATS completely.
However, the fears about public services, regulation and extension and the fact that the developing countries do not have the capacity for the administration that an opening-up of service markets will require all mean that the implications of opening up trade in services need to be very fully assessed.
I would put more emphasis on that than on anything else in our resolution.
Before we go any further we want to know - not in a perfunctory exercise but in a detailed and comprehensive assessment - what this means.
Mr President, the curious thing about the EU position on GATS is that it has become a very defensive position. It is not defensive to anyone outside Europe, but within an internal debate in which the Commission, and perhaps the EU generally, the position is defensive vis-Ã -vis campaign groups within the European Union which have decided, for some good reasons but also a lot of bad reasons, to criticise both the GATS agreement and the EU stance.
My group would like to focus on that point.
If, in the future, we want to prevent European Union trade policy being shaped - and sometimes arbitrarily shaped - by both the press and specific campaign groups, we must reassert parliamentary prerogatives in this field to open up the debate to proper, accountable public scrutiny.
That is why we urge colleagues in other groups not only to support greater transparency in the way in which these negotiations are conducted, but also, as Mrs McNally has already said, to give strong support to filling the current vacuum in the Convention and making sure that the European Parliament more generally gains the right of assent over all future GATS and WTO agreements.
Mr President. I am speaking as a member of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, and I would like to attempt to pick up on what Commissioner Lamy said earlier.
He said that he is responsible for defensive measures whereas Mrs Reding is responsible for proactive measures.
I seem to remember, however, that your mandate for Seattle in 1999 included the promotion as well as the preservation of cultural diversity.
In terms of the promotion of cultural diversity, which is the more difficult task, although I thank you for your efforts at preservation, I am astonished that, ultimately, only audiovisual services have been retained.
What is being done to preserve cultural, leisure and sports services?
That is my first question.
My second question is to Commissioner Reding.
Since your neighbour, Commissioner Lamy, has made you responsible for the proactive measures, how is that being addressed in the Treaty?
We are worried, concerned about the future Treaty and what it holds for culture.
The commitment to promote cultural diversity is an obligation, you both say, in the Treaty.
Nevertheless, we would prefer it to be a more binding obligation, as you, of all people, are aware.
We would like Article 151(4) to be respected and given due importance once again in the future Treaty.
We will now move on to another cause for concern on the proactive side of things which may also fall within Mr Lamy's remit - the international instrument.
You were both, like myself, at the professional meeting on the instrument for cultural diversity in France a month or so ago.
I know that the issue interests you and I thank you for supporting this project.
However, I am extremely disappointed to see that the majority of the Members have abandoned the question of the international instrument in the motions tabled today, even though it has the support of 50 or so countries and has been proposed by President Chirac and others to Unesco.
The feasibility study has been carried out by a Franco-Canadian group.
The matter is very important and a great deal of work has already been done. I am surprised at the lack of interest displayed by my fellow Members.
Mr President, I will try not to read any sinister political motivation into that.
Commissioner Lamy, you say that plenary debates like this are to fully inform Parliament about the progress of GATS negotiations but, in the absence of the document that would tell us precisely what is being demanded of whom, this exchange is almost entirely academic.
If, in order to find that information, the majority of parliamentarians have to resort to leaks on NGO websites, then really we are a very long way from exercising parliamentary scrutiny.
So, while I am grateful to you for speaking to us tonight, I would like to make clear that this does not constitute any kind of political scrutiny.
You have made it clear that you believe that you have gone as far as you can, as Commissioner, to make GATS texts available to us.
You tell us that you are trying to be open but that you have limited room for manoeuvre.
Well, as parliamentarians we are doing what we can to increase that room, but can I ask you specifically what you are doing to increase that room for manoeuvre?
In your letter last October to the Chair of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, you accused Parliamentarians of making false claims about what you called the alleged intransparency of the EU decision-making process.
You went on to say, and I quote, 'the current rules of access allow the European Parliament to fully exercise its task of political control'.
Can I ask you whether you still genuinely believe that the current rules are sufficient?
Secondly, the mandate.
Since the level of public awareness about the implications and complexities of the GATS process has grown enormously over the past few years, can you tell us why you believe it is still appropriate to negotiate within the WTO on the basis of a Council mandate granted back in 1999?
Would it not be more appropriate to adopt a new mandate and in it make explicit the rights of public authorities and institutions at all levels to regulate public services in order to maintain social and environmental standards free from challenge under GATS?
Finally, development.
DG Trade's press release announcing the EU-GATS offers says they are all about helping developing countries.
Let us look at the figures.
The EU made 109 requests and received just 27 requests back.
Only half of those were from developing countries and just one was from a least developed country.
Let us not fool ourselves with the rhetoric that this is favouring the poorest.
The figures show that it clearly is not.
Mr President, Commissioner, in matters of international trade, as in matters of war and peace, there is a European opinion. There is, moreover, more broadly speaking, a general opinion, and that opinion is against, is clearly against services - culture, education, health - being thrown into the infernal machine of the World Trade Organisation.
That opinion exists, so why are you not taking it into account?
Why, in the pursuit of what pleasure - it is ultimately a rather egotistical pleasure, the Commission's self-interest - are you going to open this Pandora's box, which, we are quite aware, will yield only the fragmentation of the European social model and the breaking up of the way of life which our respective nations have been building for their citizens for a century, a century and a half.
In these areas, it is not international trade which creates wealth, it is the strength of the internal markets, the power of national citizenship, the creative power of the people themselves.
Why, then, I reiterate, are we going to open this Pandora's box?
Mr President, Commissioner, I have heard it said that international trade does not create wealth.
Two great Europeans, Adam Smith and David Ricardo, have explained to us that the wealth of nations benefits greatly precisely from international trade, and that is how Europe's wealth has increased.
As Commissioner Lamy has had occasion to point out on a number of occasions, further liberalisation of international trade in services is vital for the European economy, which, it is essential to note, both depends on services and can export them.
That is why I feel that we should condemn the fact that the European Union, as Mr Clegg said just now, is in a defensive position with its back against the wall, not just as regards agriculture but where international negotiations on services are concerned too.
In saying that the European Union's objective is to defend and promote the European social model more effectively, the Commission is almost apologising for giving consumers more choice.
You, Commissioner, said that your aim is to establish negotiations in which the collective preferences and values of our society are respected.
I believe that the best way to respect the preferences of the European citizens is to open up international trade in the audiovisual sector too.
The European citizens must be the ones to decide whether cinema or other audiovisual products are better in Europe, whether they want those produced in Europe or those produced elsewhere, not to mention the fact that the large-scale distribution of music and films over the Internet is in danger of raising a question which is already longstanding, the question of protection of alleged cultural diversity in the field of audiovisual services.
We must let the citizens choose, as in the case of education.
I will end, Mr President, by saying that, as regards public utilities, as regards water and other services, too little is being done.
Europe has shown that liberalisation is not incompatible with regulating and guaranteeing the quality of the services provided to the citizens.
Mr President, Commissioner Reding, Commissioner Lamy, on behalf of my group and, I am sure, of the whole of this House's Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, I welcome the Commission's decision not to make any offer to deregulate educational, cultural and audiovisual services in this GATS round.
Although we emphatically want borders to be opened up to international trade, there is a fundamental distinction to be drawn between cultural services and others, such as those in telecommunications, transport, or, indeed, finance.
This makes it necessary to anchor this special role played by cultural and audiovisual services in the social and political cohesion of peoples in the relevant laws on contract.
Culture must not be made subject to the rules of the market or to commercial law; instead, we need regulation that takes into consideration what is appropriate to each area, and so we have to find a global solution to enable Article 151(4) of our European Treaties to be the means whereby Europe's, and the world's, cultural diversity is secured and supported in the long term and in a sustainable way.
It is for this reason that we need a two-phase process in the future.
The Commission is to be thanked for setting out the first phase in today's proposal that GATS should not cover the provision of cultural and audiovisual services.
The second stage goes beyond that, and I want to say how grateful I am to Commissioner Reding, who, with this in mind, is representing the Commission's and Parliament's views - and, I hope, the Council's - in the international discussions and working parties on the subject.
There is a need for us to devise our own international convention, an international instrument of our own, if the future of cultural diversity is to be secured.
Excellent work has already been done in this area by the Council of Europe, Unesco and, especially, the Francophone Conference.
I am quite sure that, by strengthening cultural diversity across the world in this way, we could effectively allay people's fears of globalisation, whilst at the same time enhancing and advancing worldwide intercultural dialogue - the need for which we are, in these times, more aware than ever.
Commissioner Lamy, Commissioner Reding, as you have, indeed, noted, these GATS negotiations are giving rise to a great deal of concern in the countries of the European Union, and this trend is reminiscent in many respects of unrest at the time of the Multilateral Agreement on Investments (MAI).
Indeed, GATS does contain provisions on investments too.
That said, more broadly speaking, the concern is due to the fact that the negotiations and their outcome will affect much more than trade rules, impacting on the internal rules of the countries belonging to the WTO as well.
When we talk about water supply or the postal services sector, for example, not about cross-border postal services but the internal organisation of the postal services sector, it is clear that we are going beyond the bounds of international trade.
Furthermore, that raises the question, with regard to both this agreement and the TRIPS agreement on intellectual property, that the WTO might be going beyond its remit.
The problem with this agreement is precisely that it lumps everything together: banking and insurance services but also water and energy supply, postal services, education and health, potentially.
In this regard, it is Europe's negotiating line that will allow us to make distinctions and ensure that some areas are not, indeed, placed under the authority of the WTO and its Dispute Settlement Body.
The first point I would like to raise concerns the protection of European public services, for we have witnessed a dangerous shift in recent months.
At the beginning, the Commission's position and statements declared that liberalisation offers would not be made in the field of European public services.
Then we said that liberalisation offers would not be made in the areas of health, education and audiovisual services.
However, European services, public services, are much more wide-ranging than that.
In actual fact, we can see that offers have been made in the field of postal services and that, subject to clarification and classification in the WTO, offers could be made in the field of energy and water.
We therefore call upon the Commission to take a clear line and to exclude European public services from all liberalisation offers, which must be the competence of the Member States, the Council and the European Parliament, not the competence of the WTO.
Secondly, reciprocity is not automatic, but there must be consistency, and the Union cannot ask others to liberalise public service sectors and then expect not to be asked to do the same.
We have already requested that countries such as Tanzania, Mozambique and Bangladesh liberalise their water sectors, for example.
I believe we must not put that kind of pressure on the developing countries.
Quite the opposite: we must promote cooperation, we must promote investment in sectors where these countries need it but within the framework of cooperation, letting them decide what environmental, social or other rules to impose on foreign investors.
Thirdly and lastly, I believe, Mr Lamy, that what you have said about excluding public services by revising the agreement and Article 1(3) thereof is not right.
It would be sufficient to amend the subparagraph which restricts the definition of governmental services to services which are not provided on a commercial or competitive basis and stipulate that the States belonging to the WTO are free to exclude their public services from this negotiation.
The European Union must indeed take the lead in the WTO negotiations about the liberalisation of trade in services and the achievement of a general GATS agreement.
These negotiations are certainly more than crucial for Europe.
First of all, the fact is that services are forming an ever more significant part of world trade, 24% of which, as we know, is accounted for by the European Union.
Furthermore, the European Union is currently the biggest importer and the biggest exporter of services in the world.
Another reason to take these GATS negotiations in hand is naturally - or unfortunately, I should say - the continuing slowdown of economic growth.
We must therefore concentrate more than ever before on the trade in services, and this once again applies in particular to the European Union where services represent more than two-thirds of the total gross domestic product.
We must not, however, negotiate solely on the basis of our own interests but also on the basis of the interests of other countries and other parts of the world.
Liberalisation means we must also open our borders more to services from third countries and thus contribute to their further development.
Mr President, very briefly, it is essential that an evaluation of the impact of liberalisation is carried out at WTO and European Union level, not just at Member State level.
A moratorium is not a good idea.
Bilateral liberalisation is very successful and, most importantly, developing countries frequently request it.
Progress has been made in transparency but there is no WTO forum and the European Parliament has only a very limited power of consultation.
The battle to defend public services is falling far short of expectations.
The threats of disintegration lie within the European Union, where competition policy is inappropriately applied and the specific rules much too weak.
Examining Mr Lamy's offers, we see that they are strictly confined to the internal choices of the Member States and the Union.
We must not forget the priority of development, and we must not speak in place of the South.
That said, I would like to see whether our demands for liberalisation take into account the need of the countries of the southern hemisphere for services of general interest, and I would point out that there is no framework for the activity of multinational firms.
Lastly, there is a dreadful imbalance between the rapid rate of liberalisation and the lack of public goods at regional and world level.
When will there be an action strategy for the European Union?
Mr President, I can identify with the criticisms and fears that have been referred to, among them the lack of Parliamentary control, the need for improvements in information policy, and transparency.
With all due respect, Commissioner, there are still, between confidentiality and absolute transparency, many practicable ways ahead.
This is a reproach directed at the Member States and also at the Commission.
Rather than providing elucidation about the various demands or the degree of willingness to deregulate, the documents available tend to be more of a playground for those who interpret these things.
Commissioner Lamy, you began with a report full of atmosphere, propagandising for the European model, and referring to the interest of developing countries.
I would have liked it if Parliament, in its resolution, were to have more to say about the developing countries.
What you said at the outset about privatisation, though, is not something that this House should accept without demur.
A chain of consequences follows if you give people what they want.
I do not want Brussels to be the venue for a debate on a liberalisation introduced to Europe through a back door called GATS.
Both my esteemed colleague Mrs Fraisse and Mrs Hieronymi have already voiced the most important things about art and culture, matters which are of political concern to me as well.
It is perhaps enough for me to say that it is to you that we owe the distinction between working defensively and working offensively.
Thank you very much for the report you have put before us today.
It is now for us to move into the second stage, taking the offensive in the same way and joining as one in this debate, using every possible means of action available to us in order to create an international and binding instrument to protect and promote cultural diversity.
Mr President, we feel that this debate on the opening of WTO negotiations to liberalise trade in services is extremely patchy.
Not all the cards are on the table and the initial contacts have, for the most part , not been transparent.
The Commission prides itself on a negotiating mandate dating from 1999, before Seattle, which is now completely obsolete.
The national parliaments have not debated the matter transparently and the European Parliament is being called upon to endorse everything on the basis of a brief statement from the Commission.
We are not against all liberalisation in principle, but it must at all times be controlled by the peoples concerned.
The people must never be in a position where their hands are tied.
If we follow the Commission in this matter, we will find ourselves caught up in ill-defined negotiations which could have a serious effect on the people's control over their public services and all the rules safeguarding their societies.
Of course, the Commission assures us that no liberalisation offer will be made by the Union in the fields of health or education or the audiovisual sector and that it will negotiate to preserve cultural diversity, but these declarations are not enough for us.
Why these fields and not others?
We have too much experience not to be familiar with the wheels within wheels and traps hidden in this kind of agreement, which only come to light after the event, when we have already signed on the dotted line.
Commissioner, on Thursday, in this hemicycle, we are going to debate the closure of major firms due to relocation and the resulting human tragedies.
If we want to avoid further human tragedies in the future, we must address problems earlier on in the process.
We must start by refraining now from signing agreements such as the GATS agreement which would tie our hands in the future.
That is why we call for these negotiations to be postponed until a genuinely public, democratic debate has taken place, until we have clearly assessed all the implications of GATS.
Mr President, I wish to support Commissioner Lamy on the far-sighted and important programme he is pursuing.
The whole question about the importance of services and opening up service markets is one we are about to address seriously within our own internal market.
We do not yet have an internal market for services.
I expect we will hear some of the concerns in the debates tonight when we look at our own market.
However, it is absolutely right to address broader issues.
After all, as Mr Lamy has said on a number of occasions, within the European Union we have the best-developed single market technologies of any trading bloc in the world.
It is right that we should be leading in this field.
One of the most important proposals we have worked on here is the liberalisation of electronic communications, a single framework for a converging sector.
It is those electronic communications that are really opening up the way to a global trade in services that we have never seen before.
It is right to anticipate that.
Liberalisation is always going to be difficult.
If you accept market disciplines and the opening-up of a market, you must expect reconstruction; you must expect firms to close and look for new possibilities.
Surely we are not saying here that we should go back to the days of protectionism?
Far from it!
We want to look at how markets will evolve.
That includes the developing world as well.
A couple of months ago I was at an important meeting in Brussels, with representatives from the developing world talking about electronic communications and how they want to build their infrastructures.
They realise that having the infrastructure in place is going to open up great opportunities for their own economies and for trade globally.
That is what we want to encourage.
Let us be positive about it.
I urge you, Commissioner, to continue your work on this and not listen to the siren voices in this Chamber tonight that are urging you to stop or slow down.
Let us move ahead!
Mr President, Commissioner, not only in the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport and here in the plenary are GATS and culture the subject of the most in-depth discussion; they are also being discussed everywhere where people make art and culture their business, and there is great disquiet about it - resulting from a lack of information, deficient transparency, and concern about the excessive influence on culture and the audiovisual sector exerted by market forces.
I might add that the extent of the disquiet and the size of the information gap are also demonstrated by the day of action and protest against GATS to be mounted this coming Thursday in many European capital cities - in Rome, Paris, London and Vienna - by school and higher education students and trade unionists, which will be a day of European education and action.
The concept of a cultural industry makes this development more marked.
Critics are concerned that, in this field, countries are seen as growth areas subject to market mechanisms and capable of developing their own dynamics going far beyond what was originally laid down.
One example of this is the American proposal for promoting the import of virtual goods, at the same time as removing such things as audiovisual programmes via the Internet from the GATS safeguard clauses, something that must be firmly rejected.
Not only is cultural diversity to be respected; it must also be safeguarded.
Although what is termed the cultural exception in the GATS negotiations is meant to be an exception from the usual rules of competition, the fact that the concept has never acquired legal force justifies the questions that are being asked and the concern that is felt as to whether that is sufficient to maintain our values.
Or do we not need an international legal instrument whereby it is acknowledged that states have the right to determine cultural policy on the basis of their own needs, and to take measures of their own to promote artistic endeavour and public audiovisual services?
Cultural diversity does not mean limiting oneself to one's own borders and cutting the industry back; it is about being open to diversity, and that means giving it a chance to survive.
(The President cut off the speaker)
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, the service sector is far and away the most important sector in the European economy.
The European Union is the biggest exporter of commercial services in the world, accounting for 26% of worldwide trade in services, as opposed to 22% in the United States and 7% in Japan.
The trade in services in the European Union therefore accounts for more than two-thirds of our gross foreign product and jobs.
So trade in services far exceeds trade in goods.
Further liberalisation also benefits developing countries, because trade in services promotes the infrastructure, such as telecommunications, and also the financial infrastructure for the trade in goods.
Thus GATS also contributes to the Doha round.
In my view we must therefore stand four-square behind liberalisation and in particular avoid focusing too much on the exceptions that some of the Member States want to implement.
The most important sectors are the transport, tourism, financial and telecommunications service sectors.
Audio-visual services form a relatively small part of the offer.
It is therefore ridiculous that Member States who do not want this are denying this Parliament any say because they are afraid of changes to the audio-visual sector.
I therefore support my colleague Mr Nicholas Clegg's plea for change during the Convention.
Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, concern is growing in every quarter at the wave of opening up and privatisation of services that the negotiations under the General Agreement on Trade and Services might unleash, however much the Commissioner insists that this will not happen.
The right of EU and third-country citizens, including those of developing countries, of access to essential goods and services including water, education, health, culture, energy, transport and telecommunications, is in danger of being undermined.
We are all familiar with disastrous examples of the privatisation of services in many countries, including transport in the United Kingdom, electricity in the United States and in Portugal, and water distribution and healthcare services in many developing countries.
We are therefore concerned to learn of the Commission's proposals, which overlook the importance of public services in areas such as energy, transport, postal services and telecommunications, in terms of social cohesion, the public's well-being and social inclusion.
The proposals also fail to take due account of the way in which social movements have been mobilised on a major scale to protect high-quality public services.
A moratorium must therefore be declared on the liberalisation of services and the Commission must draw up a detailed report on the foreseeable economic, social and environmental consequences of the policies of liberalisation emanating from the World Trade Organization, both in the European Union and in the developing countries.
The essential role of public services in every country's development and social cohesion must also be respected, with no proposals put forward that provide for further liberalisations in third countries or for European Union bids in the field of public services.
The Commission must also call for cultural diversity not only to be preserved, but also promoted, as has already been stressed here on more than one occasion.
Furthermore, deepening democracy, exerting greater control over the multinationals and protecting the development of the least developed countries and regions and the citizens' interests requires a democratic debate, requires national parliaments and the European Parliament to be consulted and the rule of unanimity to be upheld in negotiations in all of these areas. The role of the World Trade Organization must also be reduced and the United Nations General Assembly must be given a more active role in this field.
Commissioner Reding, Commissioner Lamy, I will confine myself to discussing the liberalisation of the water sector.
Mr Lamy, you think that more competition will provide the poor with high quality drinking water.
I personally dispute your view and I believe that there are more and more of us who do so.
Any commercialisation of water will automatically lead to an increase in consumption, for that is precisely how the system works.
You say that there is no mention of liberalising the resource in the requests the Union makes to the developing countries.
That does not make things any better, for commercialising water distribution will make it impossible to guarantee proper water management.
Moreover, we also know from experience that it is not the poor who benefit from commercialising water.
Bogota, Buenos Aires and Jakarta are proof of that.
Therefore, let us have the political courage to define water as a public good and exclude it from GATS.
Madam President, the forthcoming trade round must not, in my opinion, jeopardise cultural diversity.
According to Unesco, culture comprises all the distinctive spiritual, material, intellectual and emotional features which characterise a society or social group.
In addition to the arts and literature, it encompasses ways of life, fundamental human rights, sets of values, traditions and beliefs.
The right to culture is a fundamental human right.
It is enshrined as such in the Universal Declaration on Human Rights.
Cultural diversity must not just be safeguarded: it must be furthered and promoted as well.
Of course, this applies to all the Member States of the Union, but it also applies to the developing countries, for cultural diversity is an integral part of our human heritage.
In order to avoid running the risk of culture being seen as just another product one day in the future, we must provide it with a new legal framework so that it does not have to be part of the negotiations on world trade.
Culture is not just another commodity.
The WTO cannot and must not be the forum for the debate on culture, as, moreover, Commissioner Reding said recently, stating that: '? we must strongly oppose holding any general conceptual discussion on cultural diversity or cultural policies within the WTO ? The WTO is not the competent organisation to address this issue, nor has it been given a mandate to do so.'
We must therefore create a new binding international legal instrument, not just to further and promote cultural diversity but to establish trade rules for cultural goods and services too.
A number of Ministers for Culture have agreed to draft this instrument, in order to provide the States in the future with the necessary means to be able to identify, from a cultural point of view and according to their specific situations, the policies they need to ensure the preservation and promotion of cultural diversity.
Unesco is the body which is best suited for the task.
I therefore call for this process to be brought to an end as soon as possible.
Madam President, I see GATS, with its creation of a new international market organisation for services, not only as restructuring the global labour market, but as presaging a new global and social order, capable of having a profound effect on the political, social and cultural values and regulatory systems that have prevailed so far in most nation states, and of restricting to a substantial degree the extent to which they can act.
It is for that reason that I appeal to you, Commissioner Lamy, not to abandon the opt-out clause for public provision of services of general interest under any circumstances.
Unless, though, majority decisions are legitimised by democratic politics, the decision-making process in the countries - and there above all - is called into question by this discussion of fundamentals.
The main problem with GATS is that negotiations focus on the market conditions under which services are provided across borders, to the exclusion, though, of the social conditions under which services are provided.
If the result is the same as with the WTO on trading in goods hazardous to the environment, and if child and slave labour is not a reason to bar goods from entering the market, then I can see big problems heading towards us.
For as long as not even the International Labour Organisation's core labour standards are anchored in GATS, for as long as there is no fundamental clarification of the minimum conditions in labour and social security law under which migratory workers are to work on a temporary basis, I cannot imagine that a social consensus will be achieved in the EU in favour of opening up our market for services under module 4.
If it is achieved, it will be only in the teeth of the greatest resistance.
Democratic deficits are not a good basis on which to reshape markets.
Madam President, Mr van Velzen's statement deals judiciously with issues related to culture and cultural services, especially where they concern the flexibility of the positions to be taken by each Member State.
It is precisely because this set of problems leads to another - the problem of what is known as 'cultural exception', that it must be made clear that the Commission cannot allow itself to blunder into the issue of cultural exception.
This is an extremely controversial issue, primarily due to its own assumptions.
In an open world in which we are increasingly committed to the free interaction of cultures, cultural diversity must clearly be protected, preserved and valued, but not at the expense of hindering the free movement of values of exactly the same nature.
It is increasingly senseless, treating some cultural products as if they were industrial products, to establish forms of protection that limit their access to certain locations, such as cinemas.
With television, video, DVD and other new technologies of the digital, online and Internet age, any spectator, any consumer who wishes to do so, can choose to view whatever they wish without any real barriers being able to hinder this consumption.
I do not believe - or rather I must at least express my scepticism - that 50 Ministers for Culture can resolve this matter beyond the only point that will then be accepted, which is that every Member State can do whatever it feels is most appropriate to protect its interests and its own specific cultural diversity.
Having made these observations, Madam President, I shall simply add that items 7, 8 and 9 of the report to which I have referred address the problem in a very sensible way in terms of prudence and balance and they deserve our support.
Commissioners, I think that, as you stressed at the beginning, our concern could and should focus not on declarations of principle, but on a dynamic approach; we do not merely need to protect, we need to develop an aggressive plan, because a stagnant, defensive approach is often just denial of diversity by another name.

We should accept that there is an international balance of trade deficit in cultural and audiovisual products; they all flow from the other side of the Atlantic towards Europe, with very little movement in the other direction.
And there is another problem closer to home; few European products travel from one corner of Europe to the other.
Consequently, I think we should use the World Trade Organisation to look at the problem of the internal market which, aside from its economic dimension, is very important to European citizens and to their cultural pursuits within Europe.
Music, films and audiovisual products are not travelling from one corner of Europe to the other as much as they should.
Madam President, Commissioner Reding, Commissioner Lamy, ladies and gentlemen, world trade guarantees some 20% of jobs in Europe, which means that if we gain larger markets, we can sell more and create additional jobs.
If, in addition to that, we can purchase at advantageous prices, we become more competitive, and that is in line with the Commission's objective of making us world leaders within ten years.
It is my belief that, when talking about GATS and the WTO, we must, as a matter of priority, talk about the chances involved as well - about markets being opened up, prosperity increased, competitiveness and the possibility of increased wages.
If we put markets under a sort of bell jar, if we suffocate a market, the end result is bankruptcies and unemployment, and let me say that these days, of course, decisions to do this are taken mainly at national level.
Such decisions, of course, are party political in nature.
I travelled here today by rail from Wels in Austria; this took over seven hours in journey time alone and I was very late arriving here.
Last Monday, I sent a letter from Brussels to Austria, and it has still not arrived there.
When I travel back to Brussels, I remember that the sewage treatment plant there is still not working despite public provision of services of general interest, and that Brussels is currently pumping sewage, quite untreated, into the sea.
When I think of the universities, where the students have to sit on the floor, and where many of the professors' knowledge is not up to modern-day requirements, then I say that, yes, these are party political decisions that have to be taken by the voters in the various countries.
We should also, though, be thinking of the future; rather than seeing only the WTO's multilateral dimension, we should also be seeking out bilateral ways forward, especially with the USA, Russia and China.
I also believe that this is where a Parliamentary Assembly would be enormously effective in achieving greater transparency and justice in the future.
Madam President, Commissioner Reding, Commissioner Lamy, ladies and gentlemen, I believe this is the fourth time we have discussed this issue.
Does that mean we are stupid, deaf or stuck in a rut?
No, I think it is just that the time has come to admit that, quite simply, we do not want the same European project for our citizens.
Thus, GATS has served to highlight this difference in the way we see the world and has prompted a debate involving more participants than the limited circle of specialists and decision-makers usually consulted on matters of international trade.
We can say that we have learned from experience - and I believe that the dock workers outside can bear witness to that - how great the desire of some countries is to dominate in the market place where production is concerned.
We witness the fight to preserve public services daily.
No, we do not have confidence in the prospect you are presenting to us, and although your response to our concerns is to say, quite simply, that neither the audiovisual sector nor public services will be under any threat, we believe that the protests and reactions coming from the associations and trade unions expressing social concern are evidence that we are by no means the only ones to hold this view.
Is cultural exception really sufficient if we only exclude the audiovisual sector?
No, for we can identify sectors related to education and culture which could prove to be veritable Trojan horses and sabotage our efforts to preserve education and culture.
We support the international instrument, but how much progress has been made on it?
That would, perhaps, be a good indication of your intentions.
We must also admit that we do not have the same classification systems at all or the same definitions.
You are setting in motion a machine but you are unable to tell us what qualitative benefits it will bring.
Forgive us for wondering what use it will be to you in the future.
Commissioner Reding, Commissioner Lamy, I am of the opinion that the publication of both the European institutions' offer and their questions on market liberalisation via GATSwatch have made it clear that we in the European Parliament have good reason to be worried.
I would like to make two comments in this regard: firstly, Commissioner Lamy, you say that health, education, media and culture are not being liberalised.
That is correct, but there are other sectors that fall under services of general interest.
You do not rule out the liberalisation of energy and water, and the postal, port and pilotage sectors are already ready for liberalisation.
My group therefore wants clear guarantees that Member States can now regulate their services of general interest in their own way and that these services will not be subject to the GATS.
Naturally we do not need a WHO list for this; subsidiarity will apply as usual.
Secondly, Commissioner Lamy, I find it shocking that there is such an imbalance between the questions from the northern and southern Member States regarding market liberalisation.
In exchange for a limited number of questions, particularly concerning the mobility of labour from southern Member States, Europe wants to liberalise a number of sectors including some that we do not want to liberalise.
Commissioner Lamy, I am of the opinion that liberalising water is not the right way to achieve the millennium targets and to halve the number of people who have no access to water.
To do this we need relief funds and development cooperation.
Anyway, I am convinced that this has nothing to do with genuine concern for the southern Member States but everything to do with the interests of the water industry.
My group therefore requests that we do not adopt the liberalisation of sectors that we do not want to liberalise.
Madam President, we should take the position that we do not expect of developing countries what we are not prepared to do ourselves.
We should ensure that where we are protecting services or markets we do not oblige other countries which are less able to do battle in the open market to start up services that will simply sink or become private monopolies owned outside their own state.
It seems to me as well that there is an urgent need for this Parliament to be treated as a parliament and for the secrecy in relation to these negotiations to end.
If we are trying to create a multinational organisation at European level, which will have public support and legitimacy, then we cannot continue to proceed in ways which exclude the democratically elected representatives from important areas of policy.
Finally, the bottom line in terms of protectionism is that we have to protect the rights of citizens, whether they are inside or outside the European Union.
Madam President, free trade is basically a good thing.
It favours development and democracy, as well as growth leading to greater prosperity.
Nevertheless, trade issues always give rise to extensive debate, and there is good cause for having such a debate.
The market must not encroach upon the political sphere, and democracy must not be restricted.
The requirements of transparency and public scrutiny of documentation are fundamental.
No country must be forced into taking particular decisions.
Neither the market nor other interests must be able to force a country to implement changes that conflict with its national political ambitions.
The developing countries are particularly vulnerable.
They would like foreign investment, and dealers in international capital are aware of the fact.
The developing countries are therefore in danger of being subjected to pressure and of being forced to yield to unreasonable demands.
At the same time, we must be able to require that fundamental union rights be recognised and that the environment not be destroyed and human rights ignored.
Madam President, Commissioner, I get the impression that the EU's way of conducting negotiations is listing to one side.
It is one-sided in being guided by economic interests, which is actually out of the question.
The Treaties require us to make sustainable development the model for all our policies, which means that we cannot carry out liberalisation without at the same time negotiating social standards and environmental norms.
This leads me to form the impression in my mind that you are actually in violation of Article 6 of the Treaty.
It is especially when one is presenting demands for liberalisation of water to seventy-two of this planet's states that one is negating the very social and ecological conditions that prevail locally.
It is here that the principle of sustainable development must hold undoubted sway, rather than the economic considerations inherent in the ability to provide water if at all possible in the interests of shareholders.
Decisions as to how to organise the water supply have to be taken on a local basis; they must remain with local politicians and must not be taken in response to external pressure.
The EU must not stoke up the fight for the blue gold.
Madam President, I am going to respond to some of the speeches made in this debate, while my colleague, Mrs Reding, will deal with issues relating specifically to cultural diversity.
Briefly, I will turn to Mr van Velzen's question on universities. No commitments concerning this sector will be given on this occasion.
At the Uruguay Round ten years ago, we rashly gave a number of commitments on opening up private universities in certain Member States.
This time, we will stand firm.
I would now like to consider the issue of bilateral relations with the United States, which I discussed with my American counterparts in Washington on Monday and Tuesday of last week. There are, indeed, a number of problems concerning implementation of WTO decisions on settling differences.
The United States is not moving very quickly to implement these decisions.
I visited the country to speed things up and I made sure our point of view on this was very clear, particularly to Congress, so that it would move forward with the necessary legislation. At this stage, the problem lies with Congress, not with the Administration.
Congress has not said it will not proceed with the necessary legislation on this issue. Should it fail to do so however, the WTO has endowed us with the means to focus our minds, to use an English expression.
Mrs McNally, with regard to the part of these negotiations on access to trade in services that concerns public services within the European Union, I have made my position on the content very clear: nothing we offer in these negotiations will undermine the current status of public services within the European Union.
I would now like to turn to the other issue, as outlined by Mrs van Lancker. This is the question of whether we might just be asking too much of certain developing countries on the issue of opening up the services sector.
In the first place, I am aware that many developing countries need a competitive services sector. I know that while, in our part of the world, the services sector accounts for 60% of the economy, in most developing countries the services sector makes up between 40% and 50% of the economy.
This is a considerable percentage.
I am aware that developing countries themselves are calling for the liberalisation of the services sector, particularly in relation to the European Union. Lastly, I do not want us to fall headlong into the trap of what I would call 'euromorphism' over the issue of public services.
In Europe we have an extremely well-developed public services structure.
I am one of those who value it highly, although some may disagree with me.
I must state clearly that other countries throughout the world, especially some developing countries, do not have the same type of public services provision.
At present, these developing countries do not intend and frequently cannot afford to establish public services that, if I may say so, mirror our own. In this case, opening up the services market is the best way to improve the management of the economies of developing countries, make them more competitive and integrate them more effectively into world trade.
I will let my colleague, Mrs Reding, respond to Mrs Fraisse's comments. I would, however, like to remind Mrs Fraisse that the secret of a successful team, especially a sports team, is to have a strong defence and a strong attack.
In this regard, I think the distribution of roles is appropriate.
I would like to reply specifically to the question concerning sport raised by Mrs Fraisse. At this stage, there is no European Union offer relating in any way to sport or leisure, for the very simple reason that we have not received any requests to this effect.
In her contribution, Mrs Lucas focused on questions of transparency.
Let us be very clear on this issue. The whole House has heard an account of the principles on which the Commission's approach to these negotiations is based.
I have explained these principles on numerous occasions.
A number of Members (one Member for each group and the coordinators, in particular) have been able to study the details of my proposal by virtue of the institutional agreement between the institutions.
I can well understand that you may have doubts about how the details of my proposals compare with the broad lines put forward. I can well understand also that you may wish to challenge me on my intentions.
That is perfectly normal. Each and every one of you can ask your coordinator whether or not the details of my proposals correspond to what I previously announced.
To my knowledge, the coordinators have had this information at their disposal for almost three weeks. Nobody, however, has approached me to say that the detailed proposals do not correspond with what I had previously announced.
I am very much relieved as I am not in the habit of acting otherwise.
Mrs Lucas, there is, indeed, transparency on this subject. If I do not make all the offers completely public, it is because it is sometimes better to keep matters confidential, in the best interests of either consultation or negotiation.
Moreover, this is something the European Parliament itself understands well. For example, Parliament reserves the right to confidentiality in the case of conciliation procedure when negotiations would be at risk.
I believe it is right for Parliament to retain this option. As in all negotiations, there is a time for informing the public and a time for discretion.
As to the substance, I would refer to Mr Clegg's comments where the main points are concerned.
He is quite right in what he says. Unless and until the Convention grants the European Parliament real constitutional power in trade affairs, denied it by the earlier Intergovernmental Conference, where this type of procedure - which I endeavour to manage to the best of my ability - is concerned, you will indeed, in theory, be without any power in this area.
We have gone well beyond the current provisions on information and transparency of the EC Treaty.
If you want to move further ahead, as the Commission does, please support us. I trust that Members' interventions at the Convention will be as emphatic as those sometimes directed against the Commission.
Mr Abitbol and Mr Berthu, I would hope, when it comes down it, that people will not cry wolf too often. If we cry wolf when there is no wolf, we only end up frightening people.
There is no wolf here. Whatever your views on this issue and whatever you can establish about it, those of you who understand it and have access to the information know that there is no wolf.
There is no question of opening a Pandora's box of any kind.
It has not been opened and remains closed.
Mr DÃ©sir, I completely understand all your reservations. I share a number of them.
Once again, however, we should not act as if the Pandora's box of deregulation had been opened. It remains closed.
We are not considering the liberalisation of services. We are considering proceeding with opening up trade in services.
This has nothing to do with deregulation, liberalisation or privatisation.
We should not confuse two completely different debates. On the one hand, we have the debate amongst ourselves within the European Union on the extent of liberalisation of certain sectors that have hitherto been protected.
These include energy, transport and postal services. This debate concerns the way we organise our own society.
It involves a number of my colleagues within the Commission as well as Parliament and the Council. On the other hand, we have the debate on issues relating to external negotiations.
Please do not bring the dock workers into it. To the best of my knowledge, unless I am very much mistaken, the dock workers' presence relates to a draft directive on the internal market.
The dock workers sector is not on the list. They are concerned about the internal market.
If we open up transport services, or ask others to do so, then our control over those services, and over those we are asking to open up their markets, will not be affected in any way by negotiations of this kind. Allow me to repeat: in no way will it be affected.
We will retain our sovereign right to regulate these sectors as we see fit. This matter therefore has nothing to do with the draft directive at issue.
I would like to comment briefly on what Mr Herzog had to say. Overall, I agree with him.
The real debate, underlying the present one, the anxiety, fears and reservations concern what is happening within the European Union, or what will happen in the coming years. I understand all the feelings expressed.
I therefore agree with Mr Herzog that, in this debate, in the Commission's work and in future debates with the Council and Parliament, we should focus on the organisation of public services, of the universal service, of services of general interest within the European Union.
If we had more direction and if the agreement between us on what exactly constitutes services of public interest were more clearly defined, then some of the fears expressed in this debate would be dispelled, and rightly so.
I would now like to turn to the questions concerning the water sector. I recognise these are sensitive issues.
I appreciate that Mr Turmes, Mrs Figueiredo and Mr Karlsson wish to point out to me that, thus far, GATS has failed to produce noteworthy results as far as water is concerned.
I would simply respond by saying that water is outside the remit of GATS.
Thus far, no country has given even a minimal commitment concerning the water distribution sector under the General Agreement on Trade in Services.
Not a single one!
No such commitment has been given by any country.
What has happened, or what is happening in a number of countries stems from sovereign decisions that countries have taken on liberalisation or on privatisation. This has nothing to do with international negotiations on services.
If many countries, particularly developing ones, have proceeded with cases of independent liberalisation or privatisation, it is for the most part because they needed foreign direct investment. In my opinion, GATS and other similar negotiations allow such countries to attract investment without surrendering their right to regulate.
There have been occasions when they have been forced to do so as the result of a reckless approach. In a sense, therefore, this amounts to a form of protection.
I would remind the House once again that our proposals for this area relate only to distribution. They do not relate to access to water, as Mr Turmes recognised.
Lastly, before I give Mrs Reding the floor, I would like to respond to those Members who have urged me to be more proactive, namely Mr De Clercq, Mr Harbour, Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel and Mr RÃŒbig.
I am not surprised by their statements.
I do wish to take a harder line on this matter but I believe I should take account of the misgivings expressed in different quarters. In general, these concerns stem from confusing international negotiations on trade in services, on the one hand, with the attitudes and negotiations within the European Union on the control, regulation and deregulation of services, on the other hand.
In my opinion, these two debates are quite different. Given that these misgivings and concerns do exist, however, we must respond to them patiently and as clearly as possible.
The Commission is ready to do just this.
Madam President, my colleague, Mr Lamy, has explained very clearly that, as far as culture is concerned, the Pandora's box is closed and no one has any intention of opening it.
There are a number of reasons for this. Firstly, we want to maintain our ability to protect cultural creativity on a regional, national and international level.
To this end, we need to have the freedom to support all kinds of cultural products, if that is what we want to call them.
Secondly, cultural products are not the same as commercial products.
Culture has another dimension. It is linked to our roots and our diversity.
As Mrs De Sarnez rightly said, and as I have clearly stated, neither GATS nor the WTO is an appropriate forum in which to debate culture.
I therefore agree with all those in this House who have stated that we need an international body like Unesco.
Madam President, we need to be aware that, at present, there is no international legal reference standard for culture. I agree with all the Members who stated that one is called for.
We need one to pre-empt this never-ending series of debates on culture.
Even if Mr Lamy and I do not open the Pandora's box on this issue, there is a deep-rooted fear in the Member States and amongst the people of Europe that this could nonetheless happen one day.
We therefore need an international legal reference standard in the interests of cultural diversity and cultural exchange.
It is an idea we should work on. It follows logically from the Unesco declaration and we are studying it with interest.
My own feeling is that the viability of an international instrument would depend, in particular, on its capacity to develop reference standards on cultural diversity at an international level. Initially, it should foster reflection on indicators of cultural diversity
That said, preserving our ability to support cultural diversity entails, in the first place, action within the European Union.
Nevertheless, many Members of this House who have indicated that we need to go further are right. We do have an international responsibility which goes beyond the Europe of Fifteen or Twenty-five.
The Treaty now provides for this.
Article 151(4) allows international action where culture is concerned and we regularly engage in this.
I can assure you that a film director from a third country could not show his or her film in Europe without an invitation to a European cinema festival.
We are most certainly opening up to others.
I would like to tell Mr van Velzen that our Erasmus World project is only possible because the Treaty allows us to go beyond the borders of the European Union.
Ladies and gentlemen, this must certainly be preserved in the European Convention and in the next Treaty. In the forthcoming Treaty, we must be allowed to retain our ability to protect cultural diversity of all kinds within the Union.
We must also be able to retain our ability to act beyond the borders of the Union at international level.
This could involve the creation of a Unesco type of international agreement to protect culture, or projects like Erasmus World. It could also involve helping creative people from third countries express themselves in the forums made available to them.
You will appreciate that culture necessarily entails opening up.
Clearly, this opening up is not merely for the benefit of Europeans; it also involves welcoming creative artists and others from third countries.
I would thank the Commission for these contributions.
In connection with this debate, I have accepted six motions for resolutions tabled in accordance with Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure
Despite all these fine words, the European Parliament remains under-informed and, above all, under-consulted.
We are unable to exercise parliamentary control.
What value do meetings involving confidential documents held behind closed doors have?
How can we accept this lack of democratic debate where neither national parliaments nor the European Parliament are involved?
The Commission is relying on a general mandate pre-dating Seattle that has been rendered null and void. It therefore has no legitimate right to impose its decisions.
Through aggressive demands directed at third countries, concerning the water sector, in particular, the Commission is undermining any genuine efforts to address the needs of the people of the countries involved.
Other values must be promoted over the profits of multinationals, trade for its own sake and the rationale of privatisation: particularly the need for strong public services, which are essential to social cohesion and equality.
We must ask ourselves why it is so difficult to assess the consequences of liberalisation.
Modernity lies in the ability of governments to guarantee fundamental rights and not in a determination to satisfy the financial markets.
I join with more than 150 other French elected representatives in demanding transparency and the suspension of the negotiations in order to prevent an irreversible GATS.
The next item is a recommendation for second reading (A5-0050/2003) by Mr Jarzembowski, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council directive on market access to port services [11146/1/2002 - C5-0533/2002 - 2001/0047(COD)].
Madam President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, despite the stones that have been flung at this Parliament this afternoon, let us, dispassionately and calmly, debate an issue that we have had to deal with for months, indeed years - the issue of the European regulation of sea ports.
The Council at last handed down its common position on 5 November, so that we are now through to the second round.
There is one thing that I believe should be apparent even to those who were throwing stones this afternoon, and that is that seaports need to be regulated in the same way across the EU, as seaports, being nodes of intermodal transport, have a central part to play in European transport policy as a whole.
There is a need for improvement in Europe's ports, and that needs to be accomplished, on the one hand, by clear rules on competition among ports and within each port, and, secondly, by means of transparent market access for harbour services.
The Council has stated its position, and now, on the basis of the first position, we again have to give our opinion.
There are four things I want to say about the 34 amendments that the committee has submitted.
First, the committee takes the view that we need unambiguous provisions to establish fair conditions for competition between ports.
Even though the Council and the Commission have made statements in the Council Minutes to the effect that they too can see the need for fair framework conditions for competition, such declarations of intent are not satisfactory, as, even if the Commission were to extend the transparency directive to ports, it would not achieve what we want, which is, firstly, that enterprises operating out of ports and the harbour companies should actually themselves provide the Member States and the Commission with details of the financial links that exist between them and the state, the region, and the cities; secondly, that the Commission should act on this information; thirdly, that it should then actually prohibit measures that distort competition; and finally, that it should put before us a transparency report that would enable us to see where we need to do more work.
Madam President, the regulation on state aid that the Commission submitted at the last minute is not adequate, either.
There has to be legal certainty for the ports and for the port companies.
We have to know which financial arrangements regarding port infrastructure do not constitute subsidies and do not require modification, and which actually are subsidies and need to be approved.
It follows that we need clear and binding guidelines.
Secondly, we are agreed - in the committee at any rate - that pilot services are to be taken out of the scope of the directive.
The Council's approach is to keep pilot services within the directive's scope, but then to state that all are free to do as they please.
In contrast to that, we favour clear and open regulations.
We want pilot services in the Member States to be regulated in the public interest and in accordance with the safety requirements in force in that Member State, whether these pilot services be private or provided by the state.
That is something that the Member States should regulate for themselves.
The demonstration, and a number of strikes in European ports, were about self-handling, and this is where I am, quite seriously, astonished.
After all, we all spent last week in discussions with trade unionists.
It was Parliament that, at first reading stage, restricted self-handling to a port's own staff and equipment.
The committee's report introduces a further restriction - to a ship's own crew.
The unions are striking, and I have no idea why.
If they are generally opposed to European regulation of ports, then let them say so.
They have not said that up to now.
I take the view that there is fierce competition among ports, and that there must be openness and a fair balance between the interests of the shipping companies and the port companies.
An individual port belongs neither to the people who work in it nor to some state-operated harbour monopoly, nor indeed to the shipping companies.
A balance must be found between fair competition and entrepreneurial freedom, and so I can only say that our proposal on self-handling is the right one.
Nor can I understand why some are now saying that we have to make all port services subject to a conditional agreement.
The Commission has stated that the Member States can require that they be submitted for approval.
At first reading stage, Parliament took exactly the same view, as did the Council in its Common Position.
There is absolutely no reason - and, Madam President, I do not consider it permissible - to vote, tomorrow, on amendments imposing, in Article 6 (1), mandatory approval on all Member States at once.
The Belgians can do things the way they want to, but it makes no sense to impose a course of action on the Finns, and so, tomorrow, we should have no misunderstandings in this House, and there should be no reference to election campaigns, wherever they are being fought.
We of course want the compensatory payments to be arranged on a mandatory basis, with unambiguous criteria, and so we have no great problems in that regard.
I know, Madam Vice-President, that we two have an excellent relationship, but on this point we are, unfortunately, at odds with each other, and I would again ask you to give the question further consideration.
What this Parliament demands is a regulation that holds in a balance the interests of the shipping companies, of the port entrepreneurs, and of the workers both on the ships and on land.
The proposal we are putting forward is an excellent one, one that all these parties should consider very carefully, and, in the conciliation procedure, they should also support the provisions on transparency.
We both - as, I hope, does the Council - want seaports to be efficient and to perform well, and to be places where workers and entrepreneurs can coexist amicably.
Madam President, firstly, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Parliament for the work it has done to date with regard to this extremely important directive and I would like in particular to thank the rapporteur, Mr Jarzembowski, for the work he has done in relation to this issue, which is extremely important in terms of providing the European Union with a competitive transport system.
We often complain that Europe could use sea transport as an alternative to road transport and land transport in general.
However, we are now sometimes being faced with a situation in which those same people who say that we must promote maritime transport create more difficulties when it comes to creating a sea transport system which is more competitive and more suited to the new circumstances.
We clearly need to improve the efficiency of port services, and that is what this initiative intends to do.
We need to improve the efficiency of these services, put an end to situations of monopoly, which sometimes mean that the same services cost three or four times more in one European Union port than in another, indicating that something is not working, and - I insist - we must guarantee, by excluding or imposing restrictions and guarantees, so that marine safety aspects are maintained at the highest possible levels.
We in the Commission believe that the Council's Common Position to a large extent takes account of the amendments approved by this Parliament at first reading which represent a balanced solution for achieving these objectives and I believe it would be a real mistake not to maintain this balance and to change the broad balance established within the Council.
In this regard, ladies and gentlemen, I will explain to you the Commission's position on the proposed amendments.
Some of them clearly improve the Council's Common Position and the Commission therefore accepts them in their entirety, in principle or in part.
In other words, the Commission is once again making an effort to ensure that the codecision system works as well as possible.
In this field, I would firstly like to refer to the amendments which highlight the provisions of the Commission's directive on transparency with regard to the ports to which the directive we are dealing with apply.
This achieves the objective we have all shared from the outset and in this regard I regret the fact that the rapporteur, Mr Jarzembowski, believes that what is proposed here is insufficient.
In any event, I will refer later, in particular, to some of the amendments which deal with these aspects.
Secondly, we can accept Amendment No 11 - which relates to a lesser frequency for the review of the list of ports of a high seasonal character - and Amendments Nos 5 and 27 - which provide examples of expensive moveable assets which could be considered equivalent to immovable assets when considering repayments or residual costs.
Furthermore, we can support all those amendments which, without going into detail, we believe make appropriate contributions to the common position or those which provide additional clarification, in one way or another, of the final text.
I would once again like to congratulate both Mr Jarzembowski and the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism in general for the work they have done.
Certain amendments, however, appear to attempt to slow down, and even to paralyse, the efforts made to promote this stimulation of European ports, aimed at improving, as I said earlier, the potential of long-distance maritime transport, aiding our exports to other parts of the world, but also short-distance maritime transport, providing an alternative to land transport.
We therefore clearly cannot support Amendments Nos 36 and 66 which call for the Council's Common Position to be rejected.
Having said this, I would like to make a few brief comments on other issues which Mr Jarzembowski has mentioned.
Firstly, the question of competition between ports.
I know this is an issue of great concern to the rapporteur and other Members and furthermore I believe that progress must be made on it.
That is why I intend to accept those amendments which propose the inclusion of ports in the Commission's Directive on transparency.
The Commission understands the current concern here.
In fact, our recent document on this issue demonstrates our will to resolve the problem while respecting, however, the provisions of the Treaty, Mr Jarzembowski.
That is to say, State subsidies have a framework, which is the one we have proposed, but they cannot just simply be regulated, since the Treaty itself lays down the regulatory framework.
We must clarify this in order, as I said, to prevent legal doubts or uncertainties.
And therefore, Mr Jarzembowski, I must say that Amendment No 15 goes further than such provisions and we cannot accept it.
We are, however, prepared to try to seek, together with this Parliament, an approach which is acceptable to everybody.
In this regard, Amendment No 10, duly modified, with certain important alterations in accordance with the solution we may find, could help us to find that compromise formula.
I would ask you that we may work as hard as possible to find it as soon as possible.
With regard to Amendment No 16, I must remind you that the Commission, within the context of the so-called 'range of port measures', has already carried out a study such as the one requested and unfortunately there was little cooperation on the part of the ports.
Secondly: Mr Jarzembowski has talked about the practice of self-handling.
This practice should be allowed in all modern ports where possible, with regard to both operations on board and those on land.
The Common Position reflects this desire to send a message of progress and looking forward rather than rigidity.
A message of progress but with every guarantee.
In this regard, it is made clear that this type of action must comply with the social, environmental and safety standards required in each port and that this demand is essential in order to be able to carry out this self-handling.
Those amendments which seriously restrict this approach - since, in various ways, they hinder self-handling operations - restricting them exclusively to seafaring people, cannot be accepted.
Amongst other things - we are talking about ships from third countries and from European Union countries - because these crews are not subject to the same requirements as the professionals who work in our ports and what we are proposing in the Council's Common Position is that, in order to carry out these actions, they must be carried out within the framework of social and safety standards in accordance with the rules of each port.
Because the additional limitation relating to ships flying the Union flag will bring the Union into confrontation with its partners in the world and that must also be avoided.
Finally - briefly - we have always believed that pilotage is a commercial service.
Therefore, access to such a service should be regulated by the Treaty and by this directive.
For this reason, we support the consensus reached on the common position that authorisations should be conditional upon compliance with certain particularly strict criteria with regard to public service and maritime safety obligations - and again we return to the reality of each port.
But this approach can be adapted by means of specific solutions for each port, which allow self-handling, within the field of pilotage, in the form of exemption certificates, under certain conditions.
In conclusion, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow's vote will have great repercussions on the legislative process.
The Commission has always shown itself prepared to seek constructive solutions with the European Parliament.
I would like to remind you once again that our general objective is to guarantee that the port services industry, which is expanding greatly, is ready to confront the challenges facing us.
Furthermore, the future European transport system will only succeed with efficient and forward-looking ports.
I would therefore like once again to ask you to support this Commission proposal and I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Jarzembowski, and the whole team which has worked on this text, and all the Members of Parliament for your attention.
Mr President, Commissioner, we have reached our second reading, a milestone on the long, hard road towards liberalising port services, and I think that we should all start by thanking and congratulating our rapporteur, Mr Jarzembowski, on a job well done.
Having said which, I realise that as soon as I sit down, a number of my honourable friends will no doubt stand up to oppose liberalisation or at least make comments intended to severely restrict the liberalisation of port services.
What I have to say to all these honourable Members, whose opinion I do of course respect, is that I fail to understand how we can be in favour of liberalising the railways, in favour of liberalising air transport, in favour of liberalising telecommunications, and against liberalising port services.
We cannot have one sauce for the goose and one for the gander.
I, for one, find it incomprehensible.
Secondly, I should like to say to everyone - and to the port workers protesting today - that, in my personal opinion, they stand to benefit from the liberalisation of port services in the medium to long term, because it will create new jobs.
We have nothing against these people.
On the contrary, we recognise that their work helps foster economic growth; but they should not hamper further liberalisation and, by extension, further growth in the European economy.
The European Parliament, at least the majority in committee, has so far stood by a number of firm principles, one of these firm principles being our espousal of the liberalisation of services, not as an end in itself, but as a means to economic growth.
And because we stand by this principle, Commissioner, we adopted an amendment, which the rapporteur referred to and which is designed to prevent discriminatory treatment by port authorities, so that the ports of the European Union can compete with each other.
In doing so, we did of course listen very carefully to what the industry and interested parties had to say. That is why we stand by our position on pilotage, where idiosyncrasies, different approaches and safety factors have to be taken into account.
It is why we take a different view from the Council, a more amicable view if you like, of workers' demands and the question of self-handlers.
Our focus is on proper staff training, which is why I think that port workers' current demands on the question of self-handling are somewhat exaggerated.
This being our position, and in the light of the position taken by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism when it voted for the report, I think this is the right approach if we and the Council are to push through legislation which is acceptable to all sides as quickly as possible.
Mr President, Commissioner, I think it right that, in what you had to say, you quite unequivocally faced the issue head-on, but you should be aware that the committee's amendments, about which you made critical comments, are the result of large majorities in the committee, for which I want to express my gratitude to Mr Jarzembowski.
We passed them with a great deal of unanimity, and I think we will get an absolute majority of 314 votes on the decisive points when we vote tomorrow.
Discussing the part package today and voting on it tomorrow, we know that many European port cities - and I emphasise cities - have seen their workers, out of fear for their jobs, out of fear of social dumping, taking to the streets and demonstrating, and I say, for myself and on behalf of my group, that we sympathise with port workers as they draw attention to their concerns and needs.
They have every right to do so, but not, as I see it, to throw stones and get into scuffles with the police.
I take the demonstrations in the port cities to be in support of the work we are doing, as the Common Position does indeed include a number of odious points that we cannot accept; it is those things in the Common Position that we want to change today and tomorrow.
The most odious point is the formulation on self-handling, which is also to include what is done on land.
Let me say quite clearly that this is, in our view, unacceptable.
We take the view that self-handling can mean only those things that can be done by a ship and its company on their own.
Anything more than that is not on, as is clear from the term 'self-handling' itself; anything else would be handling by others.
Let me say, for the benefit of the Commission and the Council, that we Social Democrats do not believe this definition of self-handling to be capable of being negotiated in a conciliation procedure.
There is no moving beyond that, either here or in the conciliation procedure.
I want to point out that the directive contains an array of provisions that touch - to the workers' benefit - on social protection, social security matters, and their qualifications for the jobs they do.
I think the committee has done very good work on these things, and the Social Democrats have tabled amendments to make overall improvements.
You can vote in favour of all these amendments tomorrow, and then everything will be that little bit better for the workers.
Finally, I turn to the issue of pilot services, an area in which the Commission was very keen - and the Council rather less keen - to see competition introduced.
We believe this to be wrong.
As carriers, ships are subject to so many constraints, and face so much competition, that safety often gets left behind.
As we have seen from what happened to the Prestige and the Erika, pilots have to answer for the safety of ships.
They therefore have nothing to do with this directive.
In general - as Mr Jarzembowski has mentioned - we have now devoted a great deal of attention to competition in ports.
My main problem continues to be with competition between one port and another, and that is where the Commission has not done enough.
We hope the Commission will now present us with something good in this area, so that we can really get to grips with the problem of inter-port competition.
Thank you, Mr President.
Commissioner, access to port services must be as open as possible, and a port must be able to operate as well as possible.
This directive is one contribution, but we also need guidelines for government aid and a directive on transparent financial relationships between the port sector and the government.
We are also rightly making rules that create a framework for the free circulation of services and we are rightly including specific aspects of ports.
The trade unions are also right to point out to us the risks of ports of convenience, ports where all the social rules go overboard, just as there are flags of convenience, cheap flags, for ships.
That is why we must impose requirements - social requirements too - on anyone wanting to offer services in a port.
That is also why we propose introducing compulsory licensing for the provision of services in ports.
That will enable aspects such as safety and the environment to be taken into account, as well as social rules and employment.
The Prestige accident, an accident that once more focused our attention on the training and quality of ships' crews, which we are also talking about here, had fortunately not yet happened at the time of the first reading.
Since then we have also had a proposal from the International Maritime Organisation about safety on ships and in ports - in fact you are currently working on legislation on that.
We must therefore know who is working in our ports and under what conditions.
With a good licensing policy the competent authorities should be able to ensure that a port is not a place where you take risks with safety or with the environment, that a port is certainly not a place where you allow social dumping, but that a port is in fact a vital link in an efficient and sustainable European transport policy.
That is something we urgently need.
Mr President, we have already debated this directive on opening up all port services to competition at the first reading. Everyone has commented on it.
The Council subsequently made its position known.
We are faced with a liberal directive which, as usual, seeks solely to reduce costs, to the detriment of all other factors. Even though the rapporteur, Mr Jarzembowski, has met with a large number of people and has included a number of proposed improvements, the situation, the fundamental problem remains.
There has been no genuine consultation with unions or others involved, despite the fact that these people are familiar with the safety and environmental requirements and have invaluable know-how.
Furthermore, the fact that we are continuing to legislate against those employed in this sector was demonstrated this afternoon through the formidable dock workers' demonstration.
In this respect, I support the protest made by Mr Wurtz, the chairman of my group, to the effect that the attitude of the police towards the demonstrators was unacceptable.
As he said, their protest is legitimate. Considering that their trade and their jobs are being destroyed, we cannot expect them to come to the European institutions bearing flowers.
In addition, no prior assessment has been made of the effects of this liberalisation, especially as regards important issues such as employment, safety and the environment.
According to my fellow Member, Mr Hatzidakis, liberalisation is not an aim in itself, but a means of economic development.
Well, I am waiting for an evaluation!
I want to know the impact of this on other sectors.
We have been waiting for a while now.
Regardless of the amendments incorporated, the text remains liberal.
Whether we like it or not, self-handling at ports will be tantamount to permitting social dumping, despite the various safeguard clauses included. These refer to safety, to the qualifications required of staff and even to the nature of the seagoing personnel.
This directive makes it possible to employ workers from outside the port to do the work of the qualified workers currently employed.
The concept of self-handling will result in insecurity, worse working and employment conditions and worse environmental safety standards.
This is a particularly retrograde step in light of the current practices of commercial fleets, which have shown that the consequences may be very serious for the European Union.
Employees like dock workers fulfil a very important economic role in difficult conditions while maintaining safety standards.
Services such as pilotage and mooring services are not covered by this directive, even though they are universally recognised as being services of general interest.
I think all these sectors should be considered as partners in the pursuit of sustainable development.
Lastly, following the damage caused by the Prestige, I met with professionals from the maritime sector in France to discuss safety issues. They all insisted that maritime safety begins at ports.
I therefore feel that the measures taken here after the sinking of the Prestige and the decision taken today to impose self-handling are totally contradictory.
These, then, are the reasons why my group will continue to advocate rejection of the common position.

Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, opening up markets, liberalisation, port services - these are the central themes, but today we have naturally been talking about specific elements of these, two to be precise: the authorisation and licensing of these services and this new service provision, and self-handling.
In both cases the position of workers may be affected.
I would therefore like to say to the Commissioner that from my point of view I am in favour of more maritime transport, to replace other forms of transport, for example, but I am not in favour of affecting social rights.
I would therefore like to express my concern about what is going on here, not only as shadow rapporteur for this subject in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, but also as chairman of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
When we see what the employers' associations - and others, incidentally - are currently putting forward, which is something I would also like to find out more about from the Commissioner, namely that there is a conflict between ILO - the international labour organisation - conventions 137, which concerns port activities, and 152, which concerns the working conditions for such port activities - and the EU directive in its present form, then I wonder whether we have not jumped the gun.
There seems to be a major problem, and I would like to know if there really is, as we have not yet come to the end of the road.
After the vote tomorrow we will go to arbitration, then we will have another vote and then the European Court awaits, I can assure you of that.
Secondly, one of the reasons why the people who are protesting at the moment are angry is the fact that a number of amendments we are trying to introduce, relating amongst other things to authorisation, licences and Article 13 on self-handling, have been declared inadmissible.
Things are changing in the world, people are coming up with new arguments, and I hope that the President will also allow us to do something about this tomorrow.
For the rest, I agree with Mr Jarzembowski and others that this port directive on competition in ports is completely inadmissible if we do not have a simultaneous arrangement, a regulation, about competition between ports.
We are still waiting for this.
Please can we link these two matters.
Mr President, Commissioner, when, a while ago in this House we considered the Green Paper on ports and maritime infra-structures, Parliament clearly identified the area in which we feel the Commission should be working.
Firstly, the list covering the funding and the system of tariffs for ports, clear rules on state aid to ports and, finally, the adoption of measures guaranteeing access to the port services market through legislative instruments established at the Commission's initiative and within its powers.
The Commission, however, decided, contrary to what was requested of it, to propose a directive on port services and to omit what Parliament had charged it to provide, which were clear rules on state aid.
This is perhaps one of the reasons why the directive, despite the changes it has already undergone, has been contested so intensely at various levels, including here in Parliament, where a considerable number of amendments have been tabled at second reading.
In fact, the directive has not produced any measures that will benefit the operability and effectiveness of national ports where Portugal is concerned, and instead generates unnecessary bureaucracy and constitutes a potentially destabilising threat to the social harmony that has marked relations between the social partners in all Portuguese ports.
We must not forget the fact that, especially in Portugal, some companies have recently taken on obligations arising from legislative requirements, such as having to absorb all workers employed in any capacity in ports and whose interests must now be safeguarded.
We cannot, therefore, accept the fact that this directive will allow any port user, who may or may not be accredited, to engage in cargo-handling activity, in contravention of national legislation on labour or on the operation of ports, which is binding on all port operators, under conditions other than those laid down, specifically for the use of operators' own equipment and workers, and possibly on docks for which a public service concession has been granted.
As I stated, the obligation on current port operators to absorb the labour force contracted to ports on salaries around three times higher than the average in sectors with identical operational requirements means that the directive will not be able to allow a port user to engage in cargo-handling activity without having to be accredited, thereby using workers in more favourable conditions than those binding current port operators under the law and under collective bargaining agreements.
In this regard, we clearly maintain that self-handling must be confined to the work of a ship's own crew, as the term 'self-handling' itself suggests, and used as a complement to and in conjunction with the port operator.
Self-handling is the most controversial aspect of the directive and the aspect that will have the most implications for economic agents, especially in my country, especially for Portuguese economic agents, in the event that the wording that has just been approved does not safeguard the principles identified previously.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, although this draft directive has been considerably amended, I do not think it is any more appropriate now than it was at first reading.
As I see it, the reasons for excluding pilotage services from the scope of the directive apply to all technical nautical services. Quality of service and the safety of operations are part and parcel of all these services.
This directive has a single aim.
It seeks to establish fair competition, which seems to amount to opening up markets judged to be sufficiently profitable to competition. Although the efficiency and reliability of public services is recognised, this is outweighed by the interest, or rather the interests generated from the process.
Self-handling provides an example of this liberal vision. Although it now has a better-defined framework, for the most part it ignores the high safety standards currently in place.
Is it actually realistic to imagine that the two roles currently fulfilled by qualified professionals might, in future, be undertaken by non-specialist workers in a completely fragmented way?
The dock workers made their discontent clear through their demonstrations in Brussels on Friday and this afternoon in Strasbourg. The demonstrations show how they despair of the European institutions that are out of touch with reality and the concerns of the people of Europe.
They can see that the authorities are sticking obstinately to their dogmatic positions. This is all the more unacceptable when safety is at stake.
I am not going to reiterate the points made by some of my fellow Members during the discussions on the previous document. They pointed out the negative repercussions of previous cases of liberalisation, which proved unpopular as they were ill-prepared and imposed.
Further to the Erika and Prestige accidents, it is not possible to claim ignorance or maintain that such incidents were highly unlikely.
If accidents happen, the European Union and its institutions must act in accordance with their accountability to the citizens of Europe.
Mr President, it goes without saying that I am emphatically opposed to the directive in front of us, and particularly the file on self-handling.
I wish to emphatically express my complete solidarity with the workers who have come to Strasbourg to demonstrate today.
After all, from practical experience in my own country, Flanders, we know that the pool system with recognised dock workers ensures that we have qualified and motivated people working in our ports who can be regarded as some of the most highly skilled workers in the world.
It is their dedication and their professional knowledge that make our ports fast, competitive and in particular safe handling organisations.
I would like to know why something that is in fact perfect has to be changed or dismantled.
Dismantling this pool system and the dock workers' monopoly will not only result in the umpteenth social graveyard, but it will also undermine the safety of our ports, unsettle the social peace that we have, cripple the strength of our ports and even reinforce anti-European sentiment.
After all, the man in the street should realise that strong European files or files with a strong European dimension that have to be deblocked in order to secure our prosperity will in fact get us nowhere.
Take the IJzeren Rijn rail link, for example; there has been no progress there, but Europe appears to regard measures that we know will only result in social breakdown and more unemployment as a priority.
Europe is giving the impression that it gives greater priority to the interests of certain shipping lines - shipping lines that in many cases are practising a form of modern-day slavery - than to the survival of their own best port workers.
Only a clear 'no' or 'never' will do in the face of so much blind European arrogance.
Today we must make it all the more clear to the Flemish port workers: working for your own people first is a guarantee of safety and quality.
Mr President, it is not for a procedural motion, it is for a personal fact.
What we have just experienced from Mr Vanhecke is a personal affront, not only a personal affront to me but an affront to all Flemish Members of Parliament who have worked for months in tandem with the port managers and trade unions to make this directive into something good.
Then Mr Vanhecke comes along here and bangs his drum.
He has not taken a single initiative himself; in the first reading he even abstained on the matter of self-handling, and he now comes along and tries to score points.
This is unacceptable; it is unacceptable to all the members who have worked so hard: Mrs Smet, Mr Sterckx, Mrs Maes, Mrs Van Brempt, Mr Dhaene and myself.
I oppose it.
Mr President, free access to port services is very important for guaranteeing honest competition in ports.
Competition between ports is also important, so the Commission must ensure greater transparency in government investments that benefit the ports.
The present directive got off to a messy start, but we now finally have a good document on the table.
I would like to say something about two matters.
Firstly, self-handling.
Today and last week, there were dock workers demonstrating outside the Parliament buildings.
They have every right to do so, but if ever there was a directive that took account of all the rights and interests of the dock workers, then it is this directive.
Their position and social standing is extremely well protected by various articles in the directive, right up to their training and professional qualifications.
Even if the port employers wanted to, it will not be possible to work with poorly trained, unqualified workers who could be a threat to the safety of the ports.
What we do want to set straight, however - and everyone is always talking about workers' rights, Mr Bouwman - is that employers have rights too, even if nobody ever stands up for them.
The employer's right to know whom he will be working with is, I think, the employer's right.
I therefore do not support Amendment No 13 in which self-handling is again toned down - in a definition, would you believe.
In order to guarantee that every Member State has regulations in which everything is guaranteed, I have tabled Amendment No 28, as we had promised in consultation with the FNV.
The second point of interest is pilotage services. I wholeheartedly endorse the Council's viewpoint on this matter.
In the formulation of the Council, Member States may liberalise their pilotage services if they want to, but they must do so under the directive.
In other words, with all the protection and professional qualifications that this entails.
I am not in favour of removing pilots from the directive.
Anyway, what else is this directive about?
The common position forms a balanced text which we should not tinker with too much.
Important points such as the provisions on transparency, the duration of licences, new ports and arrangements concerning the compensation that service providers have to pay when buying themselves out of a contract period, are in my opinion plain and clear.
The compensation arrangement can, in my opinion, best be arranged between the market parties concerned without outside interference.
The text of the common position does far more justice to the great diversity of situations and regulations on this point than the amendments tabled.
Commissioner, I must reiterate the position of the French socialists on this document. Consideration of this report began in confusion during the first reading.
We are opposed to it for three main reasons.
Firstly, we believe that, if we want to purse the aim of sustainable mobility as part of our policy on ports as proposed in the White Paper, the problem of competition in ports is certainly not the most appropriate or timely way of approaching the issue.
