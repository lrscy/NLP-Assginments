Unless we take a strong stand now, the NPT is in danger of becoming meaningless â full of good intentions, but resulting in little political action.
The European Union has a duty to take a leading role in this and to ensure that real action is taken.
Nuclear weapons make the world more insecure and dangerous.
The International Court of Justice ruled in 1996 that their use, or even their threatened use, was unlawful, which makes the strengthening of the NPT all the more urgent.
We are talking here about real, existing weapons of mass destruction and destroying them in the most effective way by enforcing international agreements.
We are asking the presidency, the Council and the Commission what exactly is being done in preparation for the PrepCom in New York.
What progress has been made, for example, on the 13 practical steps and on nuclear-free zones?
My country, Wales, declared itself nuclear-free in 1982.
What is being done to support the pioneering work of the mayors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in mobilising cities throughout the world to work for the total abolition of nuclear weapons?
This must be the goal of all of us.
Â Â  . Mr President, it gives me great pleasure, on behalf of the presidency, to respond to the question that has been asked.
The European Union is committed to the multilateral treaty system, which provides the legal and normative basis for all non-proliferation efforts.
On 12 December 2003 the European Council adopted an EU strategy against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
The strategy incorporates and bases itself on the texts adopted by the European Council at Thessaloniki in June 2003.
The WMD strategy underlines the EUâs particular commitment to the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons â NPT.
The EU believes that all our efforts should be aimed at preserving and strengthening this fundamental instrument of international peace and security.
The EU supports wholeheartedly the objectives laid down in the Treaty and is committed to the effective implementation of the final document of the 2000 NPT review conference and the decisions and resolution adopted at the 1995 Review and Extension Conference.
The EU has repeatedly stated that the Non-Proliferation Treaty is the cornerstone of the global non-proliferation regime and the essential foundation for the pursuit of nuclear disarmament under Article VI of the Treaty.
The EU statement to last yearâs second preparatory committee for the 2005 Review Conference of the NPT, recalled that Member States continue to attach great importance to achieving the universality of, and universal compliance with, the NPT.
In this regard we welcome the accession to the Treaty by Cuba, in 2002, and by Timor Leste in 2003, which brings it closer to universality.
However, there are three countries â India, Israel and Pakistan â that remain outside the regime and we continue to call upon them to accede unconditionally to the NPT as non-nuclear weapon states.
On 17 November 2003 the Council adopted a common position on the universalisation and reinforcement of multilateral agreements in the field of non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery.
Article 4 of the common position confirms that achieving universal adherence to the NPT is of crucial importance.
To this end, the European Union will firstly call on those States not yet parties to the NPT to accede unconditionally to the NPT as non-nuclear-weapon states and to place all their nuclear facilities and activities under the provisions of the IAEA Comprehensive Safeguards System.
Secondly, it will urge those states not yet having entered into safeguards agreements with the IAEA to fulfil their obligations in accordance with Article III of the NPT and to conclude such agreements as a matter of urgency.
Thirdly, it will promote all the objectives laid down in the NPT.
Fourthly, it will support the final document of the 2000 NPT review conference and the decisions and resolution adopted at the 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference.
Fifthly, it will promote further consideration of security assurances.
Finally, it will promote measures to ensure that any possible misuse of civilian nuclear programmes for military purposes will be effectively excluded.
There is no common Council analysis of the progress on the implementation of the 13 steps.
The European Union is however committed to encouraging the progress made towards systematic and progressive efforts towards disarmament.
The European Union will continue to encourage all efforts to implement Article VI of the NPT, as well as paragraphs 3 and 4c of the 1995 Declaration on 'Principles and Objectives for Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament' and the practical steps agreed in the 2000 final document.
The EUâs commitment to the comprehensive test ban treaty is also clear and was reiterated most recently by the EU common position on the universalisation of multilateral instruments adopted in November 2003.
The EU will continue to promote the early entry into force of the CTBT.
Pending its entry into force, we urge all states with nuclear capacity to abide by a moratorium on nuclear test explosions or any other nuclear explosions and refrain from any actions which are contrary to the CTBT.
The EU has acknowledged the importance of nuclear-weapon-free zones, established on the basis of arrangements freely achieved among the member states of the regions concerned.
They enhance global and regional peace and security.
We welcome and support both signature and ratification by the nuclear weapon states of the relevant protocols of nuclear-weapon-free zones.
On the question of verification and safeguards, the EU believes that the safeguards serve as a technical tool in support of the political goal of sustaining an environment in which there can be peaceful use of nuclear energy without the threat of proliferation.
In this connection we strongly support the verification role of the International Atomic Energy Agency.
The Union also takes the view that adoption and implementation of comprehensive safeguard agreements, and additional protocols to them, is a prerequisite in the effective and credible safeguards system.
The EU also continues to attach great importance to the fight against terrorism and strongly supports all measures that are aimed at preventing terrorists from acquiring nuclear, biological and chemical weapons.
The WMD strategy emphasises the EUâs commitment to strengthening export control policies and practices within its borders and beyond, in coordination with partners.
The EU will work towards improving the existing export control mechanisms.
It will advocate adherence to effective export control criteria by countries outside the existing regime and arrangements including in the nuclear field.
As regards the proliferation security initiative, the Council has not adopted a position on this issue. Not all Member States participate in the PSI.
The question of the International Mayorsâ Campaign has not been considered by the Council.
The third preparatory committee for the 2005 Review Conference of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which will be held from 26 April to 7Â May 2004, will be a pivotal event in terms of disarmament and non-proliferation in 2004.
As presidency, we will work within the Union and with key partners, to seek agreement on a solid basis for the successful outcome of the review cycle.
This work will take place in the first instance within the Working Group on Non-Proliferation and in its troika meetings with third countries.
The work will include the preparation of EU common statements on various aspects of the Treaty for delivery by the presidency at the preparatory committee.
The presidency will inform the European Parliament on the progress achieved in this field in accordance with Article 21 of the Treaty on European Union.
Â Â  . I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate today although, inevitably, I will traverse some of the ground that has been so ably covered by the presidency.
Recent revelations on the proliferation of nuclear weapons technology to Iran, Libya and North Korea have highlighted the importance of maintaining and strengthening effective controls.
It is a matter of historic record that the clandestine acquisition of nuclear weapons by India and Pakistan in the 1990s and the consequent impact on regional stability gave rise to grave concern.
North Koreaâs withdrawal from the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons last year was a further dangerous and destabilising step, both for the immediate region and the international community as a whole.
The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons â NPT â which entered into force in 1970, established the international nuclear non-proliferation regime as we know it.
This regime established the basic norms for behaviour.
It provides â as the House will know â a legal ban on nuclear proliferation beyond the five nuclear weapons states recognised by the Treaty and makes nuclear proliferation activity illegal in the international community.
With it came the principle of regulated nuclear trade, the concept of nuclear safeguards and, of course, the International Atomic Energy Authority, whose excellent work underpins the regime.
Understandably, much of the focus has been on the regimeâs failures, but we often underestimate the success.
In a 1960 presidential debate, John F. Kennedy envisaged a world with perhaps 20 nations with a nuclear capability.
That his vision was never realised has been due, in large part, to the creation of the NPT.
South Africa, Argentina, Brazil, Taiwan and South Korea, for example, have all turned their backs on the proliferation of nuclear weapons, partly because of international pressure, but also as a result of sensible and wise decisions taken in response to domestic debate and opinion.
We also have positive recent developments with Iran, which has now accepted the Additional Protocol, and Libya.
Against this background, while recognising the challenges that the NPT faces, particularly on nuclear proliferation and disarmament, we believe the forthcoming third preparatory committee can be approached with some confidence.
There may well be shortcomings in the non-proliferation regime but they are certainly not terminal and they can, in our judgment, be addressed.
We must continue to pursue the universal adoption of the NPT by countries that have so far refused to do so, and in particular India, Pakistan and Israel.
North Korea must return to conformity with the Treaty.
We must also extend the ratification of the important Additional Protocol to the Treaty. This Protocol provides the IAEA with enhanced and tougher powers to perform inspections.
In this context, the Commission's role is first in assisting the presidency, which sees progress in this area as a high priority, and second in encouraging the maximum degree of EU coordination.
The last 12 months have seen the EU take enormous strides in strengthening its approach to non-proliferation.
The European security strategy that was adopted at the December 2003 European Council identifies weapons of mass destruction as one of the most dangerous threats to todayâs Europe.
At the same European Council, the EU strategy against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction was approved.
This strategy is now being followed up by concrete action.
Work on implementation of the strategy is proceeding in a large number of areas which are too numerous to set out today, but I will highlight a number of important examples.
The first was last Novemberâs adoption by the General Affairs and External Relations Council of a text aimed at mainstreaming non-proliferation policies into the European Unionâs wider relations with third countries, among other things, by introducing a non-proliferation clause in agreements with them.
This new commitment on non-proliferation is important, because the new EU strategy aims to include provisions on non-proliferation in all agreements with third countries.
This is now part of ongoing negotiations, for example with Syria, placing non-proliferation on a similar level to human rights and the fight against terrorism.
The EU Joint Action for Disarmament and Non-Proliferation in Russia was established by the Council in 1999 to enhance cooperation with the Russian Federation in the latterâs pursuit of a safe, secure and environmentally sound dismantlement, destruction or conversion of those WMD infrastructures, equipment and materials.
The projects support chemical destruction and the disposal of weapons-grade plutonium.
These projects, which are implemented by the Commission in close cooperation with a number of Member States, are a small but important part of the Communityâs EUR 1Â billion contribution to the G8 Global Partnership, launched at the meeting in 2002 in Canada.
The Interparliamentary Conference hosted by the Commission under the Non-proliferation and Disarmament Cooperation Initiative on 20 and 21 November 2003, which took place here in Strasbourg, highlighted the considerable future challenges ahead if we are to safely dispose of the dangerous remains of Cold War WMD programmes.
The conferenceâs significance was confirmed through its status as an interparliamentary gathering of figures from key national parliaments, including the United States Congress and the Russian Duma.
For the WMD threat to be removed it must become and remain a high priority issue for national governments, regional organisations and the international community as a whole.
From a Community perspective, we are grateful for the increased attention given by the European Parliament to the need to adequately fund threat-reduction activities in the next budget cycle.
The Commission, in cooperation with the European Parliament, is seeking to define future non-proliferation priorities and, thanks to a recent decision by Parliament, will be able shortly to launch a pilot project to further this work.
I am grateful for the opportunity to have taken part in this short but important debate on a matter of such international significance.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the NPT is not only a non-proliferation treaty.
It is also the only binding international agreement for nuclear disarmament.
Non-nuclear powers undertake not to acquire nuclear weapons, and the nuclear powers promise to get rid of their existing ones.
These commitments may be found in ArticleÂ 6 of the Treaty, under which the parties undertake to conduct serious negotiations with a view to getting rid of all nuclear weapons.
This undertaking has been signed by all the nuclear powers.
At the previous quinquennial meeting, the nuclear states undertook totally to abolish their nuclear arsenals.
Above all, a unanimous decision was taken concerning a 13-point action programme for implementing complete nuclear disarmament.
What the EU must do at the forthcoming meeting is, of course, to demand that these commitments be met.
Ireland has for a long time played an active role in the work for nuclear disarmament, for example in conjunction with my own country, Sweden.
Will the Council demand, then, that these commitments be complied with?
The nuclear powers have certainly reduced their strategic nuclear arsenals.
The United States has instead developed what are termed mini nuclear weapons, intended to be used directly in war, together with nuclear weapons known as bunker buster weapons that penetrate thick rock.
These developments undoubtedly breach ArticleÂ 6 of the NPT Treaty.
Moreover, the United States has revised its nuclear weapons policy so as to be able to use its nuclear weapons, and not only in war but also for so-called preventive purposes.
This amounts to a serious breach of international law.
To engage in war for preventive reasons is a breach of the UN Charter and a return to the law of the jungle, that is to say the right of the strong, applicable before the advent of the United Nations, to intervene for their own purposes.
It is naturally important for the European Parliament to demand in its resolution that the parties that have signed the NPT should fulfil their commitments.
They must embark upon serious nuclear disarmament and call a halt to any development of new nuclear weapons.
In what way will the Commission and the Council give impetus to these demands at the next NPT meeting?
Â Â  â Mr President, the Director-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mr El Baradei, recently stated that the risk of a nuclear conflict has never been greater than today.
While Iraq was brought under control, the rest of the world changed into a kind of supermarket of private proliferation, a supermarket in which all countries and, possibly, even terrorists with nuclear ambitions, can seize their chances.
Despite recent successes with regard to Libya and Iran, there is little cause for optimism.
The US, Russia and France have all made a start on preparing a new generation of nuclear weapons.
As tension mounts between it and the US, Saudi Arabia is now also choosing the nuclear option.
For years, the father of Pakistanâs atomic bomb, Abdul Qadeer Khan, who was trained in Europe, passed on nuclear information to dictators and possibly even terrorists.
On account of this combination of commercially-minded nuclear experts, immoral businesses and state-owned institutions, the threshold for a nuclear war of destruction has been lowered.
Today, everyone is agreed that the monitoring system must be updated and tightened up.
The capacity of the International Atomic Energy Agency must, as a matter of urgency, be reinforced if effective control is to be made possible, but the European Union should have the courage to take political, diplomatic and economic action against countries that ignore, or evade, monitoring in the field of nuclear proliferation.
Not only do we have to tighten up where monitoring is concerned, we must also be prepared to enforce it collectively.
I therefore welcome the Council's and Commission's pledge to commit to the further, full implementation of the NPT and to work for ambitious results during the next Prepcom and the Review Conference in 2005.
Â Â  MrÂ President, firstly, we hear a debate in the House concerning an area of freedom, security and justice, and then we hear two vital speeches by MrÂ Patten and the Irish Presidency.
We should be pleased and encouraged, but the truth is that things are, in actual fact, heading in all but the wrong direction when it comes to nuclear disarmament and the possibility of obtaining such an area of freedom, security and justice.
One of the reasons why things are heading in the wrong direction is that there is an unwillingness to comply not just with the words, but also with the spirit, of the Non-Proliferation Treaty.
I am thinking, in particular, of ArticleÂ 6, concerning the abolition of nuclear weapons.
At the most recent meeting, in the year 2000, it was decided to set up a special committee to deal with nuclear disarmament.
Since then, nothing has happened.
If nothing is happening, it is because those countries that should be putting their energy and resources into this issue either do not wish, or are unable, to do so.
For the moment, it is clear that we cannot expect support from the Americans in this matter.
They are in the throes of doing almost the opposite of what they have committed themselves to doing.
They have also emphasised that they do not intend to comply with either the letter or the spirit of the Non-Proliferation Treaty.
By introducing what are termed mininukes, they have, rather, reduced the nuclear threshold instead of doing what they have, in principle, undertaken to do.
The EU countries are not much better.
Instead of making this issue a firmly established part of the transatlantic dialogue, we are rather cautious and obliging.
We get slightly involved in a war in Iraq and do our bit in a number of other US actions, in Afghanistan etc, without pointing out that, if this problem is not taken seriously and solved, all our talk of areas of freedom, security and justice may at most be used to lull people to sleep with. It cannot in any case be used to create the world we all want to see.
Surrounded by flames, there is no living in freedom, security and justice, so I should like to see a little more energy behind the very fine words.
It is always entertaining to hear MrÂ Patten produce fine words, but I am looking for a little more energy.
Â Â  Mr President, the Third Non-Proliferation Treaty PrepCom in New York in a few months' time has to be a success.
To that end, it is essential that Ireland, as the holder of the presidency, ensures that Member States adopt a common position that will become part of its commitment to the EU strategy against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction adopted in Thessaloniki, because these are the weapons of mass destruction.
Ireland, as one of the instigators of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, has a major role to play here.
We would like to know, in relation to the Council Working Group on Nuclear Weapons, what the priorities are for the NPT PrepCom meeting.
Parliament needs to know which Member States are being cooperative and which are not.
The Council should prepare regular progress reports on this issue for Parliament, in particular on the issues of the dismantling of nuclear weapons arsenals, nuclear weapon-free zones and the no first-strike option.
This is in the public interest.
We need to know how far EU Member States have implemented the action programme of the 13 practical steps agreed in 2002 at the NPT Review Conference.
It is also very important that the Irish presidency takes a proactive role to ensure that Europe becomes a nuclear-free zone, that the UK and France get rid of their nuclear arsenals and that Nato's first-strike policy is abolished.
The Council has to prepare a statement on the progress made by the EU since the report in 1995 by this Parliament on the NPT and, indeed, the many resolutions since then.
I would like to see a proactive position from the Irish presidency, informing this Parliament about what is happening within the Council.
Â Â  â Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, when I listen to you both speaking on behalf of the Council and Commission, I should be reassured, but I am not, because we have been living, ever since Hiroshima, under the threat of an atomic war, and this threat is increasing rather than decreasing.
We should stop paying lip service to non-proliferation and monitoring.
Indeed, hypocrisy is quite clearly spreading in this case; after all, since the Non-Proliferation Treaty, the number of countries with nuclear material has risen continually.
It appears that this has happened with the help of countries of our own Union which have never been punished and never been called to account.
How did Israel manage to develop an atom bomb?
First with the help of France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany; everyone has helped create this bomb, and we are now complaining that Israel remains outside of the zone because, of course, the United States does not want to force that country to accept non-proliferation.
As a result, the Arabs are also continually itching to get hold of nuclear weapons.
We notice that all the monitoring that is in place was unable to prevent Mr Khan, the father of Pakistanâs nuclear bomb, from doing his own thing, and getting away with it, for thirty years.
Meanwhile, the material has increasingly become more readily available or available on the black market.
Over the course of five years, one and a half kilos of fission material has disappeared from Georgia.
The implosion of the Soviet Union has thrown open a market, a black market, in nuclear material.
I hope that you will vote for enforceable measures and will take a stand against fine statements that send our people to sleep, because they are wide awake.
Â Â  Mr President, I do not share the optimism of either the Council or the Commission on this.
The fact that two Member States of the European Union possess nuclear weapons undermines the moral authority of the whole of the EU when it comes to the debate on weapons of mass destruction.
The overwhelming hypocrisy of the British and American governments in demanding the disarmament of others, while simultaneously upgrading their own nuclear capacity, is clear for all to see.
This is an untenable, hypocritical and very destabilising position.
We have heard a lot about international law recently, so let me remind Britain and France that, according to the ICJ at The Hague, nuclear weapons are immoral and illegal.
According to commitments made at the Sixth NPT Review Conference, all nuclear states made an unequivocal undertaking to accomplish the total elimination of their nuclear arsenals leading to nuclear disarmament.
That was four years ago, and very little progress has been made since.
Britain and France should lead by example and unilaterally dismantle their nuclear warheads.
There should be immediate removal of US nuclear weapons from European soil.
These are undoubtedly ambitious aims, but if we are serious about the threats posed by weapons of mass destruction, this the route we have to take.
Â Â  â The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place on 26Â FebruaryÂ 2004 in Brussels.
Â Â  I would like to greet a delegation of 15Â members of the upper and lower houses of parliaments in Mercosur countries (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay) seated in the gallery.
The delegation is headed by Mr Alfredo Atanasof, a Member of the Argentinian Parliament and Chairman of the MercosurÂ JointÂ ParliamentaryÂ Committee.
Our guests are here to participate in the Sixth Interparliamentary Conference of the European Parliament and the Mercosur Joint Parliamentary Committee. The conference takes place today and tomorrow in Strasbourg.
As you know, the European Union and Mercosur are negotiating an agreement on economic collaboration, political coordination and cooperation.
It is my great pleasure to welcome this delegation and wish the Interparliamentary Conference every success.
Ladies and gentlemen, I must also inform you that the debate on the Council declaration concerning the position of the EuropeanÂ Union on the hearing in the InternationalÂ CourtÂ of Justice on the Israeli wall will be delayed until 3 p.m. so that we can proceed to the votes in the next few minutes.
Â Â  The next item is the vote.
Â Â  Mr President, the amendment provides for the words âadequately qualifiedâ to be inserted before the word âprofessionalsâ.
Â Â  . â Mr President, the Group of the Party of European Socialists wishes to table an oral amendment to paragraphÂ 12. The amendment reads as follows in English:
'Calls for the revision, with a view to the phasing-out, as soon as possible, of the individual opt-out proved for in Article 18(1)(b) of Directive 93/104/EC; in the meantime, calls on the Commission to identify practical ways of tackling potential or actual abuses of the opt-out provision, including seeking views on how best to strengthen the voluntary nature of the opt-out.'
MrÂ President, some groups also wish to divide up this oral amendment.
The first part would finish at âDirectiveÂ 93/104/ECâ and the second part would then begin with âin the meantimeâ and continue to the end.
Â Â  Mr President, I, on behalf of the ELDR Group, and the PPE-DE Group jointly tabled an amendment.
Is it in order that PPE-DE Group can do a complete U-turn and table an oral amendment that is the opposite of its original amendment?
At the same time, the Group seems to be are disagreeing completely with its Conservative colleagues â and the shadow rapporteur was a Conservative.
What state has my amendment âŠ
Â Â  Excuse me, I am sorry to interrupt you.
We will not have the debate again, but you have a good procedural question.
I will deal with it.
If 32 Members object to the oral amendment, it falls.
Â Â  Should the oral amendment not be taken after the vote on the amendment, because they are amending the paragraph, rather than the amendment I tabled?
Â Â  If we vote on the oral amendment, the revised Amendment No 15 will fall, because it is incorporated in the oral amendment.
Now we come to the procedural question.
Are there any objections to the oral amendment?
Â Â  Mr President, surely, as it aims to delete the text, Amendment No 26S should be taken before you take the oral amendment?
Â Â  The answer to your question is that unless 32 Members object, we will proceed with the oral amendment, which represents a compromise between the political groups.
That concludes the vote.
Â Â  Mr President, I am pleased to announce the presence in the gallery of a delegation of regional representatives from the Lombardia, including my daughter Elisabetta Fatuzzo who, knowing that I was due to speak on the report on agricultural incomes within the European Union, pointed out to me that once there were fruit trees that produced apples, pears, cherries, beautifully sweet cherries, and there were wheat fields and vegetables.
When will we again have the pleasure of harvesting this produce near our homes like we used to?
When will we again be able, like Adam, to receive apples plucked by Eve directly from the tree?
Â Â  Thank you Mr Fatuzzo.
We welcome your group of visitors from Lombardia, and your daughter, Elisabetta.
Â Â  . â In the Garot report on trends in agricultural incomes in the European Union, the European Parliament is by implication beginning to complain about the future consequences of the Fischler reform, even though it agreed to it itself.
It was in fact Parliament which, in order to please the Commission, assented to plunging agriculture into the world market, decoupling aid from production and aligning product prices downwards.
Reading the Garot report, it is hard to believe that.
The Parliament is now realising that preserving farmersâ incomes and maintaining the presence of a healthy agriculture in all the countries of Europe require remunerative prices based on production costs and adequate external protection (paragraph 12).
We were more consistent when we rejected the Fischler reform, proposing at the ârebuilding an agricultural policy in Europeâ colloquium an agricultural model that was internally less subject to public intervention schemes, which, without export subsidies, was protected from the outside, so that remunerative domestic prices compatible with a sustainable management of nature would be set spontaneously.
That is the only way to really safeguard Europeâs agricultural future.
Â Â  . This report rightly denounces certain aspects of this CAP which has served primarily to feed the profits of the big capitalistic farmers and large-scale distributors.
The rapporteur says he wants to distance himself from that policy and protect farmers, especially small farmers, in every region of the European Union, even the most remote.
We are not against the smallest of them being protected, and that is the only reason why we did not vote against this report.
We are, on the other hand, totally against subsidies or aid for agricultureâs capitalists.
We are also against the protectionist aspects of the policy advocated by this report because protectionism is a direct attack on the incomes of many farmers in third countries, including poor countries, and because it is harmful to consumers.
We therefore abstained.
Â Â  . â I voted in favour of Mr Garotâs excellent report and I want to take this opportunity to congratulate him on his work on European agriculture.
Mr Garot has managed to strike a good balance between those who would like to disengage Europe from agriculture in favour of the world market and those who consider the European budget a âmilch cowâ making the richest farmers even richer.
Â Â  . â A sound argument in favour of maintaining European agricultural subsidies is that they enable small farmers to survive falls in their productsâ prices and to contribute to preserving a viable countryside.
This argument is cancelled out if tax money is misused to line the pockets of rich farmers and agricultural multinationals.
A recent study by the development organisation Oxfam shows that EU agricultural subsidies in Great Britain mainly benefit large landowners.
For example, it is estimated that the richest of them, the Duke of Westminster, receives some GBPÂ 38 per hour in agricultural subsidies.
Even the rapporteur, Mr Garot, who, as a Social Democrat, unfortunately considers the liberalisation of agriculture as a natural phenomenon, now observes that something is amiss where agricultural subsidies are concerned.
Between 1995 and 2002, agricultural incomes rose by 7%, but at the same time, the number of farms fell by 15.7%.
The remaining farms increased in size and became more intensive.
Agricultural support is being distributed unevenly: 20% of the farms receive 73% of the direct support for 59% of the acreage and only 25% of the jobs.
The rapporteur is, above all, anxious about farms that produce little but do receive support.
I would be more in favour of a ceiling, a maximum limit of support for each farm.
Without such a measure, the agricultural funds would become a source of useless bureaucracy and an unjust form of redistribution.
Â Â  . â I abstained during the vote on Mr Garot's report, despite the fact that it backs development and reform in the direction of agricultural policy with decoupled premiums and strengthened rural policy.
The report does not, however, take sufficient account of the restrictions that govern the funding of the Common Agricultural Policy.
Even the financial leeway available impacts on the policy to be adopted.
I should particularly like to draw your attention to paragraph 25, in which cofinancing for agricultural and rural policy is rejected.
In my view, compulsory cofinancing is precisely one of the key instruments that can help adopt a common agricultural policy in the future.
Â Â  . This report focuses on the current crisis in agricultural incomes in a number of Member States.
The crucial issue here is the extent to which the common agricultural policy is fulfilling the aims established by the Treaty in terms of ensuring a decent standard of living for farmers and inhabitants of rural areas.
While overall agricultural income increased by 7% between 1995 and 2002, this result was obtained at the cost of an 18% reduction in the number of farms.
We have seen the social costs of this phenomenon for Portuguese farmers, who have been forced to abandon or to modify the activities that they have always carried out.
The truth of the matter is that in comparison with other sectors of the economy, agriculture has been lagging behind.
The overall figures also hide major disparities, such as the fact that 20% of farms receive 73% of CAP aid.
These farms only account for 59% of the land and 25% of jobs in the sector.
The situation is politically and socially unacceptable and explains the behaviour of some Member States wishing to maintain their privileges under the CAP.
By voting in favour, we endorse the wording in the report of the recommendations with regard to the recently strengthened pillar of rural development of the CAP, promoted ...
Â Â  . Within the framework of the CAP, the number of farms fell sharply â by 15.7% â between 1995 and 2002, which led to a rise in agricultural incomes across the whole of the EU.
This rise was in fact due both to this reduction in the number of farms and to the increase in farm size.
Pluriactivity and diversification have also helped to maintain agricultural incomes.
Examination of the reality of rural life in Member States, however, reveals, in many cases, that farmers are dependent either on public aid or on the fluctuations of prices and markets, leading to a feeling of insecurity, and, in turn, to low levels of investment in modernisation and in crop diversification.
Farms are becoming increasingly concentrated, and, unless this trend is combated, it will result in the depopulation of the countryside, thereby endangering all of the external factors supported by the countryside, not all of which are quantifiable.
The aims of âcompetitivenessâ and âmultifunctionalityâ must be made compatible, thereby ensuring a minimum level of security for those involved in farming, as well as confidence in a fair standard of living and in the stability of income.
The outcome of this would be viable Community agriculture that is capable of supporting the highest possible number of farms and jobs throughout the EU.
I voted in favour.
Â Â  . â I voted in favour of the Garot report in recognition of the merits of an initiative which for once has enabled us to debate one of the fundamental questions affecting the preservation of our agricultural model: our farmersâ incomes.
This debate has enabled us to break with the fragmentary and technical approaches normally forced on us when examining the flood of legislative proposals emanating from the Commission.
I also wanted to mark my full agreement with the review of the fundamental aims of the CAP, the relevance of which the report reaffirms: âto promote a territorial approach to agriculture capable of preserving as many farms and jobs as possible throughout the EUâ and âto ensure a fair standard of living for the agricultural community and stabilise incomes with a view to maintaining farming activity throughout the European Unionâ.
I can only express my amazement, however, at the contradictory reasoning which, on the one hand, always approves the Commissionâs proposals, be they for decoupling or for lowering external protection, while on the other denouncing the risks of total adulteration of the European agricultural model that those same proposals entail.
My approval therefore clearly does not apply to the references to decoupling and to rural development contained in the Garot report.
Â Â  With this report we are still in the field of agriculture.
So, I should like agricultural research to make progress, progress, progress to the point where a wine can be produced from grapes that does not harm the liver of the person drinking it.
I should also like this agriculture to produce pears that taste like pears, apples that taste like apples, cherries that taste like cherries and peaches that taste like peaches; but above all, MrÂ President, I should like mint â which is my favourite flavour â to have, continue to have and have even more of the taste and perfume of mint, which gives me so much pleasure and which I adore.
Â Â  I thank you for that earthy contribution.
Â Â  . â It goes without saying that a large part of agricultural research has up until now been in one way or another directed towards areas from which the agri-food capitalists hoped to derive the greatest profits.
This report advocates redirecting at least some of that research to sectors that are currently neglected.
That really would be a good thing.
Even if, unlike the rapporteur, we do not think that the development of âsustainableâ agriculture and of âbiologicalâ agricultural production, which he supports, is necessarily synonymous with a real advantage both to consumers, at least the vast majority of them, and to small family farms.
We are not, of course, opposed to such a reorientation of agricultural research or to its being financed out of public funds as the rapporteur wishes.
That request underlines the extent to which the market economy is incapable of funding research if the results do not produce immediate profits.
Â Â  . Agriculture has a major impact on the climate, on soils, on biodiversity, on the balance of ecosystems and on landscape management; in other words, there is strong environmental interaction.
It is a vital socio-economic and cultural activity, which ought to ensure high-quality agricultural produce.
The food and animal-health crises that have befallen the EU have shown the unsustainability of the current agricultural model established under the CAP.
This model encourages intensified production, at complete variance with the multifunctional face of agriculture.
In order to develop sustainable farming culture, it is, therefore, important that we develop, implement and fund agricultural research that takes account of the significance of agriculture both for the development of rural areas and for the production of high-quality food.
The paltry 2% of the Sixth Framework Programme for research is too low a level of funding for research into areas such as more sustainable farming methods, food safety and quality, alternative sources of income in agriculture (non-food uses of agricultural raw materials), the question of gender, new ways of regulating the market and improving organic farming methods.
Other areas in which research is crucial are GM crops and biotechnology.
To be more specific, we must look into questions concerning the coexistence between GM crops and conventional/organic crops, and the potential risks of releasing these crops into the environment and of introducing them into the food chain.
Â Â  . The report before us points out the need to increase funding for research in the area of agriculture, in light of developments such as the transition towards multifunctionality, the greater importance attached to rural development and the need to make certain specialised agricultural practices, such as organic farming, more commercial.
The rapporteur therefore calls for the use of funds from the Sixth Framework Programme for research to support projects and initiatives in the general framework of agriculture and rural development, bearing in mind the considerable potential, in the area of food science and the development of produce, to boost local production and local economies.
We agree entirely that if we are to meet the consumerâs increasingly high expectations in terms of traceability, hygiene control, quality of ingredients, and so forth, considerable investment is required, in order to raise quality levels and maintain competitiveness.
Given that such investment is not easy to come by at SME level, we must create conditions whereby investment is obtained at industry level, or at regional or national level, through public funding.
I therefore voted in favour of the report.
Â Â  . I share the rapporteurâs view that funding is needed for research in the field of agriculture.
There is considerable potential, in the areas of food science and the development of products, to boost local production and local economies, which, unfortunately, has not been properly exploited.
In view of the most recent developments in the sector, such as the transition to multifunctionality, I believe that rural development should be accorded the priority it deserves, and the use of funds from the Sixth Framework Programme for research may help in this regard.
I feel that the growing demands of consumers, which I welcome and encourage, surely deserve the total support of the European institutions.
The institutions must contribute not only towards making it increasingly possible to trace a productâs progress âfrom farm to forkâ but also towards making certain specialised agricultural activities, such as organic farming, more commercial.
In terms of traceability, hygiene control and quality of ingredients, considerable investment is still required in order to raise quality levels and to maintain competitiveness.
I therefore voted in favour.
Â Â  Indeed, I voted in favour of this report on the recognition of professional qualifications because its aim is to have doctors who are European doctors â recognised as such throughout Europe â European lawyers, European accountants, European architects.
We Members, Mr President, are we not already European parliamentarians?
Do we not demonstrate that we can succeed at being parliamentarians without having to take additional exams in order to be recognised throughout Europe?
We are an example, therefore, of how it is possible in practice to have a single European profession.
Just as we have succeeded as parliamentarians in carrying out our work effectively, so too may all the professions be able to do likewise.
Let us hope that it happens soon!
Â Â  . We MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the report because, on the pretext of 'transparency' and 'recognition of professional qualifications', it endeavours to shrink the scientific foundations for qualifications, when developments in science and technology presuppose the upgrading of education.
As we pointed out during the debate on the report, its objective is to further liberalise the job market for the benefit of big business, it intervenes in the education system of the Member States, imposing an educational model which downgrades higher education, and it harmonises downwards the qualifications needed to access professions protected by law.
As far as engineers, for example, are concerned, apart from the question of unequal treatment at the expense of qualified engineers who have completed a five-year course at an institute of higher education, whom it equates with graduates of three-year courses, the downgrading of the profession implied by the Directive gives rise to the serious matter of public interest and urgent social and grass-roots requirements in sensitive sectors, such as earthquake protection, construction and upgrading the natural and man-made environment.
In addition, Plenary voted in favour of the amendments which pave the way for the recognition of imitation diplomas issued by university institutes, the famous Liberal Study Centres linked with foreign universities, equating its graduates with graduates from Greek institutes of higher education, despite the fact that the courses at these centres are not recognised in Greece as higher education courses.
Â Â  . I welcome the criticisms made in the report of the Commissionâs draft, especially with regard to the temporary measures to define the provision of services and to the possibility of avoiding making social security contributions.
In Portugal, the key element of the regulation and limitation of access to certain professions is Article 47 of Constitutional law.
Restriction is only possible by means of National Assembly legislation.
Access can only be restricted when other fundamental rights are at stake â life, health and the safety of persons and effects â whilst always respecting the criteria of proportionality, of need, and of ensuring that the measure is appropriate.
The idea of consolidating all professional regulations in one single directive, taking account of the particular characteristics of each of these â doctors, veterinary surgeons, nurses, obstetricians, architects and dentists â is acceptable, since life, health and the safety of persons and effects are at stake.
It is, however, unacceptable, and indeed incomprehensible, that the Directive does not include other healthcare professionals, who play a vital role in the health and safety of workers, such as health and safety officers at work, biologists, senior health technicians and diagnosis and therapy technicians.
The draft Directive, by not setting out explicitly that in order to recognise professional qualifications training must be based ...
Â Â  . â The report on the recognition of European qualifications extends the possibilities for the provision of services and harmonises qualifications in order to increase the mobility and free movement of labour in Europe.
It seeks to give a service providerâs customer a guarantee of the quality of the work provided and to enable him to find the person responsible if he is not satisfied with the service and to insure him against risks.
But there is nothing in this text about the rights conferred by recognised qualifications, nothing about the guarantees offered, nothing about the harmonisation of status and working conditions, nothing about improving the conditions of training.
We reject a policy that seeks to give every guarantee to undertakings or customers in the case of professional mobility but none to those who work; we reject a policy that encourages social dumping by putting wage earners in brutal competition with one another with no guarantees, thereby undermining their status and social benefit entitlements.
We are in favour of a harmonisation of qualifications that is indissolubly linked to a definition of status, working conditions and social commitments in terms of wages and social protection, because that would make for a mobility that would encourage improved living and working conditions in all European countries.
We have therefore voted against the ZappalÃ  report.
Â Â  . â As submitted to us, the report contains an enormous number of amendments, among which I have concentrated on only one, namely Amendment NoÂ 20, which relates to recital 21.
In fact, my help has been sought by the Architectsâ Council of Europe, at the request of the architects and consulting engineers of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.
This amendment would introduce the concept of surveyors being able to offer building design services.
Introducing a reference to surveyors into this directive would confer recognition on a profession which exists only in the United Kingdom and in Ireland, and whose members are not involved in the designing of buildings.
In these countries, âbuilding surveyorsâ are occasionally employed in the design of buildings.
The profession of surveyor not being common in Europe, the versions of the amendment in various languages will introduce confusion as to who is entitled to design buildings.
The French translation refers to ââ, who are not part of the same profession.
This amendment appears to me to be dangerous, and I will be voting against it.
Â Â  . The Peopleâs Party for Freedom and Democracy is particularly delighted at the fact that the compromise amendments that have been agreed upon are fully in keeping with the European Commissionâs initiative to launch a Europass, an Internet system that should promote the comparability of degrees and qualifications in the EU.
The compromise contains a time-based points system, with quality points being awarded to each training course.
This system guarantees that in the assessment of a training course, not the length of time, but the quality, is of importance.
In addition, in a compromise, the rights and duties have been tightened up of those professions that involve extra care duty to protect the consumer, by means of compulsory registration and insurance in the case of a temporary provision of services in another Member State.
For women too, the same rights remain valid for access to the labour market.
A discriminating provision providing for the possibility of retaining a qualification only if work had not been interrupted for two out of the last five years, has been deleted.
The directive is of vital importance in enhancing mobility on the labour market and is an essential precondition for achieving the Lisbon objective.
A transparent system of qualifications will become more important, particularly in the light of enlargement, which will result in a further increase in intra-Community migration.
Â Â  . Young people are told that it is becoming increasingly easier for them to work abroad.
For some, working abroad for a while to gain experience is fun, but it is not if it is a necessity because jobs in their own profession are dying out in their own country, so that they can only be found in far-flung places.
People are altogether disenchanted if they have to work abroad at lower wages and with no recognition for the qualifications they have gained.
According to EU propaganda, everyone in every Member State is entitled to work at normal wages that are current in that country, and qualifications are mutually recognised.
Practice, however, differs a great deal from that ideal image.
Foreign teachers do not qualify for equivalent work in France and Italy.
According to petitions recently received, Greece does not recognise university degrees gained abroad by Greeks, and there are also problems in Baden-WÃŒrttemberg and Scotland.
I do not get the impression that the proposed amendment of fifteen directives will really solve the problems.
At best, there will be more freedom to settle on the part of those practising liberal professions, whereby foreigners will no longer need to meet the licensing and registration requirements, but these will remain compulsory for their domestic counterparts.
According to medical specialists, the equal status for their qualifications has not been regulated very well by the European Commission. The complaints are set to persist.
Â Â  . â I am glad that MrÂ ZappalÃ âs report on the recognition of professional qualifications in the European Union has been adopted today.
With enlargement imminent, the free movement of workers, in particular of doctors, dentists, nurses, veterinary surgeons, midwives, pharmacists and architects, in the EU requires a simplified and harmonised system of professional qualifications.
It seemed to me important to preserve what we already have and therefore to maintain high standards of qualification, especially for doctors, in a âEuropeanâ spirit that respects personalised values.
That is why I voted against Amendment No 155.
It would in fact have been preferable to have a supple and flexible mechanism that takes account of developments in university degree courses when setting the number of yearsâ training for specialists.
Finally, I voted against Amendment No 156, which does not clarify the scope of automatic recognition of professional qualifications and does not leave Member States free to recognise specialisms in the medical profession.
On these points I am looking for a strong signal from the Council, for it to pay greater heed to professional associations, of doctors in particular, for the greater benefit, in the end, let us not forget, of the patients.
Â Â  â I travelled from Milan to Rome by car. I had to go and see my mother whom, as a result of my commitments as an MEP, I have not seen for some time.
Between Bologna and Florence there was huge traffic congestion, what the French call a ; we could not get through as there was a queue of trucks, articulated lorries and cars at a standstill.
I saw MrÂ Gargani, the rapporteur of this report, waiting for me there.
âWhat are you doing here, MrÂ Gargani?â, I asked him.
He replied, âI am here to show you what would happen if my report on the harmonisation of motor vehicles is not adopted.
Look, one motor vehicle has turned over.
So, remember, when you arrive in Parliament tomorrow to vote in favourâ.
It was a dream because I never met Mr Gargani, but in my view it is right to vote in favour, which is what I have in fact done.
Â Â  . I welcome this report on the Commissionâs proposal aimed at completing the single internal market in the automotive sector, by extending the principles and procedures of EU type-approval, which currently only apply to passenger cars, to all motor vehicles.
In view of the progress made in the automobile sector and given the impending enlargement, it is necessary to bring in a single compulsory system for the type-approval of motor vehicles, to replace national procedures.
This may bring benefits for the European automobile industry, such as reduced production costs, greater ease of access and expansion in the European market.
In addition, there will be gains in terms of road safety and environmental protection.
I particularly agree with the rapporteurâs view that any benefits that may accrue to small and medium-sized manufacturers are nullified by the conditions the proposal imposes on them for using it.
The annual production limit required is set at too low a level, which may act as a disincentive for European SMEs to manufacture, thus hindering their potential for development and technological innovation.
The transitional periods that must precede the systemâs entry into force must also be extended, to take into account the adjustments that will need to be made by manufacturers and by all those required to deal with the new procedures.
I voted in favour.
Â Â  . The Commission feels that Northern hake stock has suffered biological collapse and has, consequently, drawn up a recovery plan that entails drastically reducing the catch and the fishing effort.
The rapporteur feels that this measure is disproportionate and suggests only a management plan.
Both sides justify their positions with scientific advice.
This raises four important issues:
- firstly, it is essential to evaluate the effectiveness of the recovery plans established in the revision of the common fisheries policy (CFP) in Council Regulation (EC) NoÂ 2371/2002 of December 2002, as a measure for conserving fisheries resources;
- secondly, fishermen must be involved in the process of assessing stocks, which Parliament called for in its opinion on integrating environmental protection requirements into the CFP.
It is deplorable that in the case of Northern hake fishermen have not previously been properly involved;
- thirdly, given that the sustainability of resources is a key objective for the fisheries sector and for fishermen, stock recovery measures â leading to a reduction in the catch and fishing effort and in some cases to activities being ceased altogether â must be subject to an assessment of their socio-economic impact; financial compensation for losses incurred by those affected, especially fishermen, must also be ensured;
- lastly, measures must be commensurate with aims, which requires not only assessing ...
Â Â  . I voted against this report today, as I did at the committee stage.
The original proposal of the Commission was for a cod and hake recovery plan based on scientific advice which was broadly similar in its assessment of the situation in both of these fisheries.
Intensive lobbying by those whose national interest is in the hake fishery influenced the Commission and Council's decision to separate the two, proceeding first with cod recovery measures, which have emerged as discriminatory against the Scots white fish sector.
At committee stage this Souchet report was almost completely rewritten by amendments favouring the national interests which target the hake fishery.
This move further fuels the opinion of many Scots that certain national fishing fleets are being favoured, while Scotland loses out from EU management.
The major influencing factor in this process is the fact that some Member States have governments which are prepared to make survival of their fishing communities a priority, while Scotland has the misfortune to be represented by the UK government which regularly betray us in EU Fisheries Council negotiations.
Â Â  . â Cod is an example of how fishery resources are not inexhaustible.
In order to conserve them, the Commission is constantly flanking our fishing effort with a variety of instruments for managing stocks and boats.
Withdrawals from stocks are limited by total allowable catches, which are broken down into national quotas.
The number of boats is constantly being cut by means of the financial instrument for fisheries guidance.
The Regulation of 20 December 2002 on the sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources takes up these instruments, but serves in particular as a basis for a third instrument of management proposed on 27 June 2003, limiting the fishing effort in kilowatt-days.
If stocks are not to fall below the biomass limit, 100 000 tonnes in the case of Northern hake, for example, the number of days boats are absent from port would be limited on the basis of their power.
Apart from this toolâs complexity, what is the use of setting our European fishermen aside if the stocks released in that way are overexploited by the Japanese, the Russians and other practitioners of industrial fishing?
Â Â  The Commissionâs proposal shows the need for a collection of measures to facilitate the recovery of the hake stock.
The proposal is based on a report by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES).
Parliament does not, however, wish to go as far and judges the problems to be less serious.
Parliamentâs amendments are based essentially on the view that the Commission has exaggerated the problems of over-fishing and that a recovery plan is unnecessary.
I chose to vote against Parliamentâs amendments because the original proposal by the Commission attaches greater importance to taking the problems seriously.
Moreover, continued survival of the fish stock is given priority over the socio-economic effects to which any restriction can, in the worst case, give rise.
Â Â  Mr President, I am not certain I can follow the eloquence of MrÂ Fatuzzo in my explanation of vote.
First, however, whilst nobody in this House is opposed to the proper control of the working time of all those employed within the European Union, it is equally important that a certain flexibility be allowed.
The purpose of the amendments that I tabled, and some of the proposals I supported, was to ensure that this flexibility would be there, that there would not necessarily be a renationalisation of the rules regarding working time, but that there would be flexibility within the system to ensure that seasonal workers and other people who chose to work longer hours would be entitled to do so, rather than being regulated against.
Even though some of those amendments did not get through, I still support the report and congratulate the rapporteur on it.
On a further procedural point, I think an error was made with regard to allowing the oral amendment to Amendment No 26.
My Amendment No 26 sought to delete a certain paragraph, whereas the oral amendment related to adding something on to that paragraph from the original text.
I would ask that you or your services look at that and that it be put on record.
Whilst I know we cannot change the vote on that issue, it should be put on record that an error was made.
Â Â  I note your point and the record will show that. However, I dispute your point.
I will ask the services to communicate with you on the matter.
The oral amendment would have fallen had it received 32 objections.
That did not happen and so it became the precedent on which we voted.
I will ask the services to give you an explanation, even if you should remain unhappy with its contents.
Â Â  Mr President, I welcome the Cercas report and congratulate the rapporteur on a very balanced approach.
In the UK, 4 million people â or 16% of the workforce â currently work more than 40 hours per week.
At the beginning of the 1990s the figure was 3.3 million people, or 15% of the workforce.
It beggars belief that more people voluntarily want to work in excess of 40 hours a week now than was the case at the time of the introduction of this directive.
This calls into question the use of the individual opt-out and whether genuine free choice of workers, as laid out in the directive, is being respected.
Long hours damage workers' health through stress and burnout; they affect the productivity of industry and harm family life.
No one should be forced to work more than 40 hours.
I support flexibility, but there must be genuine free choice, and I am not convinced that free choice currently exists.
Â Â  I had a dream, MrÂ President.
I dreamt that Mr Berlusconi, President of the Italian Government, had a halo and so I can call him San Berlusconi.
San Berlusconi said to me, âI know that tomorrow you are to vote on the Cercas report concerning working time and it seeks to prevent those who are exempt under the minimum working time directive from working too much.
Look at me: I work all day, from six in the morning until two the following morning.
See how young I am, how active I am, how alert and satisfied I am at work!
My advice to you therefore is to vote against this Cercas report so that everyone can work as much as me and be as satisfied and as young as I amâ.
At that moment I woke up and realised it was a dream.
I felt free therefore to vote according to my conscience and so, in fact, I voted in favour of the Cercas report, even though San Berlusconi advised me to vote against.
Â Â  Mr Fatuzzo, I thank you for bringing some Mediterranean colour to these otherwise modest debates after our votes.
You referred to looking young: as we know from the references that you have made, there are many ways to look young, of which working hard may be only one.
Â Â  . â The Cercas report shows what every worker already knows: the employers and the politicians who serve them, who want a workforce that will do their every bidding, want the employers to be able to set working hours as they wish, with no legal limits.
Great Britain is the leader here.
The rapporteur says that âthere are currently more than four million workers whose working week is longer than 48 hours, almost one million more than before the introduction of the directive.
There has also been an increase in the number of those working more than 55 hours, which is now over 1.55 million.
Around 1% of workers in the United Kingdom have a working week longer than 70 hours.â
As to the workerâs individual agreement to work those hours, the cynicism of such a provision is underlined by this comment by the rapporteur: âit is common for these agreements to be signed at the same time as an individual contractâ. The choice is therefore between working yourself to death and having no work at all.
This general offensive against any labour regulations affording workers even the slightest protection from the omnipotence of the employers is a serious social setback.
Â Â  . We voted against this report, since, regrettably, proposals by the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party and the Union for Europe of the Nations Group were approved that substantially amend the text approved by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
As a result of the proposals and votes of these groups, some extremely important elements were, consequently, left out of the final text:
- the call for temporary measures to prevent a significant number of Member States, such as the United Kingdom, and new Member States, from being able to opt out, which defeats the purpose of the Directive;
- the request that the Commission immediately begin action against the United Kingdom for non-compliance, in view of the widespread systematic abuse of the Directive referred to in the Commissionâs communication;
- the item stating that the Lisbon Agenda sets a target of a 60% employment rate among women by 2010, which will not be achieved if extended working hours continue to be allowed;
Our proposals, on the other hand, were not approved, namely those advocating a gradual reduction in working hours and those that put forward alternative models of organising working time in the health care sector and in similar sectors that involve being âon callâ to protect workersâ rights as regards maximum working hours.
Â Â  . â The aim of the Cercas report was to take a hard look at the directive setting the maximum weekly working hours in the countries of the European Union.
They are set at 48 hours measured over a period of four months.
However, the directive allows for derogations extending the period of measurement by annualising it, at the same time allowing the rule to be disregarded altogether if employees âopt out voluntarilyâ.
The reportâs explanatory statement acknowledges that such exceptions are becoming the rule in Europe.
In the United Kingdom in particular, the âindividual opt-out clauseâ has apparently been signed by one third of employees, four million of whom are already working more than 48 hours a week.
The resolution therefore asked the Commission why it had not undertaken the review of the directive that should have been made in 2003.
Calling for an improvement in the working conditions and health of employees, women in particular, it sought as far as possible to limit cases in which the 48-hour week was exceeded and in particular to do away with the âindividual opt-outâ which is obviously being abused.
Once again, the vast majority of Members have shown their contempt for social questions and their sole concern for profit by voting for amendments that do away with any desire to limit working hours.
That is why we voted against the amended resolution.
Â Â  . The Working Time Directive of 1993 protects employees against working weeks in excess of 48 hours, daily rest times of less than 11 hours and holidays shorter than 4 weeks.
These are all minimum provisions and could easily be tightened up.
This is, above all, necessary to prevent governments of EU Member States from considering these European minimum provisions as normal and adjusting their national legislation accordingly, as the Dutch Minister De Geus appears to want to do.
In practice, the directive is being undermined by a concession made at the time to the â then Conservative â British Government.
The opt-out clause means that individual British employees, when signing their contract of employment, are asked to waive their rights.
People who are not prepared to do this often have to make way for people who are.
An additional problem is that hours on call for fire fighters and medical staff are often not included in their working hours.
Since this has now been changed by a judgment of the Court of Justice, these people are brought within the scope of the opt-out clause.
This makes it possible to get people to work for excessively long periods of time.
By a narrow majority, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has chosen in favour of an infringement procedure against the British Government and of abolishing the individual opt-out.
Today, this proposal has been scuppered by a Conservative majority
Â Â  . The report now before us concerns the review of the Directive on the organisation of working time: reference periods and self-exclusion clauses, better known as âopt-outâ clauses.
In 1993, the United Kingdom negotiated an opt-out clause authorising specific Member States not to implement the 48-hour maximum working week in certain circumstances
Although these clauses are not exclusive to the United Kingdom, it is there that they are used most frequently.
The 1993 Directive does, however, establish a 48-hour maximum working week, thereby according basic protection for most workers, the main exception being managers.
While there are reservations, the approval of various amendments has limited the most excessive aspects of what the rapporteur proposes.
I therefore voted in favour.
Â Â  The EU has a long history of devising minimum rules for the organisation of working time.
The British opt-out in this area has, unfortunately, been ever increasingly turned into almost a principal rule, because 33% of employees in Great Britain have signed agreements to the effect that they are prepared to work more than 48 hours per week.
There are tendencies for this now to spread to more countries, entailing a risk to employeesâ health and undermining safety in the workplace.
We Christian Democrats do not wish to support such a development.
It was therefore crucial that I voted in favour of the new wording of paragraphÂ 12, the two parts of which were adopted by, respectively, 275 votes in favour and 229 against (with 9 abstentions) and 335 votes in favour and 155 against (with 21 abstentions).
This means that the time limit on the British opt-out is now to be phased out.
Amendment NoÂ 28 involves a long-term solution to the problem of doctorsâ hours on call being discussed in the next stage of consultation, something I supported because the result would otherwise be demands for approximately 3Â 000 new doctors in Sweden and an unsustainable funding situation for the county councils.
Â Â  That concludes the explanations of vote.
(1)
Â Â  The next item is the Council statement on the position of the European Union on the hearing in the International Court of Justice on the Israeli wall.
Â Â  .
Madam President, in addressing the situation in the Middle East, I regret to say that there have been very few developments of a positive nature in the region in recent months.
I shall have to be frank and say that prospects for progress in the short term are not overly encouraging.
Nevertheless, the European Union continues to attach great importance to this issue and as presidency we shall play an active role in international peace efforts and in particular as a member of the international Quartet comprising the European Union, Russia, the United States and the United Nations, we will be energetic in pursuing this issue.
The Irish Foreign Minister, in his capacity as President of the Council, visited Israel and Egypt on 14-18 January 2004.
He met the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Israel and paid a courtesy call to the President of Israel.
In his meetings, Minister Cowen pointed out that the status quo was not sustainable and that progress must be made on the implementation of the roadmap.
He suggested that if initial steps envisaged in phase one of the roadmap are proving too great, then perhaps smaller steps might be taken as a means of building confidence in the region.
The Israeli side showed some interest in these ideas.
Similar suggestions had been made to the Palestinian Foreign Minister, Dr Nabil Sha'ath, during the course of a visit to Dublin on 9Â January.
These ideas also attracted support from the President and Foreign Minister of Egypt, and the Secretary General of the Arab League.
The Palestinian Prime Minister, Mr Qurei, visited Dublin last Monday and his discussions with the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister included further discussions of these ideas.
The meetings were conducted in a very cordial atmosphere and the discussions were wide-ranging and frank.
The Palestinian Prime Minister briefed his Irish interlocutors on the preparations being made for a meeting with the Prime Minister of Israel.
He said that he is willing to meet Prime Minister Sharon at a mutually convenient time.
He also announced a number of positive measures which the Palestinian Government is taking, or will shortly take.
These included the continued return of Palestinian police to the streets; firm action to end incitement; and an unequivocal statement reaffirming the stated Palestinian position on Israel's right to exist in peace and in security.
Prime Minister Qurei also outlined the work of the Palestinian Elections Commission, which is preparing for elections in the Palestinian Territory in the coming months.
He also urged that the Quartet have the Israeli Government stop the building of the wall, because continuing construction would lead to the undermining of the roadmap and the two-state solution, in addition to the human catastrophe for the Palestinian people's way of life that the wall entails.
There can be no doubt that the construction by Israel of a separation wall which extends deep into Palestinian territories is a major obstacle to progress and peace in that region.
This has been the subject of statements by the European Union and others who have urged Israel to consider the long-term consequences of this construction.
I need hardly say that the wall figured prominently in the discussions which the President of the Council had in Israel two weeks ago and that the Israeli attitude was regrettably uncompromising.
On 21 October 2003, the Member States of the European Union and the acceding states co-sponsored a resolution in the United Nations General Assembly.
That resolution called on Israel to stop and reverse construction of the wall and asked the United Nations Secretary-General to report on Israeli compliance.
When at the end of November the Secretary-General reported that there was no evidence of Israeli compliance, the General Assembly adopted a resolution asking the International Court of Justice to render an advisory opinion on the legal consequences of the construction of a wall in occupied Palestinian territory.
This resolution was adopted on 8 December 2003.
On that occasion the European Union abstained in the vote.
The decision to abstain was taken after intense consultations and was based on the conviction of many Member States that transferring the matter of the wall to a legal forum would do nothing to advance the political process necessary for peace.
Abstention did not in any way suggest that the European Union's position that the wall was in contravention of international law had changed â quite the opposite.
On receiving the resolution of the General Assembly, the Court invited Member States of the United Nations to submit statements or information to the Court which might be of assistance in its deliberations.
Some Member States of the European Union felt that it would be desirable for a common position to be submitted to the Court.
Other states had a strong preference for individual national submissions to the Court.
After considerable discussion â including at the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 26 January â it was agreed that there would be a presidency submission on behalf of the Union and that individual Member States might make national submissions based on established European Union positions.
The presidency had forwarded the texts of presidency statements to the United Nations General Assembly on 20 October and 8 December.
These were transmitted to the Registrar of the International Court of Justice in The Hague by the Irish Ambassador on 30 January.
The written submissions of all interested parties â including the Israelis and the Palestinians â have now been received by the Court.
It is expected that oral submissions will commence on 23 February and that the Court will deliver its advisory opinion to the General Assembly sometime between late May and late July.
Amid the gloom prevalent in the region, there have been some small signs of hope.
The Geneva Initiative promoted by Yossi Beilin and Yasser Abed Rabo is a welcome indication that rational discussion between senior people on both sides is possible.
This plan points to some ways in which the difficult final status issues â such as Jerusalem and the right of return of refugees â might be addressed.
I was pleased to see that the authors were recently in Brussels to brief the European Union's High Representative, Dr Solana.
Other initiatives among civil society representatives are also in train involving academics, political figures and former military and intelligence officers.
This will serve to show that dialogue is possible, even on very difficult and emotional issues.
I am also encouraged by suggestions that the Arab League may move to reiterate its initiative adopted at the Beirut Summit almost two years ago.
This idea, advanced by the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, was that, in return for Israelâs withdrawal to the 1967 boundaries, relations with all Arab neighbours would be normalised.
Normalisation would involve de jure recognition of Israel by the entire membership of the Arab League, the establishment of diplomatic relations, the establishment of trade links and the opening of possibilities for technical and investment exchanges in all sectors.
At the time this proposal received insufficient attention in Israel, but with the roadmap on the table this initiative could prove to be complementary.
It might also serve to reassure Israel as to the wisdom of proceeding towards a peace agreement with its neighbours, Syria and Lebanon.
I would urge the leaders of the Arab League to use the opportunity of their forthcoming summit meeting to advance the prospect of normalisation to Israel once again.
They should emphasise their desire for a comprehensive peace, which can only be of benefit to all the countries of the region.
I would also urge the Israeli leadership to consider carefully the benefits and advantages which they could reap from a normal relationship with their wider neighbourhood and assuming their proper role in their natural economic and political region.
Finally, I should like to assure this House that the search for a peaceful solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict, based on the well-established positions of the European Union, is a priority of the Irish presidency and that we shall make every attempt to take the roadmap forward and to convince the parties to the conflict to make the necessary efforts to achieve a comprehensive and lasting peace for the benefit of all the peoples and States of the region.
Â Â  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it goes without saying that when the subject of the security fence or wall between Israel and the Palestinian autonomous regions is broached, emotions soon run very high on the part of everyone involved.
The European Parliament has on various occasions adopted opinions on this subject â on the political appropriateness of this wall, on its legality, on the new scenario it has created in terms of potential future arrangements on the part of the Israelis, on the hardship that it involves for many Palestinians, and on the illusion of security that the wall creates for Israel.
We have already made our views clear on all these aspects, and I do not wish to cover the same ground again here.
The issue we need to resolve today is where we stand as regards the hearing in the International Court of Justice on the Israeli wall.
I would first like to thank the Irish Presidency for their observations and for clarifying what the EU's position has been, on what occasions and for what reasons.
Let us look at the United Nations General Assembly resolution for which the legal basis was the 'Uniting for Peace' formula.
I in fact believe that from a legal point of view this was not an appropriate legal basis, because the Security Council was indeed in a position to deal with this and in fact did so, and I therefore think that it was right for the EU to abstain in the vote on this, no doubt for legal reasons.
However, the statement issued by the presidency at that time also had a political flavour.
If you will permit me, I shall quote the relevant sentence in English: 'The EU believes that the proposed request for an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice will not help the efforts of the two parties to relaunch a political dialogue and is therefore inappropriate.' So the consequence was that the EU of 15 abstained.
It is my belief that we should not underestimate this issue in this context.
We should take political steps towards reviving talks between the Israelis and Palestinians and reactivating the roadmap, which is moribund, so that we do not completely lose sight of the consequences of this security wall and also the resolution of the main issue.
I can see little point in our having a debate on legal issues here if it runs counter to the ruling of the International Court of Justice.
The ruling of the International Court of Justice is that there can be no trial if a state involved in a dispute before the Court does not accept its jurisdiction.
And Israel has specifically stated that it does not wish to appear before the International Court of Justice with regard to this.
I therefore believe that political initiatives are far more important, and that the only way we can get the security wall removed or even, as a first step, make it easier for people to cross, is for us to really put pressure on everyone involved to assume their responsibilities and to honour the commitments which they have after all entered into in writing.
I support the presidency to the extent that it is holding the line followed by the European Union up to now.
I welcome the fact that the presidency intends to hold intensive talks and that we â although the European Union has unfortunately not so far really played a leading role or a truly pivotal one â will in practice be able to bring our influence to bear on everyone involved in the process, by adopting a balanced stance, a stance whereby both sides will see us as an honest broker.
However, if that is not the case, and if we continue to play a merely ancillary role, I believe that the parties will not have the confidence in us that we need if we are in all honesty to play a role here.
The money that we are making available to the region will not by itself win us influence.
We need to speak with a single political voice and endeavour to make a contribution in that way.
Â Â  Madam President, I have to say that I am not particularly interested in entering into a debate on this wall of shame at the InternationalÂ CourtÂ ofÂ Justice.
Clearly, this barrier is a moral outrage and a political mistake.
I fear, however, we are running the risk of putting up a different kind of barrier.
I feel we are creating a smokescreen by spending our time on this matter instead of exerting the pressure, force and political will required to really push the Israeli-Palestinian peace process forward.
This notorious barrier certainly does hinder the creation of a Palestinian state.
Nevertheless, the existence of the settlements also makes the establishment of a viable state impossible.
Further, the absence of any political will to act appropriately represents a far greater impediment to the creation of such a state.
I would like to take this opportunity to point out that a number of other significant smokescreens are also emerging.
There is, for example, the recent announcement made by the Bush administration that it is preparing a grand plan to restructure the Arab-Islamic world and to bring it under the umbrella of Western security.
Now it seems that extreme right-wingers in the US are referring to a great restructured MiddleÂ East as their main foreign policy priority.
This, they say, will facilitate the ending of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
To be frank, I cannot take seriously a plan claiming to bring about democracy and prosperity from Morocco to Pakistan overnight.
Rather, I think this plan is another attempt to distract public opinion in the run up to the November presidential elections.
This same public opinion has now realised that PresidentÂ Bushâs electoral imperatives take priority over the supposed intentions to advance the Middle East peace process.
Furthermore, this supposed grand plan for the Middle East could make the Israel-Palestinian conflict appear less central.
There seems to be a suggestion that the EuropeanÂ Union be involved in the plan.
It should be remembered that the European Union is a key player in the Barcelona process.
This process will not succeed, at least not fully, until there is an end to the confrontation between Palestinians and Israelis.
The other smokescreen is the one currently being created by PrimeÂ MinisterÂ Sharon.
The latter is forever announcing painful concessions he never implements.
He has proved unable to remove the illegal settlements in the West Bank.
I have in mind the small number of caravans scattered across a few hills on the WestÂ Bank.
He is now saying that the Gaza townships will be abandoned.
I am quite prepared to give Prime Minister Sharon the benefit of the doubt for the time being.
It is to be hoped, however, that this grand plan does not turn out to involve relocating the Gaza settlers in the West Bank enclaves.
The latter constitute the real impediment to the viability of the PalestinianÂ State the Quartet hopes will be established.
Â Â  Madam President, Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza is deeply troubling and I would refer in that context to the shooting and subsequent death of my constituent Tom Hurndall.
But the security threat to Israel is also very serious.
It is fair to ask why, if the only point of the barrier is to stop suicide bombers, the barrier is not on the 'green line'?
Why does it make such incursions into Palestinian territory and create such hardship?
I do at least welcome the announcement two days ago that the barrier will be moved closer to the green line.
I also welcome Prime Minister Sharon's intention to withdraw from the Gaza settlements.
A senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington, Henry Siegman, wrote recently that support for the cause of Palestinian nationhood does not require denial of Jews to live in their own state.
That is precisely my position: two states side by side, with the right of return of Palestinians largely to a state in the West Bank and Gaza.
But it must be a viable state.
Of course the achievement of this does not rest just on Israeli shoulders.
Palestinians have to want peace and avoid terrorism.
It is very difficult to contest Israel's right to make itself secure, when Palestinian leaders seem unable to stop suicide bombers.
There are desperate people, but I am not convinced that desperation is the only basis for suicide bombers â they are also recruited and exploited.
The Palestinian Authority is in crisis, not only because of Israeli hostility â although that is a strong factor â but also because of corruption and criminal lawlessness.
I note that 350 activists resigned in protest last weekend from Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement.
Perhaps this parallels the case taken by Israeli NGOs to the Israeli Supreme Court in protest against the barrier.
The crucial priority is to get back to political negotiations.
I am not convinced that the International Court of Justice case helps, because it diverts from that.
What would help is grassroots democratic pressure, both in Israel and in Palestine.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I would have liked to have said what Mr MenÃ©ndez del Valle said in his analysis but will say something else.
Sister Dominique runs the Casa di Nostra Signora dei Dolori in Abu Dis, a village near Jerusalem, cut in two by the segregation and annexation wall, as it is known by Palestinians and peaceful Israelis, or by a security fence, as it is called by the Israeli authorities.
This is Sister Dominiqueâs message: âOn 11 January the construction of the new separation wall, nine metres high, was begun.
It replaces another much lower wall built in August 2002 which people could climb over when they were no longer permitted to go to Jerusalem.
Thousands of people have climbed over that first wall: children, students, mothers, old people; many have fallen, one person even died.
Two months ago we had to call an ambulance for a 65 year-old man who fell and banged his head.
The ambulance arrived much later.
On the road the army searched the ambulance, made the injured manâs wife get out and on arrival at the hospital it was too late for him.
The things that happen around this wall are intolerable.
For months hundreds of people have passed through our property every day to avoid military controls because they do not have the required permits.
People round about us live in fear of being arrested, beaten and humiliated, as too often happens.
There is constant tension and living conditions are becoming increasingly miserable.
Faced with general apathy we feel isolated and helpless.
We want to speak out on behalf of those people without a voice who every day, for the last two years, have struggled to reach their place of work and their schools or die through lack of medical treatment.
In attempting to carry out our mission, we have also encountered difficulties with soldiers when we have taken people in because the ambulance was forbidden to pass.
The same problem arises when somebody dies: the cemetery is on the other side of the wall.
Even the shops are on the other side.
Many of our patients are alone, their families are no longer able to visit them.
We do not know what will happen when the wall is finished.
The majority of our old people and employees come from the West Bank.
Only three of our eighteen employees have a Jerusalem identity card; for two years they have had to climb over the wall and change their route in order to avoid the checkpoints because, even with a pass, the soldiers would make them turn back.
This nine metre high wall will make it necessary for us to sack most of our staff and refuse to accept old people from the West Bank, in other words those who are the poorest.
We are worried and more isolated than before as a result of the wall and because the surrounding area has been turned into a military zone.
Help us!â
Those are the words of Sister Dominique, but far worse, in fact, is the situation of the inhabitants of Qalqilya who are prevented by the wall even from seeing the sunrise.
The sole exit from the city has an iron gate, for 50 000 people, which the Israeli army opens and closes as it pleases.
At 5 p.m. it is locked and nobody can enter or leave the city after that time.
In addition, what is to be said about the inhabitants of Budrus who have attempted, together with many Israeli pacifists, to use non-violent means to oppose the uprooting of their trees and the destruction of their homes?
They have been brutally beaten by soldiers; one Israeli boy is still in hospital.
The wall and the barriers under construction are, in fact, forcing the Palestinians to live in ghettoes.
It is for security, says Sharon, it is to prevent terrorist activities, not wanting to understand that security cannot be based on the construction of a wall and camps, but on the Palestinians having the possibility of living in freedom in their State in coexistence with the State of Israel.
The wall is not merely a prison: it amounts yet again to the confiscation of land, yet again it amounts to annexation.
It does not follow the 1967 borders but instead penetrates into and divides Palestinian territory.
Meanwhile, the propaganda to have the wall accepted has intensified.
Concerned at the negative reaction of the international community, the Israeli authorities are attempting to make the wall appear less monstrous.
The proposal published in the Israeli daily newspaper , made by the Minister for Foreign Affairsâ team responsible for public relations, stating that, âIf the wall were painted in bright colours it would be more aesthetic reducing the damage to public relationsâ is unfortunately not a joke.
Parliament has condemned the construction of the wall calling for building to be halted.
Walls, as we saw with the Berlin Wall, destroy freedom.
The UN General Assembly has voted for the International Court of Justice in The Hague to deliver an opinion on its legitimacy.
The President of the European Council of Ministers has stated, most inopportunely, that he considers the referral of the matter to the International Court of Justice ill-timed.
Why is it, where the Israeli authorities are concerned, that international law and human rights violations must always be put to one side in the name of negotiations that do not exist, and the Quartet, instead of applying pressure in favour of the roadmap, allow time to pass by and the dying to continue in Palestine and Israel?
This smacks of complicity because this wall is not about security; this wall amounts to territorial annexation, colonial conquest.
The European Union cannot throw international law overboard.
Let us take diplomatic action, relaunch the roadmap, do our utmost to prevent acts that can kill Israeli civilians, but let us also put economic and political pressure on Israel so that Sharon does not take unilateral action and returns to the negotiating table.
As the President-in-Office of the Council said, the international community is heeding and giving its backing to the Geneva initiative, non-violent Palestinian resistance against military occupation, soldiers who refuse to carry out bombardments and be the instruments of repression in the occupied territories, the Palestinian and Israeli parents who have had their loved ones killed by the army, by Israeli settlers or by Palestinian assassins/suicide attackers and who reject the idea of vendetta.
All those things prove that coexistence and security are possible whilst affirming the right of all to live in peace with dignity and justice.
Â Â  MadamÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, we are engaging in a rather curious debate, and I cannot say that I understand all the various standpoints.
We are all in favour of putting international relations on a legal footing.
It is for us to create the international law that we all desire.
That is why I consider the request to the International Court of Justice to produce a report on how it views the reality of this wall to be justified.
We basically want a clear statement about what the wall implies.
One very simple outcome, as I see it â and you do not have to be clairvoyant here â is that the Court could rule that a wall built on the 1967 borders recognised by the UN might not be to our liking, but would be in accordance with international law.
Whether we like it or not, the Israelis are entitled to build a wall on their own territory.
We might well regard it as being wrong politically speaking, but the issue of security is not one that we can just brush aside.
The key factor is that building this wall amounts to annexation.
Under international law it is an extension of the State of Israel, and an illegal extension at that.
It has not been negotiated â force has been used to appropriate part of the land.
That being the case, I believe that it would be appropriate for the International Court of Justice to give its opinion.
I consider that the European Union, which fought, against the Americans for example, for this court to be established â and we have always said that we want international law â was ill-advised to abstain on this.
This is not about opposing Israel.
It is about opposing any state arrogating to itself the right to annex land.
That is the keystone of international law.
It is permissible to exchange land by means of negotiations, but not â and this is also at the heart of the UN Charter â to annex land.
As I see it, the same would apply if an opinion were being sought on the content of the programmes of the Palestinian organisations.
The programmes of Palestinian organisations that do not recognise the State of Israel are also illegal and should be identified as such.
The issue of the PLO Charter is a complicated one.
It would also be possible to determine as a matter of law whether or not it refers to recognition of the State of Israel.
That means that it would also be possible to examine the constitution of groups and parties that defend the Palestinian state and Palestinian autonomy.
The end result would be that it would no longer be possible for one side or the other to claim a right for itself while refusing to recognise the rights of the other side.
That is the key factor in this conflict.
The Palestinians have to recognise Israel and any terrorist attacks in Israel contradict that.
And the Israelis have to recognise the Palestinian State, and this wall amounts to a rejection of the Palestinian State.
That can be legally established.
Â Â  Madam President, last week, the Israeli delegation arranged a meeting concerning the so-called security wall with, among others, MrÂ Peled, the Israeli foreign ministryâs spokesman.
He related a short anecdote about an American who, in a Moscow zoo, had, to his great surprise, seen a cage containing a wolf together with a lamb.
It emerged that a new lamb was taken into the cage for the wolf every day.
MrÂ Peled then compared Israel with the lamb and the Palestinians with the wolf, which, from my point of view, was certainly a case of turning matters on their head, because, to my knowledge, it is Israel that has occupied the West Bank and Gaza, that has nuclear weapons and one of the strongest armies in the world and that is backed by the United States.
Nonetheless, this is very typical of Israelisâ self-image and behaviour.
If the world does not put the strongest pressure conceivable upon Israel to tear down this completely disastrous wall, whatever the decision arrived at by the International Court, there will never be peace in the Middle East.
At the same time, Sharon needs to know that he cannot replace the roadmap for peace with his own unilateral delineation of frontiers.
I was, in actual fact, pleased to hear that Sharon wanted to remove the settlements in Gaza, until the moment it became clear that he only wanted to move them to the West Bank and that this was a stage in his now wanting to abandon the roadmap for peace and, in point of fact, to begin acting unilaterally.
That is, of course, completely unacceptable.
The settlements both on the West Bank and in Gaza are illegal and the biggest obstacles of all to peace.
The allies went to war to force Saddam Hussein to comply with the UN resolutions.
When has the international community contemplated forcing Sharon to do the same, with his being given a deadline for when all of Israelâs illegal settlements in the occupied territories must be removed?
Once that has been done, Israel will, if appropriate, be able to build a protective wall along the Green Line, but, by then, that will be unnecessary because the Palestinian Authority will have been provided with the basis for effectively putting a stop itself to all the suicide bombings.
Â Â  Madam President, MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council, MrsÂ SandbÃŠk stated that she wanted to knock down the wall.
This is an old story: there is a Europe â that of Mrs SandbÃŠk â which 60 years ago, for substantially the same reasons, wanted to knock down the Maginot Line.
Reference has been made to the Berlin Wall.
That infamous wall was constructed and supported by those who today want to knock down the Israeli wall.
That is what is happening, have no doubt, even if this evening, MrÂ Cohn-Bendit, you have said some reasonable things.
It is such a rare occurrence that I will not waste time â yours and mine â responding to your remarks.
I repeat: my compliments for saying something reasonable!
MrÂ Roche, the thing which interests me most at the moment is a news item that continues to elude us: our fellow MEP, or better, the Spanish Minister for Foreign Affairs, MrsÂ de Palacio Vallelersundi, will in the next few hours submit to the Presidency of the Council of the European Union a proposal, discussed again yesterday in Toledo, made specifically by or put forward by Shimon Perez, with the full and total support of the Minister for Palestinian Affairs, Nabil Shaâath.
I would ask her to take note of it because only and the have done so.
It is the news item of today: the Minister for Palestinian Affairs gives his backing to the procedure for Israelâs accession to the European Union so that the Palestinian State may do likewise when it becomes a reality, in the context of a federation of both States, and not that shameful ragbag of a nation State that we are offering the Palestinians in 3004: a small sovereign State, crafted out of lies, thieves, corrupt and violent individuals.
I hope, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that you listen to MrsÂ de Palacio Vallelersundiâs proposal: the proposals that we have been making in this chamber for the last 20 years â to change the historical context â and the proposals yet to be written, roadmap or no roadmap, are a waste of time, suicidal and not worthy of being proposed.
Consequently, I hope the argument that Israel must become a member of the European Union, supported by a large number of Members, is pursued with the utmost conviction because that is a contribution we can make in response to the events of 1939 in Europe and also in favour of the Palestinians, on whom you want to bestow instead a Middle East that is fascist, Nazi, communist and undemocratic.
Â Â  Mr President, the Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon claims that the construction of his country's controversial wall is to protect its citizens from terrorist attacks.
I abhor terrorism and would support the right of any government to take appropriate measures to defend the lives of its citizens.
However, the strategy of building this wall is morally wrong, as well as being counter-productive.
Like many of Mr Sharon's other counter-terrorist strategies, this fails to tackle the root causes of terrorism.
Palestinian land has been confiscated to build the barrier; thousands of Palestinian farmers and traders are cut off from their land and means of economic survival.
If the wall is completed, it is estimated that approximately 380Â 000 Palestinians will be trapped between the wall and Israel's 1967 pre-occupation border, the so-called 'green line'.
Furthermore, 160Â 000 of these would be trapped in 'double walled' ghettos or enclaves.
Palestinian communities would be effectively isolated from one another.
They would also be cut off, in certain instances, from centres such as Jerusalem, which have been the focus of their economic, social and religious life.
Recent proposed modifications will not prevent this.
Furthermore, the restrictions on the freedom of movement of goods and services will intensify the problems for an already weakened Palestinian economy.
The consequences of this ill-conceived security strategy on the part of the Israeli Government will provide a fertile breeding ground for creating another generation of terrorists rather than effectively tackling the problem.
The issue of the legality of the wall has now moved centre stage.
The refusal of Israel to comply with the resolution adopted at the October General Assembly of the United Nations to stop and reverse the construction of the wall led to the General Assembly decision of 8 December to refer the matter to the International Court of Justice.
Israel should pause and reflect on the consequences of its actions.
The wall violates the Fourth Geneva Convention, specifically in the two areas of prohibition of the use of collective punishment and prohibition of annexation, which cannot be abrogated by invoking military necessity.
It also violates the Oslo Agreement in respect of the obligation to preserve the territorial integrity of the Occupied Palestinian Territories and the prohibition against restricting freedom of movement.
When one also considers the continued refusal by Israel to comply with UN resolutions, it begs the question: 'where does Israel think it is going?'.
Does it want to be a pariah state, regarded in the same light as rogue states that are in constant defiance of their international obligations?
Or instead, will it work with the international community to create peace in the Middle East?
With progress on the so-called roadmap slow or virtually non-existent, one has to question the merit of imposing such a controversial measure on the Palestinian people.
If the Israelis are serious about making real progress in the peace process and putting the 'roadmap' back on track, the building work on the security wall should not only stop, it should be reversed.
The Israelis and the Palestinians should instead be working together to take down barriers and to build confidence between the two communities if an agreed settlement is ever to be reached.
The recent declaration by Sharon that he plans to dismantle most of the 21 Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip is a step in the right direction.
However, building yet more security walls and crippling the already impoverished Palestinian economy serves only to make it more difficult to achieve peace in the Middle East.
Â Â  Madam President, I have great respect for the President-in-Office, but today he has been forced to demonstrate very dramatically to us just how incapable the European Union is of adopting a clear position on one of the most important issues of the day.
We did not even have a subdued voice â we had no voice at all.
What did we do?
We abstained on a highly important issue where legality is very much at stake.
Because it is not â and I totally agree with MrÂ Cohn-Bendit on this â as if we are talking about a wall running along a clearly defined border. That is something you can either support or oppose.
But you, MrÂ President-in-Office, have said yourself that the wall has been built deep into Palestinian territory, and the European Union has said the same.
Just when it comes to such a step, to an annexation of this kind, and when consideration is being given to whether such border fortification can be the subject of a legal judgment, we simply say âsorry, we do not have a view, each state can do whatever it likesâ.
So what is the point of working towards a Common Foreign and Security Policy if when it comes to the most important questions we just say that we do not have a view?
That is the slogan, the motto if you like, of the Common Foreign and Security Policy on this issue.
I think it is shameful.
We are not talking about condemning Israel in a one-sided way.
Once again, I totally agree with MrÂ Cohn-Bendit: anyone who condemns and criticises this wall should equally not only condemn any kind of terrorist activity, but also endeavour to combat it.
We will not, however, achieve anything by adopting a position like this.
By taking the position of actually not saying anything at all on this important question, we alienate the Palestinians, but that does not mean that in return we will win over the Israelis, because although Israel has of course brought pressure to bear for us not to adopt a position on this, that does not mean that they will involve us more closely in the peace process.
And I find it sad that Europe's foreign ministers and Heads of State have not recognised that and grasped the implications.
You were left with no alternative today but to present the situation to us as you have, MrÂ Roche.
I have two further questions for you, for the presidency that is.
The first question relates to MrÂ Sharon's plans to remove the majority â not all so far, but the majority â of settlements in the Gaza Strip.
What does that really mean?
Removing the settlements â excellent, well done Mr Sharon, I hear you say.
But does it mean that other areas, particularly in the West Bank and in East Jerusalem, will be extended?
My question to you, MrÂ President-in-Office, is this: has the European Union at least adopted a clear position on this?
Support for clearing settlements from these areas is fine, but we should in no way be offering our support or agreement if it means that other areas in the West Bank are to be annexed.
My second question for you relates to the Americans' big talk about a new Middle East plan in the widest sense of the term.
Joschka Fischer expressed his opinion on this at the NATO security conference in Munich.
Does the European Union know anything about this plan?
Does the European Union have anything to say about this plan, and does it also include concrete measures to tackle the heart of the problem â Israel and Palestine?
It would be interesting if the European Union and the Council could say something about that.
Â Â  â Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, fear is a bad counsellor.
I can understand Israelâs desire to protect itself, but the wall is inappropriate in this case.
A UN report last September condemned the wall as illegal and charged Israel with unlawful annexation.
You, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, are of the opinion that the hearings and decisions of the International Court of Justice will disturb the peace process.
I do not share this view.
Like Mr Cohn-Bendit, I believe it would be useful to verify to what extent international law is being violated here, and that we should not make an exception for Israel, nor, in this context, for Palestine when it makes mistakes.
At present, we are talking about approximately 21Â 000 people who live in the area between the wall and Israel and who are being cut off from social amenities, schools and jobs.
This will lead to renewed hatred and a new generation of refugees.
How do you explain â I am a member of the Palestine delegation â to a group of people in Qalqilya, which was once known as the West Bankâs fruit basket and which is located near a small loophole in the wall, that everything is being closed off on three sides?
That they are being cut off from two major water sources and from all the farms that should provide for the area?
The town, with 40Â 000 inhabitants, is accessible via one single Israeli checkpoint.
As I see it, something of this nature should be brought before the court.
I share the view of all those who have said that the conflict between Israel and Palestine should be solved, but tolerating a wall and waiting until the conflict is over is not the right way to go about it.
Â Â  Madam President, it is a matter of great regret that the European Council has not supported the examination of the Israeli wall at the International Court of Justice.
This is a hugely wasted opportunity.
Opposition to a hearing at the ICJ, because it is a legal â not a political â forum, misses the point.
The ICJ is probably the last available instrument of pressure on Tel Aviv, and we should be grasping it with both hands.
Those people who say that instead we should be relying on European pressure on Israel should tell me when European pressure alone on Israel has ever yielded any results â it has not.
Yet, when there is an international multilateral forum that exists to address this issue, we turn our backs upon it.
Palestinians rightly point to the inconsistency of our position of urging them to give up violence, while simultaneously denying them the chance to seek redress through international legal institutions.
A Palestinian negotiator observed that the US, the UK and Germany asked the Palestinians not to have recourse to violence, but when the Palestinians have recourse to diplomacy the door is slammed on them.
Moreover, there are compelling humanitarian reasons to act.
I visited the Occupied Territories last month and saw for myself how the wall is destroying thousands of acres of farmland and trees, demolishing homes and shops and leaving thousands of families landless, jobless, hungry and hopeless.
As a result, according to studies by the World Bank and the UN, the Palestinian people have been reduced to the poverty and malnutrition levels of sub-Saharan Africa.
The Israeli claim that this is something to do with security is completely undermined by the fact that the wall does not follow the 1967 'green line'.
Instead, as people have said, it cuts deep into Palestinian land.
This wall is intolerable, illegal and immoral, and by failing to support the ICJ as a forum to consider it, the Council has been reckless and irresponsible.
The Council has also not been transparent, and I would like a copy of the letter that contains the presidency's submission to the ICJ to be made widely available.
Â Â  â Madam President, I should like to make one thing clear in this debate: without Palestineâs reign of terror, an Israeli security barrier would not be under construction.
It is to the German Foreign Ministerâs credit that he recently sanctioned this last-ditch measure.
There is no doubt that opinions on the precise course of this division vary, even in Israel itself; hence the present hearings before the Israeli Supreme Court.
I should also like to make it clear that the general interests of the Palestinian population on the West Bank should not suffer unnecessarily as a result of the extremely contentious security barrier.
The UN General Assembly is not, however, serving their interests by asking the International Court of Justice to intervene in such a basic political issue as this dividing line between the Israelis and the Palestinians.
This only prejudices the pressing need for the resumption of the political dialogue between the parties involved.
In short, I endorse in this context the position adopted by my country, the Netherlands, and that of the European Union, which is one of rejection.
Moreover, with regard to the legal proceedings that have been brought before the International Court of Justice, Palestineâs special observer status â in other words, that of the Palestinian Authority â is extremely odd, and amounts to a clear case of discrimination against the Jewish State.
These lopsided relations have the opposite effect politically speaking.
This is just as much a failing of the European Parliament, as next week, the Palestine Prime Minister will be visiting the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, whereas the Israeli Prime Minister will not.
In the Israeli-Palestine conflict, we should adhere to the tried and tested principle that both sides should be heard.
Â Â  â Madam President, in this hearing at the International Court of Justice about the Israeli security wall the question seems to us to be very badly put and therefore likely to be very badly resolved.
This barrier is in fact only a subsection of a much wider plan called disengagement, which is only an adjunct to an even wider process, which is the roadmap for peace talks.
All the interconnections between these different levels are very complex.
It would therefore be inappropriate to want to judge a small subsection separately without attempting to consider the role it plays in the whole process.
Especially if we are wanting to look at it from a strictly legal angle when it is a component of the whole of a peace process that is obviously political in nature.
That is why those European countries that were against taking the problem before the International Court of Justice on the grounds that it would hamper the peace efforts were perfectly right.
We must not look at this problem through the small end of the telescope because that would risk calling into question a peace process that everyone would want to support.
Finally, we must make the distinction between the principle of the security barrier and the line it takes.
I believe I have detected some confusion about that in this debate.
Just as the line of the barrier can be a matter for negotiation and, like any matter for negotiation, subject to change, so its principle is a matter of the sovereign right of a state â and, moreover, a state whose survival is constantly threatened â to ensure the safety of its citizens.
Â Â  Madam President, I wish to take a rather personal line in this debate, because I believe that, whatever we say in this House, it may be perceived as offensive on all sides.
We can make speeches here in the European Parliament that are best suited to satisfying our own electorates at home in Great Britain or France or, as in my own case, in Sweden.
As the European Union and as the European Parliament, what contribution are we prepared to make to the Middle East issue, to a peaceful future there and to coexistence between Israelis and Palestinians?
Two and a half years ago, I visited Nicosia and saw how that city was divided.
As a 25Â year-old, I travelled to Belfast and saw how that city too is divided, with, in more recent times, barricades and barriers now having been built to separate Unionists and Republicans, the two population groups.
In Ceuta, which is situated in North Africa but belongs to Spain, there is barbed wire to separate this Spanish city of Ceuta from Morocco.
The United States has built a barrier between itself and Mexico.
An electric fence is almost complete between Zimbabwe and Botswana.
Am I saying this in order in some way to excuse what is happening in the Middle East?
No, not at all but, rather, to show that similar situations exist in many other places.
In the year 2000 and with UN approval, Israel constructed a security fence between itself and Lebanon, involving electronic and other surveillance using sensors.
This was applauded by the European Union and Russia and seen as a clever way for Israel unilaterally to withdraw its troops from Lebanese land in the year 2000.
I would hope and believe that the wall and the barrier that have been built are interim solutions or measures.
I would hope and believe that these are not permanent fixtures, and I would hope and believe that it will be possible for the peace talks to begin again.
I wish to think well of both sides.
The fact that the Israeli public pressed for the construction of this wall has to do, of course, with the large number of suicide attacks suffered by the Israeli public.
One hundred and twenty suicide bombers have caused almost 900 deaths and getting on for 6Â 000 injured Israelis.
As good Europeans, and as good Swedes, let us try to see this issue from both sides.
Let us hope that we achieve a peaceful solution in the Middle East.
Â Â  MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council, listening to speeches by many Members, it is clear that the reaction is almost unanimous and that we all believe that the Council letter, in which the Council suggests to the Court of Justice that a decision on the case of the wall in Palestinian territory be considered inappropriate, is particularly serious and inopportune.
Well, in any parliamentary democracy, faced with such a vast and firm opinion of Parliament, a government resigns.
Although the concept of resigning is not provided for in the European institutions, I would ask the Council to take into consideration the opinion given in this House, which is not denouncing the wall because it causes a hazard and slows down the peace process, but is denouncing the wall as such.
This wall, MrÂ PresidentÂ âÂ as you well know and as many Members have stressedÂ âÂ is primarily a dividing wall because it does not follow the 1967 green line but it enters into Palestinian territory, dividing the Palestinian community, pupils from schools, children from parents, farmers from fields, ill people from doctors.
This is a wall that takes territory away from the Palestinian community: it goes up to 25km within the West Bank; the first section, of 150km, has already been constructed and has shut out 50Â 000 Palestinians from their territory.
When it is completed, that figure will be 130Â 000.
These figures, MrÂ President, were not made up by this Parliament but they were provided for us by the Israeli civil society and by Israeli non-governmental organisations, which remind us that 670Â 000 Palestinians risk being seriously affected by the construction of this wall and that 14% of Palestinian territory will be taken away from the Palestinian Authority.
Faced with this reality, we believe that it is the wall itself that provokes anger, desperation and hatred.
It is our duty to recognise this, MrÂ President, and we should not be surprised if this anger, desperation and hatredÂ âÂ God forbidÂ âÂ turns into violence.
The day when we find ourselves counting the victims and the figures of such violence, we should also remember how much we contributed to the desperation, hatred and anger of these people.
Â Â  â Mr President, I believe we can only be pleased that the European Union is abstaining for once and being cautious in the kind of diplomatic jihad against Israel, positions having been so biased and often unjust in the past.
Mr President, I too would like to see the security barrier come down and, once some of these elements have been repainted, see it end up as souvenirs and trinkets, just like other barriers.
Let it disappear then, yes, but when it has no more reason to be there â for it is not there on a whim.
This barrier is a response, a response to kamikaze terrorism.
Having said that, once again, even if it is justified from the point of view of defence, there are things about it that can be challenged, that is true.
But nothing is final, it is not a border, it does not signify an annexation.
Mr Cohn-Bendit, you like talking about the 1967 borders, but may I remind you that they were only ever cease-fire lines and they only began to be recognised when they were no longer effective.
Everything out there is really provisional.
Do not forget that.
Of course I want the barrier to disappear, but unlike some barriers which kill, it is a barrier that saves.
You have to remember the attacks that have not taken place, if I can put it that way.
Think of the innocent people who would have been killed by the kamikaze attacks that these controls have thwarted.
The real question about this barrier, Mr President, is this: should we stop it preventing deaths?
I think not.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the international protest against the anti-terrorist, or dividing, wall is starting to bear fruit.
It appears that Israel will be shortening the wall, or partition, so that it does not cut as much into Palestinian territory.
In that way, Mr Sharon is trying to turn the international tide that is opposed to his policy, but he will try to use the dismantling of the colonies in Gaza as compensation for the colonies within the wall on the West Bank.
In that way, he can retain the largest settlements there after all and abandon the problematic Gaza Strip.
He will thus once again foster goodwill in Washington and can quietly carry on with the annexation of the Palestinian territory, even though he thereby undermines the roadmap and makes his own plan the only viable one.
He does not recognise the Green Line. This is unacceptable to the United Nations and, as Kofi Annan stated in November, this is very counterproductive for peace.
Europe, too, should find this unacceptable, and I regret the Councilâs attitude.
A viable Palestinian state needs the agricultural land and the water sources, which are now being closed off.
We must therefore maintain our international protest against the wall.
Besides, Israel has the right to look for protection against terrorism behind the Green Line, but a new iron curtain will provide no answers in the long run.
Where I come from, anyone who builds a wall has to build it on their own land; if not, the neighbour will call in the justice of the peace.
This will shortly also happen in The Hague, where the International Court of Justice will rule on this wallâs legitimacy.
Mr Sharon is now trying to create a smoke screen to mislead the world and make people forget the Geneva peace initiative.
The question is now whether the International Court of Justice can act as justice of the peace in this case.
In any event, the problem has now attracted much attention worldwide, and international pressure is being brought to bear â even in Israel, where the Supreme Court is now looking into the case.
I hope that they will take the right decision.
Â Â  .
Mr President, once again, it has been valuable for the Council to hear the views expressed in today's discussion concerning the wall, as well as the situation in the Middle East more widely.
Many of the points made correspond with the position of the Council, which I sought to summarise earlier.
It must be clear from my previous statement that the Irish presidency will strongly hold to the view that the current situation is unacceptable.
Members of this House know that I come from a small island where we know something about divides and walls and separation.
We will continue actively to explore with all parties the possibility of resuming forward movement â even if through modest steps at the outset â in a process that has repeatedly stalled.
I want to refer to a number of the points made during the course of the debate.
As for the wider approach to the Middle East region, the effort to promote peace, progress and prosperity should in the first place have strong local ownership on the part of those in the region.
Also, it must have an appropriately strong focus on resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
After all, the continuation of the conflict is a central security reality for many people who live in the region.
The renewed EU focus on the wider region would not bypass or set aside the benefits of existing mechanisms, including the Barcelona process.
Mr Swoboda suggested that the European Union's voice was not being heard on the illegality of the wall.
Let me reiterate where the Union stands in relation to the extension of the wall.
It cannot accept that a fence or wall built on Palestinian land would best serve Israel's long-term security, nor did anything I have said suggest that this would be the case.
The European Council has expressed its concern about the route envisaged for the security fence and the departure of the route from the green line in the West Bank.
The appropriation of land in the West Bank or Gaza is illegal, it is contrary to international law and it fuels tension.
Furthermore, the restrictions associated with the security fence have resulted in unnecessary suffering for the Palestinian people and the deterioration of the economy of the Occupied Territories.
The Union's voice on this has been absolutely clear in all international fora.
The construction of the fence, or the wall, was also the subject of a United Nations General Assembly resolution on 21 October, which all EU Member States and the accession states co-sponsored.
Another speaker, Mrs Lucas, called on the presidency to publish the submission to the International Court of Justice.
She may not be aware, but the rules of procedure of the ICJ specifically preclude our making the submission publicly available.
Indeed, the Court of Justice itself will not be publishing statements received, for the very same reason.
Foreign Minister Brian Cowen, speaking recently in the Irish Senate, pointed out that the Israeli people need not live in a fortress, surrounded by hostile neighbours, where they are in danger when walking the streets or driving on the roads; where young soldiers â mere boys or girls â are placed at constant risk; and where a great part of their national resources are consumed by the burden of defence.
Equally, the people of Palestine need not live in hopelessness and indignity; where young people are encouraged to blow themselves up; where homes are bulldozed and destroyed; where employment is scarce or non-existent; where people are not free to travel around their country; where immigration seems to offer the only escape route.
We must all help the people of Israel and of Palestine to find the courage and wisdom to build a new peace; the courage to face down those who would reject compromise; the wisdom to understand that putting an end to the insecurity and suffering of their neighbours is in their own long-term interest.
We can achieve this, and if we do achieve this, the Holy Land may become a land of peace and prosperity.
Once again, I thank all Members for their constructive support and concern in this matter.
I believe that the approach adopted by the Council is an appropriate approach.
No Member of this House need have any concern or doubt as to the interest of this presidency in helping to resolve this issue.
I come from a small island where we know something of the causes and costs of division.
Â Â  â We are obliged to the Council.
The debate is closed.
Â Â  â The next item on the agenda is the statement by the Commission on corporate governance and financial supervision in the Parmalat case.
Commissioner Bolkestein, speaking for the Commission, has the floor.
Â Â  . The Commission welcomes this debate and broadly supports the content of various draft resolutions tabled by Parliament.
Whilst the facts are not yet fully clear, the Parmalat case is deeply worrying.
It is the latest in a growing list of major financial scandals of various types â in various places â over the last few years.
The apparent size of this fraud is staggering, and the apparent complicity of a number of people from distinguished, liberal professions together with the failures of regulatory control are equally staggering.
Scandal upon scandal will cumulatively weaken financial markets like the corrosive drip of a leaking fuel tank.
Many sensible investors will pull out.
Economic growth will be affected because the cost of capital will rise â the Enron affair has already shown that.
So this matters to all of us.
My first point is this: the financial services industry had better get its act together, and do so quickly.
We need some real industry leadership to stand up and take charge, to clear out the crooks, expose their unscrupulous practices and curb excessive greed.
If industry leaders are not prepared to do this, then regulators will have to do much more than perhaps they or we would like.
If that is the result, then industry leaders cannot winge about regulation from Brussels.
They will have brought it upon themselves.
Industry leadership is lacking at the moment, quite frankly.
Secondly â we already have a range of policies in hand which will go some way to improving matters in the future: measures in the Financial Services Action Plan â such as the Market Abuse and Prospectus Directives â which should be rapidly implemented; measures such as the new Investment Services Directive, which will help deal with some of the major conflicts of interest in the investment services business; the new international accounting rules which will enhance disclosure, along with the Transparency Directive â which we want adopted before this Parliament breaks for its elections.
All these directives also enhance the powers of competent authorities to act and also to cooperate much more across borders.
In my view, that means cooperating as well, in the same way, with foreign regulators â non-European regulators â in particular the SEC in Washington and also the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board in the United States.
Capital markets today â as we all know â are global and regulatory cooperation must be global too to match them.
Thirdly, in March I shall propose to my colleagues in the Commission a revised Company Law Directive on the statutory audit function.
It will strengthen controls over the audit profession in the European Union with independent oversight; strengthened inspection; stronger ethical and educational principles and high quality audit standards.
These four aspects will be contained in the revised Company Law Directive.
As a result of Parmalat, the revision of the eighth Company Law Directive is likely also to include the following four elements: first, full group auditor responsibility for consolidated accounts of a group of companies; second, obligatory independent audit committees for listed companies â all 7Â 000 of them in Europe; thirdly, stricter auditor rotation requirements; and fourthly, strengthened sanctions.
I am accelerating work in three other areas in the Corporate Governance or Company Law areas in order to have proposals ready, if possible, later this year.
They are the following three areas: the role of non-executive directors; directors' responsibility for company accounts; full disclosure in the company accounts of offshore special purpose vehicles, including the reason why the company uses those offshore structures and a much stricter verification by the group auditor of their content.
We are also working hard on the issues of conflicts of interest of financial analysts and looking again at credit rating agencies.
The Katiforis report is of considerable help in that regard.
Finally, the role and regulatory control of offshore centres need to be tightened.
We are considering the options, although that is not easy.
We expect to table in June the third Money Laundering Directive and we expect it to play a significant role.
To conclude, this is a very important debate.
We support the main lines of this resolution.
We are working, resolutely, in that sense.
We still wish for strong industry leadership and an appropriate dose of ethics.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner Bolkestein, the Parmalataffair is a systemic crisis because it was made possible by a world network of complicity and omissions, the key players of which were banks, financial institutions and external and internal control bodies, both public and private.
I believe that the Parmalat affair gives a good indication of the negative aspects of the globalisation of financial markets, the internationalisation of which allows fraudsters to easily conceal and manipulate information.
This shows how a necessary combination of transparency, efficiency and stability is all too often theoretical and, above all, fragile when faced with perverse desires rooted in a lack of ethics.
I am sorry to say that the Parmalataffair is similar to far too many financial scandals that have been portrayed in the news recently: and for a start.
It is unpleasant and difficult to have to admit it, but something in the world balance has gone wrong and has dragged everything into the abyss, including uninformed savers and operators, who were supposed to be on the alert and prevent this from happening.
We do not want to deal with individual responsibilities, nor should we have to, because this is not our job; our job is instead to undertake to prevent similar cases from happening again.
It is essential to combat infringements and fraud in such a way that financial analysts will not then find themselves in a situation where they have to advise their own clients to make criminal investments.
Amongst other things, we have also looked over the Commission communication of May 2003 to the Council and to Parliament on modernisation of company law.
In the motion for a resolution that we are presenting there are guidelines, which take into account the impact that the Parmalataffair has had and could have on its workers, savers, banks and the good operation of the financial system.
It is our task to try to reverse this course, to try to protect the savings of millions of people and to regain the full trust of financial market investors.
It is essential that we learn from this case and react in an appropriate way by objectively assessing what happened, by making projections in future and by not just hastily looking for scapegoats.
This is about establishing what did not work, what the inefficiencies of the provisions are, about proposing solutions to them, and providing for new public control powers.
We can have different political ideas on the aims of the regulation, on the production and distribution of income, but we must all agree on the fact that there must be no defrauding.
Perhaps the crisis of legality is not just an issue of people but also of institutions, which are, perhaps, unsatisfactory.
Perhaps the rules need to be looked at, re-thought and reviewed, and to do this we need to cooperate.
The competent authorities for financial control of the different jurisdictions within the Union must cooperate.
Cooperation is also called for with third countries; not just Europe but also the United States are part of this plan which is of primary importance.
I also urge the Commission to monitor any new measure which concerns the role of rating agencies.
I will take the liberty of again asking the Commission to incorporate into the action plan on corporate governance measures designed to prevent conflicts of interests, whether they be those concerning investments made by banks or other financial institutions in listed companies controlled by internal stakeholders or, rather, those concerning cases of financial analysts who work for investment banks and advise their clients to invest in companies which are provided with profitable services by their bank.
Furthermore, we need to make shareholders more responsible and more involved.
Guaranteeing optimum transparency before and after transactions is absolutely necessary for investors in the field of financial instruments.
It is, therefore, desirable that a European authority is created toÂ âÂ impartiallyÂ âÂ examine European financial markets and to look into cases with cross-border implications, along the same lines as the recent modernisation of European competition policy.
Furthermore, I call on the Commission to adopt a decision, as soon as possible, on the compatibility of Italian Government provisions with European provisions as regards the dairy sector in relation to the Parmalatcase.
Companies in this sector, the historic contributors to the Parmalatgroup have for some time been in a state of extremely serious financial liquidity, which could lead to a crisis for the whole company.
If the request for help were to be deemed counter to the rules on free competition, it would be the beginning of the end for a sector that boasts tradition and is of undisputed quality at European level.
The Parmalatcase calls for a great sense of responsibility, above all at our level, at European level.
There are three areas where we must act.
I believe that we have drawn up a well-founded report and that the next Parliament will certainly be able to engage in better cooperation with the Commission.
Â Â  MrÂ President, our group appreciates both the speed with which the Commission has intervened on this particularly regrettable issueÂ âÂ especially for the Italian economyÂ âÂ and the sense of responsibility with which the Commissioner illustrated his proposals, which are urgent if the figures that we have to examine are genuine.
EURÂ 15 billion represents a financial hole equivalent to 15% of the entire European Union budget.
This is also the result of economic deregulation and of financial cynicism whichÂ âÂ as MrÂ Fiori mentionedÂ âÂ many are guilty of.
For example, major banks that betrayed the trust of their investors; international advisors, who often knowingly certified false accounts; monitoring bodies, which failed to monitor; andÂ âÂ if I may mention this, CommissionerÂ âÂ those governments that tolerate tax havens are also guilty.
Many of these tax havens are controlled by Member States of the European Union.
I will quote a few Italian statistics: 25 Italian companies control 400 off-shore companies; of these, 171 are based in Delaware, a small State in the United States of America, and 127 in Luxembourg, the nerve centre of the European Union.
So then, what are we doing here in Europe?
I would like to propose, on behalf of MrÂ Imbeni too, an initiative to restrict banking secrecy.
Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stieglitz mentions how the use of banking secrecy is often one of the factors of economic instability, and the European Union is always appropriately preaching transparency.
I do not, however, want us to bow down to any such idols.
We could propose that the international community finally bring a moral dimension to globalisation and, therefore, propose a global agreement on banking secrecy, to which we commit ourselves, by seeking to propose a âKyoto for banksâÂ âÂ if you will allow me to use the metaphorÂ âÂ in the interests of a âfinancial ecologyâ and to finally bring some ethics into the global economy.
Commissioner Bolkestein, you have realisedÂ âÂ and you stated thisÂ âÂ that the national control instruments are not sufficient: we urgently need global and supranational rules.
We need to govern the financial markets and avoid conflicts of interest and perverse plots between banks and businesses.
The European Union must swiftly look again at Community regulations, strengthen sanctions against fraud, intervene against the impunity of tax havens and lay down rules for the absolute independence of auditors.
Such an urgent and sensitive issue perhaps warrants greater attention from usÂ âÂ from Parliament and the Community institutionsÂ âÂ and not a simple communication.
We are not proposing a Committee of Inquiry but perhaps an investigation promoted by the Conference of PresidentsÂ âÂ and therefore with the authoritativeness of a Conference of Presidentsâ initiativeÂ âÂ an investigation that is entrusted, in an informal and voluntary way, to a group of MEPs and that can continue beyond the end of this parliamentary term.
Its function would be to investigate and put forward a proposal in order to understand what happened, how it could have happened and what needs to be done so that it does not happen again, to avoid future events similar to that of Parmalat.
Finally, MrÂ President, Commissioner Bolkestein, there are references in the Commission communication to shareholders, to the management, to relations between shareholders and the management, whilst there is little or no talk of the workers, who are the first to pay personally for the repercussions of tragic events such as that of Parmalat.
We want a strong voice to come out of this Chamber to protect, guarantee and support the thousands of workersÂ âÂ from Parma to SicilyÂ âÂ direct employees and those in allied industries, who today risk losing their jobs and salary.
I believe that an ethical dimension to the economy, which we were referring to a short while ago by recalling how much responsibility also lies with governments and the European Union, now implies continuing to consider protecting and guaranteeing the right to work as a key problem.
Â Â  MrÂ President, firstly, I want to thank Commissioner Bolkestein very much for his very clear, and clearly worded, speech.
He could not have put matters better, for what we want to see are industrial leadership and ethical conduct â quite simply, proper behaviour.
I am therefore very pleased with what we have heard from the Commission.
I also wish to say thank you for the action plan for corporate governance and company law.
This had already been presented last year, and it is of course splendid that the Commission was, in this way, ahead of its time.
It is also encouraging to hear about all the initiatives discussed by Commissioner Bolkestein today.
There is a need for that action plan, and there is a need for the Commission to put more resources into implementing it.
Not only the Commission, but also Parliament and the Council must contribute resources, however.
The unfortunate fact is that, on average, six to eight years elapse between a proposalâs being put forward by the Commission and its being implemented in all the Member States.
A great many financial scandals can arise during that period of time, but, in its action plan, the Commission is repeatedly alert to issues of timing.
Good corporate governance is open, transparent corporate governance.
Part of this is, of course, good accounting.
Another important factor is that of board membersâ collective responsibility for financial, and important non-financial, decisions.
Moreover, there must be better rules for scrutinising the various group structures we find among companies.
Certain companies are constructed in such a way as to cause observers to feel that they have been placed in the middle of a labyrinth, with no red thread to facilitate movement backwards or forwards.
Such arrangements are untenable.
One thing we must not forget about is having a correct balance.
It is no use repeatedly heaping rule upon rule and assuming that rules solve everything.
The culture surrounding corporate governance is important.
If the managing director is a scoundrel with criminal intent, rules do not help.
It is no use putting unnecessary obstacles in the way of all the many honest companies.
It is therefore important that what we agree upon is balanced and of help to everyone.
Furthermore, investors must insist upon good corporate governance.
The best means of implementing everything we are now discussing is, in spite of everything, the market.
Pressure from investors is often the best incentive for sticking to the straight and narrow.
All in all, then, we are on the right road.
We just need to move up a gear and travel a little more quickly towards our destination.
Â Â  Mr President, the Parmalat financial scandal is a direct result of the monetarisation of the economy.
This monetarisation is clearly excessive because the production and trade that meet the peopleâs material needs are drowned in the speculative waters of international high finance.
Meanwhile the informal economy flourishes, along with the criminalisation of the economy, in which shady dealing becomes increasingly prominent, to the detriment of social and economic development.
This scandal is a further example of the pernicious effects of market deregulation and the unbridled movement of capital.
Parmalat made use of every trick in the book: front organisations in tax havens, the benefits of special offshore regulations, hedge funds and forged documents and bills.
This is how financial holes were concealed and tracks were covered, using complex structures and involving many subsidiaries, in order to carry out operations in the area of bonds and financial derivatives, with the assistance of international banks, cover-ups on the part of international auditing firms and rating agencies giving positive assessments.
Thousands of jobs were put at risk, in the thirty-plus countries in which Parmalat operated, creating enormous difficulties for the thousands of milk producers who depended on the company.
This is no isolated case, however.
In the past few years alone, a number of financial scandals have taken place â Enron, WorldCom and Merck, in the United States; CrÃ©dit Lyonnais, Vivendi, Ahold, Kirch, Marconi and Equitable Life in EU Member States â which have had a devastating social and economic impact.
Since this is a question of economic models, what is needed is greater stringency and tighter controls on financial derivatives, replacing mechanisms that are a product of, and whose raison dâÃªtre is, speculation.
International efforts need to be stepped up to put an end to tax havens and to limit offshore operations.
Financial instruments are needed to monitor the movement of capital, such as introducing effective taxation of stock market profits.
What is most urgently required, however, is a return to the core values of production and labour.
However considerable the problems of shareholders are â and they undoubtedly are serious â priority must be given to protecting jobs and to safeguarding workersâ rights and to ensuring their right to information, consultation and participation.
In the case of Parmalat, compensation should be immediately considered for those milk producers affected.
I should like to highlight the negative contribution of the EU in terms of monetarisation, and, specifically, the Financial Services Action Plan, which encourages the deregulation, liberalisation and integration of capital markets together with the dismantling of prudential rules and control mechanisms.
It worries me, Commissioner, that you say that hasty and poorly thought through legislation may exacerbate, rather than solve, problems of regulation illustrated by large-scale cases, such as Enron and Parmalat.
In spite of your ideological concerns and your reluctance to take risks, we cannot ignore the evidence staring us in the face, or the urgent need to address these problems effectively.
