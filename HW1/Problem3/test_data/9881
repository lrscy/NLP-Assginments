It will be the new Parliament that will decide but, if we do not place the new Parliament in the position to decide, it will not be possible to make payments at the beginning of 2007.
We have worked on this, Mr Fiori, because I can assure you of one thing: we never attempt to perform tasks that are not useful or are unnecessary.
This has involved an enormous amount of work and perhaps we would willingly have avoided it had it not been for the benefit of the Union.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the EU faces major challenges and we must decide whether â and how â we, as a Community, will respond to these challenges.
The objectives set jointly by the Member States are indeed very ambitious.
By 2010, the EU is to become the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world; it is to become an area of freedom, security and justice.
Europe is determined to take on more responsibility in the world, and we are about to embark on the historic reunification of the continent and the integration of the new EU Member States.
The financial perspective establishes an important framework for decisions on the policies and tools that we will deploy to shape the future together.
In order to achieve the ambitious objectives we have set ourselves and ensure that the Union can fulfil the growing expectations of its Member States and citizens, appropriate resources must be provided to underpin the policies.
We should not raise expectations and then fail to deliver on the policies.
That would generate disappointment among citizens.
However, we should only provide European funding from the public purse for policies if we can state with confidence â as the President of the Commission has already said â that we are creating added value â in other words, if we can achieve greater benefit by spending a euro at European level than by spending it at national level.
At the same time, Europe must continue to uphold budgetary discipline. Budgetary discipline means the own resources ceiling, which is set at 1.24%.
The Commission has decided to present a proposal which not only respects this own resources ceiling but also allows sufficient scope below this ceiling based on the average over the period.
However, the Commission has also clearly stated that the proposal by the six Member States to impose a budget cap at 1% not only conflicts with the objectives but quite simply does not stand up to a reality check.
The Commission is proposing an average level of appropriations for commitments of 1.22% for the period 2007 â 2013.
If we also include expenditure for the European Development Fund and the sound new instrument of the Solidarity Fund, the appropriations for commitments stand at 1.26%.
Commitments for payments will thus average 1.14% of combined economic performance, or GNI, over the period.
That means that the budget volume that we are proposing can be set at an average of 1.14% of GNI.
Let me comment on the length of the financial perspective, as this is quite rightly a very important issue for this House.
The Commission completely agrees that for democratic and institutional reasons, five years would be the right length of time.
The question is simply this: at which point in time is it most appropriate to commence this cycle?
We have discussed this matter in considerable detail. On the one hand, given that we have set agricultural spending up to 2013, and since the integration of the new Member States into new programmes is no small matter, and especially also in light of the Structural Funds, and taking account of the question when it is best to start the cycle from an institutional perspective, we are proposing a seven-year period again this time round as a transitional phase, as it were, before commencing the five-year cycle thereafter.
I would emphasise, yet again, the following points concerning the comparison of figures: this Commission is serious about the proposal to integrate the European Development Fund into the budget.
It has been stated repeatedly in the past that this would be desirable.
The measure outlined in our proposal therefore fulfils a demand that this Parliament has quite rightly been voicing for years, for we need an integrated and effective policy for the ACP states, especially for the poorest countries in the world.
That is why we have put forward this proposal.
On flexibility, which has been mentioned several times here today: yes, we will need flexibility if we are planning so many years ahead.
That is why the Commission has said that a revision is always a possible option.
However, we are also planning new flexibility instruments between the categories in order to be able to adjust priorities in the short term.
We are also proposing a Growth Adjustment Fund â in other words, a reserve which can be activated additionally if a policy needs to be enhanced for quite specific reasons.
Let me also emphasise yet again that the Commission is proposing the full integration of the new Member States into the structural and cohesion policies.
As you are aware, we have based our calculations on a European Union of 27 Member States.
Throughout this legislative term, which is now drawing to a close, this House, the European Parliament, has argued robustly and with great success in favour of enlargement.
At the same time, it has championed the cause of deepening and European integration.
In other words, it has always been in favour of more Europe and an efficient Europe.
In doing so, you have consistently upheld budgetary discipline and have been successful here as well.
At the end of this legislative term, you can stand before Europeâs citizens and say, with your hand on your heart, that you have done the very best you could with the European budget and genuinely created a great deal of value-added in Europe out of just 2.3% of total public spending.
These comments are directed to the Council Presidency in particular.
You are now working â and I hope this work will be successful â to ensure the adoption of the new constitution.
A key issue here is to equip the European Parliament with more budgetary rights, especially codecision rights in respect of the financial perspective.
In my view, the financial perspective must have the endorsement of the European Parliament.
Let me take this opportunity to address Mr Colom i Naval.
I am at a loss to know how the deliberations on the financial perspective can take place without your powerful commitment and your powerful voice.
I wish you every success in your new position.
Your region is very fortunate in having secured your services in this key post.
I would like to close by citing an Irish writer, because we have the Irish Presidency at the moment and also, of course, as a tribute to the President of this Parliament.
Oscar Wilde once said that we know the cost of everything and the value of nothing.
I think that in the coming months, we will have very intensive arguments over spending.
However, the key issue is not only expenditure, but also Community policy and the values of the European Union, and I am sure that this House will play a very active and committed role in this debate.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  â Before negotiating the financial perspective for 2007-2013, it is important to have a clear idea of the political backdrop to this issue.
In this respect, todayâs debate is an opportunity for the Commission, as is often the case, to try to win the support of the European Parliament for a relatively high level of annual resources, of 1.24% of gross national income (and that is without the European Development Fund), against the position of the contributing Member States, including France, which would like 1% (as in 2004).
This alliance between Parliament and the Commission is an implicit reference to the idea of a gradual expansion of the Unionâs remit, which is intended to lead one day to a federal budget.
I might add that in parallel the Commission is launching a campaign for a European tax.
We must avoid any drift in this direction, so as not to sustain a new bureaucracy and not to compromise the competitiveness objectives that were set in Lisbon.
The European Union, which is at the service of the Member States, should not be cornering their tasks, in particular that of redistribution.
It should simply provide the added value that comes from coordination, which only requires slim administrations and limited resources.
It should live from the contributions that the nation states vote for and control on an annual basis.
Under these conditions, the position currently held by the paying Member States seems to us to be entirely justified.
Â Â  . This debate on the new Financial Perspective shows that there is an enormous gap between promises and reality.
What we are seeing is, unfortunately, a repeat of Agenda 2000, when what we really needed was to increase funds, bearing in mind the growing needs in terms of social and economic cohesion resulting from enlargement, and to promote sustainable development, high quality jobs, improved social conditions and cooperation and development policies with the least-developed countries.
What is happening shows the disgraceful nature of the âGroup of Sixâsâ blackmail in placing a ceiling in the Community budget of 1% of GNP, which would lead to what we feel is an unacceptable solution.
This has also been shown with the Commissionâs unacceptable proposal, which does not meet the needs of the acceding countries, growing social inequality, appalling unemployment or the poverty and exclusion that can be seen in current EU countries, such as Portugal.
Yet the question is not exclusively about finance.
Of equal importance are the priorities and revision of the objectives and of the instruments of cohesion and budget structure to which they correspond.
The guiding principle of competitiveness, strategic realignment based on the Lisbon Agenda, the realignment of foreign policy towards actions within the scope of the Common Foreign and Security Policy and the European Spatial Development Perspective, and of internal policy based on questions of immigration policing and border controls, encompass areas that lead European integration down a dangerous path.
Â Â  The next item is Question Time, but we will begin with a point of order from Mr Dupuis, who may address the House briefly.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, strange forces are at work in the management of our questions.
In December I asked a question on Croatia.
It was held over from the January part-session until this part-session.
I thought in good faith that it had been held over because MrÂ Verheugen was to have been with us at this session and other Members had also asked questions about Croatiaâs accession.
Nothing of the sort!
Furthermore, not only do I find that my question is at the end of the list and not at the beginning, which would have been logical given that it was withdrawn in January, but also I know that it will not be possible to receive an oral answer.
And of course I have not been able to ask another question for February.
I would like the services to take careful note of this fact and for it to be reflected in the Minutes of this sitting, because I really do not think that this is as it should be.
There are some very dubious goings-on surrounding Croatiaâs accession process.
Some countries are blocking it and I will name them: they are the United Kingdom and the Netherlands.
We urgently need a debate to clarify all of this.
Â Â  Mr Dupuis, the Commission decides which Commissioners attend Question Time and determines the distribution of questions; in any event, we note what you are saying and will pass on your concerns to the Commission.
The next item on the agenda is Question Time (B5-0007/2004).
We will begin with questions to the Commission.
Â Â  . As a result of the liberalisation of air transport in the European Union at the beginning of the 1990s â which was in fact based on legislative proposals from the Commission â we can see the extent to which competition has increased between the various airlines in the European Union and how users are benefiting from lower prices and better supply.
In this context, a new phenomenon has appeared: that of the so-called low-cost airlines.
The Commission considers this to be a positive development: it increases supply for passengers, results in greater economic activity and possibilities for consumers, and offers opportunities for lower costs.
The Commissionâs action seeks to ensure that this development continues through the strict application of the rules on competition and State aid.
To this end, I must point out that our task is not to support one sector or another, but to provide balanced standards that allow for the development of the various types of aviation activities: the traditional companies with their style of business, and the new companies, described as low-cost companies, which have a somewhat different market and which have undoubtedly generated a significant increase in competition, supply and opportunities for users.
Â Â  I would like to thank the Commissioner for her reply and ask a question arising from it.
In light of the recent investigation by the Commission into the arrangements of Ryanair at Charleroi Airport, is it not now the case that regional airports in Europe are unsure how state aid rules are going to apply in the future and that this in itself is going to impinge on legitimate commercial decisions they would like to take, as well as on their future development?
Â Â  . I believe that, on the contrary, the Commissionâs solution and response in the case of Ryanair in Charleroi â which relates to the State aid given by Charleroi airport rather than to Ryanair, and that is the problem â opens up new possibilities for the promotion and development of regional airports, which are a driving force for regional development, and for the operation of the so-called âbudget airlinesâ from those airports.
I believe that the decision taken by the Commission is balanced.
It has given the green light to most of the aid received by Ryanair throughout this time.
Though it is true that limits have been imposed, in terms of time and above all in terms of the availability of this aid for any other company which is willing to carry out this type of activity, for the sake of equal treatment of all airlines operating in Europe and of transparency in these types of operation.
I repeat, however, that I believe the decision on Charleroi favours regional airports and budget airlines.
We must remember that in the case of Charleroi we have not acted on our own initiative, because the Commission had received complaints and because, as the honourable Member knows, the Commission is obliged to deal with them.
In fact, there have been complaints in relation to other airports in various countries of Europe.
We will deal with them in the coming months, when all the facts of each case are clarified.
I believe that we are thereby helping to clarify the situation, because there are a series of other regional airports which, thanks to the response in the case of Charleroi, are going to be able to provide airlines with similar conditions, which allow them to expand and carry out their activities.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it has emerged that railway companies are now competing with the cheap tickets offered by the airlines.
How do you intend to proceed with regard to the state aid that is currently being paid to the railways?
Will restrictions on the options apply here as well?
In Austria, for example, 7% of the budget is spent on the railways. That amounts to around EUR 500 per citizen in subsidies to the railways, which are now competing directly with the privately-owned low-cost airlines.
This means that there is unfair competition between the cheap tickets offered by the airlines and those offered by the railways.
I would be very pleased if you took similar action against the railways.
Â Â  . I would like to remind the honourable Member that we have not yet liberalised passenger transport in the rail sector.
In each country, therefore, railways operate as the country sees fit and they receive the aid which each country is prepared to give them, in accordance with the criteria of public service and maintenance of companies, amongst others.
It is therefore currently possible that budget airlines are competing with railways, but the latter are receiving State support in practically every country.
At a later date, following a discussion on the third railways package, which I hope the honourable Members will shortly receive for discussion, and which I hope the next Parliament and the next Commission can complete, we plan to introduce competition into passenger rail transport on international lines, not on national lines.
When that time comes, we will have to consider the effects this will have in terms of competition, but â I repeat â the aid we have authorised is limited in terms of time and quantity.
In no event may it exceed a maximum of 50%, of operating costs and, furthermore, they must be decreasing for a maximum of five years.
I believe that this is a balanced decision, which allows us to combine support for a regional airport, which â I repeat â provides stimulus and economic activity for a region.
In the case of Wallonia â an Objective 1 region which is lagging behind the Community average â that is what justifies the support for aid, not whether or not there are cheap tickets.
The fact that an airline offers people cheap tickets does not justify their receiving public aid.
The justification for the authorisation of public aid at a particular time, and for Charleroi giving it to Ryanair, is the fact that Charleroi is a regional airport in a depressed region, in order to provide that region with stimulus and activity, which is completely different, and as assistance for launching new routes and new connections.
We have also agreed on the possibility of granting aid in the air sector when the criterion of public service is fulfilled. For example, in the case of the outermost islands and island groups, on grounds of internal public service.
In this case too, conditions relating to transparency, competition and equal treatment must be fulfilled.
Â Â  . Mr President, the Commission has already taken measures to inform citizens about the transitional arrangements relating to the free movement of workers.
An electronic guide on the subject of the free movement of workers to the new Member States is already operating and can be found on the Commission's website in 20 languages.
At the same time, a printed leaflet will soon be available in all the languages.
As far as the Member States are concerned, we must make it clear that the Treaty makes provision during the first two years after accession for access to job markets to be the subject of bilateral agreements or national decisions by the Member States.
Again according to the Treaty, the Member States are not obliged to tell the Commission what they intend to do during this stage.
Of course, for reasons of transparency, the Commission has asked the Member States to notify their position and I should like to inform you that, so far, the United Kingdom and Ireland have stated that they intend to open the job markets fully, while Austria, Germany, Belgium, Finland and Denmark have stated that they will apply national measures for the first two years.
Austria and Germany have also stated that they intend to cite the saving clause in order to limit access to certain service sectors listed in the Treaty.
In all events, when we have all the information from all the Member States, we shall notify Parliament.
In addition, the Commission is in regular contact and cooperation with the services of the Member States, so that we can guarantee the uniform application of these transitional arrangements and can also proceed to issue certain interpretative guidelines which have to date been the subject of cooperation and consultation with the Member States.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner, for that answer.
Your colleague, Commissioner Vitorino, has also answered this question very comprehensively and skilfully in the past, arguing that the wild numbers predicted for Portugal when it joined the European Union were way off the mark.
We are now witnessing the same phenomenon with predictions for movement of labour from the accession countries.
My point is that I would not ask the Commission to give out information which it has no legal requirement to provide.
I am glad of the cooperation between the Commission and Member States.
But there is real confusion.
The noble aim of enlargement has led to confusion among people on the ground â European citizens â who are now anxious about the extreme predictions of the numbers of people who will come.
I do not agree with these extreme predictions, but the Commission has a role to play in giving out sensible information about what we can expect and what it will mean for free movement and, indeed, for benefits regimes â although this is a matter for Member States.
That is not coming through collectively.
On a more positive note, I would ask about movement the other way â people from existing Member States who, for example, would like to retire in Cyprus or work in Poland.
We are getting enquiries about that positive element of movement.
Will the Commission provide information?
Â Â  . It is easily understandable that in many Member States, particularly those with common borders with the newcomers, public opinion is concerned about the impact on the labour market.
I have said repeatedly that there are many independent studies concerning the flow of immigrants after day one of enlargement, working on the assumption that ten newcomers will join Europe at the same time.
The overall conclusion of these analyses is that mobility from the new Member States to the current 15 Member States is likely to remain rather limited.
As for the questions concerning social rights, let me repeat two things.
First, from the moment that a worker is a legal worker in a Member State, he or she has all social rights and access to all kinds of benefits and social security systems.
As far as pension rights are concerned, during the Italian presidency we agreed on a regulation covering the social rights and pension rights of workers not only from the new countries, but also from third countries.
That regulation provides a concrete answer to the question of pension rights.
Â Â  Following on from that question, Commissioner, I should like to raise the issue of derogation and the issue of regulations that are being unilaterally applied by some countries that have not applied for derogation.
In the case of the UK, it has indicated that it is not going to put any block on the movement of those who wish to come and work in the UK.
Now, however, late in the day, it is talking about a number of regulations of a domestic nature, in relation to our social security and other systems, that will have a discriminatory effect here.
Does the Commission have a view on this approach or is it happy to leave it entirely at the disposal of domestic governments to decide how they will deal with the matter within the first two years?
Â Â  . Mr President, the first two years, in accordance with the Council decision on the management of transitional periods, are a purely national issue.
The European Union cannot intervene, irrespective of whether this is done with national arrangements and legislation or with bilateral agreements between the new countries and the existing Member States.
However, what we need to bear in mind is that any agreements will need to comply with the existing European institutional framework.
Then there can be no question of discrimination, because one country wants to have different arrangements from another.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in recent weeks, Slovakia has set income tax and corporation tax at a flat rate of 19%.
As a result, many firms in Austria are now planning to open plants in Slovakia, which means that they will of course be employing their workforce in Slovakia as well.
Does the Commission have any studies indicating how many workers from the current European Union are likely to migrate to these attractive tax regions as industry is relocated?
Will the balance be maintained, or will there even be a clear out-migration of workers from the Member States in the first two years, especially since the opportunity to move from the new Member States to the current EU will only exist thereafter?
Thank you.
Â Â  . Of course there are studies on the movement of companies from the Member States to the new countries, but I would say that the huge wave of company relocations has been completed and today, with the obligation of the new countries to apply European law fully as regards the internal market and the job market, companies do not have the same incentives that they had in the past.
There is, of course, always the problem of low labour costs, but that is something we know, which is why the strategy on employment focuses on the question of investment in human resources and fundamental change in the orientation of jobs in Europe.
Â Â  . The EU drugs strategy 2000-2004 provides a framework for a balanced and integrated approach on all drug-related activities in the European Union.
It has also been endorsed by the new Member States and the candidate countries who have, in the meantime, set up national drug strategies and improved their capacities for taking action against drugs with the support of the Phare Programme.
The Union also has a number of drug action plans involving certain regions either producing or serving as transit countries for drugs, such as Latin America, Central Asia and the Balkans.
Research shows that a link between a particular drug policy line and the drug situation is difficult to establish.
The availability and careful evaluation of relevant and reliable information are undoubtedly key elements in developing an evidence-based drug policy.
The work of the European Monitoring Centre on Drugs and Drug Addiction and the work of Europol in this area form part of the basis for the Commission communication to the Council and the European Parliament on the mid-term evaluation of the EU Action Plan on Drugs.
This mid-term evaluation was a first step in a larger process.
By the end of this year we will have the final evaluation.
Without wanting to pre-empt the results of the final evaluation, the following developments on the EU drugs market can already be observed.
Heroin seizures have increased since 2001.
Our assessment is that street prices are generally stable or even decreasing.
The number of heroin addicts seems to be relatively stable in the European Union, although there are marked differences between the Member States.
Cannabis remains the most widely-used illicit drug and its use is still increasing in many Member States.
The use of synthetic drugs such as ecstasy and the use of cocaine seem to be increasing in certain population groups, although the use of these drugs among the general population remains low.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner, for a helpful and very informative reply.
I do not think any blame for the problem lies with you because you do not have many battalions at your disposal!
You can only set a lead.
The price of heroin going down would suggest that the supply of heroin is increasing.
We know that the crop in Afghanistan is getting bigger and bigger, and with the use of cannabis and synthetic drugs ever growing, clearly we are not winning the battle.
So my question is: how can we strengthen policing in Europe in the fight against the use and the distribution of drugs?
Â Â  . Thank you for recognising that to a certain extent I am like the Pope: I have no legions at all!
Indeed you are right, Mr Newton Dunn, the main responsibility in this area lies with the Member States.
But there is a lot we can do, both in internal policy and external policy.
When it comes to internal policy, one has to recognise that for years now Europol has been playing a very important coordinating role in detecting the main transit routes.
When we have detected the transit routes, we try to cooperate with such countries in order to prevent the entry into the European Union of those drugs.
We have made some progress in the Balkan region thanks to cooperation with the countries in the area.
Thanks to the support of the Cards Programme, we have been developing specific law enforcement capabilities in those countries to fight against drug trafficking.
I am less positive in my assessment as regards Afghanistan.
The figures I have at my disposal demonstrate that the poppies are growing and increasing, and it is quite clear that in Afghanistan the political situation is not stable enough to guarantee close cooperation as far as law enforcement is concerned in order to tackle the issue of drugs trafficking.
I believe this issue â and I know my colleague Commissioner Patten shares this view â will be at the top of the agenda in our negotiations with the Afghan authorities in the near future.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I wish to address a number of subjects I think are related to the drugs issue.
One concerns the Lisbon Strategy.
How does the Commissioner view increased drug use and increased drug misuse in the EU in the light of the fact that, by 2010, the EU is supposed to have the strongest economy in the world, with the highest growth and an ecologically sustainable economy?
Is it, as it were, good for the labour market that ever more people are giving themselves over to drug misuse?
I also wish to put a follow-up question concerning the projected European Corps of Border Guards.
What would be its role when it comes to seizing drugs?
Â Â  . Thank you for raising that question.
My answer is very clear: no, it is not good at all.
Firstly, it is not good for people to become addicted to drugs.
The European Monitoring Centre in Lisbon is developing five key indicators that will allow us to have more reliable data, so that we can compare that data among the Member States and establish a clearer link between the policy line of Member States and the impact of that policy line on the pattern of consumption.
These five indicators refer to figures for drugs used among the general population, the problem of drug use connected with infectious diseases, drugs-related deaths and the treatment provided by Member States for those who ask to be treated for drug addiction.
I hope that the work in progress with these five indicators will give us a clearer picture of the situation in Europe.
I would just add that my concern today is, above all, the proliferation in the use of synthetic drugs and the upsurge of a new profile of drug addict: the poly-consumption consumer.
Poly-consumption is a new pattern; it comes from a combination of illicit drugs and licit drugs.
We need more research and more reliable information in order to be able to fight against this new profile that has arisen in the last few years.
Â Â  We shall proceed to the second part of this Question Time, during which Commissioner Barnier will reply.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, MrÂ Alavanos asks an important question on a subject that has, moreover, always been of interest to me because, as he knows, I was minister for the environment in my own country and, as you will see from our proposals for the future cohesion policy that we will be tabling next week, I continue to attach great importance to environmental issues.
His question concerns the operation of treatment plants in Greece.
According to my information, 233 treatment plants have now been constructed in Greece, although 600 would need to be built to meet the needs of all of the Greek municipalities.
Most of the treatment plants that have already been built were completed thanks to Community cofinancing, either from the Cohesion Fund or from the ERDF, under integrated Mediterranean programmes, successive Community support frameworks or Community initiatives.
According to the legislation in force for the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund, the Greek authorities have to declare that these plants are operational when they submit each final report marking the end of the subsidy.
However, this same legislation does not give the Commission the power to check itself, after the closure of the programmes or projects, that the cofinanced infrastructure is being properly used and maintained.
This task, which is very important and which almost, in my opinion, goes without saying, is the responsibility of the Member States.
Nevertheless, there is a provision that I can mention today, ArticleÂ 10 of the Council Directive of 21Â May 1991 concerning urban waste water treatment, that provides that Member States shall ensure, and I quote, that, âthe âŠ treatment plants are âŠ operated and maintained to ensure sufficient performance under all normal local climatic conditionsâ.
ArticleÂ 15(4) of the same directive authorises the Commission to request information on the functioning of all treatment plants that have been built with help from the Structural Funds.
I can tell MrÂ Alavanos that this is what we intend to do.
If anything is amiss then the Commission will take the necessary steps, including possibly initiating an infringement procedure, to ensure that Community legislation is properly applied.
Exceptionally, and in particular if treatment plants have been abandoned, the Commission will consider recovering the funds in accordance with current legislation.
That is the useful and I think precise information that I wanted to give MrÂ Alavanos.
Â Â  Commissioner, I thank you on behalf of my honourable friend, MrÂ Alavanos.
I too am extremely interested in this question.
If I understood correctly, and I should like you to confirm this, so far the Commission has not carried out any inspection based on this article, which gives it the facility to check if these biological purification plants are operational.
Because I should like to repeat what is said in the question, and I know this from my own experience from travelling round Greece, that most biological plants are either not operational or operate defectively or operate from time to time.
This is a very important matter.
Complaints have also been sent to the Commission and reports have been sent to the European Parliament.
When do you intend to conduct these inspections?
You said that you would conduct them.
When do you intend to conduct them?
Â Â  . â The Commissionâs role is to ensure that the Member States â in this case, Greece â meet their obligations.
In addition, I should like to tell you, following on from my first answer, that we have been informed that Greece has recently set up a body of environmental inspectors.
One of this bodyâs tasks should be to inspect all of the plants that you and MrÂ Alavanos mentioned.
In any case, the Commission does not have a mandate to carry out inspections itself for and on behalf of the Member State concerned; subsidiarity applies here, I believe.
Nevertheless, as I mentioned myself in my first answer, we are able, in accordance with the Council Directive concerning urban waste water treatment â we have the authority, if I may say so â to request information on the operation of all treatment plants.
Encouraged by MrÂ Alavanosâs question, I can confirm that I will be doing this in the course of the next few weeks.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, MrÂ FerrÃ¡ndezÂ Lezaunâs question reminds me of the debate that we had recently with MrsÂ WallstrÃ¶m in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy on this major dossier of the Ebro.
The Spanish authorities have requested Community financing from the Cohesion Fund and the Structural Funds for the project to divert water from the River Ebro.
The eligibility dates of the expenditure for the various sub-projects are 29Â December 2003 and 1Â January 2002 respectively.
The Spanish authorities do not therefore need to wait for the Commission to give its decision before starting these projects, given that beginning the work will in no way prejudice the Commissionâs decision on whether to grant Community financing.
In other words, it is one thing to start the project and it is quite another to receive confirmation of Community financing.
If, then, after investigating this project as part of an overall process of reflection on the Ebro â as I said the other day before the Committee on the Environment â the Commission were to decide not to support particular parts of the overall project, the Member State alone would have to bear the cost of the expenditure incurred.
That is my answer to the question.
Â Â  Commissioner, I am sorry to return to this issue which is constantly being repeated, but there is currently enormous confusion in Spain.
The Spanish Government, without going any further, with the famous and recently approved JÃºcar-VinalopÃ³ project, also created a problem in terms of its identity and where the water from the Ebro could not go, within the JÃºcar-VinalopÃ³ project, and I had to ask the Commissioner a question â and I am extremely grateful to her for having replied to me.
In this case, however, we return to the same problem.
You are aware of the serious problems in Spain of a social and, possibly, environmental nature.
What would happen if, once the work is finished, you, without considering economic factors or funds, simply do not comply with European legislation?
What will we do in that case?
Put all the work back to its original state, with all the expense that that would entail?
We would therefore like to ask you whether you believe it makes more sense for the Commission to ask the Spanish Government to suspend any actions relating to the Spanish National Hydrological Plan, in a precautionary fashion, until the Commission has taken a decision?
Â Â  . â MrÂ FerrÃ¡ndezÂ Lezaun, I quite understand your impatience and your concern to have this clarified.
We had a fairly frank and constructive debate on this matter the other day in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and, with MrsÂ WallstrÃ¶mâs agreement, I gave a fairly resolute answer.
In my own view, even though, administratively, several different funding sources are involved, indeed several different programmes â regional programmes in Andalusia, Valencia and Murcia, as well as the Cohesion Fund, which are varied instruments that may all contribute in one way or another to funding the project to divert water from the River Ebro â this is one single project and its strategic importance is such as to warrant being examined as a whole by the Commission.
This is, I think, a clear answer and is along the lines that you wanted.
Once again, we are going to consider any request as part of a comprehensive analysis of the project.
I said just now that there was nothing to stop the Spanish authorities from starting work on various parts of the project if they so wished.
These parts of the project will have to be carried out in accordance with the environmental legislation.
We will check that they are, as this is very important.
The Commission also needs to issue a favourable assessment of the Ebro project if Community funding is to be authorised.
By starting the work very early, the Spanish authorities are taking the responsibility for any appeals to the Court of Justice for, for example, not respecting current legislation on the environment.
There is also a risk that, since the Commission will be making its overall assessment of the Ebro project after work has started, the expected funding may not materialise.
Legally, that is as much as I can say.
I would simply add that the answer that I gave about the overall assessment that we want to make of the project, which is one single project even though it comprises several parts, is, I think, what you wanted to hear.
Â Â  I would like to thank the Commissioner in particular for the clarity with which he has replied, just as he did at the meeting of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy in response to a similar question from Mr FerrÃ¡ndez.
I hope that, following this second reply, Mr FerrÃ¡ndez will be fully aware of how things are proceeding here â of what the Commission and the Spanish Government are really doing: in other words, it should be made very clear that the Spanish Government is not doing anything illegal by beginning work at certain points of what will be the Ebro diversion.
I am particularly grateful to the Commissioner for his clarity because ideas are sometimes communicated which lead to confusion amongst the Spanish citizens and I hope that all the doubts which Mr FerrÃ¡ndez is constantly raising have finally been cleared up.
Â Â  I would remind the honourable Members that they take the floor especially to put questions.
Since 15 seconds remain, you may ask a question if you wish, Mrs AvilÃ©s.
Â Â  We would like MrÂ Barnier to tell us how long it will take the Commission finally to respond to this demand, which is of genuine concern to the Spanish people, and in AragÃ³n in particular.
Â Â  . â I do not wish to commit myself by giving you an answer and running the risk of being contradicted later on.
We should actually be aware that this project is complex and that, as is only proper, we need to examine it from the point of view of Community legislation on the environment, from the point of view of the rules and, finally, from the point of view of this rather original analysis that we wish to conduct of the entire project. I think the Spanish authorities have finally understood our approach, whereas at the beginning it was more a question of gaining approval on a project-by-project basis.
We want to produce an overall assessment of all of the information that is available to us, in particular of the effectiveness of the project and its cost to consumers.
Ideally, we would like to be ready to issue this assessment during the course of the summer, at the end of this six-month period.
We have carried out preliminary studies, internal consultations and economic analyses.
The Commissionâs assessment will cover all of the technical projects themselves but will also include the economic analysis that will be made of them.
This is, after all, a major ecological project and we are therefore going to proceed responsibly, which should enable us to issue our overall assessment of the Ebro water transfer project during the course of the summer.
Â Â  The mistake proposed by this Parliament was made very clear to me at the meeting on the 16th, with Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m and yourself.
Before moving on to the specific subject of Mr FerrÃ¡ndezâs question and your reply, I will say that I am from Valencia, on the banks of the JÃºcar River, which today is dying as a result of there not having been a rigorous environmental impact study.
We all know that work of this magnitude is irreversible once it is built.
Therefore, the socio-economic effects and the destruction and deterioration of the environment would be less harmful if today this Parliament were to send a note to the Spanish Government telling it to suspend the project as a precaution until it is examined by this Parliament.
Â Â  . â We obviously need much more time to debate this subject, which is of great importance to the European Parliament and Members of all political hues.
Mrs Bergaz Conesa, in the two cases that I mentioned just now and that were the subject of the question that I was asked, the Commission does not have the right to order a preventive suspension of the work.
I am obliged to tell you this.
We have gone quite a long way already in stating that, given the extent of this project and all of the ecological, socioeconomic and technical questions that it raises, we have decided to carry out an overall assessment.
Pending the results of this, some of the work can start.
It will not be finished by June or July.
Be that as it may, during the course of the summer the Commission will say: we think that this project is realistic and feasible or that it presents risks or problems.
On this basis decisions will be made, in particular on whether to commit the European funding that has been requested.
That is all that I can say today and I should like to thank you for your views and comments.
Â Â  . Mr President, I am grateful to you for allowing me to reply to MrÂ VallvÃ©, as this question is also important.
Like MrÂ VallvÃ©, the Commission believes that cross-border cooperation is a key element to European integration.
Furthermore, in a different context, namely that of the Convention on the Future of EuropeÂ âÂ in which I took partÂ âÂ I have repeatedly proposed that the draft Constitution should provide a sound constitutional platform for cooperation of this kind.
In any event, if we are to achieve the harmonious and balanced integration of the entire EU, we must support cooperation, especially cross-border cooperation.
This is precisely what we are doing with the InterregÂ III Community initiative, which contains a Strand A specifically dedicated to strengthening cross-border cooperation.
I am also completely aware of the difficulties that authorities at Member State, regional and local level have experienced in putting in place Interreg cross-border cooperation projects.
These difficulties have mainly to do with the need for partners on either side of a border to respect both national rights and the administrative rules and procedures of their own country.
I say this, Mr President, with some degree of experience, as I spent seventeen years as the president of a border region in France, where I was in charge of a large number of projects that encountered the very types of difficulty that I have just mentioned, in my specific case with our counterparts in the Valle d'Aosta in Italy.
We must therefore provide a stable and shared solution to this problem.
The Commission has called for a study to catalogue the problems faced by the authorities in charge of these programmes, with some suggestions as to how these problems may be solved.
The results of this study will be made public in the spring, giving the Commission time to propose appropriate legislative measures in the framework of the future regulation applicable to the coming Structural Funds programming period.
This legislative proposal will, I believe, be presented in June.
The Members of your House will be aware that the Commission is to adopt next week, on 18 February, the third report on economic and social cohesion, which I shall be presenting to this House.
The report will contain proposals for a reformed and strengthened cohesion policy after 2006.
The creation of a legal framework for cross-border cooperation, which Mr VallvÃ© so fervently wishes to see, must form part of the proposals that the Commission will support in its third report on cohesion.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, I shall reply in your language.
I should like to thank you for your intervention and to say that I hope that we shall have the opportunity to hear you when you present your report on cohesion, which will not only be about social and economic cohesion, but will now, for the first time, also encompass territorial cohesion.
I also believe that territorial cohesion will not be possible without a genuine instrument to strengthen cross-border cooperation.
It is clear that the cities and the regions, or in Franceâs case the , have had difficulty in setting up cross-border cooperation programmes, given the differences in legislation that exist between the countries concerned.
I therefore feel that it is at European level that we have to design an instrument that makes such cooperation both possible and, hopefully, easy.
We await a legislative proposal in this regard, which will contribute towards reinforcing the links between the different countries, in order to dismantle what remains of these borders, described by Robert Schuman as scars of Europeâs history.
Â Â  . Mr VallvÃ©, rather than asking me a question, you gave me encouragement.
You will not have long to wait, since, as I said, I shall be presenting the report on cohesion next Wednesday with Mrs Diamantopoulou and Mr Fischler.
I also hope that we will be in a position to do this right here or in Brussels during an enlarged Conference of Presidents, but I am not sure of this yet.
What I can tell you, MrÂ VallvÃ©, is that in this report we move in the direction that you wish.
I will be going into precise detail, as I have done in the report on cohesion; having worked a great deal with my services and the legal services of the Commission, and having enjoyed your support, I hope that in the legislative programme setting out the regulations for future cohesion policy, I will be able to fulfil your wishes by proposing what may be a kind of cross-border authority.
These are the directions in which we are moving.
Â Â  In fact, Mr Barnier was right to say that there was no explicit question; I thought it could be understood as a question, but in any event a bit of help never does any harm.
That is why this dialogue is always positive.
Mr Ortuondo Larrea has a supplementary question.
Â Â  Commissioner, as you will be aware, there is a priority project, one of those approved at the Essen Council, on the trans-European networks, relating to the high-speed South-Europe rail connection, and one branch of this project is intended to link the French city of Dax with Vitoria: Dax in the region of Aquitaine and Vitoria in the Autonomous Community of the Basque Country.
Both the region of Aquitaine and the Autonomous Community of the Basque Country wish to promote this project and face difficulties in terms of understanding and application on the part of the respective central governments of the French and Spanish States.
These two regions wish to move it ahead and I am trying to ensure that within the European Union this cross-border cooperation can be accepted.
I would therefore ask you the following specific question: is this instrument, which you have told us we may possibly have after the summer, going to relate just to European regional policy funds or can it also be extended to European funds for trans-European transport networks and any other type of actions with Community resources?
Â Â  . Firstly, Mr Larrea, regional funds and structural funds have been used to finance transport networks.
Cohesion funds, and possibly funds from ERDF ObjectiveÂ 1, have intervened, are currently intervening and will continue to intervene on certain strategic sections to finance transport networks of various types, and in particular cross-border transport networks.
I am broadly in favour and moving in the direction that you wish.
It strikes me that this new instrument on which we are working may serve to mobilise and make use of European funds, and even if European funds are lacking, I shall admit to you that my dream would be that we might propose the status of cross-border territorial authority, which would be created and which would have access to local, national or regional funds.
It goes without saying that, even though such a status would be feasible without European funds, it would be even more so with them.
I need a little more time, but I should like to make an announcement in this regard next week, probably in the cohesion report.
I shall moreover spend a little more time on the legislative instrument, although I shall bear your suggestion in mind.
Â Â  Thank you very much for your cooperation, Mr Barnier.
In accordance with the Rules of Procedure, Questions Nos 41 to 44 will be replied to in writing(1).
We will begin with the 20 minutes for Mr Liikanen.
Â Â  . Civil society participated in the World Summit on the Information Society preparatory process and in the summit itself, according to the rules of procedure.
This is largely the result of the European Union's efforts during the preparatory committees.
Moreover, the summit's executive secretariat set up a civil society bureau organising 23 families in order to facilitate the participation of various civil society constituencies.
It even held formal meetings with civil society representatives in Geneva on various occasions.
It has allowed a broad convergence on key themes such as human rights, freedom of access to and communication of information, media or gender issues.
I personally participated in a number of those.
Civil society adopted a declaration on the Information Society, which is available on the official summit website.
Although the Commission has received rather positive feedback, some civil society representatives could estimate that their views have not been fully taken into account in the final documents adopted by the summit.
Even if the proposals of civil society were not fully taken on board in the final documents, the Commission is convinced that they have played an influential role.
As was also pointed out by the Conference of Non-governmental Organisations in consultative relations with the United Nations, some common language is emerging between governments and civil society representatives, paving the way for a better understanding and cooperation in the future.
Nevertheless, we must remember that the World Summit on the Information Society remains an intergovernmental process under United Nations rules, benefiting from the United Nations' legitimacy and United Nations principles of representation.
In its upcoming communication to the Council and Parliament, the Commission intends to propose to convey to the summit's executive secretariat a clear message in favour of a stronger role for civil society and to relay that position in its participation in the conference bureau as well as in its contributions.
Â Â  â Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his very detailed response.
Although I gather that he very much appreciates the input of non-governmental organisations, I notice in my dealings with those organisations that there is still some doubt as to their actual influence.
I note what the Commissioner is now stating in this connection.
The preparations for the 2005 Tunis Summit are fully underway.
I should like to invite the Commissioner to continue his dialogue with the non-governmental organisations.
As the Commissioner is aware, we in the European Parliament have a meeting planned with a number of organisations as early as the beginning of March.
He has been invited to this but is, unfortunately, unable to attend in person.
I should like to invite his Cabinet, or members of his Cabinet, or of his staff, to attend this meeting, which will be held in this House on 1 March.
Â Â  I would remind the honourable Members that speaking time is for asking questions, not for making statements.
Mr Harbour has a supplementary question.
Â Â  I would like to ask the Commissioner a supplementary question as an MEP who actually attended the summit in Geneva and was therefore able to see the extensive engagement on the floor of the conference by members of civil society, which I thought was very helpful.
I would also welcome an invitation to Mr Staes' meeting.
Although I went to the summit, I was entirely unaware of his interest, so maybe we could get together later.
One of the points I made when we had a debate on this issue, Commissioner, was that I felt that parliamentarians need to be much better engaged in the process.
We only had a small meeting with the interparliamentary union.
Would he work with the European Parliament so that we can get a better engagement, both of European and national parliamentarians, as part of the Tunis agenda and in the run-up to Tunis?
Â Â  . Firstly, I thank Mr Harbour for his active participation in the World Summit and also the participation of the other Members of the European Parliament.
It was very helpful and supportive.
I am ready to look for all possible ways to improve our cooperation in an informal context and also in the preparation for the Tunis Summit in 2005.
I should like to say to Mr Staes that whenever I receive an invitation to the European Parliament I always come, if possible.
Â Â  . Mr President, the Commission shares MrÂ Paasilinnaâs concern that in Europe the number of public sector websites that are currently accessible without difficulty is too limited.
After the eEurope action plan adopted in 2000 the Commission recommended in its communication that all public websites should follow the web content accessibility guidelines developed in the World Wide Web Consortiumâs web accessibility initiative.
Parliament took a positive view of this, as is evident from Bastiaan Belderâs report and the resolution taken on it.
In resolutions by the Council and Parliament the Commission was asked to monitor progress in order to obtain comparable data.
The Commission has followed these recommendations and in the next few weeks will publish a report explaining what has been achieved.
The Member States and the institutions of the EU are revising systems so that they harmonise with the guidelines.
This has mainly been agreed within the context of voluntary eEurope cooperation.
It has nevertheless to be borne in mind that unhindered access to public sector websites will be a long process, as there are a lot of them.
It is also to be hoped that organisations for people with disabilities will be actively involved in this.
When the time came for me to give our instructions I received 26 emails on the same day saying that Commissioner Liikanenâs website did not meet the agreed conditions.
Pressure like this makes it easier to bring about change.
At the same time the Commission will naturally look into whether Community non-discrimination policy law needs to be expanded in the future.
As a result, this spring the Commission is to begin a public hearing on a Green Paper on future strategy to combat discrimination.
The Green Paper will map out the Communityâs progress in practising a non-discrimination policy and raise questions to do with policy development.
They will include addressing the new challenges that enlargement of the Union will bring with it and laying down policy on action to promote equality in the Union for the next five years.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for your reply and I am delighted to hear that so much is going on.
Would the Green Paper also cover the lot of the socially excluded and any programmes or plans for closing the digital divide?
Â Â  . â Mr President, I shall do my best to see to it that this too is given greater prominence when the matter is being dealt with.
Thank you.
Â Â  .
On 13 December, the representatives of the Member States, meeting at Head of State or Government level, decided by common agreement on the seat of certain offices and agencies of the European Union and, in that context, a decision was taken that the 'European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA) shall have its seat in Greece, in a location to be determined by the Greek Government.'
Due to its specific nature, the Commission considers that the agencyâs basic requirements include advanced and highly secure information technology equipment, support and operations, sufficiently protected against hacking and security attacks, of which it will certainly be a target.
This includes the equipment underpinning normal office tasks, as well as the agency's intranet and databases used to store data necessary to the work of the agency, or database-driven applications and networks required for interaction with any national administrations.
Furthermore, making information available both to the general public, as well as to the specialised audiences will require a properly designed, hosted, operated and protected website.
The very recent malicious code attacks have yet again proven the need for increased coordination between Member States to achieve higher levels of security.
The Commission is convinced that the setting-up of ENISA, with its own legal personality, is the most efficient way to achieve this objective.
It favours trust and consequently the direct involvement of industry in its work.
This involvement is seen as crucial to solving the information security problems in Europe.
I am pleased to assure you that the Commission is committed to launching ENISAâs operational activities as soon as possible.
Concerning the honourable Memberâs questions on the composition and participation of the management board, the Commission, in line with its communication of December 2002 on the operating framework for the European regulatory agencies, generally favours a small-scale management board.
I made this clear in a statement during the Council on 20 November 2003.
However, because of the specific tasks assigned to ENISA and the pressing need for its establishment, the Commission has not stood in the way of a first-reading agreement between the legislators.
The Commission has nevertheless pointed out the exceptional nature of the course taken and reaffirms its eagerness to see the general framework applied.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner Liikanen, for an absolutely excellent reply.
Everyone who has followed this matter and has heard the demands we have made of the IT Agency perhaps has difficulty appreciating that those demands related directly to Crete.
We are concerned that the Agency may be ineffective.
Parliament will therefore, of course, apply pressure in this area.
We are totally convinced that the Commission can also help us minimise the negative effects of locating the Agency in Crete, which I do not regard as the ideal location.
The Council is unfortunately defending incomprehensible positions, for example that such decisions should be made without public scrutiny.
To be honest, that is incomprehensible, given the legislation on transparency we have elsewhere.
I shall conclude by putting a question, not because I cannot work out what the Commissioner thinks but because I want a clear answer, which I intend to use in the election campaign in relation to the governments.
Might the IT Agency be more effective with a smaller management or perhaps with a system of rotation?
How important is it that the institutions use tax revenue efficiently and thriftily, and how might we bring this about?
Â Â  MrÂ President, I agree that we should use tax revenue efficiently.
That is the first answer.
The second answer is that the Member States usually want to exert influence upon the day-to-day activities of any strong institution they create.
They all wish to be able to send a representative to the board of management.
I have already expressed my view in this House.
The choice is between adopting a rapid solution during this Parliamentâs and this Commissionâs terms of office or of waiting for a more uncertain future to arrive.
I chose the more rapid solution, because all the current crises concerning network security have shown that we must take prompt measures.
Â Â  We shall take the last question from Commissioner Liikanen.
More than 50 000 people die and 1.7 million are injured every year in the EU in road accidents.
This situation is unacceptable.
Road safety can be improved by building safer vehicles which also operate more safely.
Information technology can be used to achieve that goal.
Can the Commission say what stage has been reached with the e-safety programme and what progress has been made in that programme to improve road safety in Europe?
Â Â  . Let me first welcome the consistent activity of Mrs Hedkvist Petersen on the issue of road safety, including eSafety.
She has a real case here, because the number of road accident fatalities in the current European Union of 15 Member States was about 40Â 000 per year in 2001.
This figure is unacceptably high and, therefore, we have the ambitious target to halve this number by 2010.
A wide range of actions are being taken by the EU and the Member States to make this target a reality, with the result that, according to preliminary data, the number of persons killed on Europeâs roads last year amounted to about 35Â 000 persons.
The Commission has recognised the great potential of the new information and communication technologies in saving lives by mitigating the consequences of accidents or even completely avoiding them.
In September last year the Commission adopted a communication entitled 'Information and Communications Technologies for Safe and Intelligent Vehicles'.
It proposes 11 measures that promote the rapid development and deployment of new active safety systems in Europe.
The work in realising the actions proposed by the Communication is under way.
We have established, together with the industry, Member States, stakeholders and Members of Parliament, the 'eSafety Forum'.
Under the forum seven working groups are active on priority eSafety topics.
The first results are available in the 2003 Summary Report, which is available on our eSafety website.
We would very much welcome the opinion of the European Parliament, as well as a commitment from Member States.
The Commission is also considering mandating the installation in commercial vehicles of electronic systems whose effectiveness has been proven in practice, such as electronic stability systems for buses and heavy goods vehicles.
Furthermore, the Commission is using the Sixth Framework Programme to develop further the technologies for in-vehicle active safety systems.
An integrated project, 'Prevent' â which has over 50 partners and an overall budget of EUR 60 million, with about EUR 30 million of Community funding â is the most important project in this area.
Â Â  Thank you very much, MrÂ Liikanen, for an absolutely excellent and very interesting answer.
We see that a very great deal indeed is happening in this area.
In the future EU, that is to say an EU with 25 Member States, upwards of 50Â 000 people will die each year on our roads.
That is equivalent to a medium-sized Swedish town being wiped out every year.
We cannot go on like this.
We have high hopes of IT technology and the eSafety programme.
It is a very important piece of work that is going on, and it appears to be at an advanced stage.
I also hope that Parliament will express its opinion on the report mentioned by MrÂ Liikanen.
The industry has made great progress, but there are big differences between one EU country and another in terms of IT sophistication.
Applications such as these require installations both in cars and in the environment.
I should like to hear Commissioner Liikanenâs assessment of progress in the various Member States and also in the candidate countries.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the issue addressed by MrsÂ Hedkvist Petersen is a very major one, namely that of our in actual fact needing cooperation between different sectors.
We need not only safe cars, but also different types of infrastructure that operate together.
We have made certain progress in cooperation, for example the common telephone number 112, which makes things easier in the event of road accidents.
It is quite clear that, in this area, we need more pressure from above to organise the cooperation between industry, infrastructure authorities and insurance companies.
We hope that the work on eSafety will be of help, and perhaps we could also get the Member States to devote more attention to this sector.
In our first action programme, eEurope 2002, we had a special approach to e-transport, but it was not, unfortunately, able to create sufficient interest among the Member States.
One positive thing is that, last autumn, we had a big world conference in Madrid with approximately 7Â 000 participants.
The Member States too showed more interest on that occasion.
The Hungarian Government issued invitations to an eSafety Conference in Budapest in May 2004 where we hope for participation not only from IT ministers but also from transport ministers and the authorities responsible for transport infrastructure.
If technology and infrastructure are not coordinated, we shall not be able to obtain any practical results.
Â Â  I also thank the Commissioner and his services for what is an outstanding programme â the eSafety programme.
I have been privileged to participate in a number of the high-level working meetings.
I would like to ask two questions specifically, to add to what he has told us already.
The first relates to his views about the likely development of the eCall technology, which will give automatic location of a vehicle after an accident.
This seems to me to be one of the most important proposals on the table and the one that is the most feasible.
It also builds on our work in mobile telephony.
Secondly, I want to ask for the Commissioner's assurance that his services will consider sympathetically, in looking at the Phase 2 standards for pedestrian protection, the major contribution that accident avoidance technologies will make in that improvement in reducing pedestrian casualties.
I have just seen results from German tests which indicate that the Phase 2 structural standards may not bring about the sort of improvements that we had been expecting.
Â Â  . In reply to the honourable Member, let me say that, regarding the first issue of eCall technologies, we have now seen the first real applications in the marketplace, and they work.
At the Madrid conference we looked at applications developed by the health authorities and car industry, which showed that, when an accident took place, direct contact could be established with the hospital and the ambulance services were able to locate the place of the accident and make direct telephone contact.
In technological terms the product is now ready.
The challenge now is to implement it appropriately.
But the first issue has been solved.
On the second matter, as far as accident-avoidance measures by IT tools are concerned, progress has been made on the research side based essentially on the use of radars or sensors, which help the driver to identify potential risks in traffic, especially during the early evening, often the most dangerous time.
We will look at the issue in detail in the context of the feasibility studies to be carried out.
As we all know, accident prevention is by far the best solution.
In any case, pedestrian safety is a priority for all of us and we will stick to the commitments we have made.
Â Â  Thank you very much for your replies, Mr Liikanen.
In accordance with the Rules of Procedure, Questions Nos 49 and 50 will be replied to in writing(2).
We shall proceed to todayâs final section: 20 minutes of questions to Commissioner Verheugen.
Â Â  . Mr Gahler, this has been a familiar issue for some time.
I would remind you, first of all, that the bill adopted by the Hungarian Parliament on 15 December 2003 regulates the relations between the Hungarian Financial Supervisory Authority (PSZÃF), the Hungarian Parliament and the Ministry of Finance.
The text of this bill is available to the Commission.
It states that the Hungarian Financial Supervisory Authority may not accept any instructions in the performance of its tasks, which are set out in the bill.
Nonetheless, the Ministry of Finance does have the right to be informed on a regular basis about the activities of the Authority and may call on the Authority to cease any improper practices if shortcomings do arise.
In terms of evaluating these two aspects of the bill, I should point out that the explicit provision stating that the Authority may not accept any instructions in the performance of its legally defined tasks, but that the Finance Minister has the right to be informed about its activities, is in line with normal standards, including those in place in the Member States of the European Union.
Quite apart from this, the Commission has been informed that the bill has not come into force.
The Hungarian President refused to sign it, referring it instead to the Hungarian Constitutional Court for review.
This review is not yet complete.
The need for further amendments cannot be ruled out.
Since the bill has not yet come into force, the Hungarian Financial Supervisory Authority is still operating under the existing regulations and the same administrative council.
The Commission considers this an important matter.
It is in constant contact with the Hungarian Government on this issue, and given the importance of efficient and proper financial supervision, has requested the Hungarian Government to inform it promptly of all developments in this field.
Â Â  One further question: do you not think it is rather unusual that through this amendment to a bill, there has been intervention in a current procedure?
Furthermore, even if the outcome is supposedly a European standard, what was the legal position before?
Has the Authorityâs independence been enhanced, in the Commissionâs view, or has it been restricted instead?
Â Â  . Mr Gahler, I do not think it is the Commissionâs task to give its views on why a future Member State deems it necessary to undertake legislative amendments.
It is our task to be vigilant in ensuring that the legal provisions in the Member States are in line with the acquis.
That is what we have done.
Â Â  . Mr Posselt, the regular assessment report on the progress made by Romania, which was published in late 2003, contains a thorough assessment of Romaniaâs progress in the restitution of assets.
In the general conclusions it is stated that the legal framework for restitution is now fully functional.
There is one notable exception: restitutions of churches.
This is an incredibly sensitive issue in Romania.
The sensitive nature of the problem, together with the problems within and between certain denominations has resulted in a blocking of the planned legislation.
The law in Romania applies equally to all Romanian citizens.
The Commission is not aware of any special provisions for the German minority.
Your question, Mr Posselt, indicates that you may be better informed than the Commission.
If there is something the Commission does not know about, I would be grateful if you could let me know.
Consequently, I am unable to answer your question as to whether this model could be transferred to other candidate countries.
It is hard for me to assess a law we do not know about.
The selection of the general model for asset restitutions in Romania is a sovereign matter for Romania, and the sole responsibility of that state.
As you know, the European Union has no legal authority in this area.
Nevertheless, the regular Commission report does highlight the fact that the progress made in actual restitutions varies greatly depending on the value of the assets to be returned.
There has been real progress in restitutions of agricultural and forested land, but the transfer of buildings has only just started.
Only 3% of the properties in question had been returned by the end of 2003.
I would classify that as fairly slow implementation of the relevant legislation.
Â Â  â Commissioner, firstly I do believe that it is the Commissionâs role â and one you fully appreciate â to ensure that the relevant legislation is actually enforced.
In essence, that justice and administration in the candidate countries really do work within a reasonable time.
This is why you were right to address the 3% question.
Secondly, I believe â during the previous question time, you did state that you are still responsible for minority issues, including in candidate countries â that the Romanian and Hungarian legislation seeks to treat all citizens equally.
You know that there have been considerable problems with the Czech legislation, for which there is of course an official explanation.
Announcements were made by Mr MareÅ¡ and others regarding initiatives intended to improve the situation.
Do you know whether anything is being done?
Are there perhaps plans to apply these models, or at least to make another move towards reconciliation?
There was a lot of talk nine months ago but since then no more has been heard.
Â Â  . Mr Posselt, I apologise.
I came prepared for questions on Romania.
I am not prepared for incredibly tricky technical questions about the Czech Republic.
I will ask my services to investigate the matter thoroughly and to contact the relevant Czech authorities, and I will give you an answer in writing.
Â Â  . MrsÂ Schroedter, in the Maltese Constitution all fundamental rights and citizenâs rights are recognised.
The right of Maltese citizens to vote in general elections depends on their nationality, age, and place of residence.
A short while ago, a Maltese citizen lodged a complaint because one party was disputing his right to vote, and the Constitutional Court found that these requirements do not violate the fundamental rights of Maltese citizens.
The European Commission has nothing to add to the Maltese Constitutional Courtâs decision.
I would, however, point out that, according to the Maltese Constitutional Courtâs definition, the notion of residence does not require a physical presence in the country, and in fact temporary absences from the country are both included and permitted.
If a political party in Malta disputes a citizenâs right to vote, the relevant Maltese court has to consider the case and the ruling of the Maltese Constitutional Court has to be taken into account.
The right to question the electoral roll and election results is an integral part of all transparent democratic systems.
It is certainly not the Commissionâs place to intervene in the operation of the Maltese legal system.
The Commission would also remind you that the recently adopted law on the European elections in Malta states that all Maltese citizens living in any of the 25 Member States have an active and passive right to vote in the elections for the European Parliament in Malta.
This was possible because the Maltese Constitution covers general elections, but not European elections.
This is an interesting development, and the Commission has taken good note.
It shows that Maltaâs increased participation in international organisations is having a very constructive influence on domestic developments.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, you have not addressed the real question, namely the request from the Maltese Labour Party to strike 1Â 684 citizens off the electoral register for the European elections because they currently live in the European Union, and do not work in Malta.
This is the heart of the matter, and you have not addressed this in any way.
We are talking about the European elections.
That is the issue at stake, and yet the same thing happens every time.
Once again, in this case, 1Â 684 citizens will be struck off the electoral register.
My question related to this particular case.
Please could you give a more detailed response?
Â Â  C I will, Mrs Schroedter, although very reluctantly, because the European Commission really has no say in what any political party in Malta does or does not do.
You are wrong to say that anyone is being struck off the electoral register.
In this case, a party has used its right to apply for names to be struck off.
This is possible under Maltese law, as I explained, and the decision is taken using an objective legal procedure.
As I see it, it is none of our business whether the Maltese system is particularly pleasant.
What is important is establishing whether or not the general free and equal voting rights are guaranteed in Malta.
They are.
It is certainly not the Commissionâs place, however, to pass judgment on the actions of each and every party and I am not going to do so.
Â Â  . Mr Howitt, to clarify the situation in which we currently find ourselves, let me start by pointing out that Turkey is not a member of the European Union and that we have not even begun accession negotiations with Turkey.
This means we have very little opportunity for influencing Turkey, particularly via legal instruments.
For this reason, I would refer you to my earlier response to the question from Baroness Ludford, Mrs Lambert and you on the same subject and repeat that any negative consequences of the Baku-Ceyhan pipeline agreement signed by Turkey or the implementation of that agreement will be assessed according to the Copenhagen political criteria.
That is all the Commission can do in this case.
Our role is to assess whether Turkey has met the political criteria necessary for beginning accession talks.
Obviously, this will also include assessing whether or not Turkey is fully respecting human rights.
The Commission report to be presented in autumn this year will examine this question, of course.
The Commission is aware that a number of non-governmental organisations filed complaints with the Court of First Instance in January 2004.
The Commission has not yet been officially notified of the details of these complaints.
If asked to do so by the Court, the Commission will submit its comments in line with the relevant procedures.
Â Â  I thank the Commissioner for his statement.
Although there is only a pre-accession agreement with Turkey, he can be assured that the European Parliament is fully aware of Turkey's candidate or non-candidate status and that this has some legal impact.
I was one of a number of Members who petitioned the Commissioner to include an assessment in his last report, last November, on this specific issue.
This did not happen, so I very much hope that an in-depth analysis of the human rights, environmental and other impacts of this pipeline will form part of the assessment this year.
Could the Commissioner help all of us by saying what mechanisms, approach and analysis he is going to take to investigate this?
What will he be doing between now and November to answer the questions, so that we can be assured his report is full and fair?
Â Â  . Mr Howitt, I can promise you that in the final and conclusive report on whether Turkey meets the political pre-accession requirements we will carefully consider this matter.
The Commission will investigate this question, as it has investigated all other human rights issues in Turkey.
The Commission will draw together all information available from its own sources, from Member States, from human rights organisations and international monitoring bodies and also from all public information sources.
Obviously, the Commission will also ask all those involved to provide relevant information, and will then assess all the data it has gathered.
If necessary, missions will be sent out to get a first-hand impression of the situation on the ground.
We attach a great deal of importance to ensuring that our assessments are based on sound, reliable information, and will ensure that applies here.
Â Â  Does the Commission share the view that the Baku-Ceyhan pipeline is a project of great importance both for the future of European energy supplies and for the economic development of Turkey and other countries in the region?
Â Â  C. To be honest, Mr Van Orden, I have no idea whether the European Commission as an institution has a view on this.
However, I can tell you that no attentive newspaper reader can fail to be aware of what is at stake.
I am very happy, therefore, to give you my personal opinion, which is that this is a project of considerable strategic significance, with a huge influence on eastern Mediterranean politics, and implications for many other countries, and is therefore a project which merits a great deal of international attention.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mr Verheugen, for your cooperation with Parliament this evening.
Since the time allotted to Questions to the Commission has elapsed, Questions Nos 55 to 85 will be replied to in writing(3).
That concludes Questions to the Commission.
Â Â  The next item is the Commission statement on problems with salmon.
Â Â  . Mr President, the study 'Global Assessment of Organic Contaminants in Farmed Salmon', published on 9 January 2004 in magazine, compared the levels of 14 organochlorine contaminants in samples of farmed and wild salmon.
Besides dioxins and PCBs, the study reports on the presence of residues of organochlorine pesticides, the use of which has long been prohibited in the EU.
This study does not raise new food safety issues as the levels found are consistent with the results from other surveys and from official controls.
This does not, however, mean that the presence of these contaminants is not a cause for concern.
As regards dioxins, strict EU maximum levels were adopted in 2001 for dioxins in feed and food, including fish.
However, in setting these levels, the Commission had to take into account the reality of the current background contamination of the environment in order not to endanger the food supply.
I would remind you that worldwide, only the European Union and Korea have adopted maximum levels for dioxins in feed and food.
These maximum levels are part of a comprehensive strategy adopted by the European Commission in 2001 to reduce the presence of dioxins and PCBs in the environment, in feed and in food.
The implementation of this strategy would give new impetus to the reduction of the background contamination.
As a result, it will be possible to lower progressively the maximum levels to follow this downward trend.
The legislation foresees that, as early as this year, the maximum levels have to be revised to integrate some PCBs with toxicological effects similar to dioxins.
Furthermore, it is foreseen that by the end of 2006 the maximum levels will be revised, aiming for a significant reduction.
For the other PCBs, the European Food Safety Authority is currently undertaking a risk assessment.
The result of this risk assessment is expected to become available by the end of 2004.
The Commission will thereafter consider the setting of maximum levels also for these PCBs in feed and food.
The organochlorine pesticides detected in the study published in have long been banned in the European Union.
However, their continued presence in fish is due to the fact that they are very persistent compounds, which can still be found in the environment.
The European Union has established maximum levels for these pesticides in animal feed, including fish feed.
On the basis of updated risk assessments undertaken by the Authority, the Commission will consider whether a revision of the current levels is necessary for the protection of animal and human health.
The highest levels of two pesticides â toxaphene and dieldrin â found by the study in salmon feed exceed the maximum levels fixed by the EU.
We have, accordingly, drawn the attention of the Member States to these findings and requested that they submit data from official controls and, if necessary, reinforce those controls.
Finally, I would stress that the levels of dioxins reported in the study are all below the EU maximum levels.
Fish â be it farmed or wild â has its place in a well-balanced diet to ensure that consumers continue to benefit from its positive health effects.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, I was among those Members who wanted a debate to be held on this issue, given the alarm that had spread among the public.
Immediately after Christmas and New Year, a number of articles appeared in the French media, mentioning probable dangers.
An announcement was actually made but was not actively followed up, which left consumers with unanswered questions.
I rememberÂ some years ago, at least five, possibly six years ago, talking with someone who worked with MrÂ Fischler at the Commission, who told me, when we were in the midst of the BSE crisis, that the second food crisis to hit Europe would be in farmed salmon.
Those words stayed with me and this is why I was keen for a debate to take place on the matter.
He was certainly exaggerating somewhatÂ âÂ I hope so anywayÂ â and what the Commissioner has just told us would appear to bear this out.
Nonetheless, I feel that it was important for us to be able to pass on some answers to our fellow citizens so that they know what they have to do.
When we established the European Food Authority, we emphasised how important it was that communication should be commensurate with the level of risk.
In this regard, when the press articles appeared at the end of 2003, I would have liked the Commission to offer us an immediate response, rather than â somewhat regrettably â waiting until mid-February, when Parliament requested the information.
With problems of this nature, it is wrong to focus on the difficulties faced by one economic sector or another. I put myself in the place of the salmon farmers and of the regions that are â or could have been â affected by information of this kind.
Such a situation has economic knock-on effects and we are duty bound to bear this in mind.
Our overriding concern, however, is food safety for our fellow citizens.
I therefore believe that it is our duty, and this is especially important, to ensure transparency at all times and to communicate answers at the appropriate moment, so as to avoid a vacuum of information that may increase peopleâs concerns.
Even so, Commissioner, you tell us that the quality of salmon leaves something to be desired, yet you affirm elsewhere that what could be detected as doses of dioxin was below maximum levels set by the EU, and we are all relieved at that.
What I should personally like to request from you is not only that controls be implemented, but also that decisions be taken in order to ensure that farmed fish is better monitored and, more importantly, that it reaches appropriate sanitary levels.
This is what I wanted to say, Commissioner, and what we expect from you is that controls should be put in place and swiftly followed by action, so as to offer complete reassurance to European consumers.
Â Â  Mr President, when this debacle began it was with disbelief that many of us watched how a report whose science was questionable could jeopardise one of the most important rural industries in Scotland.
Scottish salmon farming supports 6Â 500 jobs, 70% in the Highlands and Islands, injecting GBP 2 million every week into the Scottish economy.
Scottish salmon accounts for nearly 40% of all Scottish food exports.
The bias of the press coverage and the lack of quality information led to a food scare based on insubstantial evidence and falsehood.
I was pleased that the Commission took prompt action to put right the evidence and to speak up for the safety of Scottish salmon.
So too did the Food Standards Agency in the United Kingdom.
The substance of the food scare was based on a highly misleading piece of research published in the American journal PCB and dioxin levels in Scottish salmon are significantly lower than the threshold set by the EU, the Food Standards Agency, the US Food and Drug Administration and the World Health Organisation.
Professor Hugh Pennington, a leading food expert said: 'The evidence is pretty clear that the officially recommended levels, which are higher than the ones that the scientists are talking about, are actually safe.'
The methodology of this research has been called into question.
The conclusions are based on a controversial risk assessment model that was introduced by the US Environmental Protection Agency.
The risk assessment model is not recognised by international organisations responsible for food safety and public health such as the WHO, which considers it scientifically flawed.
Additionally, the salmon used in the study were purchased prior to the country of origin labelling regulations, and so the study has not even ensured that the salmon tested were farmed in Scotland or the EU.
On top of all of this, the research does not contain any new information.
Even the figures used in the research are questionable, as they differ from UK Government official figures.
With this in mind, the Food Standards Agency does not accept the research findings and advises people to eat two portions of fish per week, with one portion being oily fish, such as salmon.
Sadly the American research has ignored all the health benefits of eating salmon, which contains high levels of Omega-3 fatty acids and is proven to reduce the risk of heart attack.
Sir John Krebs, Chairman of the FSA, backed this up.
He said that although dioxin levels have decreased dramatically over the past two decades, they remain a consumer concern.
The known benefits of eating one portion of oily fish outweigh any possible risks.
On the subject of fish feed, which was also brought into question, the feed of US, Canadian and Chilean producers comes from the same sources as that for the Scottish fish farmers.
It seems strange that US, Canadian and Chilean samples should be free from levels of the substances under test, compared with those from Scotland.
To my mind there is something very odd going on, when the basis of a report can be taken as read without thorough investigation.
In fact, one of the scientists involved in the research â Dr David Carpenter â has confessed that 'There may be some legitimacy in saying the reason they chose to fund this study was that they had another agenda well beyond the health effects.'
Scottish Quality Salmon members already undertake measures to ensure the quality of its feed supplies and have in place a testing regime to ensure its standards are met, as well as the rigorous environmental regulation that fish farms adhere to, which has been improving year on year since fish farming began.
The Scottish Environmental Protection Agency has a specific remit and responsibility to regulate salmon farming â 63 pieces of legislation, 43 European directives, 3 European regulations, 12 Commission decisions â that help reassure consumers that the product they are consuming is of the highest quality.
I do not know if the Commission is in a position to comment on the proposed anti-dumping measures.
I understand that there were ongoing negotiations this weekend between the Irish presidency and the British Government.
If you have an opportunity to comment, Commissioner, that may be useful.
A line needs to be drawn under this episode.
Damage has been done to the Scottish salmon farming industry, there is no doubt about that.
However, we have to move on, highlighting the falsehood of the accusations and the importance of eating salmon as part of a balanced, healthy diet.
It is because of our membership of the EU that we can work together in order to seek solutions.
The European Commission's immediate response reassured consumers that eating salmon is safe.
It is only by action at the EU level that we can take action against false food scares and bring reality to bear.
Â Â  â Mr President, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is satisfied with the Commissionâs statement.
The health risks associated with salmon have quite obviously been exaggerated.
On the other hand it is obvious that eating farmed salmon is less healthy than eating wild salmon.
This is one reason why the European Union should aspire to a policy on salmon that keeps as close to nature as possible, although salmon farms will of course still be needed for the production of both rainbow trout and salmon.
The Baltic Sea has its own migratory salmon stock.
The rivers flowing into the Baltic have produced young that have migrated to feed on what the sea areas have to offer: shrimp and small fish.
Contamination and the use of the water systems for floating timber and hydroelectric power production have had an adverse effect on breeding.
This decline has been partially offset by introducing stocks of salmon into rivers, something which companies that produce hydroelectric power in particular have been obliged to do.
That, however, has not had much effect.
It has been estimated that as many as 95% of young salmon introduced in this way perish.
On the other hand, there has been overfishing of salmon both in the open sea and in coastal waters close to the rivers in which they spawn.
There have been continual disputes over salmon fishing rights.
Now that, with enlargement, the Baltic Sea is to become even more obviously an inland sea of the Union, a comprehensive plan should be drawn up to protect salmon stocks and organise fishing activity.
Salmon breeding must be restored as closely as possible to its original natural state.
Rivers and streams that make good spawning grounds must be made suitable to permit increases in salmon stocks.
Fishways should be built on constructed waterways, and the spawning grounds in the rivers should be properly maintained.
By promoting the natural regeneration of salmon stocks we can open up new opportunities for sport fishing and tourism based on it in all the countries with a Baltic coastline.
Once the natural reproduction process for salmon is improved, the level of introduced fish stocks can be reduced and in the course of time perhaps abandoned altogether.
The money saved can be spent on the building of fishways, the upkeep of spawning grounds, and boosting other fish stock levels.
The fishing of Baltic salmon should start to see the implementation of the âspawn state principleâ, which has been successfully applied in the North Atlantic within the framework of the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organisation.
Fishing has to be restricted so that the sustainable and natural renewal of salmon stocks is assured.
After the enlargement of the Union, the protection of the Baltic Sea, maintenance of its fish stocks and organisation of fishing activity in the region will no longer be matters of multilateral cooperation but a bilateral issue between the EU and Russia.
I believe that Russia for its own part is prepared to take up the challenge of cooperation; the main responsibility, however, lies with us, the EU and the Member States of the Union.
Â Â  Mr President, I was interested to hear Commissioner Byrne say that some of the findings exceed the limits.
This is because, according to press reports when this scientific study was first published, a statement was issued claiming that a spokesperson from Commissioner Byrne's office had agreed with the assessment made by the United Kingdom Food Standards Agency that the levels of chemicals in our European salmon did not exceed EU limits.
I welcome the fact that this position has now been revised, because what we are talking about here is about consumers.
Background levels have to be taken into account.
The issue needs to be addressed as to why those background levels are there in the first place.
That is something that also has to be tackled.
From these studies it has been quite clear that farmed salmon have a significantly higher contaminant burden than wild salmon â that is what the report says â and that farmed salmon from Europe are significantly more contaminated than farmed salmon from South and North America.
A lot of people have long seen that there is obviously some sort of health risk in relation to farmed fish.
We are now saying that consumption of farmed salmon should be limited to a certain amount per week, or per month, which raises a question about the threat to consumers.
It should be clearly labelled so that consumers know what they are eating and have that choice.
I raised the issue with the President of Parliament, Pat Cox, and asked him to request the European Food Safety Authority to issue a scientific opinion on the problem.
He agreed to do so.
Unfortunately, we have still not received the letter which he was going to send.
It is crucial that this should not be further delayed, because we are not just talking about salmon here.
An issue which has not been raised at all is that other carnivorous fish species, for example tuna, cod, sea bass, sea bream and trout, are farmed in similar conditions and probably exposed to similar contamination.
This is an issue which needs to be addressed, not just in relation to farmed salmon but in relation to other farmed fish.
Finally, I see that the United Kingdom Government has adopted protection principles to safeguard Scottish salmon.
They should adopt protection methods to safeguard the consumer.
Â Â  Mr President, let me say unequivocally that if there are proven problems of a serious health or environmental nature linked to EU-produced salmon, then the matter must be dealt with seriously and swiftly.
However, there must be accurate, reliable and totally independent scientific advice before any such action can be undertaken.
It will not surprise the Commission that I am somewhat sceptical, to say the least, in relation to some scientific studies currently doing the rounds and which, I believe, prompted the present crisis.
I am not interested in who did the study.
I am, however, interested in who paid for the study.
I am also interested to know if there are vested interests involved in this work, if there is anyone who stands to gain from this type of so-called scientific research.
For me, the crisis in the salmon sector is not just environmental; the real crisis is that the EU salmon industry, particularly in my constituency of Connaught-Ulster in the west of Ireland, is under serious threat of extinction.
The entire Community industry is under threat from cheap imports, or to put it another way, from dumping of farmed salmon from Norway, Chile and the Faroe Islands.
It is totally unacceptable to me that a growing number of independent Irish and Scottish producers are going into receivership.
If this continues unchecked, there will be no environmental or health issues to resolve because there will be no EU salmon.
In recent days, both the Irish and UK Governments made a joint application to the European Commission for new measures to safeguard our salmon-farming industry.
The application does not concern the Canadian or the American producers; it concerns the EU producers, starting with Irish producers who are fighting for survival.
In conclusion, I ask the Commission to tell me and the Irish salmon producers, whom I represent, what follow-up or initiative it has taken to date, or intends to take, on the joint Irish-United Kingdom application?
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, the question of farmed salmon before us today is a genuine case study that is surely destined to be repeated many times over in years to come.
As politicians we are not armed with scientific knowledge, yet how are we to address a crisis that may have far-reaching socio-economic consequences for entire sectors?
How can we solve a problem that has arisen from the publication of a scientific report that casts doubt on the sanitary quality of a food product, that has been published as part of a root and branch reputation review, and that has already been widely covered in the media, thereby raising concerns among consumers?
How do we distinguish between what is based on well-founded concerns, calling for the most stringent measures and protocols to be put in place, and what is based on effects that are simply due to defects in the mathematical models used or in the balance of parameters?
Having had our fingers severely burnt by previous crises, which had devastating consequences â such as the crises involving mad cow disease, and dioxin in chickens, the case before us today, evidenced by the abnormally high death rate among bees, of the danger of new and extremely powerful neurotoxic molecules, which are used to coat seeds, getting into fats and water â we are being vigilant and must continue to err on the side of vigilance.
It is only by redoubling the controls, the studies, the research and the analysis that indisputable results will begin to come through to reassure consumers.
The food safety authorities are there to help us in this aim, but Parliament must also give a ruling.
I should also like to remind you at this juncture, as a member of the Scientific and Technological Options Assessment (STOA), that we have a novel type of body available to us in the European Parliament, the STOA panel, whose function is to provide Members of this House with aspects of scientific assessment that they may need in order to clarify the positions that our various committees are required to take.
It is by no means a perfect institution, but I feel that the STOA is capable of offering us invaluable help, such as providing us, in regard to a question such as the one before us this evening, with an overall perspective and a critical analysis of all scientific studies in existence or ongoing.
We must therefore not overlook this invaluable instrument.
Â Â  . Mr President, I wish to begin by answering some of the questions posed by Mr ÃÂ Neachtain, because he asked who funded the report which appeared in magazine and caused all the problems.
Few realise that the research on which the article was founded was commissioned by the Philadelphia-based Pew Charitable Trusts, worth an estimated USD 3.8 billion.
They are well known for their international campaigns against global pollution and they have recently become influential opponents of the aquaculture industry.
The magazine article â based on a USD 2.9 million research project carried out by the Institute for Health and the Environment at the State University of New York at Albany â has, as previous speakers have said, proved to be deliberately misleading in the advice it provides on salmon consumption.
And yet, I think all of us in this Chamber would be astonished at how that article suddenly appeared in newspapers all over the world.
The reason is that on the day it was published in magazine it was sent out by press release by an international PR company based in New York and simultaneously appeared on the website of the Canadian-based Suzuki Foundation, which campaigns on behalf of Alaskan wild salmon and which, of course, has a vested interest in damaging the European farmed salmon industry.
In their conclusions about limiting salmon consumption, the study's authors appear, as Mrs Stihler said, to have misapplied an already suspect risk model developed by the US Environmental Protection Agency by failing to include any analysis of the health benefits of eating salmon, despite over 5Â 000 scientific papers attesting to the necessity of eating oil-rich fish as a regular component of a balanced diet.
The research does not actually contain any new information: the data the research provides is no different from the findings of previous studies that also found dioxin levels in farmed salmon to be well within official safety limits.
However, the interpretation used in the research paper deliberately exaggerates the health risks.
Moreover, the PCB levels in all EU farmed salmon are significantly below the level determined to be safe for sale in supermarkets, even by the US Food and Drug Administration, as well as by all other international watchdogs, including our own EU Food Standards Agency and the UK Food Standards Agency.
The American research is therefore seriously flawed.
EU fish farms undertake rigorous inspection and quality control regimes to ensure that only the highest possible environmental and welfare standards are met and that the public is provided with an entirely safe, non-toxic and reliable product.
Â Â  Mr President, consumers are entitled to know what they are eating, and I fully support that as a public health imperative.
However, in order to make properly informed choices, it is essential that scientific information be accurate, up-to-date and verifiable.
In recent times, looking from Scotland, it is perfectly possible to believe that certain campaigners are making it their business to talk down specifically the Scottish salmon-farming industry and talk up specifically, as has been suggested, wild salmon from certain other areas.
Just publishing an article in a magazine entitled does not automatically verify the accuracy of its contents.
It is clear, as the Commissioner acknowledged, that there is no new evidence in the particular study published in .
It is also clear that the levels of various contaminants were within standards set by the European Commission and the UK and Scottish Food Standards Agencies, which are not bodies that are easy to satisfy in that regard.
The research totally failed to mention the positive health benefits that can be gained from eating fatty fish such as salmon.
Organisations such as Scottish Quality Salmon, which has very high standards, should be encouraged.
They require of their members constant improvement in such things as feed quality.
It is inexplicable to me to suggest that Scottish and Irish salmon, but not other farmed salmon fed on exactly the same feed, somehow did not come out of this study as measuring up to the same standards.
The measured approach adopted by the Commissioner is right, and I hope that, as others have said, there will be support for measures to protect this industry, which in Scotland is essential for employment and social cohesion in very fragile areas.
Â Â  Mr President, this is clearly a very important subject.
Salmon farming has often been criticised in the past for its environmental impact, but only recently have potential health impacts been raised.
It is crucial that these be better understood.
Health advice given by governments across the EU traditionally highlights the importance of eating more fish.
Yet, if risk analysis suggests that consumption of farmed Atlantic salmon poses health risks that detract from the beneficial effect of fish consumption, then we need to know more about that.
We need to understand more about it and we need to act on that knowledge.
We need to know for certain that farmed salmon has more contaminants than wild fish and that dioxins are among the most toxic chemicals ever created.
So far the debate has been dominated by arguments over whether the contamination found in the salmon was legal.
What we should be concentrating on is whether the salmon is genuinely safe.
That might well mean revisiting the limits that were set for contamination in 2001.
I want to get away from the arguments for or against Scottish salmon or any other kind of salmon.
These are not very helpful.
We should be talking about whether aquaculture itself is providing a viable and environmentally sustainable food for humans, and I would argue that the answer is increasingly looking like 'no'.
Also associated with aquaculture is a whole range of other problems, including the spread of disease and parasites to wild fish, the use of fish, fishmeal and fish oil as food with impacts on wild fish stocks, pollution of the sea floor from unconsumed food, the impact on predators when they are killed and the antibiotics used to control the disease.
There are some genuinely important issues here that need to be looked at and yet, perversely, governments continue to support aquaculture when, in many ways, they might well be better off putting their time and resources into rehabilitating the natural habitats of salmon so as to allow the wild stocks to recover.
This latest health report on salmon should be taken as a wake-up call to change the way we farm fish.
I look forward to a Commission revision of the standards based on genuine safety measures, not on allowances for background environmental levels, because health cannot and should not be compromised.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to respond very briefly to the issues that have been raised.
I am happy that it has been acknowledged by Parliament that the Commission responded quickly to this issue and that a clear explanation was given when it first came into the public domain.
I should like to make a clarification statement and to repeat what I said earlier.
It would be a mistake to confuse the presence of dioxin and PCBs in the fish, and the presence of pesticides in feed.
One questioner suggested that the Commission had made a statement earlier that was different from what is being said now.
That interpretation arises from a confusion of what has been said, which is that the dioxin levels are within EU maximum levels, but the pesticides in food are not, and I gave two instances that were above that.
That is a question of the levels being above the appropriate levels in the feed rather than in the fish themselves.
In answer to the question I was asked by MrÂ ÃÂ Neachtain in relation to the joint report that has been furnished by the Irish and United Kingdom authorities, I have to say that report has not reached my desk, nor has it reached my DG.
I am, of course, making inquiries about it, but that report may have been on a related issue and sent to a different DG.
It is something I will look at if it has been sent to me and if it is relevant to my portfolio.
Finally, on the question of further risk assessments, the European Food Safety Authority is carrying out a risk assessment on the presence of non-dioxin-like PCBs.
It is quite clear that my services and the European Food Safety Authority are keeping an eye on this issue.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  The next item is the Commission statement on the crisis in the steel sector.
Â Â  . Mr President, the European Parliament scheduled this declaration from the Commission only a few days ago when the future of Thyssen Krupp's AST Terni plant was at stake.
The decision to close magnetic steel production would put 450 jobs directly and larger numbers indirectly at risk.
Further job losses in the region already affected in the past would be a most unwelcome blow. It would be particularly unfortunate, in view of the long tradition of steel making in this region, the quality of the product produced at Terni and the skill levels of the workforce involved.
Therefore it is with some relief that I heard reports today of an announcement by the Italian Minister of Productive Activities, Mr Marzano, that the deadline of the decision on the future of the AST plant has been postponed to a date yet to be defined.
It is precisely because of concerns such as these, regarding the social consequences of corporate restructuring, that the Commission has sought to promote a response at Community level to the issue of how corporate restructuring is managed.
We sought, with the active involvement of the social partners, to develop and promote issues that seem relevant in the present case, investing in people on a permanent basis, developing employability through training and retraining, seeking alternatives to closures and redundancies, redeploying, wherever possible, workers affected by restructuring operations and anticipating market and technological developments.
I should like to remind you that two years ago the Commission launched a consultation with the social partners, particularly on this issue of restructuring, because unfortunately, there were many problems in many different Member States.
The Commission presented a report with some proposals.
We have the response of the social partners in October and we believe that through dialogue and agreed measures, particularly on issues to which I have already referred, everything that supports employability, the social partners can play an important role.
It is my sincere hope that in the window of opportunity that now appears to have opened all such possibilities will be given full consideration to see what contribution they can make to alleviating the crisis faced by the Terni plant.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, Europe cannot remain silent in the face of what is happening in one of the Unionâs most important steel-making sites: without any prior notification the Thyssen Krupp Group has decided to halt the production of magnetic steel in the steel plants of Terni.
This is an unwarranted action and betrays an agreement signed up to in 1994 during privatisation.
As noted by you, Commissioner, the German company is preparing to sack hundreds of workers because it prefers to protect other European sites and invest outside the Union, in South Korea.
Thanks to the intervention of the Italian Government â you mentioned, Commissioner, the intervention of Mr Marzano, the Minister for Productive Activities â and the extraordinary extent to which all the local institutions, citizens, parties and workers have mobilised themselves, Thyssen Krupp has decided to put off its decision to close the plant.
The European Parliament and the Commission cannot, however, raise their voices to help solve a crisis which is not, Mr President, Commissioner, an Italian issue, but involves the whole of Europe.
That is why we are asking that the Commission, when presenting the third report on economic and social cohesion on 18 February, clearly sets out its own proposals for protecting the industrial sector and, in particular, the iron and steel industry in the context of its new cohesion policy due to commence from 1 January 2007.
I am also convinced that the Commissionâs battle with the US in respect of market shares in steel production must be supported.
I repeat that the problem does not concern only Italy, nor is it a purely incidental matter, but rather a general problem facing the steel industry in Europe.
The crisis involves not just one company, but many and it seems to me that the Commission in comparison to the US it giving it its full attention.
Indeed, we cannot adopt a carefree and superficial approach to such a sensitive issue on which the future of thousands and thousands of jobs, and therefore of thousands and thousands of families, hangs.
As regards the Italian case of Terni, I am convinced that the Commission must intervene to deal with certain anomalies.
The steelworks in Terni, in contrast to what was established in December 1994 by the commission for the control of concentrations, are currently owned exclusively by Thyssen Krupp, this being a clear example of a concentration: the group is currently the only producer of magnetic grain-oriented steel in Europe.
Does not the Commission consider that this is potentially a distortion of competition?
Furthermore, because of its activities in Italy, Thyssen Krupp has received Community aid on the grounds that Terni, where the steelworks are located, is a region in industrial decline that comes within Objective 2.
Does the Commission not therefore consider that it should check whether the Community aid has been employed correctly by Thyssen Krupp?
Next, does not the Commission consider that it should check whether Thyssen Krupp has received further State aid in breach of the competition rules?
The investment in South Korea, announced yesterday, is a source of concern: I would not want European funds and possible funding provided by the German Government to be used not for boosting European economic growth, employment and development in Europe, but employed in South Korea, in the sole interests of one company which â I repeat â has not upheld the agreements it signed up to with Italy when privatisation took place.
Thousands of workers are now waiting for the Commission to take action in order to ensure that the Unionâs rules are observed.
A few days ago I heard President Prodi and Commissioner Monti speak and even in what you said, Commissioner, I perceive a desire to move forward, to protect workersâ interests, to resolve a problem which â I repeat â is not limited geographically to Italy.
I am convinced that the President of the Commission, after listening to the Thyssen Krupp management, will take decisive measures to intervene in the way that I hope so that the Commission may act collectively.
The President of the Commission and all the Commissioners should continue in their present direction: they can count on Parliamentâs support as demonstrated by the desire to reach a unified resolution on this sensitive and important issue, which I think will be adopted unanimously.
Â Â  â Mr President, for those who were lucky enough, like me and other Members, to take part in the strike and the demonstration at Terni on Friday 6 February, the deeper meaning of this struggle was very clear: an entire city and an entire region were united and determined to reject not merely a harsh blow against their production plant and their jobs but, above all, an attack on their dignity.
With many years trade union experience behind me, seldom have I witnessed such tension and such pride.
The announcement to close the magnetic section of ST by Thyssen Krupp means the loss of 900 highly qualified jobs and internal disruption as a result in the Terni iron and steel plant thereby posing an immediate threat to its plans, its productive capacity and its overall job prospects: we are talking of 4Â 500 jobs, including those companies affected by the knock-on effects.
Over and above that, though, this is, I repeat, a slap in the face for regional local government which has worked effectively and is still working, by utilising the structural funds, to create a more favourable climate of production for the company and its investments: infrastructure projects, training and professional retraining, energetic supply measures.
Up until yesterday everything was fine; then, in September 2003, production for electric motors, that is to say non-grain-oriented steel, was abandoned.
At that time, and again in November, a solemn commitment was given concerning all the programmes aimed at making Terni a centre of excellence for magnetic steel.
At the end of January, however, after only two months, there was an about turn: even the production of grain-oriented steel used for transformers was closed down and the closure of the plant was announced with dramatic internal consequences: there was a threat that the plant would be broken up destroying its integrated structure which, given the varied nature of its production, enabled it to balance out market fluctuations and disperse strategic functions such as marketing.
It also had major external consequences affecting Italy and Europe in general.
Magnetic steel, which is produced only in Terni, is the only special strategic steel for the energy sector; becoming dependent on Russia and the US will also have a negative knock-on effect for users who are major exporters.
The news that arrived at the end of the meeting held today in Palazzo Chigi therefore explains why the workers and the inhabitants of the city took to the streets and why they have been able to broaden their network of alliances and support.
On 18 February genuine negotiations will finally get under way without a gun being held to the trade unionâs head.
The deadline of 27 February has been cancelled, 80 contracts which had expired and which Thyssen Krupp wanted to cancel are being renewed; it is a sign that the multinational feels isolated.
In response to this preliminary result the pressure must be maintained and the attention of all the institutions must be kept engaged.
On Thursday this Parliament will make its voice heard with a resolution on this issue which genuinely symbolises the need for new systems of industrial relations and more advanced methods for linking public investment and industrial strategy.
We are fighting to ensure that there is a clear message that the dispute should end in a positive manner: a decisive dispute to put a stop to the downgrading of production in Italy and the weakening of industrial plant throughout Europe.
Â Â  â Mr President, in 1950 Robert Schuman launched the idea of a European Coal and Steel Community open to all States, thereby creating the basis for the complex and difficult journey of European unification, the most recent developments of which we are now experiencing.
Even then the importance of steel in the European context was clear.
I am not surprised therefore that the debate in this Parliament concerning the âTerni caseâ has aroused so much interest and the opinions expressed have to a large extent not been dependent on political affiliations.
The European iron and steel sector is currently suffering as a result of the decision taken by the US to impose import duties on steel, principally from the European Union.
The crisis in Italy is important because it involves other iron and steel centres, like the steel plant in Genoa-Cornigliano.
In that context, the announcement by Thyssen Krupp, the owner of the Terni iron and steel plant, that it is going to invest in South Korea to produce steel in Asia is of major importance and is causing a good deal of concern.
As you know, the Terni plant was sold in 1994 as part of the process of privatisation promoted by the Institute for Reconstruction of Industry (IRI), subject to a guarantee that its activities would continue in Italy and that jobs would be protected.
This is not a company in crisis but a company that produces a leading-edge product used to make thin metal sheets for electronic transformers. Furthermore, there are no other factories of this type in Italy.
The technology used at Terni and the studies and research carried out in recent years are of an extremely high standard.
Losing skills and know-how is exactly the opposite of the knowledge economy to which President Prodi recently referred in this Parliament.
It is no coincidence that directors, managers, researchers and local politicians lined up alongside the workforce to fight on behalf of the product and the research associated with it.
About 900 workers are likely to lose their jobs, not counting the knock-on effects.
We cannot, therefore, ignore the fact that the German multinational received funds and tax breaks from the European Union when it decided to acquire the Terni plant.
I also wonder what the significance is, in global terms, of transferring production to Korea, what technological skills workers employed in South-East Asia have, what trade union rights they have and whether those rights will be observed.
At a meeting last December, some European Union industrial manufacturers in the footwear and textiles sector posed a number of questions concerning those matters to the delegation from China, which is preparing itself to become the factory of the world.
The replies were extremely evasive and we had no grounds for thinking that elsewhere on the continent â with the exception of Japan â the situation was any better.
Above all, in a market economy based on competition the rules must âŠ
Â Â  â Mr President, nine hundred jobs lost may be no more than a statistic, but it amounts to more for the lives of the human beings affected.
The plant in Terni is at the very heart of the cityâs fabric; 900 jobs: the lives of young and old workers.
The steelworks in Terni are the cityâs history and pride; they represent the memories of the air raids that took place in the Second World War.
When the management of Thyssen Krupp announced the closure of the magnetic steel section, the whole city â as MrÂ Sacconi said â took to the streets with the workers.
Terni is not an isolated operation: in Europe, Arcelor, Lucchini and Thyssen itself are currently preparing to reorganise production; plants in Belgium, the blast furnaces of Servola in Trieste have already received threats of closure, despite trade union action.
Massive disinvestment and relocation of valuable products to non-European countries are in fact destroying European production capacity.
Community funds, which have been considerable over recent decades, have been used to dismantle State controlled iron and steel works.
The subsidies paid to private entrepreneurs such as Riva, Lucchini, Falk and other foreign groups have been used for the remodernisation of production capacity and the specialisation of the Italian iron and steel industry along profit-making lines.
The European Social Fund and the structural funds have been used to finance restructuring and retraining programmes and have led to a younger workforce being employed in the sector â in Italy today the average age of iron and steel workers is 30 â but it is precisely this new generation of highly qualified young employees whose existence is under threat.
In my view, the absence of a coordinated plan in the European Union to relaunch the iron and steel industry has contributed to individual plants in various countries â albeit at the cutting edge â being transferred elsewhere in order to fit in with the industrial plans of individual entrepreneurs.
The Thyssen plant in Terni, which is currently suffering heavy losses in the magnetic steel sector to the benefit of the Russian company Duferco, is cutting back production and preparing to transfer operations to Mexico, Korea, China and India.
There is no sign of innovation, new research or competitive challenge: the only thing visible is a dangerous move towards retrenchment which, if not stopped in time, will have repercussions for employment and social cohesion, not just in Italy but throughout Europe.
Despite the drastic reduction of employment in the sector in Italy, which has fallen from 100 000 jobs in the 1980s to 40 000 today, the steel sector still has an excellent position in the market because it is the second European producer.
In order to maintain that position, however, requires industrial choices to be made by the Italian Government â which do not appear to be forthcoming â and a clear commitment of intent at European level.
Steel and electricity are economic indicators of absolute excellence in a country, a measure of economic development.
It is therefore essential that the European Union introduce systems for tackling pollution and monitoring the environmental impact, which are priorities if the aims of the Kyoto protocol are to be pursued.
On this basis a new steel industry can be launched.
We must find solutions in the form of industrial policies geared to protecting quality products, environmental conditions and employment in the iron and steel sector.
In this sense, in response to threats to employment and gradual social impoverishment, the Commission should give a commitment to review the rules governing the structural funds.
Granting of those funds in future should be made conditional on a binding commitment being given to invest in a given location for at least ten years, subject to an explicit agreement that the subsidies will be reclaimed in the event that production is moved elsewhere.
In my view, Directive 98/59 on protection in respect of collective dismissals should also be reviewed so as to consolidate the measures designed to protect employment by making provision not only for information procedures for workersâ representatives, but also requiring a commitment on the part of the social partners to open appropriate and binding negotiations with a view to preventing dismissals or the reorganisation of production to the detriment of employment.
The jobs in the steelworks at Terni must be saved, as must the jobs in other Italian and European plants and for this reason I believe that a meeting is required between the governments of the Member States concerned, the social partners and, in this specific case, Thyssen Krupp, to draw up a new industrial plan to relaunch the magnetic and inox sectors at European level.
Â Â  â Mr President, once again Italy risks being used as a dumping ground.
Thyssen Krupp is the only case of a multinational that has grown thanks to the work of hundreds of Italian workers and huge funds placed at its disposal, either by the Italian State or the European Union, and then has decided to close, in this case in Terni, in Umbria, with the risk of leaving 900 workers and their families destitute and also wasting a huge resource of professional skills.
As other Members have mentioned, the announcement of closure took everybody by surprise: no prior notice was given to the workers or the national and local authorities and, above all, no justification was given because today the closure appears to be dictated more by questionable strategic company choices than by specific technical reasons, given that in Italy production costs are lower, the quality is higher and the professionalism of the workforce beyond question: there have been steelworks at Terni for 120 years.
Would it, I ask myself, be acceptable for Thyssen Krupp to go ahead with the decision to close after taking everything possible from that territory and those people: professionalism, resources and even their hopes for the future?
Although I am convinced that large companies â the multinationals â are certainly a source of employment and development for the whole of Europe, a few remarks must be made: to say that we do not agree with some of the behaviour indulged in by European capitalism is neither a secret nor a shock: a capitalism which, in theory, is completely committed to the free market, to pure competition and to the flexibility of the global market but which, in reality, expects to be generously assisted time and again, requiring tax incentives from national governments and all kinds of structures, infrastructures and facilities from local administrations, not to mention the granting of Community funds.
Meanwhile production has already been moved to India, with an eye on China, where the cost of labour is ridiculous and laws for the protection of workers and the environment non-existent.
Further, as other Members have already stated, these multinationals often take advantage of the opportunity offered by privatisation â which unfortunately, most of the time, are no more than asset sales â to acquire our family jewels at knock down prices, as was exactly the case with Thyssen Krupp at Terni.
So, moving beyond these contentious matters, what are we asking of the European Commission?
Firstly, we are asking for immediate measures, within its powers, to safeguard the iron and steel centre in Terni and to avert the danger of Thyssen Kruppâs plant being closed; secondly: a commitment to check that European regulations are effectively applied in order to protect workersâ rights; thirdly: a further commitment to make the granting of Community funds conditional on agreements guaranteeing employment and subject to precise conditions and limits on the relocation of plant.
We also expect a committed development strategy to be set in place for the iron and steel sector throughout Europe.
Finally, should Thyssen Krupp go ahead with its decision to close the plant, we call on the Commission to check whether all the competition rules have been complied with, in particular as regards any possible abuse of a dominant position.
In conclusion, Mr President, whilst we are satisfied with the initial positive steps today of the Italian Government, gained as a result of determined action across the board, we consider that that is all the more reason not to lower our guard.
We believe unreservedly in the free market, but we also believe that there is no free market without democracy and, above all, without respect for workers and nations.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, I think it is important to check, in the Thyssen Krupp affair in Terni, whether any infringements have occurred under Community law; whether there is State aid that undermines the German groupâs choices of location; whether â as asserted by Mr Angelilli â there is an abuse of a dominant position; whether contracts with the Italian Government or the European institutions have been broken; whether, in other words, commitments given in respect of facilities or funding granted have been observed.
In my view, this is the task of the European institutions, but I also think that that task should stop there.
I do not think it is the task of the European Commission, the European Institutions or the Italian Government to criticise the decisions of companies operating in Europe to relocate.
There is outcry at the scandalous possibility that certain products are to be transferred to India, China or South America.
Personally, I consider that that is part of the rules of the game which certain countries in the European Union â primarily Italy â have taken advantage of for many years: placing at the disposal of the international economy its own assets, for example the availability of labour.
This is not intended to be disrespectful to the 450 employees of Thyssen Krupp in Terni who risk losing their jobs; it means also remembering the hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people who may find work in China and in India; it means also making provision â I refer to Terni which has already absorbed 10 000 surplus jobs in the iron and steel sector in recent years â so that in Italy and Europe, in areas of excellence, it is possible and necessary to produce something else for export to European and international markets.
In conclusion, Mr President, I would make the point that Italy and Europe need the confidence of investors to invest in Terni, just like anywhere else.
To imagine that politicians can criticise in this way the choices made by investors would not be to render a good service, nor would it serve any real useful purpose for employment.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, representing a constituency in the North of France, I have indeed had painful experience of steel industry restructuring in my region.
In the 1970s and 1980s, brand new factories were closed down.
I have to tell you once again this evening: twenty years on, that wound is still open and sore.
I therefore feel the current crises particularly keenly, especially that of Terni, where 900 jobs are under threat.
While I was preparing this speech, after reading the motion for a resolution, I re-read my report on steel, which Parliament approved in 1996.
At the time, having observed that successive restructuring had cost over 500Â 000 jobs in twenty years, I was in a position to state that, and I quote item F, âthe Community steel industry may these days be regarded as generally cost-competitive and technological effective, even though the problem of overcapacity could emerge again in the event of a new crisisâ.
Two years later, towards the end of 1998, the industry was struck by a devastating crisis following a market crash in Asia.
Since then, we have seen a succession of crises â some small, some large-scale, the result of local or world level restructuring â leading to a catalogue of redundancies.
As recently as the beginning of 2003, it was Arcelor and the announcement of thousands of job losses.
Today it is Terni and the thousand jobs deemed surplus to requirements.
Without wishing to attribute greater importance to my 1996 report than it deserves, reading it brought back to me the risks that were already bubbling under the surface: unbridled globalisation, American pressure and production at the cost of the social and environmental aspects.
It also recalled, however, measures that were needed to prevent further crises â measures in terms of social acquis and social rights, conditions of State aid, training for employees, respect for the environment, diversification, research, new products and the penetration of new markets.
The motion for a resolution before us recalls others, and this proves, unfortunately, that our warnings were not heeded.
The Terni situation is symptomatic.
This is why we must rein in the great roaring machine, not only because the workers demand it of us, but also because if we let go, then great swaths of the European iron and steel industry will go by the wayside.
In this context, despite the efforts and sacrifices of workers in the past, there is a danger that the European Steel Industry will disappear completely, followed swiftly by those industries that use steel products; in the fullness of time, therefore, it will be European industry as a whole that is under threat.
Further proof that there is no such thing as a good economy without a social element, without training and without respect for the workers.
In the short-term, some will make a profit, but that is not the issue for us.
The issue for us is defending the economy, industry and jobs.
Â Â  . Mr President, as Members said, the relocation of companies to countries with cheaper labour is a permanent phenomenon of economic history.
I should like to make a few specific comments based on the statements made by the honourable Members on the role and facility for intervention of the European Union.
First, as far as the international dimension is concerned, it is clear that global negotiations are under way on the question of steel and the European Union wants to achieve an agreement on subsidies because, as we know, there are countries which grant subsidies, especially outside the frameworks of the World Trade Organisation.
The second point is European social law.
And I think that here it is very important to know that, of course, the final decision on a company is taken by the company's management, but it is obliged to follow the specific directives on consultation with workers and on information, and prompt information, for them, and Community law on mass redundancies.
The implementation of these directives in the first stage, because they are national law, concerns every country and, of course, it also concerns the European Union, because they are European law.
The third point is the Structural Funds, in other words European money for companies.
Here we can see two categories of intervention by the European Union.
First, as regards direct subsidies to companies.
I would remind you that, for several years now, subsidies in the steel sector have not been allowed.
They are banned on the basis of the ECSC Treaty and continue to be banned but, where state corporations are subsidised, then there are commitments, there are agreements.
A company cannot take European money and not keep to the terms on which it was granted and, of course, in such cases, the agreements are signed at national level and the national courts have jurisdiction to impose any sanctions.
The question of subsidies is one aspect of the Structural Funds.
The second, however, which is also important, is intervention in the matter of addressing the social repercussions.
And here it is important for us to see that there is experience in many countries of restructuring of the Structural Funds, especially the Social Fund, in order to support workers and, even more importantly, to retrain them.
The most important weapon in restructuring of companies is continuing training of workers so that they can deal with the problems of their sector and can re-enter the job market at any time.
So I think that it is important in the negotiations taking place at the moment at trilateral level, between companies, workers and the Italian Government, for account to be taken of this possibility of supporting and assisting the workers via the Social Fund.
Â Â  I have received six motions for resolutions to wind up the debate(1) tabled in accordance with Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be on Thursday.
Â Â  The next item is the oral question to the Commission (O-0003/2004), by Philip Bushill-Matthews and Bartho Pronk on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on demographic trends in the EU.
Â Â  Mr President, I am delighted that the House has agreed to debate this important topic.
I also hope that this is an issue on which the whole House can unite on a cross-party basis.
The subject is not just about demographic trends in general.
My oral question specifically asks for more attention to be given to issues associated with ageing.
Too often, ageing is just seen as a problem; it should also be seen as an opportunity.
Too often, the elderly are seen as people with disabilities and with needs; they should also be seen as people with abilities and with rights.
There are many aspects to be reviewed, but in the time available I will just focus on one: the opportunity for the elderly to continue in work if that is their wish.
I therefore welcome the approach taken by the Employment Task Force chaired by Wim Kok.
This report refers to one of the Lisbon Council conclusions that is often overlooked, that by 2010 the target is for 50% of 55-64 year-olds to be in employment.
Currently, only Sweden, Denmark, Portugal and the United Kingdom have reached this target.
Belgium, Italy, France, Luxembourg and Austria have employment rates for older workers of less than 33%.
Delaying the average age at which people leave the labour force is crucial.
Luxembourg, Belgium and France among the current Member States, plus Poland, Lithuania, Hungary and Slovakia among the incoming Member States all have average work exit ages well below the EU average.
They will be particularly stretched to meet the agreed target and their policies will have to change radically in order to achieve it.
Will they grasp the challenge?
But even the EU as it exists today will miss the 50% target unless it can increase the number of older workers in work by seven million over the next seven years.
This means that two-thirds of the current 46-55 age group must still be active in the labour market in 2010. This means in turn a significant change, because only half of those in this group and in employment in 1991 were still working ten years later.
This is the reason I tabled this question.
It is a matter for Member States, but the issue is: will Member States act on these employment task force conclusions within a defined and early timetable?
Will the Commission put together an early progress report to present to Parliament, ideally by the end of this year?
Finally, will Member States implement all the provisions on age discrimination in the employment directive without further delay?
I hope the answer to all of these can be 'yes'.
Â Â  .
Mr President, Mr Bushill-Matthews and Mr Pronk, on behalf of the PPE-DE group, have submitted a series of questions to which I shall reply.
Of course, I too hope that the answer to the last three questions will be yes, which means very close cooperation and decisiveness by the Commission and, more importantly, the Member States.
Your first question concerns what the Commission intends to do in order to achieve the objectives of the Lisbon Summit, as far as demographic trends are concerned.
The demographic problem is, at the moment, at the epicentre of our three basic policies, economic policy, especially public finances, the policy on employment and the policy on social cohesion.
The question of ageing is now, as you will see, the basic element in the general orientations of economic policy and the guidelines of the strategy for employment, with specific targets.
I particularly want to tell you that this year, in the spring 2004 report, we have set three priorities, one of which is the promotion of active ageing, which essentially means the extension of professional life.
We have three categories of action.
One relates to abolishing economic disincentives, which essentially discourage workers from delaying their retirement.
In many countries, the regime which exists today is that it is more profitable to retire than to remain in work, because you earn less.
So there is the serious question of disincentives.
The second is the promotion of access to training for all workers, but especially elderly workers, and here we have set specific quantitative targets.
The third is improving the quality of work.
The Commission, within these frameworks of efforts to put demographic ageing at the centre of its policies, is proposing to extend the open method of coordination to modernising the care system and the social protection system.
Here we have a particular problem, which concerns the increased burden both from the economic point of view and from the workload point of view and, hence, from the point of view of serving very old people since, due to the changes in our society, it would appear that the health systems cannot play the role which they played in the past.
Your second question concerns flexibility in retirement rules and is particularly topical.
As you yourself said, we have set specific targets.
We have set the Lisbon targets, to increase the employment rate of the elderly to 50%, and the Barcelona targets, to increase the average age at which workers leave the job market by five years by 2010.
These targets are being monitored by the Commission.
Every year, as you know, we publish indicators and tables and it is clear that the Member States are not making efforts to the same degree to give us results.
At the moment, we are examining, together with the social protection and employment committees, how social systems obstruct or favour easy retirement.
The final report is at your disposal, it will be submitted again in 2004, and we can see what the problems are in each system as regards incentives to retire, disability benefits, unemployment benefits, older workers and dependents' pensions, and how the logic of incentives rather than the logic of integrating these people into the job market has also distorted the job market, as well as efforts by people themselves to enter the job market.
We believe that this report, which will be submitted to the European Council, is also an important tool in the hands of the Member States.
I must of course tell you that the European Commission has constantly recommended the introduction of flexible retirement systems since 1980 and the response has not been as we expected.
As far as your third question on the results of the Wim Kok committee is concerned, we consider that they are extremely important, mainly because they go into detailed recommendations for each Member State.
We have already included the Kok report in the strategy on employment and our recommendations for all the countries will take account of this report.
I think that it is interesting that, in cooperation with both Mr Kok and the ministries of employment and social partners, we are presenting the conclusions of the committee to the Member States in an effort to achieve greater publicity and galvanise not just the governments but also the social partners into implementing them.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner Diamantopoulou, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by thanking the Commissioner for her detailed and encouraging answer.
There has been a substantial rise in awareness of demographic ageing and its impact on the jobs market and social policy in the EU.
Europe faces an enormous challenge in this area.
On the one hand, it is confronted with the possibility of failing to meet targets set at the Lisbon Council in the areas of employment, competitiveness and economic growth by 2010.
At the same time, health care systems must achieve the three-pronged aim of health care access for all, higher levels of quality provided by these services and the financial viability of systems.
There is, moreover, enormous pressure on Member Statesâ social security systems to meet and to guarantee, in the future, the provision of pensions to an increasingly aged population.
The time has come, therefore, to take action.
We are aware that the complex implications of the ageing of the population, along with low birth rates, cannot be solved on an exclusively national level.
These problems affect different Community policies, so what is needed is to develop Europe-wide cooperation.
The first issue that therefore arises is to know in what way the Commission will be able to support Member States to provide adequate responses to the ageing of the population, either at health systems level or at employment policy level.
The conclusions of the task force chaired by Wim Kok suggest various measures that may be adopted to maintain economic growth and to promote active ageing.
A legislative and financial framework must be drawn up that might include such key measures as encouraging employers to hire and retain older workers, discouraging people from leaving the labour market early and increasing participation in life-long training.
In addition to the questions raised by Mr Bushill-Matthews, whom I congratulate for his question to the Commission, I should like to address the question of working women.
The increase in the contribution of women to the labour market is a further response, but one which requires measures to be adopted that make it easier to reconcile working life and family life.
I would ask the Commission, and especially Commissioner Diamantopoulou, whether it is in a position to develop the mechanisms required to draw up a framework directive establishing a lowest common denominator on reconciling working life and home life.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of my group, I have to say that I do not fully understand why Mr Bushill-Matthews asked this question.
We are all aware of the problem, and the Commissionerâs reply has also demonstrated that something is being done, and that naturally pressure is also being put on Member States as and where we can.
I think your points, particularly the three requests, are expressed in too summarised a form to seriously tackle the topic as a whole and all aspects of demographic change.
Both the Member States and the candidate countries are aware of the challenges.
Let me refer you to the two reports our committee and Parliament have already approved in 2001 and 2003, which were produced by MrÂ Cercas and Mr Andersson.
I think you will find the subject receives much more thorough treatment in those reports.
We are not only talking about raising the age of retirement, as Mr Bushill-Matthews has reminded us.
Clearly one issue is the need to remove the incentives for taking early retirement.
Of course, we also need to get rid of the discrimination older workers still often encounter in our labour market, such as the fact that they are rarely allowed to participate in further training, the way their experience is often under-used, the way they have no chance of any kind of promotion.
All this forms part of making the labour market attractive and reasonable for older workers.
There is certainly a lot of catching up to be done, both by the Member States and on our side, which goes far beyond simply increasing the age of retirement.
Of course, one other element, as Mrs Bastos has said, is to consider how we can promote child-friendly employment conditions in the European Union; how we can support women in combining work and family.
I think there is a hefty contradiction if the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Demcorats have no problem with calling for a 55- or 60-hour working week, as they did yesterday, expects that, and never stops to consider that it completely rules out a child-friendly society.
I think this is another important point.
The third and last point is that of course we need to have an unbiased, open and serious discussion about an active immigration policy.
We should also seriously discuss the immigration strategy mentioned recently in this House by Kofi Annan.
I think all this belongs to a policy which establishes a balance between the generations and welfare as well as showing intergenerational solidarity, as it is often called here.
