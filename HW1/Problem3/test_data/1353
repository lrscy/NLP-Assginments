These public policies are top priority as drug addiction has serious human and social consequences, particularly among the younger generations.
They must be accompanied by other public policies aimed at improving people's living conditions by guaranteeing access to healthcare, food, housing, schooling, educational success and stable employment, and by protecting the rights to a fair wage, to freedom of creation and cultural enjoyment, and to sports.
Bearing in mind its objectives and actions, the specific programme 'Drugs prevention and information' developed at EU level may help to increase knowledge, improve the exchange of information and prevent drug use by supporting and complementing the measures taken by each Member State.
The (inadequate) figure of nearly EUR 21 million, intended for the 27 Member States over the period from 2007 to 2013, will also be put to practical and full use.
in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the outstanding report by my excellent Czech colleague Miroslav OuzkÃœ on the International Health Regulations, revised in 2005 by the General Assembly of the World Health Organisation (WHO).
The purpose of these Regulations is to prevent the spread of diseases and to protect citizens against these diseases without causing unnecessary and costly interference with international trade.
This international health mechanism must be implemented urgently in a coordinated fashion within the European Community because infectious diseases, as my admirable French colleague FranÃ§oise GrossetÃªte points out, represent a threat and a challenge for every country.
Such health questions are once again going to raise the question of the quality of the controls at our external borders as regards both people and goods.
It is essential to support the development of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), established in 2004, and the European early warning and response system for public health threats, which must encourage rapid and coherent application in the EU Member States of the International Health Regulations (IHR).
in writing. - (SK) Since we did not have a debate on the report by our colleague Mr OuzkÃœ on the International Health Regulations, I would like to express my opinion on this matter at least in this way.
The increase in international trade and greater mobility within the EU heighten the danger of international outbreaks of infectious diseases within the EU or their transmission to Europe from more distant continents.
The response to such epidemics, using defensive methods, must be integrated and coordinated if it is to be effective.
Today in the European Union we have the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC): combating mass epidemics is part of its duty.
At the same time the Member States are members of the World Health Organisation, which has issued the International Health Regulations: they also deal with the fight against diseases that can spread from one country to another one.
There is a Commission Decision on the early warning and response system for the prevention and control of communicable diseases.
The EU also has a few financial tools at its disposal, for example the European Union Solidarity Fund and the action programme for public health as a new instrument for early warning and response in the case of serious emergencies.
At the same time, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, the Member States have control over their health services.
Given this complex system of abundant legislation at several levels, it will be difficult to respond quickly and unanimously if there is an epidemic risk.
The EU and Member State systems need to be better connected so that we do not find ourselves in a situation whereby we have European legislation that will not match the preparedness of the Member States to respond quickly.
in writing. - (PT) The International Health Regulations adopted by the WHO (World Health Organisation) are a new instrument aimed at protecting world health.
They replace the former post-war regulations which concentrated on border control, specifically the health control of ships and their crews, and which included international vaccination against yellow fever, to which other vaccinations were subsequently added.
Emerging public health issues such as tuberculosis and malaria and even new ones such as bird flu and the risk of pandemic flu have made international cooperation and information on public health even more urgent.
Recent epidemics and pandemic threats have shown that no countries or regions are immune to health problems nor is it possible to guarantee this.
These new Regulations encourage the exchange of information and urge countries to coordinate their responses to global threats, recognising that all countries are important and that mutual aid is essential.
In Portugal the health surveillance of borders, international vaccination and traveller advice have been receiving less and less attention, particularly due to the current government's closure of the Regional Public Health Centres.
Without a proper national surveillance system, the attention paid to these areas will continue to be mediocre.
in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of this report.
Twenty years ago infectious diseases were not perceived as a major threat.
Today they pose a risk and a challenge for every country.
Threats such as pandemic influenza, malaria and tuberculosis are a health risk because of virus mutations, increasing resistance to antibiotics and weak health systems.
The new health risks also include foodborne diseases, chemical, biological or nuclear accidents or attacks, industrial pollution and climate change.
These threats could endanger the lives of millions of people in several countries.
The spread of globalisation and increasing international flows and trade are aggravating factors.
International collaboration to control infectious diseases is therefore vital.
To this end, it is essential to eliminate any unnecessary interference with international traffic and trade.
This report provides an additional incentive for the Member States to develop further joint actions based on the exchange of good practices.
The introduction of early warning systems in the case of serious pandemics in neighbouring countries and third countries is equally crucial.
in writing. - (SK) I would like to comment on the report by my colleague Mr OuzkÃœ on the International Health Regulations, which I supported with my vote.
This legal tool is needed in order to secure, in a focused manner, prevention, protection and especially control in cases involving the spread of a disease.
At the same time this tool makes sure that the response of the public health sector will be adequate to the risks that have developed.
This standard that was first adopted by the member countries of the World Health Organisation (1951) has since already been modified on four occasions.
Its gradual implementation in its present form began as of June 2007.
This text provides the clearly defined interpretation of the EU stance adopted by the Commission and clarifies the EU's role in implementing the International Health Regulations.
It also examines the existence and role of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the Early Warning and Response System for public health threats (EWRS).
It will further contribute to the protection of our citizens' health and for that reason I welcome its adoption.
in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution by several political groups including the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats (PPE-DE) on the EU objectives for the 8th meeting of the Conference of Parties to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, to be held in Madrid from 3 to 14 September 2007.
One notable consequence of the current warming of the planet is that it dries out springs through evaporation and reduces the flow of the water level of rivers and of the underground water basins, thereby destroying the superficial structure of soil.
According to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), desertification currently affects approximately 25% to 30% of the world's land surface area, and between 1.2 billion and 2 billion people in at least 100 states are at risk.
At a global level desertification is increasing, leading to poverty, forced migration and conflict.
In my view, the European Union urgently needs to implement a European water policy, not only with regard to quality but also with regard to quantity.
in writing. - I am supporting this joint resolution regarding the UN Convention to Combat Desertification and the ongoing meeting in Madrid.
As we know desertification affects 20-30% of the world's land area and 1.2 - 2 billion people - many of whom are in deep poverty - in at least 100 states.
As a consequence of climate change and human intervention with deforestation and over-farming, more and more of the world is becoming a desert.
The consequence is increased poverty, forced migration and conflict.
One most graphic example is Darfur, where desertification has driven a complex conflict between pastoralists and farmers, as the farmers have been driven eastwards onto the land of the latter with the generation of hundreds of thousands of refugees, rapes, mayhem and murder.
Only strong and urgent international action can stop Darfur from being the first of many more similar conflicts, whose underlying cause is desertification.
in writing. - (PT) Regardless of the scientific disagreement on environmental issues, there is no doubt, as noted in the resolution, that extreme climatic events such as floods and droughts linked to climate change are becoming more frequent and more drastic in their effects, further increasing the risk and the negative economic and social consequences of desertification.
There is also no doubt that these negative consequences are being felt both in the countries directly affected and in neighbouring countries.
At the very least for this reason, given that the European Union must bear in mind that it borders areas undergoing a desertification process, the next EU-Africa summit must tackle this issue conscientiously and consistently.
Furthermore, on another level definitely worth mentioning, the issue of desertification is also relevant within the European Union itself.
This is why the absolutely essential reform of the CAP (common agricultural policy) must take account of the need to combat desertification, with a policy aimed at settling people in rural regions also being essential.
It is to be hoped that both the policy and the politicians will take a long-term view so that the problems faced can be solved in time.
This is the case with desertification: the history books are full of lessons which we must learn in time.
in writing. - Desertification is a serious problem affecting many parts of the world and it is important that the problem is addressed globally.
Failure to act will cause serious problems for many people, particularly in the developing world, which is why it is right that the United Nations, with our support, should act now.
I shall be voting in favour of the joint resolution but I hope that this is the start of a process to address this problem, and that in years to come we are not regretting our lack of action when the opportunity to act was given to us.
Desertification is a disaster that we must avoid; this resolution is a first step.
We, as the European Union, must take the lead in reversing this trend.
in writing. - I supported the resolution in order to press for further action to address this growing problem.
In particular, I am afraid that the issue is hidden from many in the 'developed' world, because the effects are often in the 'underdeveloped' world.
Darfur is an example whose underlying cause is a conflict brought about through desertification.
- (NL) Mr President, Parliament may well give full marks to the human rights policy of official Europe, but the reality is that the human rights clauses in agreements with many Arabic and African countries often remain a dead letter and there is no active and consistent policy on human rights.
Furthermore, what about the policy with regard to China, where it is clear to everyone that the trade and economic interests of the Union and its Member States take precedence over human rights?
Top of the bill, however, is the policy with respect to Turkey, of course.
While the report constantly refers to women's rights, Europe is holding the door wide open to this Islamic country where the situation with regard to women's rights has got worse and worse since the AKP came to power.
In any case our group and the Vlaams Belang Party will not join in with this hypocrisy any longer.
- (NL) Mr President, my colleague Mr Dillen just now so rightly pointed to the great gulf between the official rhetoric of Europe, on the one hand, and the concrete policy of the European Union on human rights, on the other hand.
I would like to add something to that.
While Europe propagates the values of an open Western society and, above all, freedom of speech throughout the world, through the human rights dialogue that is so applauded here but has no strings attached, we still find that in our own official European capital, Brussels, the defenders of that very same European value of free speech are being silenced.
I think that Parliament and its President should make a stand against the diktats of the Parti Socialiste Mayor of Brussels, Mr Thielemans, who is banning demonstrations against the advance of intolerant Islam in our own European capital and in all of our European countries.
I shall, in any case, demonstrate with others for freedom of speech and against the advance of Islam next Tuesday, 11 September right outside the European Parliament.
in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the report by my Spanish colleague Elena Valenciano MartÃ­nez-Orozco on the functioning of the dialogues and consultations on human rights with third countries.
Human rights form part of the European Union's core values and it is very important to ensure that they are automatically at the heart of the EU's political dialogues with third countries.
The Council must systematically apply the human rights and democracy clause in all EU agreements and relations with third countries.
As a result, I support the idea of increasing interinstitutional coherence and finding ways of improving coordination among the different EU institutions (the Council, the Commission and Parliament) by establishing an interinstitutional trialogue on the political dialogue and the human rights dialogues and consultations.
At a time when values are being eroded in a planet that is becoming increasingly complex, the EU must ensure respect for the values linked to human rights and democracy in all its projects and programmes, especially those relating to development assistance and technical, commercial and financial cooperation.
in writing. - (FR) The report by Elena Valenciano on the functioning of the human rights dialogues and consultations with third countries has just been adopted by a large majority and I congratulate the rapporteur on her thorough work.
The report rightly states that human rights issues should be addressed within the framework of the overall political dialogue conducted with third countries.
In fact, the promotion of human rights is a fundamental part of the EU's external and development policy.
I am also pleased that the report calls on the Council and the Commission to streamline the dialogue and consultation procedures.
Increased interinstitutional coherence and cooperation would give the EU's human rights policy more credibility on the international stage.
Objective evaluation and monitoring would also be required.
Finally, the report emphasises the importance of ensuring the transparency of these dialogues at EU level and enhancing the role of the European Parliament in that regard.
For all these reasons, I supported the adoption of this report during the final vote in plenary.
in writing. - (PT) It is without question essential to promote the universality and indivisibility of human rights, 'meaning not only civil and political rights but also social, environmental, economic and cultural rights'.
However, there are contradictions in the report: for example, while stating that the dialogue with a third country on human rights will be conducted in agreement with the latter, at the same time it threatens that, in cases where the latter rejects this dialogue, the EU must consider specific actions in that country, using for this purpose the 'financial instrument for the promotion of democracy and human rights worldwide'.
Will the Member States agree to apply this measure reciprocally?
Obviously not, because the 'dialogue' on human rights with third countries is not meant for discussing human rights in the EU, but in those countries.
This example helps to illustrate the real goal, which is to try and use human rights as an instrument of pressure and interference, at the convenience and in the interests of the major European powers.
The report, aware of this possibility, which it does not actually support, underlines the need for 'coherence' and 'credibility' on the part of the EU.
The silence on the CIA's illegal flights speaks for itself.
in writing. - I supported this report, which calls on the Commission and Council to ensure a greater degree of coherence in the EU's human rights dialogues with third countries.
In particular, I support the call for more involvement of the Parliament on the content of ongoing dialogues, and urge the use of more stringent criteria and monitoring mechanisms.
in writing. - (PL) I voted in favour of adoption of the report on the functioning of the human rights dialogues and consultations on human rights with third countries.
The report raised the very important issue of the appropriate representation of the European Parliament in dialogues and consultations between the European Union and third countries.
Human rights issues should feature in the European Union's work programme as a matter of course.
Moreover, we must ensure that the European Parliament is adequately involved in all matters relating to human rights.
in writing. - (SV) We have chosen not to support the report as it seeks to undermine some of the Commission's good intentions with a view to creating more sustainable fishing.
Fishing in the EU must become more environmentally sustainable in order to protect both marine environments and the long-term viability of the fishing industry.
in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the very good own-initiative report by my excellent Spanish colleague Carmen Fraga EstÃ©vez in response to the Commission communication on the implementation of sustainable fishing in the EU on the basis of maximum sustainable yield (MSY).
Like Mrs Fraga EstÃ©vez, I am pleased that the Commission acknowledges that the current fisheries management policy has failed, and I welcome its proposal to create a new management model making it possible to ensure stock recovery, adapt the fishing effort to fisheries' real circumstances, and improve the reliability and stability of the fishing fleet.
Nonetheless, it is important to adopt a cautious approach and consider our fishing capacities in relation to the consumption requirements in Europe and in the world as well as the pressing need to look after resources.
Moreover, any change to the Union's fisheries policy will have to include suitable and financially acceptable compensation mechanisms, which will require an assessment of the legal and socio-economic impact of the final proposal.
in writing. - (PT) The sustainability of fishery resources is essential for guaranteeing fishing activity and the viability of the fishing industry in the long term.
Safeguarding the sustainability of resources by implementing long-term plans and short-term measures must without question involve an assessment of their socio-economic consequences and, as a result, the provision of financial resources guaranteeing the continued existence of vessels, employment and income in the industry and for fishermen.
In our opinion, this is the relationship which best expresses and which must be at the root of the application of the maximum sustainable yield principle.
In other words, the 'maximum sustainable yield' must not be used as an instrument to promote (even further) the scrapping of vessels and the destruction of jobs.
The plans and measures for ensuring the sustainability of resources must be based on scientific fisheries research, not forgetting other measures which take account of the consequences of natural factors and those stemming from human activities with an impact on marine ecosystems.
This is why we proposed the introduction in the report of the need to increase the appropriations earmarked for scientific fisheries research in the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development.
Finally, we must stress that the participation of fishermen in the definition of all these policies is fundamental.
(CS) Mr President, I supported the European Parliament's compromise position on the review of the consumer acquis within the Union.
The report proposes improvements for half a billion citizens when exercising their rights concerning withdrawal from a contract, delivery of goods, statutory guarantee, methods of calculating the withdrawal period, unfair contractual terms, contracts providing digital content and on-line auctions.
Having expressed my support, I nevertheless believe that given that the Commission is preparing the most extensive review of the consumer acquis to date, Parliament could have solicited more modern, innovative and far-reaching changes, particularly in the following five priority areas:
higher degree of consumer protection in electronic commerce;
simplification of cross-border transactions for consumers and entrepreneurs;
enforcing proper application of, and compliance with, European rules on the part of the Member States;
increased consumer literacy; and
successful exercise of consumer rights across borders.
I trust that the Commission's proposal will be more adventurous.
I know that Commissioner Kuneva is committed to tackling such a demanding task as this.
in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the own-initiative report by my colleague BÃ©atrice Patrie on the Green Paper on the review of the consumer acquis, taking into account, in particular, the stated objective of modernising, simplifying and improving the regulatory framework for professionals and private individuals, thereby facilitating cross-border trade and increasing consumer confidence.
It is fitting to ask ourselves on a regular basis, especially with the development of e-commerce, whether the smooth functioning of the internal market offers an appropriate balance between a high level of consumer protection and the competitiveness of businesses, alongside strict respect for the principle of subsidiarity.
This report puts forward some interesting ideas concerning the general legislative approach, the restriction on unfair terms, the harmonisation of legislation, the right of withdrawal, the sale of consumer goods and, finally, the effective application of consumer law.
in writing. - (PT) We regret that a majority of the European Parliament has rejected the proposals made.
This will mean a rough ride for the simplification of consumer rights legislation.
We may be faced with an attempt to reduce and limit these rights, particularly in countries where these are more advanced.
We regret that the proposals made by my group were rejected, particularly the definition of a limited set of general rules common to all vertical consumer protection instruments: this would ensure a high level of consumer protection with implementation of the approved method of minimum harmonisation combined with the country of destination principle, so as not to compromise existing national legislation.
As we have said, it would not be acceptable for a consumer rights directive to return to any country of origin principle as a general rule, as was attempted in the initial version of the Directive on the liberalisation of services.
Given that the report still contains several contradictions and negative aspects, we voted against it and will closely follow developments in the situation.
in writing. - Some coherence of consumer policy, such as fixed minimum levels of consumer protection, can stimulate consumers' willingness to purchase goods and services from another EU Member State and therefore promote the development of a smoothly functioning internal market.
Nevertheless, we wish to stress that consumers also purchase many goods from countries and regions outside the EU, such as the United States and Asia.
The role of the EU institutions in this connection must not therefore be exaggerated.
It is crucial that the EU measures that are taken are proportional and that the subsidiarity principle is fully respected under all circumstances.
We therefore oppose several of the proposals that were presented in the European Parliament earlier, such as EU-initiated information campaigns for consumers, consumer information at EU level (which can be handled nationally or through voluntary cooperation between existing authorities in the Member States) and EU-funded authorities and institutes.
The current European Parliament report and the Commission's Green Paper on the review of the consumer acquis are essentially well balanced, however, and create a simpler and more predictable regulatory framework.
We have therefore decided to vote in favour in the final vote.
in writing. - (SV) We welcome the review of the consumer acquis and see it as a positive step that we are now proposing to investigate the disparities, gaps and overlapping directives.
We do not see any overall problem with harmonisation that simplifies and benefits Europe's consumers and professionals as long as it does not mean that we need to reduce any further our own levels of consumer protection, which come from a long tradition of Swedish consumer protection.
We had therefore wanted to have a consumer protection guarantee and regret that Parliament did not share our position.
in writing. - (FR) I was unable to vote in favour of the Patrie report because of the wording of paragraph 2, which recommends that Directive 2000/31/EC on certain legal aspects of information society services, in particular electronic commerce, be revised.
In my opinion, the existing Directive, which stipulates, inter alia, that the applicable VAT rate is that of the company's country of origin, works very well in practice.
Why would we change this excellent Directive in order to introduce a system where the consumer must pay VAT for these services in the country of destination?
That would lead to total chaos for all those concerned: both the tax authorities, which will have to manage VAT amounts from countries established in 27 different countries, and the companies concerned, which will have to apply up to 27 different VAT regimes.
Such a situation would be unacceptable and would hinder the free movement of goods, thus establishing an almost insurmountable obstacle to the single market in electronic services.
(PL) Mr President, I simply wanted to state that during the electronic vote on the Patrie report I twice attempted to vote in favour of an amendment, but unfortunately my machine failed to work.
I would like this to be noted.
Thank you, Mr Libicki.
That will be noted in the Minutes.

Burma
The next item is the debate on six motions for a resolution on Burma.
author. - (LT) Through this discussion and the resolution to be voted on in a short while, the European Parliament calls the human rights situation in Burma to the attention of the EU Member States, the other EU institutions and the international community.
The country is often called a paradise for tourists, but is far from a paradise for the people living there.
The last provocation by the ruling regime against its citizens was last month's 500 percent increase in fuel prices.
No wonder such a decision has evoked dissatisfaction and public protests, which have been, and are still being, brutally suppressed.
Scores of protesters were beaten and arrested, and in order to realise the extent to which this regime suppresses its citizens and what it is capable of, one needs only to remember the events of 1988, the situation of the Nobel Peace Prize Laureate http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1991, the attempt on her life in 2003, and the fact that, since 1996, the regime has destroyed more than 3 000 villages and carried out the forced removal of more than one million people.
Extraordinary brutality is characteristic of this regime; its catalogue of crimes includes rape, torture, forced labour and the use of child soldiers.
All this is undoubtedly seen by the international community and we should not allow recent events to develop into larger scale repressions.
The crimes and human rights violations by the ruling regime in Burma deserve our severe condemnation.
We express our solidarity with the people of Burma and demand that the arrested protesters be released immediately and that http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1991 be allowed to live a rewarding life and have freedom of action.
Today a heavy responsibility also falls on certain countries in this region, such as China and India, which have the potential to exercise their influence in order to reach a settlement of the conflict in Burma in a civilised way.
author. - (PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, four years ago, here in this Chamber, I had the opportunity to complain about the flagrant violation of human rights in Burma and to hope that we might see an improvement in the future.
This has unfortunately not happened: although the human rights infringements in Burma have changed to some extent they have actually deteriorated significantly.
The expulsion of the International Red Cross is highly symbolic in this respect, showing that this is a totally intolerable regime.
However, what we in the European Union must look at is our policy towards such infringements: it is hard to believe that in seven years we have not had a summit with Africa on Zimbabwe, where there is an extremely violent regime that is failing to respect human rights.
However, when it comes to Burma, the same cannot be said: obviously the commercial interests in Asia are much more important than those in Africa!
This does not seem acceptable to me.
author. - Mr President, Burma has the shameful record of being ruled by one of the longest-lasting military dictatorships still in existence.
Burma has been under a totalitarian military regime for 45 years.
An ex-British colony, Burma has suffered a traumatic post-colonial period, which has been fertile ground for the firm establishment of a military junta.
Since 1962, army generals have ruled the country and the Burmese people have endured severe abuses of their human rights.
Furthermore, the generals, through their incompetence, have made Burma one of Asia's poorest countries and a nation in which corruption has assumed gigantic proportions.
In addition, Burma has become a cancerous infliction on the rest of the world by being heavily involved in the large-scale trafficking of heroin, with Burma being a major exporter of this deadly drug.
The power figure in Burma today is General Than Shwe, a person of dubious psychological stability, who is reported to be maliciously introverted and superstitious and who frequently takes important state decisions after consulting astrologers.
Yet Burma is a country gifted with unparallel natural beauty, a uniquely fertile land and rich mineral resources, as well as significant oil and gas deposits.
All of these have been the centre of attraction for foreign investors.
But, sadly, the benefits of such investments have not reached the people of Burma, and have largely ended up in the pockets of the dictators and their collaborators.
A hope for return to democratic governing was heard in 1990 when the National League for Democracy (NLD) won a national election.
But the General suppressed all attempts at democratisation and the NDL leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, not only was prevented from assuming power but was also placed under house arrest, and this despite an international outcry.
Burma has been the subject of human rights resolutions by this House on numerous occasions in the past, and some sanctions have been in place for years.
But it has all been in vain, mainly because the Burmese ruling regime enjoys the support of China.
The truth is that if we really want to effect democratic changes in Burma, we must direct our blame and our attention at the Chinese Government.
We can put pressure on the Chinese, e.g. by threatening them with trade sanctions and an investment embargo on China.
If we are brave enough to do that, then we stand a chance of changing things for the better in Burma.
If not, then I fear this resolution, like all the previous ones, will end up in General Than Shwe's dustbin.
author. - (PL) Mr President, as usual, Thursday afternoon finds us debating cases of breaches of human rights around the world.
If we listed all the many countries, societies and nations that have breached human rights and are consequently the subject of our debates they would amount to a substantial proportion of our planet.
It should be noted that breaches of human rights do not arise only in poor counties.
They also often happen in developing countries that may not be particularly wealthy but are in the process of developing, like Russia.
Some of these countries even legitimise themselves through democratic elections.
Breaches of human rights may also occur in countries like China, which is moving rapidly up the world wealth ratings.
At the same time we also have to deal with the poorest countries.
Mr President, I believe we should consider whether we ought to forego our debate on one occasion and ask the European Commission to present ideas for tackling breaches of human rights across the world.
I make this proposal because we discuss these breaches Thursday after Thursday, we are forever complaining, but what comes of it all.
Human rights violations obviously lead to a tangled web of consequences.
It should be stated that one such consequence concerns the cooperation between various large financial and economic institutions that are generally perfectly legal and the criminal regimes in power in the countries concerned.
It has emerged that there is a group of large financial corporations that collaborates with various bigwigs and local dictators to oppress their own people.
Sadly, it is often the case that those countries were better off during colonial times.
True, they were governed by the colonial powers, but criminal links between large foreign financial entities and local regimes were less common.
As Mr Matsakis has rightly pointed out, there are links of this sort in Burma, to name but one example.
Should something be done about that?
author. - (DE) Mr President, this afternoon we are discussing three states - Burma, Sierra Leone and Bangladesh - which count among the poorest in the world, although that really applies to their populations, not the states themselves.
The reason, of course, lies in the lack of democracy - although the situation in the three countries of course varies considerably in this respect - and in the exploitation of the population and, above all, the human rights abuses of every kind.
The contents of the recitals in this first resolution on Burma are especially shocking.
Indeed, they are horrific and, for us as privileged Europeans, they should be a wake-up call.
The abuses inflicted by this military regime on individuals, and especially on the various minorities - I would like to mention the Karen people in particular here - are hair-raising.
We cannot simply look away.
I would like to add something that is not really highlighted in this motion.
The Greens are very pleased to support the contents of this motion because it is entirely justified in social policy terms and from a human rights perspective.
However, I believe that the environmental disasters resulting from this military regime should also be emphasised rather more forcefully.
I would like to give you an example: there are plans to build a massive dam, which will result in 10 million people - just think about that for a moment - having to be resettled.
The activities of this military regime can only be countered by the most stringent joint measures by the EU, the UN and the nations of the world.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (GA) Mr President, I am happy to be speaking in Parliament for the first time on a subject as important as human rights.
We find ourselves today having to strongly react, once again, to the unacceptable actions of the military junta in Burma.
Our last urgency resolution on Burma was only in June.
The recent crackdown on peaceful protesters, who were demonstrating their right to associate, has merited yet another condemnation by the European Parliament.
The scant regard the ruling State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) has for its own people has become all the more evident with their recent imposition of a fuel price increase of 500%.
The SPDC clearly wants to further impoverish its people.
But Burmese civilians have shown unbridled bravery in coming out to demonstrate.
Not only were demonstrators beaten violently by police, but multiple arrests were made and members of the 88 Generation Students group have been reimprisoned.
I call for the immediate and unconditional release of all those who have been detained since protests began as well as Aung San Suu Kyi, probably the world's most famous imprisoned democratic leader.
Furthermore, the new constitution, recently drafted by the National Convention in Burma, is a sham given the simple reason that no democratically elected members of the opposition were involved in the drafting process.
This Parliament now leads the call for an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council to consider the recent events in Burma.
We need a strong and binding resolution on Burma at this level, as this crisis now impacts upon the overall security of this region.
Countries like China and Russia, who prevented the adoption of the last UN Security Council resolution on Burma and China of this year, need to play a more responsible role regarding this country and should lend their support to any future UN resolution.
All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing.
The international community is doing little, while the Burma junta is perpetrating atrocities against its own people.
How long can we justify allowing this evil to reign?
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, I had the privilege almost a decade ago to visit Aung San Suu Kyi under house arrest in Rangoon, when she made it absolutely clear that the way forward that she saw for Burma was for the EU to impose rigorous sanctions against the regime.
Ten years on, little has changed.
Our sanctions are ineffective.
She is still imprisoned and, as we have seen, the economy continues to deteriorate.
I welcome the statement by Gordon Brown last week that he would take a lead in action against Burma, and I welcome, in our resolution, paragraph 10, which recognises the important role that ASEAN is now playing with respect to Burma, paragraph 14, demanding that China, Russia and India use their best endeavours to put pressure on the current regime, and paragraph 20, calling for a new UN Security Council resolution.
That is the only way we can strengthen the global response to try and put pressure on the regime to finally buckle and bend.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (PL) Mr President, this is already the third occasion during this parliamentary term on which I have taken the floor during a debate on human rights to speak about the social and political situation in Burma.
Human rights have been infringed in that country for many years.
There is widespread persecution, not only of pro-democracy activists but also of the rest of the population, 30% of which is living on the verge of poverty.
People are being obliged to carry out forced labour and are being forcibly resettled.
This time the protests and persecution intensified following a 500% rise in the cost of fuel due to the government withdrawing its subsidy.
Organisations defending human rights are sending out alarming information on the arrest of some 100 activists and the illegal detention of Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, for yet another year.
We support the resolutions.
They will not, however, have any impact on the situation in Burma.
The regime currently in power there does not react to any pressure, and more radical measures are therefore required.
(PL) Mr President, this is not the first debate on cases of breaches of human rights, democracy and the rule of law in Burma and it will certainly not be the last.
When we discussed the resolution on Burma in the PPE-DE Group yesterday, we came to the conclusion that the motion for a resolution is very good but the situation in Burma is very bad.
I am sure many of us would like things to be the other way around and the situation in Burma to be such that we were not required to adopt a resolution of any kind.
In Burma the army is pacifying regions inhabited by ethnic minorities.
The army regularly arrests opposition activists and it harasses ordinary citizens protesting against price increases and the further reduction of what is already a horrifyingly low standard of living.
What can we do about this?
The European Council should carry out a detailed study of the weaknesses of the sanctions system with a view to the latter becoming a really useful and effective weapon in the war against the political regime in Burma.
It is essential to exert further pressure on China and Russia so that the situation in Burma can eventually be discussed at the United Nations Security Council.
In addition, we should make every effort to ensure that EU aid, which will amount to EUR 65 million over the next few years, should go directly to the citizens of Burma and not serve to support the regime.
(DE) Mr President, the military dictatorship in Burma features regularly on the European Parliament's agenda for its grave and most severe human rights violations.
Like all the previous speakers, we view with regret the crackdown on the peaceful demonstrations, which were directed against the massive fuel price increase of 500%.
This fuel price increase resulted in a doubling of transport costs and massive price rises for essential goods and services, all against the backdrop of disastrous social conditions in Burma, where 90% of the population lives below the poverty line and survives on less than one dollar a day, and one child in three under the age of five suffers from severe malnutrition.
We view with regret the violent assaults on civilians, the particularly brutal attacks on women and the detention of more than 100 people, and call for their immediate and unconditional release, including the release of the leaders of the 88 Generation Students group.
I wish to stress that we should also intensify pressure on China, India and Russia so that these countries bring their influence to bear on the Burmese regime and stop supplying it with weapons so that substantial improvements can be achieved.
Mr President, we have yet another resolution telling us of the terrible human rights abuses that continue to take place in Burma.
This latest extended and illegal house arrest of an innocent woman is unacceptable.
Burma is effectively a prison country which operates under a repressive system of military rule.
Burma has been designated a country of particular concern by the US for violating religious freedom.
The Burmese military closely monitors and restricts organisations, activity and expression of all religions because they view them as threats to so-called 'national unity'.
In particular, abuses against Christians in Burma are widespread and systematic.
Christians suffer a deliberate campaign of discrimination in their work, restrictions on churches, meetings and literature and the arrest, torture and imprisonment of pastors and church workers.
Burma's military regime has no moral or legal justification for their activities of any type.
Such human rights abuses cannot continue.
We, in Europe, need to stand up to military powers like Burma, regardless of the trade advantage with Burma or their patrons like China; otherwise our resolutions will remain ineffective.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the crackdown on peaceful protestors on the last day of August has once again spotlighted the scandal of human rights in Burma, and the Commission remains very worried about this situation.
We believe that the military regime is a threat to the region and, most of all, to the country and the people of Burma.
A large part of the population of 52 million is in anguish and poverty, which is the result of bad political and economic governance.
In an environment of political, social and economic insecurity, issues of human rights are sadly taking backstage, and the most recent detention of political activists is a case in point.
The overriding challenge for the Government - national reconciliation and economic development - is obvious.
But for the international community, helping the transition of Burma towards being a more open and more developed society to be led by a legitimate and civilian government must remain the paramount goal.
The National Convention process, which has just finished, was a very formal procedure to boost the current regime's power.
It was certainly not a genuine exercise to draft a new constitution and was far from inclusive.
That is why the Commission fully shares the view of the United States Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who has requested the Government embark on an inclusive, participatory and transparent process, with a view to allowing all the relevant parties to Myanmar's national reconciliation process to fully contribute to defining the country's future.
We also welcome the work of Ibrahim Gambari, as Special Envoy for Myanmar of the United Nations Secretary-General.
We hope that the good offices of the United Nations will continue.
Professor Gambari is due to visit Myanmar shortly.
We criticise, specifically, the working conditions in the country for the Red Cross.
The Government, in its own interests and out of respect for international humanitarian law, should allow the International Committee of the Red Cross to continue its mission.
At the same time, we should note a few encouraging signals.
The Commission hopes that the recent arrangement between the Government of Burma and the ILO, handling the complaints against forced labour, will help the victims.
We acknowledge that the Government has agreed in early August with its ASEAN partners to the inclusion of a human rights commission in the planned ASEAN Charter, the constitutional document.
What can the EU do?
An effective policy should aim at bringing the country back into the international community, allowing for political, social and economic development.
The EU common position reflects this need; it is a balanced document, detailing our criticisms, while engaging Government over its responsibilities and offering assistance to the people.
As regards engaging the regime, there is a consensus that more needs to be done, not less.
Isolation will only make the population pay a greater price.
The Commission maintains that channels of communication with the Government must be kept open, notably to convey our concerns about human rights and, in this regard, the Commission uses all appropriate occasions, for instance the ASEM meetings, and the EU ASEAN meetings, to raise the need for an inclusive dialogue among all stakeholders.
We regularly press for national reconciliation and for the liberation of political detainees.
To help the people of Myanmar, and specifically the most vulnerable parts of the population, the Commission is increasing its assistance programmes in quantitative and in qualitative terms.
A new country strategy foresees support for health and basic education, for instance the Three Diseases Fund, which is supported by the EU and its partner, is already working well to fights AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis.
This comes on top of our significant humanitarian aid.
In particular, as foreseen in the EU common position, the European Union wishes to engage the Government in a critical dialogue over its responsibilities to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, and the Commission hopes that the Government is prepared to step up the existing dialogue in areas of health and education, among others.
Unfortunately, we do not believe that additional restrictive measures will push the Government in the desired direction or will alleviate the suffering of the people.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at the end of this afternoon's debates.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - (FI) Mr President, in 1990 the National League for Democracy won the democratic elections in Burma.
A military junta placed the party's leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, under house arrest.
In 2007 Myanmar's Peace and Development Council continues its oppression.
Aung San Suu, who was elected leader in Burma's elections, remains under arrest.
Burma is an example of how, as long as the will of the people is suppressed by means of house arrest and imprisonment, society suffers.
Human rights and legal order do not prevail.
Ninety per cent of the people live below the poverty line.
The country's dwindling economy and poor humanitarian record worsened again this year when Myanmar's junta raised fuel prices in August.
In the quest for a solution the EU's role is prominent in the United Nations Security Council and the Human Rights Council.
The European Member States must show strength and take responsibility for the plight of the Burmese people.
The keys to the solution, however, are mainly in the hands of China, Russia and India.
China has already exercised its right of veto in the Security Council and blocked a resolution on Burma.
A highly regarded position in the international community does not come free. It has to be earned.
Attempts by the West to enforce a rapid democratisation of despotic regimes in the world have failed.
It has been said that democracy is not a product that can be exported.
Some have thought it to be the white man's illusion.
People have asked whether rule by the people is even the right way to govern a country.
Is it a suitable option everywhere?
The problem with the world, however, is not that democracy should be won with fire and sword. The problem is that it is suppressed with fire and sword.
2.
Bangladesh
The next item is the debate on six motions for a resolution on Bangladesh.
author. - Mr President, Bangladesh is a country that I have visited many times and one of which I am very fond.
Indeed, I have many friends of Bangladeshi origin in London and I follow the political situation there very closely.
This resolution acknowledges that the situation has deteriorated significantly in recent months, such that there are now real concerns about law and order, human rights and, indeed, the mere survival of democracy in that country, which is highlighted throughout this resolution.
When the electoral process was suspended in January, I think most of us hoped it would just be a matter of weeks before elections could take place, but the weeks have become months, and months have now become years, before a new democratically-elected government can be in place.
In the mean time, we have the unconstitutional and unsatisfactory situation of a civilian caretaker government with the support of the military trying to keep law and order in an increasingly desperate and violent climate.
Two former prime ministers are in jail.
There have been riots at the university, hundreds of arrests (including of academics) and allegations of assaults and torture.
This cannot be the way forward and, as paragraph 11 makes clear, I am sure we in the European Parliament stand ready to help and assist to bring the return of democracy to Bangladesh as soon as possible.
author. - Mr President, Bangladesh is territorially about the same size as Greece but has a population almost twice that of Germany.
It became a nation only in 1971 following years of civil war which involved neighbouring ex-British colonies, Pakistan and India.
Bangladesh suffered 15 years of military dictatorship and, although civilian government was restored in 1990, the country is far from having a true democracy.
Today, it is a very poor nation plagued by widespread corruption, political interference by the military, severe abuses of human rights, bans on political activities, discrimination against women, religious extremism and a long list of other evils, some of which are mentioned in the resolution.
Yet, as is stated clearly in Recital N: 'the EU and Bangladesh have good long-lasting relations and are important economic partners'.
This is true, but so much for choosing our friends and partners and so much for being successful in helping such friendly nations to improve their state of prosperity, their level of democracy and the rule of law.
In fairness, the EU has tried to improve things in Bangladesh, but has it tried hard enough?
Has the aid given to Bangladesh been directed properly at improving the nation's productivity infrastructure or has it been deviated into the pockets of corrupt officials?
Has the pressure on the military to stop interfering with the nation's political life been severe and determined enough, or has it been weak and ineffective?
One can provide one's own answers to these questions.
However, my view is that we are a long way from doing what is necessary; there is an urgent need to review our policy on Bangladesh, not excluding the implementation of sanctions and certainly including the serving of stern warnings to neighbouring Pakistan and India to resist the temptation of interfering in the internal affairs of Bangladesh.
author. - Mr President, like my colleague Robert Evans, I also represent, in London, our region, over 150 000 constituents of Bangladeshi origin.
Bangladesh is a large and strategic South Asian country, and once again regrettably is in the news with the August student demonstrations and the arrest of three former prime ministers in a process aimed at combating corruption, but unfortunately and perversely having the appearance of attempting to stifle the democratic, albeit deeply divided, political classes.
The caretaker government has reassured the EU and the USA that it will proceed to democratic elections at the end of 2008, once the electoral registration process is completed and robust enough against electoral fraud.
However, the timescale appears very long, and there are suspicions that the military, whose profile politically has recently risen, are keen to radically alter the political complexion of the country by removing from circulation the two warring protagonists, ex-prime ministers Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia.
It is difficult to understand why they are not released on bail pending trial, and furthermore why the initial arrests were so melodramatic and lacking in due process under the emergency powers - which this resolution rightly calls for to be lifted, as well as calling for EU diplomatic observers to be present at the two ladies' trials.
Certainly, Western aid donors are watching Bangladesh very carefully, given the concerns about the deteriorating human rights situation over the last few years and also increasing Islamist radicalisation of its society and a departure, very sadly, from its original course of secular multi-party democracy - a model we in the EU should strongly continue to support for that country.
author. - (PL) Mr President, the next country we are to discuss during this afternoon's debate is Bangladesh, where fundamental rights are also being breached.
Having heard about all these individual cases we are bound to wonder how such a situation can exist in a world that is increasingly subject to so-called globalisation, that is networked by economic organisations and even more so by political ones, a world that has seen the establishment of the United Nations and of the European Union on our own continent, and a world where there are so many organisations claiming to respect human beings.
We might well ask ourselves why globalisation of fundamental humanitarian principles has not taken place.
It seems to be a problem affecting our times and our organisations.
Everyone is interested in politics and economics, but when it comes to giving politics and economics a human dimension, so that no further harm is done to humble ordinary people, we appear to be helpless.
Commissioner Reding said a moment ago while we were discussing Burma that there is a danger that we will becomes helpless again and fail to react against these injustices.
We need to understand, however, that certain steps have to be taken and that there is an imbalance between the scale of our political activities, our economic activities and the extent of compliance with standard fundamental rights.
I should also like to draw attention to another issue.
In the declaration reference is made to the emergence of persecution for religious reasons amongst others.
I should like to point out that religious persecution is generally, though not always, directed against Christians, notably Catholics.
At a global level, Catholics are currently the group most frequently persecuted and killed for their faith.
We should stick to the facts and when we refer to persecution we should remember who is persecuting whom.
author. - (SV) Mr President, I think that Bangladesh has been a country of great hope.
It has religious freedom, women in rural areas have access to microcredit and we could see a local economy beginning to develop.
These positive trends have been quickly reversed, however, in a country where terror is spreading.
In order to tackle corruption, according to the government, journalists, lawyers, political actors and student activists are being imprisoned.
If I may say, putting everyone in prison is a bad way to tackle corruption, to say the least.
We promise that we will help Bangladesh on the path to democracy and there must be a will on the part of the government.
Before I finish, I want to raise something that is in the resolution, but which perhaps not many will talk about and which I think is important, as I have spent a lot of time with people in slums.
There were people in the old regime, in the ruling class, who took land, but when the government attempted to take back that land, millions of poor people, poor peasants and people in slums were evicted from their homes, from the last small shred of hope of survival which they had through a small piece of land.
We must also think of these people when we are fighting for democracy in Bangladesh, as they have the least voice of all.
They have the least power of all.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (PL) Mr President, the situation in Bangladesh is certainly worrying.
Action has been taken, however, with a view to holding elections at the appointed time.
There is concern, nevertheless, that the Election Commission's work programme presented in July 2007 will not be completed on time.
We should recall that the European Union's observation mission came to an end on 22 January, when the United Nations also withdrew its support.
We cannot abandon Bangladesh at this stage.
We must send observers with a broad remit.
The observers should also monitor criminal proceedings under way and arrests of ordinary citizens.
It is particularly important to exert pressure on the authorities to secure the freedom of the students arrested during the protests of 28 August 2007.
We should react swiftly, providing wide-ranging aid; if we fail to do so, we cannot expect the elections to take place at the appointed time.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PL) Mr President, almost a year has gone by since the last European Parliament resolution on Bangladesh.
Despite our high hopes the situation in the country has deteriorated.
The elections planned for January of this year did not take place and were postponed until the end of 2008.
With the support of the army, the interim government declared a state of emergency.
The current leadership is openly restricting all political activity and the freedom of the press and other media.
The individuals arrested include two former prime ministers, 160 leading politicians and over 100 000 civilians.
The brutal suppression of the student protests against the army at Dhaka University in August of this year gave rise to serious concern at international level.
In view of the aforementioned events, the Council and the European Commission should monitor the situation carefully.
They should press first and foremost for independent institutions and political parties in Bangladesh to be allowed to resume their activities.
It is essential to send another observation mission and provide technical assistance, which could make a positive contribution to preparations for free democratic elections.
Only if all the interested parties work together will it be possible to stabilise the situation in Bangladesh effectively.
Mr President, it is obviously a good thing that the human rights situation in Bangladesh is being exposed here in the northern hemisphere.
After all, we have seen the present regime attempting to silence the legitimate political protest of students and journalists through arbitrary arrests and detentions.
Since the new government took over in January 2007 more than 250 000 people have already been locked up.
Since the declaration of the state of emergency, the army has been responsible for countless cases of torture and murder.
However, I would really like to expose another issue, an issue that is endemic in that state and that carries on regardless of changes of government.
It is something that is often neglected by all kinds of human rights organisations, because evidently it is something that simply cannot be spoken about.
I am talking about the wholesale and systematic gang rape that takes place in Bangladesh.
The violence against women and young girls is one of the most heinous violations of human rights in that Islamic state.
This kind of violence encompasses sexual and domestic violence, gang rape, throwing acid over women and honour killings.
Whether or not people want to hear about it, it is undeniable that by means of these atrocities extremist Muslims want to cleanse Bangladesh of its religious minorities in order to transform the country into a monolithic, Islamic state.
Every government of Bangladesh has failed to act and this is a downright disgrace.
Bangladesh ratified the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women in 1984.
It is high time that Parliament sent out a very clear signal to the Bangladeshi Government to inform it of its responsibilities.
(ET) Ladies and gentlemen, neither the European Union nor the UN suspends its election observation missions lightly; unfortunately we had to do so in Bangladesh.
In January the activity of democracy was suspended with the support of the military in a country whose two main parties, in the only example of its kind in the world, are led by women.
I admit that combating coercion and corruption is important for an effective economy and politics, although dirty methods such as suppressing demonstrations, gagging the press and undermining fair judicial proceedings may not be employed to that end.
For nearly twenty-five years Bangladesh has been moving towards the European model.
Secularism, hand in hand with religious tolerance, human rights and freedom of speech are values which our Parliament supports with all possible means.
We should therefore do all we can to put Bangladesh back on the road of democracy.
The technical assistance to organise elections and the bipartite working groups are the least the European Union can do.
We demand an immediate end to the state of emergency and to military intervention.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the European Commission shares the concern at the human rights situation in Bangladesh articulated in the draft parliamentary resolutions.
The European Union, by the way, has a commendable history of constructive engagement on human rights and democracy with Bangladesh, and the decision to send an EU election observation mission to scrutinise the abortive 2007 elections and to suspend the mission in the face of the Awami League boycott and compelling evidence of efforts to rig the polls, is an example of that engagement.
In the wake of the formation of the military-backed caretaker Government and the declaration of a state of emergency in January 2007, the EU has sought to balance strong support for a return to democracy in 2008 with the rigorous monitoring of the human rights situation.
This is reflected in the European Commission's intention to extend substantial support, alongside eight other international development partners, to the development of a voter list with photos.
Parliament will recall that profound misgivings over the list prepared for the 2007 elections were a key factor in the postponement of the polls.
The EC delegation in Dhaka is closely following the voters' list pilot project and has provided highly positive feedback on the process.
The EU has, however, consistently made clear that progress on technical preparations for the elections must be matched by progress on political reforms, and as the EU troika underlined during its visit to Dhaka in June, the political parties must be implicated in the reform process as soon as possible.
In an encouraging move, the Bangladesh Election Commission has now announced a schedule for consultations with the 15 principal parties in the country.
The EU has made strong representations to the Government of Bangladesh, and to the military, on the need to ensure respect for the human rights and due process, most recently during a local EU troika dÃ©marche to the Foreign Affairs advisors on 8 August.
That dÃ©marche also provided the opportunity to raise seven individual cases of human rights violations.
The Government has provided detailed responses to some of those cases.
EU heads of mission will continue to pursue human rights concerns with the authorities, with a view to ensuring that those who have committed abuses are appropriately punished and the others released.
As to the specific case of United Nations Special Rapporteur, Sigma Huda, the head of the EC delegation in Dhaka has conveyed concerns regarding her medical condition and treatment to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
I understand that Mrs Suda is appealing the decision of the trial court, and the EC will follow the case very closely.
Support for human rights and good governance also constitutes one of the three priorities for the EC financial assistance to Bangladesh under the country strategy paper for 2007-2013, alongside human and social development and trade and economic development.
EUR 55 million have been earmarked for action under that priority for the period 2007 to 2010.
In conclusion, the European Commission remains optimistic that Bangladesh is on track to hold credible parliamentary elections in 2008.
We are extending substantial political and financial support to that goal, while - and I would like to underline this - remaining very vigilant on human rights and other concerns.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at the end of this afternoon's debates.
3.
Financing of the Special Court for Sierra Leone
The next item is the debate on six motions for a resolution on the financing of the Special Court for Sierra Leone.
I should point out that some of our colleagues are currently in Sierra Leone to monitor the elections there.
author. - (PL) Mr President, the development of international humanitarian law, together with the establishment of courts to try perpetrators of war crimes and crimes against humanity represented a mayor achievement by the international community after the Second World War.
The role of the aforementioned institutions has developed further in the era of globalisation, especially in areas where national leaders are unable to establish a central authority around governments based on the rule of law and ensure the fundamental security of the inhabitants concerned.
The Special Court for Sierra Leone is making a significant contribution to the cause of peace and justice in the Mano River region of West Africa.
I should like to highlight the programme undertaken by the Court involving the archiving and translation of documents relating to its work.
I should also like to mention the victim protection programmes it has set up.
Activities of this nature are crucial to the establishment of governments based on the rule of law in West Africa in the longer term.
In today's resolution on the financing of the Special Court for Sierra Leone the European Parliament is calling on the Commission and on all European and Member State institutions to guarantee the financial basis to enable the Court to complete its work in a measured and responsible manner.
author. - (PL) Mr President, it so happens that the next round of parliamentary elections is due to take place in Sierra Leone this coming weekend.
I cannot but express my regret that the European Parliament delegation previously planned will not be present there.
We might well ask ourselves why the Special Court for Sierra Leone is so important.
This is not simply a case of one more of the many African countries with a history of rape and murder.
It concerns the prestige and development of the international administration of justice in the area of criminal law.
We have recently witnessed two spectacular failures of this very system, and we should be honest with ourselves and recognise them as such.
I refer to the failed attempt to sentence Slobodan MiloÅ¡eviÄ and the exceedingly controversial circumstances surrounding the death of Saddam Hussein.
Should a further fiasco now occur in the wake of these much-publicised events, that is to say, should the Court be obliged to cease operations due to a lack of financial resources, it would amount to the coup de grÃ¢ce for international administration of justice in the area of criminal law.
To go into detail, what is at stake is the allocation of less than USD 90 million over the next two and a quarter years, with more than a third of the total to be transferred this year.
This is needed in order to ensure the continued operation of the Court.
The prestige of the administration of cross-border justice really does depend on the Special Court for Sierra Leone sentencing Charles Taylor, the former President of Liberia, and on it investigating 17 allegations of crimes against humanity and war crimes, including murders and sexual offences.
I should like publicly to thank two countries from the floor of this House, namely the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, which have provided significant financial support for the Court's activities.
The United Nations also has an important role to play.
It cannot behave like Pontius Pilate and simply wash its hands of the matter.
I am glad that the European Parliament will speak with one voice on this issue.
author. - Mr President, those who strongly support the respect for human rights - Members of this House included - have fought hard to ensure that a Special Court for Sierra Leone was set up and notorious killers, like Charles Taylor and his criminal mob, faced trial and punishment.
Those same people now view with disbelief the grim prospect that the effort to bring Charles Taylor to book may end up becoming a farce because the Special Court in The Hague ran out of money half way through the trial.
Such an eventuality will no doubt be a serious blow to international justice and it will make our citizens lose all faith in the rule of law and order.
Furthermore, it will send a very clear encouragement to criminals worldwide to pursue without fear their evil acts of committing genocides and other despicable atrocities against humanity.
Irrespective of the outcome of the plea to somehow keep this Special Court on Sierra Leone alive and functioning, one cannot help but raise the following issues.
Firstly, the USD 89 million requested by the court to conclude its operations is surely a vast amount of money.
How come it is so vast?
We all know that lawyers make a bomb, but not a nuclear bomb!
Could not such a court operate on a more economically efficient budget?
Are there perhaps expensive extravagances and gross inefficiencies resulting in large amounts of financial waste?
Secondly, how much did it cost for a very similar court in The Hague to try, to the extent that it did, Slobodan MiloÅ¡eviÄ?
Was the budget then not subject to limitations and why was that so?
Is it perhaps different to commit a crime against humanity in Europe than in Africa?
These questions need answers, which, from my experience in this House, I know I am not going to get, and our citizens may have to resign themselves to believing not that the rule of law holds true but that money rules the law.
author. - (DE) Mr President, West Africa was once known as a region where there was a great deal of positive development.
Today Sierra Leone has become a synonym for the particular horrors which we have witnessed across Africa over these past few years.
We therefore have a responsibility to ensure that the forthcoming elections not only help to restore democracy but also, and far more importantly, restore justice and the rule of law.
This must include the prosecution of the massive crimes that have taken place in this country.
After all, Europeans were among those who used Mr Taylor as a means by which to enrich themselves from, and in, Sierra Leone.
That is why I believe that the process of dealing with these crimes cannot be allowed to fail due to a lack of funds.
We Europeans have a responsibility in that regard, but I nonetheless believe that the questions that have been raised here are justified.
It is apparent that we will not make progress in the long term with ad hoc tribunals.
It is apparent that what we need in the long term is a single universal jurisdiction to deal with these criminal dictators.
However, that does not help us at the moment.
The first task now is to press ahead with the trials that have already begun and, in particular, to press ahead with securing the conviction of Mr Taylor, for that will send out a warning signal to criminals who are committing crimes against humanity today or who may do so in future: I would mention Zimbabwe's dictator, Mr Mugabe, in this context.
Mr Mugabe must be shown what could happen to him if he continues with his horrendous crimes.
That is why we need uniform criteria and stable institutions to deal with these massive crimes.
author. - (ES) Mr President, I was lucky enough to be part of the Election Observation Mission that participated in the elections held in August in Sierra Leone and I must say first and foremost that we were all extremely impressed with how professionally the mission, led by my Group colleague, Mrs Isler BÃ©guin, was run and is still being run.
As such, I had the opportunity to be able to visit the Special Court in situ and hear directly from Mrs Mansaray, head of the Registry, about the work the Court is doing.
During the visit we were constantly told that if there were no justice there would be no peace.
That is precisely why this Court is so important.
As stated many times in this resolution, it is crucial for the continued consolidation of the peace process in Sierra Leone to ensure that the crimes do not go unpunished
It was very expensive and it costs a lot of money because the Court's work has been of epic proportions; ensuring complete respect for the rule of law in a country that has been devastated by a civil war is very difficult.
The first task was to gather all the testimonies and that was no mean feat: the population had to be convinced that there would be no reprisals and that they would not be subjected to any more humiliation.
The second task was to convince the people that all those involved in human rights violations could be tried, not just the guerrilla leaders.
In addition, I must point out that the defence of the accused has been scrupulously respected.
The Court also took a historic decision in 2004 to refuse to recognise the applicability of a national amnesty for the perpetrators of war crimes and crimes against humanity.
Without justice then, there is no peace.
It is thus important to contribute to the funding of this Court.
We are obliged to contribute towards peace and stability in the Mano River region.
The Special Court is itself an example for the reform of Sierra Leone's judicial system and I would call on the Commission here to look into the possibility of providing financial support for the projects carried out by the United Nations with a view to reforming the country's judicial system.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (PL) Mr President, the Special Court for Sierra Leone is entitled to count on our particular attention, as it is rightly presented as a new and almost perfect model for the pursuit of justice.
Furthermore, it has proved that an international court dealing with war crimes may be located in the country where those crimes were committed, thus allowing local people to have direct access to justice.
In addition, if the Special Court for Sierra Leone is compared with similar bodies in other parts of the world, it can be seen that this arrangement has allowed the Court to be fully effective whilst incurring significantly lower costs.
For the first time in history an incumbent head of state of an African country, Charles Taylor, has been successfully convicted of crimes against humanity.
It has also proved possible to establish a legal definition of the notion of child soldiers and forced marriages, so as to enable those guilty of such crimes to be convicted.
The Special Court for Sierra Leone may unfortunately have to cease its operations as it is running out of funds.
The sum required to allow proceedings against the most notorious criminals to continue is less than USD 90 million.
I hereby call on all the Member States and on the Commission to provide funds to support the Special Court for Sierra Leone as soon as possible.
Continuation of the peace process and reconciliation in Sierra Leone and the whole of West Africa will be seriously threatened if funding for the Court does not become available.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PL) Mr President, Commissioner, I fully support all those who have appealed for this job to be seen through to the end and for justice to de dispensed in Sierra Leone.
This simply must happen.
The perpetrators of crimes cannot be allowed to believe that they will enjoy impunity, regardless of where they may reside, be it in Europe, in Africa or in any other part of the world.
I should, however, like to take this opportunity to highlight a particular problem, which I believe to be very significant.
We are witnessing a proliferation of courts established by the United Nations, a kind of mushrooming of criminal courts.
An International Criminal Court was set up in Rome.
An International Criminal Tribunal to deal with the crimes that took place in the former Yugoslavia was also set up, and another to deal with the crimes committed in Rwanda.
Now we have the Special Court for Sierra Leone.
I appreciate that all these courts are necessary, but if they are to be established their funding must be guaranteed from the outset.
That is a sine qua non.
I therefore call on the Commissioner to raise the matter of financing such institutions at the forthcoming EU-Africa summit, due to take place before the end of this year.
These institutions are necessary and must be properly funded.
It is embarrassing to have to discuss sums of this nature.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the European Commission is strongly committed to assisting in the transition of Sierra Leone from a situation of post-conflict to one of development and to support its efforts in sustaining peace, stability and democracy.
We have fully supported past, current and future actions of the Court in bringing perpetrators of war crimes to justice, thus recognising the suffering of the Sierra Leoneans during the civil war.
The work of the Special Court sends an important signal to everyone that serious crimes against humanity, genocide and war crimes will no longer remain unpunished, no matter where they have taken place.
The Commission has been providing financial assistance to the court since 2002.
This assistance was granted indirectly in 2002, by supporting the project worth almost EUR 685 000 through a coalition of NGOs led by No Peace Without Justice to identify human rights violations, to raise awareness among the legal profession and to provide legal assistance to the Government of Sierra Leone.
Since 2003, the Commission has provided the funds to the Special Court directly, through the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights as already mentioned.
An overall budget of about EUR 2.1 million has been allocated to the Court by means of three Victims' Justice and Legacy projects.
The overall objective of these projects was inter alia to ensure that the Special Court contributes to a broader understanding of justice for victims of the conflict.
Moreover, in 2006, the emphasis was given to the coverage and proximity of Charles Taylor's trial and it targeted civil society groups as well as the people of Liberia and the subregion.
The Special Court will be supported in 2008 by the new European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights, which was adopted in the context of the new Financial Framework 2007-2013.
The amount of EUR 600 000 has been reserved in the annual action plan from the 2007 budget.
The Commission is holding the talks with the Court to identify the project proposal for the 2007 funding.
It has been said several times by different Members that there are difficulties to find sufficient means for financing the Special Court.
That is why the Commission is considering raising this matter with the Member States and it is also exploring the possibility of financing the Court and its outreach activities through other financial instruments.
The debate is closed.
The vote is due to take place at the end of the debates, in other words in just a moment.
Debates on cases of breaches of human rights, democracy and the rule of law (debate)
1.
Burma (vote)
Resolution on Burma
2.
Bangladesh (vote)
Resolution on Bangladesh - After the vote on Amendment 2 to recital F:
Mr President, did you take my oral amendment to add the name of the third former prime minister, Mr Moudud Ahmed, to the original text?
It should have been taken first.
It was a technical adjustment.
I am not sure whether the voting order precluded doing so, but it should have been taken first in my view, and then the split vote.
According to the indications of the Sittings Service, Mr Tannock, your oral amendment was tabled in case of Amendment 2 being rejected.
Amendment 2 was adopted, however.
Thus, in principle, your oral amendment lapses.
Having said that, if the Members feel that we can add Mr Moudud Ahmed's name to the list in recital F, I have no objections.
Are there any objections to this oral amendment?
(Parliament agreed to accept the oral amendment)
3.
Financing of the Special Court for Sierra Leone (vote)
Resolution on the financing of the Special Court for Sierra Leone - Before the vote:
(DE) Mr President, my group had agreed to request roll-call votes.
Due to a technical error by a new member of staff, this does not appear to have been conveyed to you.
I would ask you to grant this request for a roll-call vote since something seems to have gone wrong on the technical side.
We are not going to set up a special court for your member of staff.
Thus, if there are no objections from the House, we will hold a roll-call vote during the final vote.
- Before the vote on paragraph 6:
Thank you.
In the absence of Mr Agnoletto, can I move the oral amendment to paragraph 6 on his behalf?
I think people will have it on their voting lists, but in case they don't, it reads 'invites the Commission to ensure continuing funding of both core and non-core activities of the Special Court in the forthcoming national programmes with Sierra Leone; invites the authorities of Sierra Leone to consider transitional justice and the independence of justice as a priority'.
(Parliament agreed to accept the oral amendment)
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have noticed that the images for the votes have changed.
However, for the roll-call vote it seems to me that the figures are male only, and given that there are ladies voting too I would ask that the images be adjusted to reflect reality.
That is a valid comment, but as there are only three figures it will be difficult to be fair to everyone.
We will therefore have to look at the number of figures.

Statements by the President
Ladies and gentlemen, we have learned with deep sorrow of the death of our former colleague, Nicholas Bethell, who was a Member of the European Parliament from 1975 to 1994 and again from 1999 to 2003.
Lord Bethell died on 8 September at the age of 69, following a long and courageous battle against Parkinson's disease.
During his many years as an MEP, Lord Bethell proved an outstanding Vice-President of what was then the Political Affairs Committee.
He devoted himself energetically to many issues, on which he also drafted reports: the liberalisation of air transport, the EU membership of Cyprus and the introduction of the Sakharov Prize, which over the years gave moral support to many people worldwide in their fight against oppression.
Let me say a few words on this subject.
Armed with his masterly knowledge of the Russian language and at considerable personal risk, Lord Bethell visited the Soviet Union on several occasions, where he made friends with many leading dissidents, such as Alexander Solzhenitsyn, Andrei Sakharov, Anatoly Shcharansky and Alexander Ginsburg.
He held discussions with them, interviewed them, campaigned for the release of those of them who were imprisoned and in general fought for the freedom of nations and for justice.
Lord Bethell translated two books by Alexander Solzhenitsyn into English.
He brought Anatoly Shcharansky and Elena Bonner, Sakharov's widow, to the European Parliament, not just once but on several occasions.
Lord Bethell was a colleague and a friend, who acted with conviction and set yardsticks.
We will remember him with gratitude.
Ladies and gentlemen, I have just heard that two Spanish soldiers have been killed by a mine in Afghanistan and others - also Spanish - have been seriously injured.
I would ask you to observe a minute's silence in memory of Lord Bethell and all victims of terrorism.
(The House rose and observed a minute's silence)
Thank you.
Ladies and gentlemen, we have taken note of the pro-democracy and freedom demonstrations in Burma/Myanmar.
I am sure I may express solidarity and sympathy on behalf of all of us. That goes in particular to Aung San Suu Kyi, a holder of the European Parliament's Sakharov Prize, who has been under house arrest for many years.
The European Parliament hopes that the time will come when we can welcome Aung San Suu Kyi here in the European Parliament and we call on the Myanmar authorities to release all the detainees immediately and grant them the right to demonstrate freely.
(Applause)
Approval of Minutes of previous sitting: see Minutes
(NL) Mr President, just a marginal note to this week's part-session.
As you know, the first round of voting for the 2007 Sakharov Prize will be taking place shortly.
There were five nominees.
The ITS Group had nominated a candidate too, the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople.
We now find that the Patriarch has been put under pressure not to stand.
To my knowledge nothing like this has ever happened in the whole of the time that European Parliament has awarded the Sakharov Prize.
He was happy for his name to be put forward by our Group - Mr Binev asked him and he was perfectly agreeable.
This is something quite intolerable.
As far as I know it has never happened before that someone has been pressured to withdraw his candidacy purely and simply because he was nominated by a group that rows against the mainstream.
Well, in protest at this kind of outrage, this kind of underhand political machination, I can tell you now that the ITS Group will not be voting in the upcoming election.
Mr Claeys, I have heard of the events you are talking about, but cannot give a view on the substance of what you say has occurred.
This is not really the right moment to inform Parliament; it should be done in a different form so that we can discuss this question.

Order of business
I hereby inform you that pursuant to Rule 68 of the Rules of Procedure, on Tuesday, 25 September the President of the Council and I will be signing four legislative acts adopted by the codecision procedure.
The titles of those legislative acts can be found in the Minutes of today's sitting.
The final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at their meeting of Thursday, 20 September 2007 pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed.
The following amendments have been proposed:
Monday:
No amendments.
Tuesday:
The PSE Group has requested that the report by Mr Zatloukal on efficiency and equity in European education and training systems be put back from Tuesday evening to Wednesday evening and taken after the report by Mrs Descamps.
(DE) Mr President, I will be very brief.
With several reports being taken together and the Saryusz-Wolski report postponed from Monday to Tuesday, there will be very little time to debate the Zakloukal report on Tuesday evening.
In agreement with the rapporteur, we would, therefore, prefer that report to be held over until Wednesday.
That is the only reason.
- Thank you, I am sure that was the reason for the proposed amendment.
(Parliament agreed to the request)
The report by Mr Zatloukal was postponed to the Wednesday night sitting.
Wednesday:
The Verts/ALE, GUE/NGL and ALDE Groups request that the statements by the Council and the Commission on the situation in Myanmar/Burma be put on the agenda for Wednesday afternoon, followed by the tabling of motions for resolution.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this House, as you have very rightly said, has already given its opinion on the situation in Burma on a number of occasions, but what is happening today was not happening in 1988.
Thousands and thousands of people, monks, are demonstrating and there is little doubt that events are on the move.
Up to now, the Community institutions, the Commission and the Council, have said nothing.
There have been a few reactions from this or that Member State.
In our view, therefore, Wednesday will be an excellent moment for a statement by the Council and the Commission and for a round of speakers from the political groups, if only to show our support for these new developments in Burma.
We cannot stay silent at this time and we have a duty to focus attention publicly on this country, because we have the opportunity to do so.
Therefore, I really hope that the plenary will accommodate the three groups tabling this proposal.
(NL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if ever there was a time for a communication from the Commission and Council focusing attention on the situation in a particular country, that time is now.
A brief discussion on Burma will give us the chance to express our solidarity with the events of the past few days there, and it is most important that we should do so.
There are enough of us who are very concerned at the situation of Myanmar, of the Burmese generally, and of Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi, to make time for this during the current part-session of Parliament - it need not take all that long.
(DE) Mr President, naturally we discussed this idea at length in our Group too.
We felt that this particular moment, with demonstrations happening on the ground, is perhaps not the right time for us - to put it rather colloquially - to put in our three ha'p'orth and express our view.
Our view in this connection is quite clear.
If, however, that is the wish of the House and it is also made clear that we are of course on the side of the demonstrators, as we have always said, then we could agree a compromise to the effect that we are in favour of a debate, as proposed, but will not table a resolution at this point, which does not preclude the possibility that next time, when we know how things stand, we also adopt a resolution.
My request, at least, is that we hold separate votes on whether to hold a debate and whether to table a resolution.
Thank you, Mr Swoboda.
That is precisely what I would like to propose.
First we vote on whether to hold a debate. If we vote in favour of a debate, we then come to the question of whether to table a resolution.
That is a logical and conclusive procedure.
Can we follow that procedure?
(Parliament approved the proposal)
(DE) Mr President, we did not know that the Liberal Group might want a resolution and, if so, that it would not be tabled until the next part-session.
That is a new situation.
We can all live with it.
That is why the proposal from the Liberal Group that you should now put to the vote is, if I understand it correctly, as follows: if the Groups agree to draft a resolution, it should be tabled during the next part-session.
That does not exactly mean that we have already reached agreement; it does mean, however, that if we do agree among ourselves, the resolution would be tabled during the next part-session.
We can all accept that.
First we have to decide whether we want a resolution and then, if we do want it, when we should adopt it.
(DE) Mr President, on a point of order: since this is a new matter we cannot simply say yes or no.
We should discuss it and not simply assume that just because they are Social Democrats our colleagues have spoken on behalf of all of us and can decide what is the reasonable way to proceed.
We would like to say something against it that may be even more reasonable.
I propose that first we vote on whether we want a resolution.
If we vote in favour, we will then decide whether the resolution will be taken this week or during the October part-session.
(DE) Mr President, of course we need a European Parliament resolution on this issue.
We have drafted resolutions, some of them lengthy, on many other occasions and in some cases we could not have claimed quite the same urgency.
Here we have a very concrete reason, here we have a very significant change in the situation of this country, which we have been observing for a long time.
It has already been pointed out that the leader of the opposition, who has been under house arrest for many years, has been awarded our Sakharov Prize but has not yet received it.
That is why we must react to these new developments with a resolution.
Yet there is no urgent need to do so this Wednesday.
We will be holding the debate on Wednesday and I would propose that we vote on a resolution at the following sitting.
We shall now vote on whether we want a resolution and will then hold a second vote on when we should adopt it.
(Parliament agreed to a resolution)
(DE) Mr President, I would like to say something about why we should decide now on a resolution.
Basically I do not understand this debate.
Everyone clapped when the President took a clear stand.
What the President said can surely be incorporated into a resolution that Parliament could adopt as early as this Thursday.
What is so difficult about condemning what is currently happening in Burma?
Where is the problem?
Who needs 10 or 20 days to say: we are on the side of those who are fighting for freedom in Burma, full stop!
It would take 10 lines!
If the Social Democrats or the EPP-ED cannot manage it, we will draft it for them.
We have already decided in favour of a resolution.
Shall we draft the resolution this week?
(Parliament approved the request)
I propose beginning Question Time not at 5.30 p.m. but at 6 p.m. to give us more time for the debate, while allocating the usual hour and a half to Question Time, i.e. from 6 p.m. to 7.30 p.m.
(Parliament agreed to the proposal)
Thursday:
No changes
Sitting on 10 and 11 October
Wednesday:
The Social Democratic Group has requested postponing the joint debate on the reports by Mrs Bowles and Mrs van den Burg on Community statistics to the October part-session in Strasbourg.
(DE) Mr President, we are requesting the postponement for the following reasons.
It should be possible for us to reach agreement with the Council at the first reading.
If, however, we held the debate as early as 10 October, it might not prove possible.
That is why we should postpone it.
I believe the rapporteur also agrees with this proposal.
I put to the vote the proposal for postponement to the October part-session.
(Parliament approved the proposal.)
Thursday:
No changes
(The order of business was adoptedÂ¹)
One-minute speeches on matters of political importance
The next item is one-minute speeches on matters of political importance pursuant to Rule 144 of the Rules of Procedure.
Mr President, we do appreciate your kind words about Nicholas Bethel.
His death a fortnight ago has led to many tributes from across the political spectrum.
As we debate the issue of human rights, something that presses upon us now as it always has, we should remember his enormous efforts.
We remember, and we are proud of, his award of the Schuman Medal in 2003, when, despite the ravages of his ill health, he delivered a moving and eloquent speech to members of our group.
For many people, his championing of the cause of both Nelson Mandela and Andrei Sakharov is something we should not forget.
A letter was written by Elena Bonner, the widow of Andrei Sakharov, to Nicholas Bethel's family a few days ago, in which she recognised that, without his help, the cause of Sakharov and many other dissidents in the then Soviet Union - and the nature of the repressive regime - would not have been properly recognised outside.
On behalf of the British Conservative delegation, I am proud to deliver a tribute to a courageous man.
Those of us who attended his funeral in London on Thursday saw and heard for themselves the immense pride and affection in which he was held by so many friends and colleagues outside as well as inside the political world.
Our thoughts and prayers are with his family at this time.
It was a privilege for me and for many of my colleagues in this Parliament to have served with him, a man of such distinction and humanity.
(Applause)
(ET) Ladies and gentlemen, Russia has started to show in a number of ways where, in its view, the borders of the European Union should lie.
Since August endless columns of cars have been standing at Narva border crossing in my homeland, Estonia.
On the worst days it takes over 100 hours to cross the border, with over 400 lorries queuing.
The situation on the border between Russia and Latvia is even worse.
The Kremlin has agreed to initial discussion of the issue in Moscow on 16 November, but that is still two months away.
I want to encourage the European Commission and the European Council to address the issue considerably sooner, at the next summit in a month's time on 26 October in Portugal.
It strikes me that the parties have an excellent opportunity here to improve relations by turning their attention to practical issues such as the trouble-free crossing of borders.
The free movement of goods is one of Europe's fundamental freedoms.
Russia, which aspires to membership of the WTO, cannot afford to behave like this.
After all, it also wants the support of our Union.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 30 October 1985, Altiero Spinelli, fearing that the Europe of nations, rather than the European nation, would very quickly undermine the 1984 reform of the European Parliament, entrusted us in this House with the task of continuing the European revolution.
I should simply like to quote what he said on 31 December: 'The European Parliament may censure the Commission, may bring about its resignation, may reject the budget, may vote for a budget other than that proposed by the Council, but the European Parliament must in particular forward its opinions to the Council.
Without these opinions, the Council cannot make decisions!'; Spinelli, who organised tens of meetings on this issue in the various European countries, concluded 'the European Parliament should have the courage to strike in support of its opinions.'
Mr President, we went for a military rather than a parliamentary operation to achieve a new structure, a new organisation of Europe.
It seems to me that the polls tell us clearly what the people of Europe think of this and of the bureaucratic Europe of nations and not the European nation.
We are aware of your revolutionary enthusiasm, Mr Pannella.
Yet we must keep to our Rules, and they provide for one-minute speeches.
You have been speaking for nearly two minutes.
(PL) Mr President, one of the Catholic institutions of higher education in Poland is currently applying for a grant from the European Union.
In our country's history, the Catholic religion has played an important role in the fight for freedom during the Communist era and, in general, has acted for the development of democracy.
One could even compare it to the role played by socialism in Franco's Spain.
Polish Catholicism has never done anything to harm the Jewish people.
However, I have heard that the Jewish people are trying to block this grant and have approached the President of the European Commission.
This is interference in Polish affairs and in Polish sensitivities as regards Europe, the Polish nation and religion.
The European Union should put its trust in the Poles concerned and not bow to pressure from lobby groups.
(DE) Mr President, Angela Merkel received the Dalai Lama at the Chancellery yesterday.
In the context of its strategy of isolating the Dalai Lama on the international stage, China requested Mrs Merkel not to meet him.
On several other occasions in the past, Beijing has called on the Federal Government to refuse him entry.
That shameless interference is all the more remarkable when we remember that next year China wants to play the gracious host of the Olympic Games.
We have seen this kind of brazen attempt to exert pressure in relation not only to the Tibetan people but to human rights in general.
That is why I support the Chinese candidate for this year's Sakharov Prize.
I seriously wonder what else we can expect in the year to come and what more needs to happen before Europe stops all too casually selling its system of values in return for economic interests.
That makes Mrs Merkel's action yesterday all the more encouraging!
(Applause)
(PT) - I should like to take this opportunity to express our solidarity with the soldiers and leaders of associations representing members of the armed forces who are the subject of disciplinary procedures in relation to their activity in such associations, for exercising and upholding the legitimate rights of members of the armed forces in Portugal, especially as regards the whole range of social and professional matters which these associations seek to promote as part of a necessary enhancement of the dignity of military life.
I would like to close by reminding you of the recommendation of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe of 11 April 2006 on the human rights of members of the armed forces, which states that members of the armed forces are citizens in uniform who must enjoy the same fundamental freedoms, including those set out in the European Convention on Human Rights and the European Social Charter, and the same protection of their rights and dignity as any other citizen.
In August, the President of this Parliament participated at the congress of the German Landsmannschaft.
His decision to support this organisation serves as an example of how the President is not capable of acting neutral when the interests of his country to rewrite history are involved.
Owing to such organisations and their misguided supporters, the German people may possibly believe the lie that Poland committed evil by accepting the historically Polish western territories on the Odra and Nysa from the hands of the Great Powers.
A Polish politician once wrote that the Anglo-Saxon parties to the Potsdam Treaty put forward a formula that we had been awarded the western territories by way of compensation for the loss of the eastern territories.
The Polish nation has rejected this formula and does not consider these territories as compensation by Russia for the eastern half of our fatherland.
The nation believes that the western territories are the compensation for guilt at crimes committed by Germans, compensation that has nothing to do with LwÃ³w and Wilno.
The President of this Parliament, an institution representing 27 nations, is expected to show objectivity and represent the common interests.
If Herr President has a problem with that, let him remain silent.
Europe does not need any more mawkish, moralising Christers who speak of peace and cooperation.
Mr Wojciechowski, since you have addressed me personally, let me say to you that the principles of the European Union are based on discussing things together, conducting a dialogue.
In my speech I spoke of reconciliation, and nobody in Poland could criticise a single sentence of my speech because it was a speech about reconciliation and your views are also represented.
I must tell you that I do not understand how you can criticise the fact of talking with people and endeavouring to convince.
I ask you to be fair and to do your part in bringing about reconciliation in Europe!
(Applause)
(DE) Mr President, specifically on a point of order, I am sorry that you responded in person just now.
I can understand that but I find it absolutely intolerable for the President of this Chamber to have to defend himself in person against such an unreasonable and inappropriate attack.
That is why I say this - and I hope I am speaking on behalf of all sensible Members of this House: both in this speech and in other, earlier speeches you have upheld the dignity of this House in an outstanding manner and defended the basic values of the European Union with dignity in every respect.
I thank you for that, and also for your speech in Poland!
(Applause)
Thank you very much, Mr Schulz.
It is certainly moving to hear such words from the Chairman of a large Group.
My warm thanks!
(RO) Mr. President, as known, on 25 November 2007, elections to the European Parliament will take place in Romania, the first ones of this type in our country's history.
An event of such a political, social and, as I said, historical importance, should mobilize the entire society so that the event could take place under the best conditions.
Unfortunately, this is not happening since the political scene in Romania is agitated by endless disputes, a situation that, in my opinion, does not favour the climate of stability required for the normal development of elections.
Moreover, if the no-confidence motion submitted today, two months before the elections, is adopted, and it has every chances of being adopted, taking into account that it is initiated by the most numerous opposition party, the political situation may become even worse, the main effect being the decrease in the population's interest in the elections to the European Parliament.
In this situation, I consider it opportune, and maybe even necessary, for the political forces in the European Parliament to join the Romanian ones in order to normalize the conditions for carrying out the elections.
(FR) Mr President, I would simply like to add that I have just returned from a four-day visit to Poland.
I had a good look around and I talked to Polish people, and I am pleased to report that I did not meet any who took the same tone as our colleague here.
I found the Poles to be thoroughly European.
I also laid a wreath at Auschwitz-Birkenau: I believe that people from every country in Europe have been there and I believe that all of us - including yourself, most particularly, Mr President - are determined such things will never happen again!
So I am pleased to say that what we have just heard was not the voice of Poland, nor of the ordinary Polish citizen; it was the voice of dangerous people, whose dangerous thinking would be capable of taking us back to the days of concentration camps.
I will not mince my words here. Never again!
And, above all, let us never again hear this sort of hatred expressed in the European Parliament!
(Applause)
(SK) There may be debate later about what I want to say.
In 2002 former Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor OrbÃ¡n appeared before the European Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs. He stated that the decrees of President BeneÅ¡ were incompatible with EU law.
The European Commission subsequently carried out an analysis of this matter. The conclusion was that the European Commission considers the issue of the decrees of President BeneÅ¡ to be resolved and closed.
As a result of constant efforts to open up these decrees, last week the National Council of the Slovak Republic adopted a resolution on the inviolability of post-war documents.
The resolution, which condemns the principle of collective guilt, was supported by members of the coalition and opposition parties.
History cannot be reversed or changed.
A situation that occurred in exceptional circumstances must be viewed in the context of the time in which it occurred.
Challenging and revising the post-war order of Europe is not what the majority of progressive and positive thinking Europeans expect of us.
Our common aim is peace, cooperation and resolution of the problems facing people who live in the here and now.
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very keen to draw your attention to the resolution that was adopted last Thursday in the Slovak Parliament.
That resolution does not reflect a European spirit, it does not reflect a spirit of reconciliation and understanding, but instead says that the decrees that came into force after the Second World War, the BeneÅ¡ decrees, are still fully applicable today.
The explanatory statement equates the Hungarian and German minority with traitors and enemies.
I want to point out that we as a European Parliament - and I have already written to the President too - should send out a clear signal that this is not the spirit that should inspire us in Europe but that we should be working together on the construction of Europe and building up a common future.
(Applause)
(DE) Mr President, I am loathe to speak on this matter, but I have a request to all Members taking part, whether it be Mr Ferber, or Mr MaÅka, who belongs to my Group.
What has been happening in some EU Member States and their parliaments over the past weeks gives cause for concern.
Every one of us in this House knows that even if the Slovak Parliament adopts a resolution of this kind, the BeneÅ¡ decrees can no longer have any legal effect.
On their accession to the European Union, all Member States who join it have committed themselves to basic values, which makes any further discussion of the issue Mr Ferber has brought up unnecessary.
That brings us up against the question: what are we as a European Parliament doing to calm the situation down?
In my view we should not start interpreting the text - and incidentally I did not find the phrases you used in the text - but take a different approach.
The European Parliament, instead of fuelling the tensions with controversial debates, could decide to take a different approach and apply the procedures for resolving disputes that we use in our own everyday work in this case too.
That would mean saying that the mission of this Parliament 60 years after the end of the war is not to conjure up the ghosts of 1945, but instead to convey the spirit of cooperation of 2007.
One way to do this would be through a dialogue, which does not have to take place here in plenary.
I therefore call on all colleagues in my Group, as in your Group and all the other Groups, to try to calm the situation down instead of aggravating it by statements designed for media effect, which is what I think they are.
We are not holding a debate now.
Mr Ferber, there is no provision for Members to answer one another.
(Heckling)
(DE) Mr President, I would ask Members to take note of what this item on the agenda is actually about.
If Mr Schulz feels he has to comment on every second or third speech, that is his problem.
But if he is interested in having a real debate here, then I would be pleased if he would support our Group's request to hold a debate on this subject in this House at the earliest opportunity.
(Exchange of views with microphones switched off)
I hope this matter will be resolved amicably.
(SL) Thank you very much, Mr President.
Last week several Slovenian provinces were badly affected by a natural disaster - the worst flooding in living memory.
Six people lost their lives and initial assessments put the material damage at at least EUR 200 million.
People have started to rebuild in the affected areas.
They are being assisted by the government and large numbers of volunteers, but the scale of the damage is such that we are justifiably also relying on solidarity from the European Union.
I am pleased that the European Union has already announced that it will give the matter due attention in terms of aid.
Thank you very much too for your attention.
(HU) Mr President, last week the National Council of the Slovak Republic passed a resolution affirming the inviolability of the BeneÅ¡ Decrees.
Based on the principle of collective guilt, these decrees deprived ethnic Hungarians and Germans of their assets, of the possibility of exercising their civil rights, and often even deprived them of their personal freedom.
This was a shameful thing even at the time, but it is especially shameful that in the 21st century, 60 years after the events took place, a Member State of the European Union should have tabled this motion and reaffirmed it.
Of course it comes as no surprise that this is happening in a Slovakia which is currently in the process of ratifying a law naming Hlinka, leader of the semi-fascist Slovak state, as father of the Slovak nation.
It is happening in a Slovakia where, moreover, JÃ¡n Slota says the trouble is that they have not been able to rid the country of Hungarians, and that this is the source of all their problems.
I think that every democrat has an obligation - and I say this with all due respect to Mr Schulz too - to condemn all such attempts to resurrect the terrible and shameful events of 60 years ago.
Thank you.
(SK) In August this year an extreme right-wing group known as the 'Hungarian Guard' was formed in the Republic of Hungary.
The Guard's aim is to protect Hungary from attacks from neighbouring countries but its officials are stating that they will never abandon their demand that all Hungarians should live in one state.
The Hungarian authorities have not challenged the activities of this nationalist group and have enabled it to register, thereby legalising its activities.
The group's first public event was even attended by a FIDESZ party member of the Hungarian Parliament. The formation of this group is causing anxiety and fear in neighbouring countries, primarily Slovakia, Romania and Serbia.
In the light of the increasingly radical views of certain Hungarian political circles, the Slovak Parliament has adopted a declaration on the inviolability of post-war documents governing the post-war order in Central Europe.
(HU) Mr President, this debate again demonstrates that we newcomer nations should follow the example of the old Member States of the European Union in terms of how German and French people achieved reconciliation, how the Italians and Austrians achieved agreement on South Tyrol, how Dutch and Germans, Germans and Danes, Germans and Belgians resolved centuries-old conflicts.
My message to everyone in this House is that the way to respond to nationalism is not with more nationalism, but by condemning nationalism, and first and foremost by condemning and combating our own nationalism.
The European Union's fifty-year history has been a history of reconciliation among its peoples and ethnic groups, of atonement and self-examination by its peoples following the Second World War.
Willy Brandt's historic gesture of kneeling in Warsaw may have contributed to enabling the German nation to hold their heads high and become a great people and a respected nation in Europe once more.
Asking other peoples or ethnic minorities for forgiveness, acknowledging our past errors and crimes cannot, will not ever diminish the stature of a people or nation; on the contrary, only by doing so can a people or nation become great.
We know full well that the notion of collective guilt has led to universal conflagration and to the extermination and prostration of peoples.
My message is that there is no alternative to a historic Hungarian-Slovak reconciliation either for the Slovak majority, the Hungarian minority in Slovakia, or for relations between Hungary and Slovakia.
Thank you for your attention.
(RO) Mr. President, on 14 September, I submitted a resolution proposal to the Private Office of the President of the European Parliament regarding compliance with the linguistic rights of Romanian communities in Europe and the conservation of the Romanian language in the context of promoting multilingualism and cultural diversity.
At the end of August, an unprecedented testimony was the exchange of opinions with the members of the IlaÅcu group, which took place in the Sub-Commission for Human Rights.
They spoke about the closing down of Romanian language schools and about the fact that books written in the Romanian language are burnt in the Transnistrian region of Moldova.
Also, I have received numerous complaints at my parliamentary office from the Romanian community of Valea Timocului in Serbia, in relation to the prohibition of the right to learn and pray in the Romanian language.
The same things can be said about the Romanian communities in Bulgaria and Ukraine.
In the context of the beginning of 2008, a year of intercultural dialogue and attention given by the European Union to promoting cultural diversity, as well as by creating the position of Commissioner responsible for multilingualism in 2007, I believe we cannot ignore the situation of continuous infringement of the linguistic rights of Romanian communities.
We must promote their protection, both within the foreign policy and the internal policy of the European Union, to find solutions for improving the current situation.
(RO) Mr. President, the European press has presented a series of abuses committed by employers from the European Union Member States against seasonal or permanent workers coming from the newly acceded countries, abuses associated with serious infringements of the labour legislation.
Such regrettable cases are possible due to the fact that the newcomers are not aware of their rights on the labour market, the relevant legislation and, especially, the institutions competent to protect them.
This is the reason why I firmly request the European Union to urgently establish offices, in all Member States, for free legal consulting on labour law for workers coming from other Member States.
I also consider that, for regulating such situations, the Commission also has to take into account measures for encouraging and facilitating the migration of labour forces between Member States.
(PL) Mr President, for us Poles the Gdansk shipyard is not just the birthplace of 'Solidarity', it is also a symbol of the changes that have taken place both on a national and international level.
It is also a symbol of freedom and partnership.
At present there is a conflict between the Board of the shipyard and the European Commission, which is demanding a drastic reduction in the shipyard's capacity and the closure of two slipways, or else the refund of state aid.
I would like to make public here that the Gdansk shipyard was the beneficiary that received the lowest subsidies and despite that was the only one of them to make a profit in the first six months of this year.
If the shipyard were to give in and accept these conditions, then, practically speaking, this would be the end of this symbolic shipyard that has done so much to deserve assistance.
The supervisory board of the shipyard has decided to increase the initial capital by PLN 300 million, which would be allocated for additional investment.
It is still possible to save this shipyard.
I believe that saving this workplace would be an honourable action not just for Poles, but also for the European Union.
Today the workforce and I ask that the Members sign declaration no. 81 concerning the future of the Gdansk shipyard.
In addition, on a formal issue, Mr President, could I say a couple of words since I have the floor?
I would like to ask who gave Mr Schulz the job of censor?
He does this job without politeness, without manners, he interferes in debates and speaks out of turn.
I would also add that he certainly does not have the majority behind him.
(EL) Mr President, we returned last week from Palestine where we in the Committee on Development were fortunate enough to see the current situation both in the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip.
The Gaza Strip has reached crisis point.
What was once an open jail is now the scene of a catastrophe because the Israeli authorities have decided to ban imports.
Hospitals, for instance, have medicines but no spare parts for their equipment.
Roads are piled with rubbish and there is a danger of tanks overflowing with effluent.
In short, the humanitarian situation is desperate.
People in Gaza are living on the breadline; the difference between the two Palestinian territories is beginning to become obvious.
We as a Parliament must therefore take action to free Gaza from its isolation and to bring about a sustainable solution based on the needs of a whole nation rather than those of the inhabitants of one side.
(DE) Mr President, like my colleague and friend Milan HorÃ¡Äek I wanted to address an event that occurred yesterday.
Chancellor Angela Merkel was the first German Head of Government to receive the Dalai Lama, in Berlin.
She has stood firm against all the verbal attacks and disparaging personal remarks made by the Chinese.
She has repeated that she is prepared to support the Tibetan people in their aspiration towards cultural and religious identity and desire to achieve genuine autonomy.
Our European Parliament, which is the voice of human rights throughout the world, also endorses the non-violent approach the Dalai Lama has consistently followed.
Let yesterday's event set an example throughout the European Union.
It should encourage our Member State governments never to give in to China, not even under economic and political pressure.
(Applause)
Mr President, my point is simple: as energy becomes the focal point in international politics and as efforts to create a single EU energy market are increasingly resisted by the existing national monopolies, the efforts of the same Union to further integrate the foreign policies of its Member States into a common foreign and security policy would be consequently undermined, because, on the import side, Member States seek to continue to secure preferential deals with the major suppliers and, on the export side, they would attempt to extract maximum gain from unilateral policies.
The effects are already visible: in spite of the hard talk at Union level, the truth is that, instead of reducing its current energy dependency, the EU is becoming more and more dependent on Russian and/or Russian-controlled energy supplies.
Not that a substantive relationship with Russia is a bad thing in itself, but, the more substantive it gets, the more unbalanced it tends to get too.
As a citizen of a country with enough experience in the matter, I know how difficult it is to keep politics away from trying to exploit such an economic dependency.
(SL) Mr President, I have drawn attention on a number of occasions to the Slovenian minorities in Italy and Austria but on this occasion I welcome the Italian Government's actions last year aimed at implementing a law to protect the Slovenian minority, namely the establishment of a list of 32 municipalities in the Friuli-Venezia Giulia Region and support for the building of a Slovenian school in San Pietro al Natisone and Slavia Veneta.
These measures will ease the lives of the Slovenian minority in Italy and satisfy at least some of their rights and needs.
However, I also call upon the Austrian Government and our fellow Austrian MEPs to do their utmost to ensure that Austria also makes the earliest possible start on implementing in full Article 7 of the Austrian State Treaty.
I refer in particular to paragraph 3 which in principle guarantees the Slovenian minority the right to bilingual signs.
This will promote coexistence and even better relations between the countries concerned and also relations within the European Union.
Mr President, I rise to make a protest and a proposal.
I want to protest against the actions of the Polish Government in blocking a decision in Council to have a Europe-wide declaration regarding the abolition of the death penalty on 10 October 2007.
I believe that delivers a very bad signal to the many countries around the world which persist in retaining the death penalty, some of which execute children and people with mental disabilities.
Something like 5 000 people are executed by states every year and 28 000 people languish on death row, so it is inexcusable that a full Member State of the European Union should in any way deliver an opinion which seeks to undermine the argument for ending the death penalty.
I wish to propose that you undertake an initiative for this Parliament to mark 10 October in a special way, and that you encourage the Member States of the European Union, and all the parliaments of the Member States, to do likewise.
Mr President, I rise on an issue of an animal disease, blue tongue, which has spread through Europe - through France, Germany, Luxembourg and Belgium; and now we have one case in the UK.
It is a difficult disease to find and it is a difficult one to diagnose, and the long-term solution is a vaccine.
I recommend to this Parliament, the Commission and the Council that we do everything in our power to get a vaccination in place, because this disease has killed over 1.8 million cattle and sheep in the last 10 years in Europe.
So we need to do something about it seriously.
I would urge you to put all pressure on the Commission, the Council and this Parliament to get a vaccine available.
This item is closed.
Road Map for renewable energy in Europe (debate)
The next item is the report by Britta Thomsen, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on a Road Map for renewable energy in Europe.
rapporteur. - (DA) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the committee members for their excellent and constructive cooperation in connection with the report.
I am pleased that we are now placing renewable energy high on the agenda, as renewable energy will constitute a vital cornerstone for Europe in demonstrating to the rest of the world that we can actually fight climate change and secure energy supplies for our citizens.
I consider my report an opportunity for Parliament to both influence the shaping of impending legislation on renewable energy and at the same time ensure that the Heads of State or Government and the Commission are aware that the ambitious targets that have been adopted require significant and genuine effort if they are not to simply end up as empty promises.
First and foremost, I would like to emphasise that a central message in my report is that we have created the right framework for the development of renewable energy. It means that we are integrating all our policies within the energy sector.
Renewable energy cannot be seen as separate from the other targets within the energy sector, specifically the implementation of an internal market for electricity, achievement of an energy efficiency potential of 20% and revision of the CO2 emissions trading scheme.
All these targets are interconnected and the primary concern therefore is to ensure that we achieve the proper legislative framework.
We shall compel the Member States to implement already adopted legislation and decisions, and guarantee a long-term perspective that encourages investors to become involved in this huge venture.
These are the preconditions that need to be met so that we can achieve our political objectives of greater security of supply, reduction of CO2 emissions and creation of new jobs in Europe.
Yet, at the same time, we must develop an energy policy that is based on solidarity with the developing countries where more than a million people have no access to energy.
The energy sector must no longer simply be regarded as a technical element in our everyday lives, but more as a joint player in resolving the problems involving the environment, climate and security of supply.
I have highlighted that one obvious example of the need to create integrated policies is the EU's Structural and Cohesion Funds.
These funds provide the opportunity for investments in renewable energy, energy savings and other climate-promoting measures.
However, the expenditure plans for the Member States indicate that the new Member States would prefer to use the money to build motorways rather than invest in renewable energy.
Just one percent of the funds has been allocated to renewable energy and energy savings.
Therefore, I would urge the Commission to revise the guidelines to provide systematic support for green energy projects in the EU, so that there is a link between what we adopt, on the one hand, and the way in which we allocate funds, on the other.
In the report, I have also underlined the importance of incorporating energy efficiency within the National Action Plans.
Several people have pointed out to me that their separate action plans for energy efficiency do not belong in this report.
However, I feel that it is precisely the establishment of this link that is fundamental, because otherwise it will be a purely Sisyphean task if we continually increase our energy consumption whilst simultaneously attempting to achieve a relative target of 20% renewable energy.
These two things must and shall be amalgamated.
We must constantly maintain the perspective that investments in renewable energy are an asset to Europe.
The promotion of a market for renewable energy will contribute to the fulfilment of the Lisbon targets by increasing employment within the Member States and by increasing the initiatives of the Member States and the EU with regard to research and innovation.
The final subject that I would like to emphasise today is of course the issue of biofuels and renewable energy in the transport sector.
I would like to encourage us to really move forwards within Parliament and adopt a comprehensive approach towards the transport sector, which also secures political objectives concerning the expansion of public transport and the switch from road to rail and waterborne transport.
Although in general I support the idea that the transport sector must also carry its share of renewable energy, I believe that there are a couple of pitfalls that we need to be aware of.
Firstly, the introduction of biofuels should not result in us slackening the requirements for energy-efficient cars.
We must not allow a message to be sent to the car industry to focus on bio-fuels instead of more efficient cars
Secondly, we must establish requirements concerning sustainability criteria that ensure a marked reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, and concerning the view that an increase in demand for biomass can be compatible with the preservation of biodiversity.
Furthermore, a focus on biofuels must not lead to a marked increase in food prices.
Last but not least, we must emphasise that biofuels are not the only way in which renewable energy can be used in the transport sector.
Electric cars are expected to play a greater role in future.
I hope that we will have a good debate today and that collectively Parliament can send a signal to the Commission and the Member States concerning the importance of achieving the EU's targets for renewable energy.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, firstly I would like to congratulate Ms Thomsen on her excellent report.
Renewable energy has always been high on the agenda of the European Parliament, and now Member States are also increasingly aware of the need to strengthen their performance in this field.
Constantly increasing the use of renewable energy resources is one of the main pillars in European policy to achieve sustainable, competitive and secure energy supplies.
Therefore, Ms Thomsen's report will play a crucial role in the formulation of the Commission's proposal for promotion of the use of renewable energy that I intend to present to the College by the end of this year.
I would just remind you that Mr Vidal-Quadras's report played a huge role in the formulation of our package on the internal energy market.
I am pleased to say that my approach in preparing the proposal is already very much in line with most of the calls from Parliament.
I would like to mention that the proposal will be adopted together with the greenhouse gas reduction and emission trading scheme proposals.
We will continue the integrated approach from the January package to ensure consistency between renewable energy and climate change policies, and create synergies between them.
Now I would like to turn to some concrete points of this report to discuss them in more detail.
I share your view that the completion of the internal energy market is a very important issue in our energy policy, and it is indispensable that renewables are rapidly integrated into the internal energy market.
That is one of the reasons why the Commission adopted the third internal market package on Wednesday.
Access to the grids is an essential precondition for the successful integration and expansion of electricity generation from renewable energy sources, as well as objective, transparent and non-discriminatory authorisation procedures.
You rightly pointed out the importance of reaching an agreement soon on assigning a share to each Member State to achieve the 20% binding target for the whole EU in 2020.
As you would expect, the methodology to be applied is quite a politically sensitive issue.
We are currently working on the proposal and the Commission is discussing this topic with Member States.
It is vital that the national targets are established in a fair and transparent way.
But just as important is the establishment of a trading scheme which can give the needed flexibility, and to ensure that this will work in an EU-wide market.
This will also contribute to our goal of producing renewable energy cost effectively.
I agree with you on the importance of creating and implementing national action plans.
National action plans submitted by each Member State and approved by the Commission should contain the national sectoral targets, the development paths in each sector and measures to be taken in order to reach these targets.
The Commission will assess the national action plans based on specific requirements and criteria laid down in a new directive.
I agree that renewable energy sources in the heating and cooling sector have to experience a significant growth, and this has to be ensured by the legislative framework.
The intention is to cover this sector in the directive as well.
Many heating and cooling renewable technologies are highly economical and there is a lot of potential in this area.
I welcome the support of your report on the minimum 10% biofuels binding target.
I agree with you that we have to ensure that biofuels are produced in a sustainable way.
The Commission will include measures on biofuel sustainability in its proposal.
These measures are not aimed at limiting biofuel imports, but the standards would apply equally to domestically produced biofuels and imports as well.
To sum up, the new legislative framework on renewable energy sources should ensure that we reach the EU-wide target of 20% by 2020.
This will require serious investments to be made, a regulatory framework and, most of all, strong political will.
I believe that this report gives us confidence in it.
I would like to come to the last point.
There have been doubts expressed that the Commission intends to let nuclear energy count towards the renewables target.
Can I say clearly that this is not, and never has been, the case.
The 20% target of the renewable energy in the final EU energy consumption will only be met by renewable energy.
